1,The SPEAKER,Unknown,Hon. David Hawker) took the chair at 2.00 pm and read prayers. NA Hon. John Murray Wheeldon,19
2,Mr HOWARD,CONDOLENCES,"I move: That the House expresses its deep regret death on 24 May 2006, of the Honourable John Murray Wheeldon, former Federal Minister and Senator for Western Australia and places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. John Wheeldon was born on 9 August 1929 in Subiaco, Western Australia. He attended the esteemed Perth Modern School and later the University of Western Australia. After graduating in arts and law, he went on to practise as a solicitor and around this time John Wheeldon's political life began in his role as President of the Western Australian Young Liberals. John Wheeldon was elected senator for Western Australia in 1965, representing the Australian Labor Party, and he remained in the Senate as a Labor Party senator until 1981. John Wheeldon had a deep and abiding interest in, and extensive knowledge of, international affairs. He was a very fierce opponent of the Vietnam War from very early on. He visited North Vietnam in the mid-1960s when the war was at its height and in 1967 he visited the United States, campaigning against the war in Vietnam. In parliament he served as a member and chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee and the joint committees on foreign affairs and defence matters. John Wheeldon was a minister in the Whitlam government as Minister for Repatriation and Compensation from 1974 to 1975 and later, in 1975, he also took over the ministry of Social Security. Later, as a member of the opposition shadow ministry, in 1976 he was spokesman on repatriation, compensation, media and films. John Wheeldon believed his greatest achievement in parliament was his involvement in a report on human rights in the Soviet Union which gave exposure to a range of significant humanitarian issues. In his last year in parliament he was made Parliamenat the tary Adviser to the United Nations General Assembly in New York. After he left the Senate, John Wheeldon was approached by Rupert Murdoch and offered a position on the Australian newspaper. As a senior writer with the Australian, he specialised in foreign affairs and politics and he will be remembered there for his vast knowledge of world politics, his dry and incisive wit and his remarkable writing capacity. After he left parliament, I got to know John Wheeldon rather better than I had known him when we both served in parliament between 1974 and 1981. He was a very interesting person in a political sense. He commenced membership of a political party as a member of the Liberal Party in Western Australia, he then left the Liberal Party-no doubt in part because of the Vietnam Warand became an active member of the Australian Labor Party. My recollection of him as a member of the Australian Labor Party is that he progressively adhered to some of the more left wing causes in the Australian Labor Party and he found himself in company with the late Dr Jim Cairns and a number of others-the late ‘Diamond Jim' MCClelland and many others-in the Labor Party who held strong views which might broadly be typified, certainly on international relations, as being on the left of the Australian Labor Party. After he left parliament, I think it is fair to say-and I do not think I do any injustice or reflect inaccurately on his memory-that his views then began to return not all the way but some of the way back to the views that he had held as a younger person. One of the interesting things about John Wheeldon was it was impossible to typecast him. He was a very fierce opponent of the war in Vietnam, he was a prodigious critic of the Soviet Union and the totalitarianism involved, and he was a very fierce opponent of the acquiescence of the Whitlam government, the Fraser government and the Hawke government in the incorporation of East Timor into the Republic of Indonesia. I remember that on one occasion, when I interviewed him for a radio program in the early 1980s, he gave me a memorable blast, collectively speaking, in relation to the incorporation of East Timor into Indonesia. So he was not somebody whom you could put in a pigeonhole and say, ‘This is how John Wheeldon would react.' He was a person who absolutely scorned pomposity and he was-and this is something that endeared him to me very greatlya fierce and unrelenting critic of political correctness. Some of the more memorable diatribes that I have heard against political correctness were delivered in conversations that I had with John Wheeldon. His journalistic career brought him into contact with many people who had not previously known him, and he displayed a remarkable intellect. He was somebody whom I grew to like very much when we saw each other in different circumstances after he left parliament. I recall those occasions with great warmth. He was a likeable character. Although I have no first-hand knowledge and nobody in this parliament has first-hand knowledge of 1975, he is reputed to have argued in the federal parliamentary Labor caucus that, when the Senate failed to pass the budget, the then Prime Minister should have immediately advised the holding of an election. That is what the record suggests. As I say, I was not present at that meeting and there is nobody opposite who was present at that meeting, so we will have to accept that as an accurate version of events. If indeed that is true, then he, along with the late Ken Wriedt, displayed remarkable prescience in relation to the events that unfolded in 1975. He was in every sense of the word an independent intellect. You could not predict him. Although I naturally did not share all of his positions on the issues on which he spoke, he took what can fairly be described as a very intellectually honest position. His great passion was foreign affairs. I remember him as a warm, witty and engaging personality. To his wife, Judith, and his sons, Andrew and James, and his daughter, Miriam, on behalf of the government I extend my deep sympathy and condolences.",19
3,Mr BEAZLEY,CONDOLENCES,"I rise to support the condolence motion of the Prime Minister. I knew John Wheeldon extremely well in his time in politics, but knew him less well later. It is one of the profound regrets in my life that it is in the nature of the job we have that we tend to fall out of touch with our friends. I have not been able to see much of him over the last five or six years, and I am the poorer for that. I cannot begin to describe in this parliament what John Wheeldon was like and who he was, because there is no member of this parliament, in the House or in the Senate, who remotely resembles John Wheeldon. He was a politician of a completely different era, with a completely different standard of intellectual honesty and an absolute determination to be his own man and to speak his own mind. If you had put him in a focus group, you would have seen them completely destroyed within five minutes flat and banging on the doors to get out of the place. If you had told him that he had to confine his remarks to a seven-second grab, he would have boxed your ears. But he was capable of a seven-second grab. I remember him being interviewed by Syd Donovan after our defeat in the 1977 election. Syd, who was then being quite portentous about it all, said, ‘Senator, could you tell us why it is that the Labor Party lost this election?' to which John Wheeldon replied in a similar tone of voice, ‘I suppose, Syd, that the primary reason was due to an absence of votes.' He was a great balloon pricker in his time. He was never completely comfortable in parliament, and managed to talk himself out of it thoroughly by the end of it. He said of parliament: When I first came into the Parliament, like most of us I suppose, being human, I used to achieve a certain small measure of ecstasy at seeing my photograph in a newspaper, even if the story which appeared alongside it consisted of a garbled account of something I had said or an allegation that I had been at a secret meeting plotting the overthrow of the leadership of the Labor Party when I had been in a different city from that in which the meeting took place. In fact, one often achieved a certain thrill at seeing one's face television screen while one was being asked silly questions by a disc jockey with ideas above his station. But as the years pass the charm of that tends to wear off. I remember that at the height one great controversy, when I think I was being accused of being an agent of the Chinese Communist Party-which some suggest I still am-a near neighbour, a prominent businessman, asked me whether I could take up some matter with Sir Charles Court because he knew that I was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly and would undoubtedly have great influence on him. That quote epitomises the way in which John Wheeldon used to speak. As I said, there was a time in my life when if I saw John each month I would see him each week. I saw a great deal of him. When I started in politics one of my jobs on the state executive of the Labor Party was to make sure there were at least half-a-dozen speakers after John Wheeldon had spoken on every subject, because it would take you that long to wear down the destruction of your arguments by him and have some chance of winning a majority on the state executive. One of the last things that he did in political life, I suppose, for which I am very grateful, was to vote for me in a preselection. John went through many metamorphoses as a politician. The Prime Minister has referred to his conversion from the Liberal Party to the Labor Party, and that was on the Communist Party Dissolution Bill. He believed that the attempt to ban the Communist Party was a direct attack on democratic liberties, which he strongly upheld. He then became a thorough-going and convinced intellectual socialist. He worked in a Fabian Society bookshop in London for a couple of years, and replacing him to work in that Fabian bookshop was Jomo Kenyatta. John had an extraordinary array of friends internationally. He spoke and read French and German fluently, and if you went into his office there would be French and German on a magazines all over his desk. There would be English-language papers, but none of them Australian. He had an extraordinarily encyof clopaedic comprehension of where the world stood, even if he had a particularly idiosyncratic analysis of it, and many conversions on the road to Damascus. Fierce anticolonialism, picked up in the 1950s, led him to be a strong opponent of the Vietnam War. Then his analysis of human oppression and colonialism led him to be a forthright opponent of the Soviet Union in his later years in politics. As he went through these various metamorphoses, he did so to the great dissatisfaction of most members of the Labor Party, one way or another, in Western Australia and not a few in the federal parliamentary Labor Party. His career looks quite conventional when you see it on paper, as the Prime Minister read out. He had 16 years in the Senate and a couple of years as a minister. He was a very good minister in his time. I have a note from Graham Edwards, which I should read out. It says: … though a staunch opponent of the Vietnam War, he had an immense compassion for individual veterans. He helped me and other veterans. Of course, as Minister for Repatriation and Compensation, he was in a position to do that. He served on many parliamentary committees. He was probably most proud of two of them-though he would have wanted to forget the time when he put in a minority report arguing for the legalisation of the use of marijuana. His last report in parliament was on human rights. It was one of the seminal reports produced by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee and I do not think we have bettered it. Unlike these days, he wrote most of the report himself. I will put his conversion in politics in his own words, as I think the words bear a bit of thought: I have had to make what John Foster Dulles would have called an agonising reappraisal. In my early days, I believed that there were a lot of things wrong with Western society as a result of capitalism. I still think that, but I also those things are just as bad, or worse, in Eastern Bloc countries. I was never enamoured of the Soviet Union and I was one of the most vocal critics in the Senate of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. And my stand against the Vietnam War was not taken out of sympathy for the Soviet Union. But it has become clear to me over the past several years that the Soviet Union is an imperialist power and that the danger it poses is greater than any other dangers. I do not think that the two superpowers are equally culpable for the threat to world peace. For a start, the US is subject to the internal pressure of its society. Speaking about US bases, he said: I have changed on that. I believe that the Soviet Union has designs on the rest of us and that the US is the principal obstacle to Soviet expansion. If other countries do not cooperate with the US, the chances of the Soviet Union being successful are increased. One thing I can say about all the speeches is that absolutely none of them were read. Perhaps his second reading speeches on legislation were read, because it is necessary to do so, but they would have been the only speeches he read in this place. I also strongly suspect that he spoke without notes. I did see a set of notes prepared by John Wheeldon once. There were five words bound in a line-and they were his notes for a half-hour speech. He was an extraordinary performer in that regard. As Jim MCClelland, one of his friends, said of him: Wheeldon was one of the verbal pyrotechnists of the Whitlam era. In full flight in the Senate, speaking entirely without notes in flawless syntax on a subject such as the Vietnam War, his was a hard act to beat. He was an extraordinary speaker. The Prime Minister had something to say about his attitude on the blocking of supply. I was not a member of the caucus then, so I do not know exactly what John's position was. But he did say this of the Governor General of the day, believe that whom he had got to know well: In my experience, I found him to be less than forthright. That is about as mild as John ever got. I remember him describing one of my colleagues as ‘having the appearance of a soccer ball with scuffs'. He was not a fellow who, when he concluded speaking, operated on the basis that those about whom he was speaking ought to nevertheless leave the room feeling good about themselves. They invariably left the room feeling extremely bad about themselves and often feeling extremely bad about John. He was a one-off. He was an unusual character. Parliament was richer for having him and poorer when he left it. He did not leave politics. He became an active leader writer for the Australian newspaper. He wrote a great deal and put his encyclopaedic comprehension of foreign policy and politics to very good use. He had enormous affection for his family and for his wife, Judith, who will be grieving terribly today. He said this on his retirement: I suppose it is pretty young to be voluntarily ing from parliament, but one isn't immortal. I am certainly not tired of politics, and it remains my main interest, but for some time. I have not been enjoying it. In fact, I am not sure that I have ever enjoyed it really, spending 14 hours a week travelling between Perth and Canberra. I do not like being away from my family for long periods. I do not believe there is any great cause being argued in the federal parliament in which I am sufficiently interested to warrant spending the sort of life I am living. He fought very hard to get that family. When he sought to bring Judith into this country, the entry was vetoed by ASIO and he was obliged to sit down with John Gorton and persuade him to allow his wife in. His wife's parents had a background in the Communist Party in the United States. His wife subsequently became the principal of Abbotsleigh. I am not sure whether she is now.",20
4,Mr HOWARD,CONDOLENCES,She is retired.,23
5,Mr BEAZLEY,CONDOLENCES,"She was a brilliant teacher. When I knew her in Western Australia she was the vice principal of John Curtin High School. When she went to Sydney she shifted to the private sector. I think she was principal of a prominent Jewish school in Sydney for some time before she took up the appointment at Abbotsleigh. She is a marvellous woman. She and John were a wonderful, witty and enormously capable couple together. I extend on behalf of the Australian Labor Party our deepest condolences to Judith; their son, James; and the son and daughter from John's first marriage, Andrew and Miriam. I will conclude with something which was said in one of his obituaries, which I think puts it far better than I could conceivably do here: Wheeldon was a man of almost limitless erudition … original … witty … fluent, sagacious … Although originally a man of the Left, and never one for modern economic reform, he wouldn't sentimentalise the Left or any of its causes … Wheeldon's brilliance and wit and moral courage retirwill be missed by all who knew him.",23
6,Mr ABBOTT,CONDOLENCES,"I came to know John Wheeldon in the late 1980s, by which time he was a writer and commentator, but he was all the better at that thanks to his experience of parliamentary and ministerial life. He would sometimes lament that, as a member of parliament and minister, he had read millions of newspaper articles but not a single book. It was not true of John Wheeldon, of course, but it was certainly an illustration of his awareness of the danger of drawing down too much on your intellectual capital. He also used to say that, in government, people who had studied issues for years never made decisions and the people who did make decisions tended to have studied them for about five minutes-again, a caricature, nevertheless a revealing one, and a warning against the danger of decision making on the run. As both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition have pointed out, John Wheeldon was something of a political pilgrim. He was a former president of the Western Australian Young Liberals. He was not the only lefty to be a Young Liberal president, but I am told it is not as common these days! By the late 1980s, he certainly was a partisan for good people and for defensible principles and not for any particular party. In my experience his passion was to see people treated humanely-that was his great passion and he was quite pragmatic about how that might best be done. He happened to believe, for instance, that Australia's role in the independence of East Timor righted a great historical wrong and he thought it was one of the proudest moments in our history. In 1998, along with Peter Coleman, another distinguished former member of this House, he was prepared to lend his name to a campaign to expose the undemocratic nature of the then One Nation Party. I was particularly touched by the faith he was prepared to place in me in this regard, and I hope it was not misplaced. In my experience, John Wheeldon was loyal without being blind to people's faults; he was committed without believing that any particular side had a monopoly on wisdom and virtue; he was ferociously opposed to political correctness in all its forms because he believed it defied common sense. He was a man of high intelligence, of broad culture and of rare moral courage. There are too few such men in our public life, but certainly he served his country to the best parliament and in public advocacy. We rightly honour his life and mourn his passing. In conclusion, I should point out that he was very sick for several years before his death. He was devotedly nursed throughout that long illness by his wife, Judith, who, as the Leader of the Opposition said, is an absolutely brilliant woman in her own right-a former headmistress of Queenwood School in my electorate and of Abbotsleigh College in Wahroonga. We certainly should honour her as we honour him. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",23
7,Ms MACKLIN,CONDOLENCES,"It is true, as the previous speakers have said, that John Wheeldon was a politician who defied categorisation-a thinker, a wit, a brilliant speaker and a fierce proponent of human rights whom Bob Carr described as ‘federal parliament's one true internationalist'. As the Prime Minister and others have said, he was at one time a small ‘l' liberal. He was a member of the Young Liberals until 1950, when he quit over the Menzies government's attempt to ban the Communist Party because he felt it offended principles of justice. One example of his cutting sense of humour was when, in his response to the Menzies' Communist Party Dissolution Bill, he said: ‘It seemed rather fatuous to call itself the Liberal Party and then introduce a bill like that.' We know that he mixed with people from very diverse backgrounds-whether it was Rupert Murdoch, Bob Santamaria, Jim Cairns or Barry Cohen, and the list goes on. Even though it is a very diverse list, respect for his intellect was extensive. It is certainly the case that he knew what he was talking about on international affairs, politics, literature and history, and, of course, he had the capacity to turn that knowledge into words of his ability in that shone. He was a very lucid, aggressive and, as I understand it, memorable speaker in the parliament. I gather he was impatient with imprecise questioning and intellects less capable than his own-which I suggest might include all of us! As the Leader of the Opposition said, he was a fluent speaker of French and German, studied philosophy at Oxford, practised law and brought all of that into the parliament. As the Minister for Repatriation and Compensation, he was responsible for trying to establish a national rehabilitation and compensation scheme. Here is another example of his wit. Apparently, when in opposition, John Wheeldon was known to have joked with his then left-wing colleagues: ‘Whitlam will make us all the minister for repatriation.' It has been suggested that Gough was being ironic in giving this portfolio to a man who once said: ‘I was too young for World War II, too old for Vietnam and too scared for Korea.' As others have said, he was a passionate opponent of totalitarianism, whether it was of the Left or the Right. He fought apartheid in South Africa, campaigned against the persecution of Lebanese Christians and fiercely criticised the White Australia policy. As others have mentioned, the very important report of the parliamentary committee on foreign affairs, which he chaired, made a very significant contribution to exposing human rights abuses in the Soviet Union. We should be very proud of that work. In short, John Wheeldon cared about the world and Australia's place in it. He told the Bulletin: A commitment to democracy and human rights should imbue our view of the world, both because it is morally right and is in our interests. I must say, working with John must have been, at times, a bewildering experience. His staff told the Age back in 1975: He can wake in the morning and act like an English social realist philosopher, move into the realms of absurdist humour and finish the day deep in existential thought. It must have been a task and a half to be one of his staff, but I am sure they learnt an enormous amount as well. To his wife, Judith; his children, Andrew, Miriam and James: our condolences on your loss.",24
8,Mr RUDDOCK,CONDOLENCES,"I briefly wish to be associated with the remarks of the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, the minister for health and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. This has been a remarkable condolence motion in the context of the sincerity of views on both sides of the chamber. I had the privilege of serving with John in the parliament from 1973 to 1981. I share the same respect that my colleagues have expressed today. My daughter Caitlin was at Abbotsleigh when Judith was the principal. I was at a function organised by the school upon her retirement to look after John. John was present on that occasion. I have enormous admiration for him and a great deal of admiration for his wife. I think she served in the great tradition of Betty Archdale in influencing many young women who will play leadership roles in the future. I am privileged to be able to be associated with the motion.",25
9,Mr KERR,CONDOLENCES,"Might I add a couple of remarks. I only met John Wheeldon on a couple of occasions, but one will live in my mind forever. It occurred at a time when I was standing for the Labor Party in 1977, a failed venture into politics as a very young man. I attended a meeting at which Wheeldon was a speaker. He was a small man, who sat curled up with a cigarette smoking between his fingers, in the days when that was possible in public halls. He looked quite insignificant until he rose. He spoke without notes, and he spoke in such a manner that it captivated everybody in that room. And although we only saw him for a short phase in public life as a minister, he also had carriage of one of those great issues of public policy that the Whitlam government put forward and sadly was not implemented-a national compensation scheme, which Whitlam, in his later book recounting his political triumphs and failures, says was his greatest sadness that he was not able to see come into effect. It remains unfinished business for us, when we contemplate the fact that we still have circumstances where persons injured in various different walks of life find themselves without adequate recourse or compensation. A life like John Wheeldon's is one that touches many people in many different ways, which has been evidenced by the tributes that have been paid from both sides of this House. As someone who had a tangential relationship with John, difficult though he is said to have been, I remember the speech that he gave on that occasion as probably the most vivid explanation of the agenda of the Whitlam government that I was ever privileged to have heard. Those who were fortunate enough-and, sadly, now as I reflect, old enough-to have been part of that generation and to have seen any aspect of it will never forget his like. Question agreed to, honourable members standing in their places. NA Divisions: Recording of Votes",25
10,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"The Manager of Opposition Business requested that I check the circumstances in which a number of members may have entered the chamber after I ordered the doors to be locked but before the doors were actually closed last Thursday. Inquiries have been made about the circumstances in which some members entered the chamber in the division in question. While the staff act in accordance with my directions, they do not attempt to physically obstruct members in the process of closing the doors. If a member is in the course of entering the chamber when the direction to lock the doors is given, the staff will not any action that will risk injury to a member. The options available to staff are limited even more when there are a number of members lining up at the restricted entry points the chamber. If members enter before the doors are closed, they are entitled to proceed to a point in the chamber where their vote will be counted, provided they reach that point before tellers are appointed. Members are not entitled to reopen closed doors. Based on the advice I have received, I do not propose to approach any members about withdrawing their votes. In recognition of the need to protect the integrity of the voting process, I ask all members to maintain their awareness of proceedings and, in particular, of division requirements. I have also asked the Serjeantat-Arms to monitor the entry of members for divisions and to report back to me if there are any persistent problems that need to be addressed. Parliamentary Behaviour",26
11,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"The Manager of Opposition Business also asked whether a motion of closure of a member was valid in light of the terms in which it was moved. Given the withdrawals by the Leader of the House, the motion was a valid motion. I also note that the House endorsed the ruling by the Deputy Speaker to this effect, by negativing the motion of dissent from that ruling. NA Wheat Exports",26
12,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. Can the Deputy Prime Minister confirm that, in March this year, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Peter MCGauran, endorsed work by industry group Single Vision, which was investigating alternatives to the single desk for export take wheat? Did this work include modelling by the Centre for International Economics, a known opponent of the single desk? Can the Deputy Prime Minister confirm that he only to became aware of this work weeks after it commenced and just days before it was revealed in the media? Isn't it the case that, while the Deputy Prime Minister was out in regional Australia defending the single desk, his National Party colleague was undermining him and the single desk? Deputy Prime Minister, don't your colleagues tell you anything?",26
13,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question, at the end of it, is no. I am aware of the work that the Leader of the Opposition has been referring to. I am not aware that it was instigated or endorsed by the minister for agriculture. I understand that it had been instigated by the GRDCthe Grains Research and Development Corporation-which is an independent body. The Leader of the Opposition would be well aware of the background to that. At the moment a number of elements of research are being done into the grains industry and the future of the grains industry that we are well aware of. As far as undermining my position, the government's position and the single desk today is concerned, the answer to that question is no. It is not undermining the position that I have taken when speaking at public meetings and the government's position today with regard to support of the single desk and looking after the interests of Australia's wheat growers. Wheat Exports",26
14,Mrs HULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. Would the Deputy Prime Minister advise the House of the status of negotiations to secure the supply of wheat to Iraq?,27
15,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Riverina for her question. The member for Riverina will be pleased to be able to inform the wheat growers in Junee, Illabo, Temora and Cootamundra in her electorate that today Wheat Australia have announced that they have concluded a commercially acceptable deal to sell 350,000 tonnes of wheat to the IGB in Iraq. This is good news for Australian wheat growers and good news for the trade relationship between Australia and Iraq. I think all members of the House would be aware of the history of this deal. It has had a bit of rough time at times over the last few weeks in its development and negotiation. Even early last week it looked as though it was not going to go ahead. I acknowledge the tenacity of Wheat Australia in sticking with the negotiations and achieving this very important outcome for Australia's wheat growers. Earlier this year, the Iraqi government indicated that they were going to set aside their commercial relationship with the AWB during the Cole inquiry-and that was a reasonable course of action for them to take. Following that, I took a trip to Iraq, and in Baghdad I met with the Deputy Prime Minister, Dr Ahmad Chalabi, to seek access to that market and for Australian entities to negotiate in the tendering process for wheat. He indicated to me that he would agree that Australian entities could participate in the tender that was opened at the time and that we could tender for 350,000 tonnes of wheat. Wheat Australia has been participating since then in these negotiations to this very successful conclusion with the agreement today. Wheat Australia has announced today that it will be moving ahead with that. It was interesting, as an aside, that last week, while I was overseas representing Australia in WTO negotiations and discussions, the member for Griffith was criticising me here in Australia for being over there negotiating multilateral agreements that the Australian Labor Party wholeheartedly support. He said: ‘Oh, he shouldn't be over there. He should be flying to Baghdad to fix this up.' What the member for Griffith does not realise is that the telephones still work in Baghdad. Three days beforehand, I was talking to Dr Chalabi about these issues. So we were sorting them out. When the member for Griffith was criticising me here in Australia, we were sorting the problems out with this deal. Today in their announcement of the 350,000 tonnes sale of wheat, Wheat Australia congratulated the federal government and thanked it for its support. They said: With commercial terms now agreed, it is also appropriate that Wheat Australia acknowledge the federal government for their efforts in securing this opportunity for Australian growers to for the supply of wheat into Iraq. The market is open. They will have the opportunity to compete in further tenders. And we fully expect that they will. NA",27
16,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon Mr Bruce Cowan, a former member for Lyne. On behalf of the House, I extend to him a very warm welcome. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Trade: Import Risk Analysis",28
17,Mr RIPOLL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. Can the Deputy Prime Minister confirm that the government is currently reviewing import risk analysis arrangements for mushroom imports? Will the fact that his National Party colleagues and, in particular, the member for Maranoa, keep him in the dark and feed him fertiliser influence the outcome of this review?",28
18,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will call the Deputy Prime Minister to answer the first part of that question. I believe the second part contained ironical expressions, so it is not necessary for him to answer it.",28
19,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member's question was about Australia's import risk analysis process. My understanding is that there are about 118 import risk analysis processes under way today. Our government and our party are committed to ensuring that the environment of Australia stays free of exotic pests and diseases to keep safe our agriculture and the food products we export to the world. Snowy Hydro Corporatisation,28
20,Mrs GASH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, what is the government doing to protect tender the Australian character of the Snowy?",28
21,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Gilmore who, along with the honourable member for Eden-Monaro and the Special Minister of State and a number of other members on this side of the House, including the member for Riverina and one or two on the other side of the House-or on the cross benches at least-have expressed some concerns about this issue. If we are interested in analysing what it is all about, we should recall that the decision of the New South Wales government to sell its 58 per cent ownership of the Snowy really decided what was going to happen. The Commonwealth holds 13 per cent, the New South Wales government 58 per cent and the remainder is held by the Victorian government. I note also that, when the resolution to approve the sale of the federal government's 13 per cent was presented to the parliament, the Labor Party in opposition supported that resolution. I note also that as recently as last Friday the Leader of the Opposition reaffirmed the support of the federal parliamentary Labor Party for the sale of the Snowy. As I indicated to parliament last week, we support the sale of the Commonwealth's 13 per cent share in the Snowy Hydro for three reasons. Firstly, with New South Wales as the majority shareholder, with 58 per cent of the company, having announced that they were going to sell, there was little point in the Commonwealth holding on to our minority 13 per cent, unless we were going to use budget funds to buy out the New South Wales government share, and we took the decision that that would not have been a good use of those budget funds. Secondly, the water needs of downstream users and the environment are fully protected by the current water licensing regime. There is a common belief, which is mistaken, that the water is owned by the company-it is not. It is owned by the public via the New South Wales government and is made available by a 75-year licence. Thirdly, we believe that the private sector is better at running private businesses than the government. I am aware that the member for Gilmore, the member for Eden-Monaro in particular, and a number of other members of this House are concerned about the potential for foreign ownership of the Snowy Hydro. As a result, as I foreshadowed last week, the government has considered and decided to introduce into legislation measures to implement foreign ownership caps and other Australian protections in relation to Snowy Hydro Ltd. This is fully consistent with the approach we have taken in relation to entities such as Telstra and Qantas. The government will introduce legislation in June that imposes the following permanent restrictions on Snowy Hydro Ltd. Firstly, no foreign individual or company will be permitted to own greater than 15 per cent of Snowy Hydro. Secondly, foreign ownership in total will not be permitted to exceed 35 per cent of the company. Thirdly, the head office of the company must remain in Australia and be located in Cooma. Fourthly, Snowy Hydro Ltd must maintain a substantial business and operational presence in Australia. Fifthly, at least two-thirds of the directors of the board of Snowy Hydro and the chairman of any meeting of the board and shareholders must also be Australian citizens. Finally, Snowy Hydro Ltd must remain incorporated in Australia. The New South Wales and Victorian governments have indicated that they will support this Commonwealth legislation. We will seek to have the legislation debated and passed by the end of June 2006. This would allow the sale to proceed about the middle of this year. In addition, the selling governments have already proposed to the ASX that a 10 per cent limit on any individual, domestic or foreign shareholding be placed in Snowy Hydro's constitution for at least four years to ensure an appropriate spread of ownership. The three selling governments will continue to seek approval for this proposal from the ASX. I know there will be those who will continue to oppose any sale of Snowy Hydro, but with the protection for water users and the protections on foreign ownership I believe that we can proceed with the sale confident that the Australian community can only benefit from the sale. Again, I record my thanks to the member for Eden-Monaro, the member for Gilmore and the member for Riverina in particular for the very effective and thoughtful campaign they have brought to bear on this difficult but important issue. The outcome reflects great credit on their advocacy. Workplace Relations",28
22,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Spotlight 2c an hour AWA which would see Mrs Annette Harris lose $90 a week in take-home pay. Is the Prime Minister aware of the statement on ABC radio on Saturday by Mrs Harris: “I thought John Howard was just Prince Charming ... “But ... after what's happened and his arrogant attitude in Parliament-it's just left me cold ... “I'd like him to come and walk in my shoes for a day and see what I actually do as a mother and as a worker and then coming home every night. “I don't have people serving me for $14.28 an hour, I've got to do all that myself.” When will the Prime Minister go to Coffs Harbour and personally explain to Mrs Harris how her losing $90 a week is fair?",29
23,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to the first part of the question is no, I was not. Obviously, like any other person in public life, if somebody thinks poorly of decisions with which I am associated, that is a matter for personal regret. My attention having been drawn to what the lady has had to say, I can only make the observation, as I did last week, that the interesting piece of information, which may be of passing interest to the Leader of the Opposition and to other members of this parliament, is that Spotlight has, as many people in the House know, recently opened a new outlet in Mount Druitt. Mount Druitt, unlike many other parts of Sydney, still suffers from an unacceptably high level of unemployment.",29

26,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can hear the Deputy Leader of the Opposition-‘90 dollars' she is saying. Spotlight has, I am told, opened a new store at Mount Druitt in Western Sydney. The unemployment rate in Mount Druitt is over 10 per cent. I am further informed that 38 of the 40 new staff employed on AWAs in Spotlight at Mount Druitt in Western Sydney were previously unemployed. In other words, there are 38 people who are better off. The piercing voice of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition keeps saying ‘90 dollars'Ms Macklin interjecting Ms King interjecting",30
27,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Ballarat is warned!,30
28,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is not actually $90; it is $338.10, because that is the difference tween the amount a job seeker on the unemployment benefit of $205.30 a week receives and the amount that they will receive under a Spotlight AWA of $543.40 a week. Like my friend Tony Blair, I believe fairness in the workplace starts with the chance of a job. As a result of our policy, 38 people in Mount Druitt have been given the chance of a job and they are $338 a week better off. East Timor",30
29,Mr TOLLNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister advise the House of further developments in East Timor?,30
30,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Solomon for his interest in this issue. I think all of us would agree that we welcome the advice from the Australian Defence Force that they are making significant progress in restoring peace to Dili, in particular, in East Timor. The situation there is obviously getting better. There is still a high level of tension and there are still reports today of confrontation-this time between gangs. So there is work to be done, but I think the Australian Defence Force are showing their characteristic professionalism in doing the job and doing it in the way they know best. I also note the arrival yesterday of 46 Australian Federal Police officers. Amongst the tasks I hope they will be able to undertake is to assist with the investigation into the atrocious killing of nine unarmed members of the East Timor police force last week. This was an appalling and brutal act. I think if Australia can make a good contribution to the investigation that will be something that all Australians will warmly welcome. We are also pleased that the Council of State chaired by President Xanana Gusmao has been meeting and dialogue is under way to try to resolve what are clearly political be- differences between a number of the leaders in East Timor. I am also pleased to note that Ian Martin, who will be well known to quite a few people in this House as the special envoy of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, has arrived in Dili and is having discussions with President Gusmao and others. Also, he will be meeting Brigadier Slater, the Australian commander in East Timor, this afternoon. The restoration of stability is certainly helping to ease the humanitarian situation. The staff of our embassy have visited all the major centres in Dili where internally displaced people are currently located. They have assessed that the people who are internally displaced have access to clean drinking water and food, the conditions are not cramped and medical issues are not a major problem. I want to emphasise that. I think organisations like the Red Cross are doing very well to help those people. The Australian military has contributed greatly to easing the humanitarian situation in East Timor. Because of the contribution to the restoration of stability by the Australian Defence Force, there is now delivery of food and water to displaced Timorese. Brigadier Slater is doing an outstanding job in East Timor and I think the House should be proud of the work he and his soldiers are doing there. As he said this morning, ‘The sooner we get the guns off the street, the easier it will be for the aid agencies. The humanitarian situation is not that bad. It will get bad we do not get security sorted out first.' That sentiment has been pretty much replicated by the Secretary-General's special representative, Mr Hasegawa, who was reported today as saying, ‘We have been able to step up our efforts to meet the most pressing food and water needs of the people displaced from their homes in Dili. The improved security situation and direct support of the Australian military forces where possible have greatly assisted this process.' I just want to emphasise that. The humanitarian situation is being addressed. A lot of the problems are not as great as they have been portrayed from time to time. I think the Australian Defence Force is doing a simply outstanding job. I call on all commentators to let our experienced military and hard working professionals just get on with their jobs.

37,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have repeatedly said that the strength of the Australian economy is due to the efforts of the working men and women of this country. I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that the working men and women of Australia have been more adequately rewarded for their efforts under this government than they were under the former Labor government. The last person in this parliament who can speak with pride about rewarding the ordinary working men and women of this country is the former Deputy Prime Minister in the Keating government because, as those who follow these matters will know, real wages under this government have increased by 16.8 per cent over the last 10 years compared to a paltry increase of only 1.3 per cent under Labor. In relation to Mrs Annette Harris, I am informed that she exercised her right to reject the AWA and remains employed as a part-time employee on the relevant award after refusing to accept the AWA. Economy",31
38,Mr HENRY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer update the House on the latest data on the Australian economy? What does it indicate about its strengths and how does it compare with other developed countries around the world?,32
39,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Hasluck for his question and acknowledge his interest in national economic matters. Retail trade figures released today for April 2006 showed that retail trade rose 1.4 per cent for the month is 7.4 per cent higher through the year. They were unexpectedly high figures, which show robust consumer growth in retail trade. Conversely, building approvals released for the month of April fell 3.4 per cent and are down 7.5 per cent for the year. That shows us that housing most probably will continue to detract from growth through the course of 2006-07. An OECD outlook was recently released which forecast Australia's calendar growth for 2007 at 3.7 per cent compared to the rest of the OECD at 2.9 per cent. That shows that Australia again will be picking up in 2007, outpacing most of the developed worldindeed, as we have outpaced most of the developed world over the last 10 years. Growth in Australia over the last 10 years has averaged 3.6 per cent compared to the OECD average of 2.7 per cent. We have an Australian economy which has outpaced the developed world and which is forecast in 2007 to do the same again. Importantly, the OECD says that only 10 of 28 countries in the OECD are expected to balance their budgets in 2007. Of course, one of those is Australia, which will be running the ninth surplus budget in the 11 budgets since this government was elected. As we know, the Commonwealth is forecasting a surplus budget of one per cent of GDP in 2006-07. Unfortunately, the states are not forecasting budget surpluses either in 2005-06 or in 2006-07. Cumulatively, state and local governments are running deficits of 0.5 per cent and 0.6 per cent of GDP in those successive years. If it were not for the Commonwealth government running a budget surplus which outweighs the combined position of the state and local government sectors, government would not be adding to saving in this country. As we know, with strong business inand vestment, business is running down savings. As we also know, the household sector is not saving either. This is the importance of good strong economic management. We are now in the longest period of continuous growth in Australia's history after 10 years of this government, and keeping the fiscal position in the strong position that it is is a very big part of that. We fought to get the budget back into surplus against the opposition of the Labor Party and we need to fight for good economic management in the future. Workplace Relations",32
40,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is also to the Prime Minister. I refer to Senate estimates hearings last night where the spotlight was on AWAs and the Office of the Employment Advocate. Isn't it the case that, of the sample 6,263 AWAs lodged with the Office of the Employment Advocate since the commencement of the government's industrial relations legislation, 100 per cent-all of them-excluded at least one protected award condition, 64 per cent removed leave loadings, 63 per cent removed penalty rates, 52 per cent removed shift work loadings and 16 per cent excluded all award conditions? Isn't this just what the government's legislation causes and wants-a 2c an hour race to the bottom?",33
41,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, and what the member for Perth did not acknowledge is that the same information that was provided in the Senate last night indicated that 78 per cent of the sample agreements provided for a wage increase during the life of the agreement and, in 84 per cent of the agreements sampled, the wages were greater than the comparable standard rate, which is the hourly rate of the award. Mr Stephen Smith-That's what Spotlight did to Mrs Harris.",33

43,Mr LINDSAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Defence. Would the minister update the House on the progress of Australian Defence Force operations in East Timor?,33
44,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Herbert-a very strong advocate for 3rd Brigade in Townsville-for his question. I join with the member for Herbert, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the parliament and the Australian people in congratulating its commanding officer, Brigadier Mick Slater, for the outstanding job that he and his men are doing in East Timor. It is extremely important that Brigadier Slater have full responsibility for making all of the decisions that need to be made in prioritising the activities and functions of our Defence Force in East Timor. This morning Brigadier Slater said that Dili is a different place from what it was three days ago, that there is no gunfire in the city or in the foothills and that there are many people in Dili who are going about their business. That is not to say that Dili or East Timor are safe places, but they are safer. It is worth remembering that 2½ weeks ago the Australian government prepositioned the Defence Force in anticipation that a request may come from the East Timorese government to provide military assistance to bring peace and order to the country. That request arrived late last Wednesday and by Thursday afternoon the first element of Australian Defence Force troops arrived at Dili airport to secure it. All of the 1,300 Defence Force personnel were fully deployed yesterday in East Timor. It is worth also remembering that the day that the request arrived there were raging gun battles in the streets of Dili with the heinous murder of innocent unarmed police officers. There were also armed civilians. From that period we have now gone to an environment where we still see relatively stable, if not declining, evidence of rogue criminal gang related activity in the streets of Dili. It remains a dangerous place, but it is safer than it was and it is safer because of the actions of the Australian Defence Force. In the last two days 450 weapons have been removed from thugs and gangs on the streets of Dili. Those weapons include highpowered rifles, handguns, shotguns, grenades, machetes and a whole variety of implements that have been used by these gangs. In the last 24 hours, 160 East Timorese police have voluntarily returned to their headquarters and their academy and 260 weapons have been handed in by them. The East Timorese army has now gone back to its barracks quite cooperatively, and at the moment the detention arrangements have been settled for the Australian Defence Force. Those who are suspected of having committed a serious crime or who are detected in the process of committing it are being detained. A welldeveloped framework to monitor every stage of that process has been agreed. A detention management team, including military police and Australian Defence Force lawyers, has worked with the East Timorese authorities. Again, on behalf of the House and the Australian people, I thank and I congratulate the Australian Defence Force. The task ahead remains far from complete, but human life in East Timor is much safer today than it was a week ago. Workplace Relations",33

52,Mr VASTA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer outline to the House the extent of the tax cuts announced in the budget? How will these help families and keep the country competitive?,34
53,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Bonner for his question, and I congratulate him on what a great job he is doing as the member for Bonner. This government introduced the largest income tax cuts in Australia's history in 2000. Since introducing the largest income tax cuts in Australian history in 2000, this government has cut tax in 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006. As a consequence of those tax cuts, you will now be on a 15c rate between $6,000 and $25,000, you will be on a 30c rate between $25,000 and $70,000, you will be on a 40c rate between $75,000 and $150,000, and you will be on the top rate of 45 per cent only on each dollar over $150,000. Under the Labor Party, between $20,000 and $50,000, you faced rates of 33c, 43c and 47c compared with 30c under this government. Indeed, many of us remember that the last tax cut that the Labor Party promised did not even survive-did I say ‘promise'; no, it was L-AW-the 1993 election. As a consequence of this, since 1995-96 reductions in tax and growth in real wages have increased the real disposable income of the average individual earner by 17.8 per cent. That is 17.8 per cent as a consequence of tax cuts and increases in real disposable income. The consequence of that is that average wage earners in Australia are far better off under a coalition government than they ever were under the Labor Party. Not only have real wages gone up but taxes have come down. When you put that together with the increase in family allowances, families are doing even better. I am very pleased that the member for Grayndler is showing the government his best side-an old tactic but a good one, to stand up and pretend you are not interested when you are getting a barb because your government did not do anything for real wage earners, did not do anything for income tax and stands condemned by the Australian people as a consequence. The moral of this is as follows: the coalition stands for average workers in Australia. It is under a coalition government that their wages have gone up. The coalition government stands for average wage earners when it comes to tax, and average wage earners will always be better off under a coalition government than under a Labor government. Snowy Hydro Ltd",34
54,Mr WINDSOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister and leader of the ‘Old Liberals'.,35
55,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for New England will get straight to his question.,35
56,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,35
57,Mr WINDSOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Given that the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victorian governments have announced that they now plan to introduce legislation that imposes so called permanent restrictions on Snowy Hydro Ltd relating to foreign ownership and the structure of the board, could the Prime Minister explain what capacity this parliament has to bind future parliaments on these guarantees? Is it not a fact that the so-called permanent restrictions on the future of Snowy Hydro can be amended or repealed at any time by any future parliament?",35
58,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It will be no surprise to the member for New England, as a member of both the New South Wales and federal parliaments, to be reminded of the doctrine that no one parliament can bind the actions of a future parliament. Self-evidently, anything passed by this parliament can be repealed by a future parliament. Indeed, I even recall examples in the past: so certain was one government that tax reductions it might implement in one parliament were going to be repealed by another parliament it decided not to introduce the promised tax cuts in the first place. Can I say to the member for New England: he has given a description of the so called permanent restrictions. That is a description that the member for New England has employed. We are going to legislate and I would not expect a future parliament to repeal that legislation, particularly as the only party that is ever likely to form a government in this parliament other than the coalition is the Labor Party and the Labor Party is committed on this issue to the same policy as the government. I think the likelihood of it being repealed in the future is very remote, and the member for New England knows it. Indonesian Earthquake",35
59,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister update the House on the government's response to the recent earthquake that struck Indonesia?,36
60,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Pearce for her question and her interest. The latest official estimate of the death toll from the earthquake near Yogyakarta is 5,136. Injuries are estimated at 20,000 and up to 200,000 people are now in need of shelter as a result of 60,000 homes being destroyed. This is a major disaster. The Australian government will now provide $7½ million for critical humanitarian assistance to the survivors of the earthquake, and as part of this we will send supplies and over 80 experts to Yogyakarta urgently to assist with the relief and recovery effort. An Australian medical team of 27 medical and surgical personnel, all coming from New South Wales, is going to depart for Indonesia today to join with the AusAID team which is already on the ground in Yogyakarta. That team coming from New South Wales will include surgeons and operating staff, disaster medicine specialists and logisticians. Also, they will take with them 12 tonnes of medical equipment. Food and water will also accompany the team. AusAID staff who have been on the ground since Saturday are assisting with the assessment of the needs of the people of the Yogyakarta area. They have recommended sending urgent orthopaedic instruments as a result of the massive injuries suffered by people, and those orthopaedic instruments are now on their way. There have been reports of heavy rain falling in the area, and that is of course compounding the challenges of the relief effort, so AusAID are purchasing tarpaulins for the local people to help address that problem. There have been also, importantly, a large number of aftershocks. There have been 750 reported, and that means that people have been very reluctant to return to their own buildings. So at this time of crisis Indonesians are calling on their friends and their neighbours to help them out and, because this is a genuine humanitarian catastrophe, I think we have a humanitarian obligation to assist, so assisting is what we are doing. Skills Shortage",36
61,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education. Does the minister stand by his attempt today to shift blame for the nation's skills shortage onto the mining industry with his statement that he cannot ‘accept that mining can get away with this claim that they had no idea the minerals boom was going to come on so quick' and that, instead, the mining industry has just gone and, according to the minister, ‘pilfered everyone from the sugar industry'? When will the minister take responsibility for our nation's skills crisis instead of just finding someone else to blame? If the minister is so concerned about skills shortages in the Pilbara, why hasn'the opened the Pilbara technical college promised to the region almost two years ago?",36
62,Mr HARDGRAVE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I actually thank the member for Jagajaga for this question, because this government now has in training near record levels of people in this countryclose to 400,000. When Labor were last in office they had a mere 122,000 people in training. So I think 10 years of achievement speaks for itself. In fact, I can quote the South Australian Minister for Employment, Training and Further Education, Paul Caica. He said in today's Adelaide Advertiser that ‘businesses need to play their part in creating opportunities for young people'Ms Macklin-Why are they pilfering from the sugar industry?",36
63,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has asked her question.,37
64,Mr HARDGRAVE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and the first step was of course to identify their needs. It is certainly not government's fault alone that there are not enough people where businesses themselves want them. But at the end of it this government is working hard on that, with record amounts of money-far more money than Labor ever imagined they would put towards the training system. We are also very much dedicated to the task of saying to business, ‘If you plan for the sort of workforce you want, we will give a training system in a way that will make sure that your needs are met when you need them.' We are in partnership with the eight state and territory governments, who themselves have a variety of responses that conflict with that general approach. The mining industry certainly does train people-there is no doubt about that-but it is absolutely fundamental that major industries such as mining continue to understand that these days, unlike when Labor was in office when there was a large pool of unemployed for them to draw upon, there are far fewer unemployed in this country and so the commitment to training has to be redoubled and has to start in the boardrooms and work its way out. As Paul Caica, the South Australian minister, said, governments alone cannot do this. It is important that business plays its part. Influenza",37
65,Mr KEENAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Would the minister advise the House of steps the government is taking to protect Australians from a flu pandemic?,37
66,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do appreciate the member for Stirling's interest in this issue and I can inform him and the House that the World Health Organisation continues to believe that Australia is as well prepared as any other country on earth for a possible flu pandemic. I stress that a pandemic outbreak is possible. It is not probable, although the recent deaths of up to seven family members in Indonesia show that the danger remains real. So far the government has committed almost $600 million to pandemic preparedness. This money has, amongst other things, given us an antiviral stockpile that is building up to almost nine million courses, 50 million syringes and 40 million surgical masks. We will purchase up to five million doses of bird flu vaccine, should this pass appropriate tests. We are researching a range of bird flu issues including quick testing facilities, we are providing extra equipment to public hospitals and we have upgraded our laboratory and surveillance capacity. Today the government has released a revised Australian health management plan for pandemic influenza. One of the features of the new plan is the stress on issues such as personal hygiene, social distancing and home quarantine as a means of preventing the spread of any pandemic outbreak. Today the government also announced details of Exercise Cumpston 06, which will be held over four days in October, to test our readiness to deal with infected travellers arriving at a major international airport. I have to say that any pandemic outbreak would certainly be an unprecedented test of our national character, but I am confident that the sorts of preparations that we have in place will help us to cope.

74,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, I have a question relating to the ruling that gave at the start of question time today on the motion moved by the Leader of the House last Thursday, the motion being ‘That that snivelling grub over there be not further heard'. As I understand your ruling, Mr Speaker, you believe that by the time the House voted, that motion had become ‘That the member be no longer heard' as a result of the Leader of the House withdrawing the offensive words. Mr Speaker, the only withdrawal offered by the Leader of the House prior to the vote being taken was in the following terms: If I have offended grubs, I withdraw unconditionally. Mr Speaker, I take it as implicit in your ruling that in future in this House a withdrawal in that form will be seen to be an effective withdrawal. If you saw it to be effective on this occasion when offered by the Leader of the House, then you must necessarily be ruling that it will be effective on all occasions when offered by other members of the House. Can you confirm that the practice in this chamber is now that a withdrawal in that form is effective?",38
75,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I thank the Manager of Opposition Business for her question. I would make a couple of points here. First of all, as she would be aware, in my statement. I used the word ‘withdrawals'-plural. Secondly, I suggest that, if she would like to discuss this further, we could talk about it afterwards, but I have made a clear ruling on the matter.",38
76,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I will discuss the matter with you further but could I note, for the purposes of the record, that the only unconditional withdrawal offered by the Leader of the House was after the putting of the relevant motion. It is on page 39 of Hansard, some six pages after the motion was moved. So it is impossible that that withyou drawal was effective to correct the motion, because it was offered after the motion was voted on.",38

78,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, I have a question for you relating to the ruling that you gave at the start of question time today on the issue of the doors being locked. Can I refer you to page 273 of House of Representatives Practice, where it says: House staff acting on the Chair's instruction to lock the doors will allow Members in the process of passing through the doors to pass before locklanguage? ing them but do not continue to hold the door open for approaching Members. Mr Speaker, can I indicate to you that in the division that was the subject of your ruling today people who were only approaching the doors at the time that you ordered that the doors be locked did continue to come through the doors. Mr Speaker, I am exercising my rights understanding order 135(b) to complain about the record of this division. I would specifically ask you to inquire whether or not the votes of the Minister for Education, Science and Training, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and the member for Dawson are properly recorded in that division because they were on the other side of the door, not in the door, at the time that you ordered that the doors be locked.",38
79,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I thank the Manager of Opposition Business. I again draw her attention to the statement. I made earlier in response to her question from last week. It was quite a detailed response to the very points that she has just raised. I have asked, as I said in the response, the Serjeant-at-Arms to monitor the matter in the future for where there are any persistent problems.",39

86,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I am sorry; I just do not understand. Are you saying that, because the House carried a dissent motion on a slightly unrelated subject, it is now in order for motions to have unparliamentary language provided a majority of the House agrees with it?",39

92,Mr MCGAURAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"During question time, in a question from the Leader of the Opposition to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, the Leader of the Opposition made two false assertions. The first was that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry endorsed work by industry group Single Vision. Mr Speaker, Single Vision has not approached the government seeking endorsement for its research, nor has the government given formal endorsement of the conduct of its project. The second falsehood was when the Leader of the Opposition asserted that, whilst the Deputy Prime Minister was out in regional Australia defending the single desk, his National Party colleague was undermining him on the single desk. That is simply wrong. As I reiterated at that time, and have since on any number of occasions, the government has given a firm commitment to wheat growers that the single desk will remain as long as there is a benefit to them and to the nation's export performance.

98,Mr WINDSOR,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I would like to correct the record. In question time today the Prime Minister, in answer to a question relating to the sale of Snowy Hydro, said words to the effect that the use of the term ‘permanent restrictions' on Snowy Hydro Ltd was my construction and not the government's.

100,The SPEAKER,SNOWY HYDRO LTD,Order! Is the member for Calare seeking leave to speak to the motion?,41
101,Mr ANDREN,SNOWY HYDRO LTD,I am seeking leave. Leave granted.,41
102,Mr ANDREN,SNOWY HYDRO LTD,"I am grateful for the fact that the government, contrary to my advice, has determined not to gag this debate. The Snowy Mountains scheme is the Vegemite of national infrastructure. The only important difference is that we own the Snowy. This sale is all about setting up the private sector to exploit the peak power market. It is Enronesque in its potential. It is about derivatives. It is about selling insurance. It is about building gas fired ministations to manipulate the power market and conserving water that should go to irrigators and the environment in order to maximise power returns at manipulated peak prices. It does not need a foreign gorilla to do this. This is part of a process to set up a casino of power supply and manipulation of the supply market. The 10 per cent cap on shareholdings is a nonsense, as is the cap on foreign ownership. The 10 per cent cap will guarantee that shareholders with a lazy $300 million to spend can buy up to a 10th of the Snowy scheme under this offer-hardly mums and dads. I am sorry to disagree with the member for Riverina on this point-and I acknowledge her firm endeavours and passion around this issue-but there is no way in the world that her private member's bill can enshrine in legislation a permanent cap on any sort of shareholding, as the Prime Minister admitted during question time. This is a sly sale that has no mandate. It is the selling of stolen goods. There is no referendum, no inquiry and no agreement with the electorate at a state or national level. The parliamentary motions on the Senate and House Notice Papers six weeks ago clearly appeared on the day they were introduced. They were to be rushed through with minimal debate-thus was the hope of the coalition-with Labor approval to satisfy the revenue problems of the Iemma government in particular. It has been well documented that the debate was not semaphored-except to those who had a special interest in ensuring that the matter went through the parliament with the greatest of haste. The states had no motion on this and, like the federal parliament, they had no legislation. They made sure of that when their corporatisation legislation ensured that a sell-off did not have to go through parliament. Why did the federal parliament not adopt the same strategy? Of course, the government, at that stage, did not control both houses, and, as I understand it, the Senate forced an amendment that ensured that any sale be referred to the parliament. There was never to be a full and proper inquiry, there was never to be a parliamentary inquiry and there was never to be a proper debate-as was shown on 29 and 30 March in a shameful process that tried to give the impression that this matter had the imprimatur of the parliament when there was absolutely no mandate and the matter had taken the public by shock. How arrogant, how devious, how appalling! How angry the people are who have come to see me in recent times. They have emailed, they have written and they have rung. They have been in parliament today. These are people who have had a long association with the Snowy Mountains scheme. They know that Snowy Hydro can look after its own infrastructure and its own upgrades well into the future and does not need any injection of taxpayers' money to do so. The only reason there was any motion in the parliament was, as I said, that the coaliit. tion did not have the numbers. The key to all this is the commercial-in-confidence elements of the so-called agreements-the 75year water licences and the compensation deed that will see taxpayers forking out to compensate a privatised Snowy Hydro for shortfalls in any guarantees locked into the sale. That is where the taxpayer will be caught out in the future-having been asked whether they wish to buy back their own asset. Forty-six of these so-called agreements will not be open to public gaze. Snowy Hydro delivers a $150 million dividend to the three governments and $50 million in taxes. It is capable of funding own capital upgrades, estimated at $40 million a year-nothing like the $1.5 billion Della Bosca and others allege is required and use to justify the sale. Snowy Hydro does not get, and does not need, state or federal gov- legislation. ernment money to prop it up in any way. The $1.5 billion needed for capital upgrades, which Mr Della Bosca, Mr Iemma, Mr Brumby and this government bang on about, is the spending plan of a fully privatised Snowy Hydro expanding well beyond its current role to manipulate electricity markets in this country, at the expense of Australian consumers, irrigators and the environment, for the benefit, surely as night follows day, of major shareholders. In spite of any attempts to cap foreign ownership, that cannot be guaranteed into the future. Inevitably, down the track, overseas-or, indeed, Australian-mega power operators and market manipulators will have control of those processes and we will leave the way open to manipulation of that market to a degree that could be Enronesque in its outcomes. Today's joint announcement is simply the sticking of a collective federal and state digit in the dyke-or, at least, the dam of public opinion. Caps cannot be guaranteed beyond this parliament-and the government knows So, too, do the Labor Party and the state governments. Think again, Prime Minister. Think again, Labor. There at 13 million reasons why you should-and they all have a vote.",41
103,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,SNOWY HYDRO LTD,Is the motion seconded?,42
104,Mr WINDSOR,SNOWY HYDRO LTD,"I second the motion and I do so with pleasure. Australians are opposed to the sale of Snowy Hydro, and most members, if they are paying any attention to the public debate, would recognise that. There are a number of issues that need to be aired, and they were not aired when the motion first came through its the parliament. People were very confused about what the issue was. Many members of that the government did not even know that a motion was going to be introduced and that the government did not need to introduce Today there is still a degree of confusion. We are told that there were something like 46 agreements within the original corporatisation of Snowy Hydro, which took place in 1997 and came into effect in 2001. We are told that those 46 agreements are part of the contractual arrangements that will be a condition of the sale. But no-one that I am aware of has actually seen those documents. There is no mandate for the sale of Snowy Hydro. I am as critical of the New South Wales government as anybody in this parliament-and no government has been to the people on this issue, including the Commonwealth government. There has been very little debate on this very important issue. There is confusion over the facts around the constitutionality and the legalities involved, the operation of the scheme and the various compensatory mechanisms that will or will not come into play if, in fact, the New South Wales government intervenes on the control of water and what that will mean to the generation of power or to any private business that will be deprived of the possibility of generating income from that source. We do not know what the contract says. Anybody who has made application for a prospectus has not been provided with any great information on the sale documentation at all. Even though there is a 75-year water licence, which I think now has 72 years to run, we do not know what the compensation mechanisms may or may not be. How can we sell an asset which is essentially owned by the people of Australia without these questions being answered? It is time that the Commonwealth government took some leadership in this debate. I am distressed to see this announcement today coming from the Hon. Nick Minchin and the Victorian and New South Wales ministers responsible for the sale. Nick Minchin says: ‘The Australian government will introduce legislation in June that imposes the lowing permanent restrictions on Snowy Hydro Ltd.' There are a number of restrictions, which I will not go through-people can read them in the press release-but the fact is that this government and this parliament cannot make those restrictions permanent. Our Constitution provides that one government cannot bind a future parliament through legislation. That is the legality of the situation. Where are the Labor Party on this motion? We have seen where they are in New South Wales. We have heard the argument that the New South Wales government has cash flow problems and needs the money. The New South Wales government has no debt. It has a cash flow problem that, hopefully, is temporary. By doing this the New South Wales government is selling the house to pay the grocery bill. There is no need for the New South Wales government to enter this arrangement. There is no need for the Victorian government to enter this arrangement. Least of all does the Commonwealth government need to take this step. In my view, the Commonwealth government has displayed some leadership in recent years through the National Water Initiative and other initiatives. We have started to look at the water debate across state boundaries. Senator Minchin has been grinding away at the states, particularly Victoria, over many months now to make the sale possible. For the Commonwealth government to give up that leadership role with many things still unknown is quite disgraceful. I believe today's announcement by the minister about the caps, the board structure, foreign ownership restrictions et cetera is nothing but a Clayton's announcement on the sale document. Hopefully, the people of Australia will rise up against the bill that the government is going to introduce to the parliament. What are the reasons for the sale? We hear folthe corporate mantra that governments should not be involved in the delivery of business services. These services are fairly significant. They involve water going into the Murray and Murrumbidgee systems and renewable power generated into the electricity grid linked to four states. This is very important for our future energy needs, particularly at a time when the Prime Minister and others are, quite rightly, talking about need for a debate on future energy needs and the possibility of nuclear energy. So why aren't we debating the Snowy Hydro issue in greater detail? This is our major construction achievement of 50 years ago-the crown jewel of looking forward, multiculturalism and a whole range of other issues. The New South Wales and Commonwealth governments agree. They say that there is a need for growth in Snowy Hydro and that, for Snowy Hydro to go forward, there will be capital requirements. Investigation shows that turbine maintenance for Snowy Hydro should not be any greater than about $25 million per annum. The operational and general maintenance costs are probably about $15 million per annum. So there is a $40 million requirement annually, not the $200 million or the $1.5 billion over five years that many people are talking about. Snowy Hydro generates a return of about $150 million each year and pays about $50 million in tax, so it does have the capacity to self-fund within those restrictions. The issue may well be that Snowy Hydro Ltd has greater ambitions than the supply of hydroelectricity-such as gas turbines and accessing the water market. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister is putting in place rules which could see Snowy Hydro becoming a major player or a water baron when it comes to the access to water licences and in doing what it does in the derivatives market in insurance at the moment-selling at the peaks when it has a captive market to sell into and multiplying profits in that way. That is something in which some public administration really should be involved. I do not know whether there are restrictions on that within the sale contract or notbut I do not think anybody else in this chamber knows either. Those are the sorts of things that people need to know before they the can make proper decisions as to the sale, the long-term impacts on the downstream water users and the long-term impacts on power users on the eastern seaboard. In conclusion, there will be a rally held in Canberra a fortnight from today at approximately 12 o'clock. We are calling on all Australians, if they are serious about the long term needs of water and power generation in this nation and if they are serious about public ownership of much-needed instrumentalities, to make a stand. It is time that the people started to turn up and generate their power-the power to maintain these instrumentalities that were earned through the deaths and hard work of many Australians over many years. It is time that they turned up, put the heat on and poured water on these irrational governments that are making irrational decisions in some sort of rational economic debate. I challenge all Australians to be at that rally. The fact is that the Prime Minister, through Nick Minchin-and I pay credit to the member for Riverina and others in this parliament-has come out today with this press release that puts up a bandaid approach in terms of ‘permanent restrictions' when we all know they cannot be permanent. The Prime Minister admitted at question time that obviously they cannot be permanent. What is the point of introducing them if we are interested in the long-term needs of water and power generation within this country? It is time for people right across Australia to stand up. I congratulate Alan Jones and the many others who have had the guts, in terms of their positions on radio and in newspapers, to articulate what people right across Australia are saying. It is very obvious in here that, privately, whether they be Labor, Liberal or New Liberals, members do not want it sold. But with the forces of party mechanisms they are being forced to participate in this farce of the sale of Snowy Hydro. I call again on all of the people across Australia who are opposed to this, or opposed to the privatisation of much-needed public utilities, to show up at the rallies in Sydney, in Cooma and the one in Canberra in a fortnight's time.",42
105,Mr MCGAURAN,SNOWY HYDRO LTD,"Gippsland-Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (4.03 pm)-I well understand the concerns that people have about the privatisation of Snowy Hydro. But once the New South Wales government's decision to sell its 48 per cent stake was made, it was inevitable and unavoidable that the Commonwealth would also have to sell its 13 per cent stake. The retention of a 13 per cent share in a commercial company by the Commonwealth is not practical nor fiscally sensible. It is too small to have an impact. I think the Labor Party's shadow minister for finance put it extremely well here in the chamber on 30 March this year when he said: In my judgment, the key issue for the Commonwealth in this instance is whether there is any merit in retaining 13 per cent of a major organisagalitres, tion, Snowy Hydro. In my assessment, that fact alone makes it relatively pointless to oppose the sale of the holding, because 13 per cent is simply not enough to allow the Commonwealth to influence the decisions of the organisation in any material way, and I think it is a very unlikely scenario that any government would commit to buying the current shares that are going to be put on sale by the New South Wales and Victorian governments. Consequently, concerns about the sale have been overridden by the determination of New South Wales to sell its majority stake whatever the position adopted by the Australian government. The water security issues loom large, rightly. We are confident that security is there for irrigators, regardless of ownership. That security is governed by the Snowy water licence, which was issued by the New South Wales government. It was developed by the Australian, New South Wales and Victorian governments at the time of corporatisation, specifically to protect security. It guarantees the volumes for irrigators. While it is true that it is technically open to New South Wales to seek to vary the conditions of the licence, there is a massive disincentive deliberately built into it for the New South Wales government never to consider doing that. The terms of the Murray-Darling Basin agreement mean that any reductions to Snowy Hydro releases would be deducted from New South Wales water allocations. No government would dare do that, politically or economically-or, if it did, it would suffer the political odium. The issue of environmental water is also of great importance. Releases of water for the environment-up to a 21 per cent increase in flows has been agreed-are also protected by the terms of the Snowy water licence. There is a qualified commitment by Victoria and New South Wales to return another seven per cent, around another 84 gipost-2012 to take environmental flows to 28 per cent. The responsibility for recovering and paying for that additional water rests exclusively with the New South Wales and Victorian governments. That is in black and white in the implementation deed, and they have recently committed to setting aside some funds from the sale to do that. Water For Rivers, the body set up by the three governments to undertake that environmental water recovery, is increasingly confident that it can meet the 21 per cent target on time. I think we will be seeing some more announcements on that pretty shortly, which will also deliver some more water to the Murray. The timing of the release is also of great importance to irrigators. Here the Murray-Darling Basin Commission, Snowy Hydro and New South Wales government representatives have met several times to progress outstanding issues relating to water management that have been raised in this House, within the government and by the President of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission, the Rt Hon. Ian Sinclair. The parties are working towards finalising an agreement that will assist the Murray-Darling Basin Commission in managing the timing of releases from the Snowy. I am confident that we will see a sensible set of protocols to ensure that the timing of the release of the guaranteed volumes is to the satisfaction of irrigators and communities rightly concerned about environmental water flows. With regard to foreign ownership: this has been touched upon in this House, not least of all by the Prime Minister. He has set a number of conditions over and above the normal foreign investment approval processes that give comfort to those who are concerned that Snowy Hydro would be dominated by foreign interests. Given the shortage of time available to us to pursue this matter, I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later date so that the debate is not closed today. Leave granted; debate adjourned. NA Indigenous Communities",45
106,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Lingiari proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The need for the Government to address urgently the underlying issues pf poverty and dissay: advantage, including the causes and symptoms of substance abuse, violence and dysfunction within indigenous communities. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",46
107,Mr SNOWDON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Lingiari) (4.08 pm)The events of recent weeks have thrown into stark relief some of the more horrific and sensational circumstances that Indigenous Australians confront every day of their lives. I would like members across the chamber to agree that dealing with these circumstances is our most urgent national priority. It is important that we do that. I acknowledge that none of us on either side of the House can come into this place with clean hands on this subject. It is clear from our perspective-certainly from my own-that we could have done more when in government to address the underlying causes of poverty in Indigenous communities. It is unfortunate that the social justice package which was being developed by the Keating government was never put into any agreement or funded. What we have seen subsequently is a matter of some concern. I note that, now more than two years ago in an article in the Age, Michael Gordon wrote: For much of his eight years plus in office, John Howard has concentrated on what he calls practical reconciliation, refusing to say sorry for injustices and placing little store in symbolic gestures. But (outside the COAG trials) he delivered little, partly because so many responsibilities are shared. The explicit promise of yesterday is that money will now be used more effectively and the lives of indigenous Australians improved. Importantly for all of us, particularly those of us on this side of the chamber, he went on to Turning this promise into reality will require gence, rigour, vision and more political will than has been on display from either side ... That is still the challenge that we all in this parliament face, right here, right now, today. It is worth reflecting upon the success that the government may or may not have had in addressing these needs. It is clear to me that, whilst the Howard government has been in power for 10 years and despite its rhetoric about practical reconciliation, which it has embraced wholeheartedly, little has changed. We now know that the COAG trials that Gordon refers to have been a sham. It has diverted more funds into the bureaucracy, and very little money has hit the ground where it is needed. In the celebrated case of one Tasmanian project, the administrative costs were 10 times that of the project itself. I note that the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs seated at the table referred to the COAG trials with the Thamarrurr Council at Wadeye recently. In that reference, he has made the assertion that the Commonwealth had put $44 million into the community through the COAG trialsMr Brough-No, I did not.",46
108,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The minister will have an opportunity to reply.,47
109,Mr SNOWDON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Minister Brough, I am happy for you to respond when it is your opportunity. He stated that the joint NTfederal contribution, however, was more like $1.9 million. Wadeye elders said that there would be no need for intervention if only the Northern Territory and federal governments met their obligations. Data unearthed through the Senate estimates process reveals that tens of millions of dollars spent administering trial programs under the umbrella of COAG in many instances outgun the value diliof the project. I referred to a case in Tasmania where administering a $34,318 program cost the Australian community $327,784 in administrative expenses. If we listen to the rhetoric, we are led to believe that millions, indeed billions, of dollars have been thrown down the chute after Indigenous affairs. What we know, constantly of course, is that a lot of this money never meets its destination, and we need to be very concerned about that. The government came into power with a hard-edged and very clear-cut agenda to rid itself of the very last vestiges of Labor's approach to Indigenous affairs. It shrugged away any semblance of a bipartisan approach. From day one, the government has pursued its agenda to reshape the Indigenous affairs policy landscape in its own image, with a single-minded ideological commitment. ATSIC was the first to feel the blowtorch when it was ordered to make acrossthe-board cuts under the first Costello budget. These cuts, not coincidentally, had the greatest impact on programs dealing with family violence and the support of young people. Indeed, it is a matter of some concern that, in the 1995-96 ATSIC budget, $30.3 million was spent on community and youth support, including the Family Violence Intervention Program. This program funded 37 women's centres, four men's programs, 15 children's services, 70 services for youth activities and youth bail accommodation, nine family support and violence intervention programs, the night patrol project in Katherine and a women's crisis centre serving 20 communities in New South Wales. In March 1997, the community and youth component ended as a result of budget cuts to ATSIC in the 1996-97 budget. We have seen the horrific results of family violence and sexual abuse in Indigenous communities highlighted over recent days. We as a community will not, and should not, tolerate the excesses that have been perpetrated upon Indigenous women and children by some males. But Indigenous Australians deserve a great deal more respect in this conversation we are having about them-not with them-than they are currently receiving. Whilst ATSIC may have had significant flaws, its abolition by the government-and I have not come here to either praise or bury ATSIC-has left Indigenous Australians without a nationally representative structure, and indeed, without a national voice. Its called replacement, the National Indigenous Council, comprises a group of people who do not represent anyone, who are not responsible to anyone and who are not accountable to anyone. Yet they purport to give the primary source of advice to the government on Indigenous affairs. During ATSIC's lifespan the issue of sexual abuse and family violence was repeatedly raised by commissioners. Indeed, one of those commissioners, Alison Anderson, now a member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly for the seat of Macdonnell, raised the issues with the Prime Minister himself as a member of his task force in 2003. Report after report has made recommendations that have been shelved and all but ignored. The pleas and cries of women in the Indigenous community have not been listened to by this government. The minister has visited Central Australia and Northern Australia on a number of occasions. In 1979 and 1980 I was working with an Indigenous community in the Pitjantjatjara homelands of South Australia to put forward a proposition to the government to fund a petrol sniffing program-the first petrol sniffing program to be funded by the Commonwealth. Despite repeated requests for recurrent funding by Indigenous families across Central and Northern Australia for diversionary programs to deal with petrol sniffing and alcohol abuse, the programs have not been funded appropriately. Now we are having visited upon us the stark reality of what happens in communities which suffer from excessive substance abuse. Violence against women and families has followed. I am happy to acknowledge, as someone who has lived and worked in these communities for many years, that we should have a far greater understanding than is currently being exhibited about issues to do with customary law and how they impact upon the commuso- nity. As a nation we need to better understand and address the issues at the heart of the problem. To do this, we must first look, listen and learn. I say to the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, who is at the table: I am pleased that he has taken the interest he has. If I can do anything to assist in his understanding of Indigenous issues across Northern Australia and Australia generally I would be happy to do so. If there is any way I can assist him to sit down with communities so that he might understand what their issues are, rather than have those issues told to him by others, I would be glad to do so. I know from Indigenous Australians who live in my electorate-around 40 per cent of my constituents are Indigenous Australians-that they hanker for an engagement with the community about the issues which have been publicised so highly lately. They need to be understood. They want you to sit down with them and not talk about them, but talk to them. They want you to understand that they have concerns about the issues which have been raised publicly. They also have solutions to some of these issues. They understand the need for a high school education. It is worth noting in passing that until 2001 no Aboriginal kid living in a bush community in the Northern Territory could get to a high school, pass high school and get his or her year 12 certificate in their home community. That was because of 24 years of indolence and direct policy failure by successive conservative CLP administrations since 1978. It is only since the ALP was elected to the government in the Northern Territory that there has been any effort to provide secondary education for kids in the bush. There are between 3,000 and 5,000 young Territorians who have had no access to high school education. These are young people who, if they could get a job, would never have the skills for it. These are young people who do not even have the skills to be able to access the training they require to get a job. We cannot blame these people. There is no point accusing them. We have to understand their plight and sit down and work with them. The minister and others have been to Wadeye, and I have talked already about the COAG trial at Wadeye. What the community there have been telling me, and telling governments for many years, is that they require a new form of housing, setting up what are effectively subdivisions for some time. They have already set up one. This would decentralise the community. They have been after this for some years. It has been part of the COAG discussion, but it has not hit the table. Whilst the government has a predilection for trying to ensure that every Indigenous Australian, wherever they live and whatever their circumstances, is a private home owner, it ain't going to happen. Welfare housing is extremely important, and the public sector has a significant role. There is already a housing deficit of around $1.2 billion in the Northern Territory alone, and around $2.5 billion across Australia. We need to address these issues, and we need to address them together. I say to the minister: ‘Let's sit down and talk about targets and goals. Let's talk about what might be achievable to redress the balance. Let's talk about the things that can be done to ensure that Indigenous Australians have the same opportunities as the rest of us. Let's understand that attacking their rights is not the answer. Let's recognise that they have rights as Australian citizensthe same rights as every other Australian citizen-which need to be funded by government.' I am aware that the government is proposing significant changes to the CDEP. Some of them are probably worthwhile, but others are totally misguided. Again, I am happy to enter a dialogue with the government-I am sure my colleagues on this side of the House are too-to see how we can get more effective changes than the ones which have been proposed by the government. Recently in the Australian of 26 May Patrick Dodson referred to the 1997 report Bringing them home. He said the report: ... highlighted the infringement of UN definition of Genocide and called for a National apology and compensation to those Aboriginal people who had suffered under these valid laws for the destruction of Aboriginal societies and the sanctioning of the biogenetic modification of Aboriginal people. He said: ... despite the horrors exposed in the report as a nation we proved incapable of confronting our past and dealing with its consequences. That failure alone should have been seen as condemned for a lack of courage and a denial of justice. … … … Undoubtedlyhe saidsome of our politicians see these outcomes as a sustaining of the natural order of the dominant society and its institutions. However there are others ... who understand that the unjust assertion of the power of one section of society over a less powerful group will ... diminish us as a nation ... I say, ‘Hear, hear' to that. What I say to the minister is: let's walk together down this path. Let's walk together in a bipartisan way to improve the lot of Indigenous Australians for the benefit of us all.",47
110,Mr BROUGH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Longman-Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Indigenous Affairs) (4.23 pm)-Let us make no mistake today that the speech by the member for Lingiari was not about addressing the fundamental issues; it was about revisiting an ideological approach that has failed. It is one that has failed miserably the people whom we should all seek to represent. I would like to address at the outset a few of the issues that the member for Lingiari raised. For starters, he said I should have a dialogue with him and some other people. Let me tell you that the people I have had dialogue with and continue to do so are not just Indigenous leaders and representative bodies-whether it be the NIC or Reconciliation Australia-but people over the fences, people sitting on the river banks, people who have been picked up by the night patrol and people sitting in their homes who do not have a voice. They do not know that this discussion is taking place in here today. Mr Crean-Do you think you are the only one who talks to them?",50
111,Mr BROUGH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Hotham asks, ‘Do I think I am the only one who speaks to them?' The member for Lingiari, your representative on this issue, has said, ‘Come and talk to me.' The people I am talking to do not even know that this discussion is occurring today. They are the people who have said to me: ‘These are the key issues for us. These are the key issues for the people on the streets.' These are the people who are saying: ‘You've got to understand that we want to be treated the same as the whitefella. We want to be treated the same way under the law.' If you want children to attend schools, you have to have parents accepting responsibility for ensuring that they go there, and the state or territory government has to police those laws. These people want to ensure that the laws that currently apply-not new lawsapply to them equally, just as they do to the wider community. They tell me-whether it be in Wadeye, Port Keats, Galiwinku or Mornington Island: wherever it happens to be-that they do not believe that occurs today. I know there is a great propensity on the other side to widen this debate. I have deliberately kept the issue focused on delivering the fundamental principle that underpins any civilised society. There has not been a civilised society ever that has succeeded when the basic rule of law has not existed and when the criminal justice system that applies in that society has not had the confidence of its people. That is what has occurred in these places. Let us deal with some of the specifics. In Wadeye there has not been one riot of 150 people; there have not been two riots of 150 people. They have been going on and on. When there is a riot-let me explain what happens here-150 people trash a suburb. In fact, the men and boys go through first and behind are the women and children who actually ruin the homes, destroy the toilet bowls and break the windows. We have seen the evidence of that. There is no escaping that there is a fundamental breakdown in law and order. What I am simply saying to people, first and foremost, is that if we do not deal with that issue we can continue to build more homes, which we have done. In Wadeye there have been 28 homes destroyed over the last few months. If we want to continue to replace houses at the same rate as they are being destroyed, we will be here in another 10 years time facing the same issues. First and foremost we have to face up to the stark reality that there are people who do not know anything other than lawlessness in these communities. It is not just Mal Brough or the Howard government saying that. It is the people who are having the crimes perpetrated upon them who say, ‘I want to stand up in a court of law and give evidence, but I'm afraid of payback.' The member for Lingiari knows as well as anyone in this place that there is a very real notion of fear for these people, whether they be black or white. When I was in Wadeye I had both black and white Australians saying those words to me. They said: ‘I know exactly what you're saying. What you're saying is 100 per cent correct. Don't expect us to stand up in court because payback will cost us too much.' There is a fundamental breakdown in our faith in the criminal justice system and our capacity to deliver law and order that we, Australians, accept and, in fact, demand in every suburb that we live in. Yet it does occur here. The member for Lingiari says that there have been reports on domestic violence. His words were, ‘They've all been shelved or all but ignored by the Howard government.' I say to the member for Lingiari: who has the constitutional responsibility to deliver law and order in this country? Dr Lawrence interjecting",50
112,Mr BROUGH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"If the former Premier of Western Australia is oohing and aahing about abolishing the states because they cannot deliver Australian fundamental law and order, get up and say it-that is fine. The reason I asked all the states and territories come together was not to berate them but to do the very thing that the member for Lingiari asked. It was to bring us together not just on the issue of what happens after the event-after a child has been raped, after a young woman has been burnt, after someone has had domestic violence perpetrated upon them year after year or their house has been destroyed or the community centre has been destroyed-but on the issue as to how we are going to prevent those things from happening in the first place. I am not suggesting for one moment that issues of housing, education, employment and opportunity are not important. But Wadeye is a classic example-and the member for Lingiari is, in fact, incorrect: he invited me to correct the record so I shall-because the federal government and the Northern Territory government, in partnership, signed up to the COAG trial. The COAG trial was to try and ensure that there would be better outcome for the people of Wadeye. It has not occurred; we accept that. Forty million dollars has been spent or committed. Half of that money was for housing, much of which as has not been delivered. The reason it has not been delivered-I am sure the member for not Lingiari would be keen to hear-is the delay in providing serviced land to enable the housing to be established. There are lengthy delays in providing serviced blocks to these remote communities. In fact, in Wadeye the government provided $1.5 million to the Northern Territory government in June 2004 for servicing of the land and to this date it still has not occurred. I am not blaming the Northern Territory government. It is a statement of fact that, as the member for Lingiari knows, there are huge issues in getting land when no-one, other than the community, can own it. The fact is that there is a new subdivision to out there-and the member for Lingiari referred to it in his comments-which is safer, which is removed and which was supported and dealt with through the federal and Northern Territory governments working together. I ask any member of the Labor Party whether we can seriously say, of 150 people rioting, people being speared in the leg, people being hit over the head with nulla-nullas and people running through town trashing houses and breaking toilet blocks, that there is an excuse that we can give for that. I say no. In that same trial 24 young apprentices were put into a housing prefabrication factory in Wadeye. We did not need 24 apprentices; it was about opportunities. The last I heard there were five remaining. Why? Because those individuals do not have the basic numeracy and literacy skills to stay there and, probably far more important than that, the education system has failed them of course. Why? Because they do not turn up to school. There is no cause and effect from the parents. That is a reality of life. I was told only this week by a resident of Wadeye, that when some of the young men have been taken to a workplace that very night the elder who has requested that work placement happen and has aided and abetted that person in having a better opportunity has had their house trashed and ruined. If that is a fact, how is a community ever going to dig itself out of the malaise that it is in if we do not first and foremost restore law and order? I invite the member for Lingiari and those who sit opposite if they missed it to have a look at last night's Four Corners. It was an excellent program. There were no dramatic overtones to it. It just had statements of fact, and the camera does not lie. Firstly, there was a corner store in a community of about 150 people which has lost over $100,000. How can one store in one community lose that sort of money unless it is mismanagement or corruption? Secondly, the night patrol vehicle, which is supposed to keep the streets quiet and peaceful at night because there are no police there, was in Alice Springs being used as a cab. The fuel is no longer there because of the misuse of a resource that is supposed to be used to keep people safe. Then there was the community hall which 12 months ago or a little longer had a billiard table and other resources to assist people in having something positive to do and to engage the young people. It appeared like there were a lot of bullet holes in it. It was clear that it was trashed. I wonder whether there was a police investigation into that trashing of public property. I wonder if there was a police investigation into the corruption at the store. I wonder if there was a police investigation when they said women could not walk the streets at night because of the violence in the streets in a ‘dry' community. Are we as Australian taxpayers supposed to continue to pour more money into a community like that until we get the basis that every civilised society both demands and deserves-that is, to have a safe community? There have been some improvements over the last 10 years. It is worth mentioning them- because there is a lot of doom and gloom. There are communities out there that are doing the right thing, but I am not prepared to gloss over the problems and stand up here and say, ‘The Howard government has spent more than any previous government-$3.3 billion-and we should be proud of it.' We should be proud when people have the same rights as everybody else, have the same opportunity to live anywhere they choose to in this nation and have an education and the life skills to live in Canberra, Wadeye, Galiwinku or Alice Springs. Today they simply do not have that opportunity. The death rates from respiratory illness have reduced. These are still appalling figures, so do not let anyone misread what I am saying, but it is important to recognise there has been an improvement. The death rate from respiratory illness from 1992 to 1994 was seven to eight times the non-Indigenous average-today it is four times. Death rates from infectious and parasitic diseases was 15 to 18 times more likely to occur than the non-Indigenous average-today it is five times. The year 3 writing benchmark at school was 73 per cent of all students-today it is 83 per cent. Secondary school attendance has improved. Year 12 retention has improved. Students attending what used to be known as VET has gone up from 2.4 per cent of 32,000 to 33.6 per cent of 57,000-so a dramatic improvement. Home ownership has improved. I want to deal briefly with this issue of home ownership. The Howard government has made a big ploy that we want to move away from collectivism. If you go to these communities, people say there is no employment. The reality is that the collective, the corporation, owns the land. No individual owns the land. You can never own your own home. Even if you aspire to do that, it is a simple impossibility. You cannot own a business there because the collective owns the businesses. The collective determines who gets the house, the collective decides who works in the community store and the collective makes all the decisions on behalf of the group. I know there was a time when we thought that self determination and land rights would solve the problems. I believe it was well meant on both sides. It simply has not worked and it will not work. The people of Nguiu in the Tiwi islands have voted with their feet and said, ‘Let's change and let's allow home-ownership here. Let's allow ourselves to able to put in our own sweat and effort and own something for ourselves, make a determination for ourselves like every other Australian and take control of our lives rather than being dependent upon the collective.' There is nothing wrong with that. That is a direction that the Howard government wants to move in. We recognise that there will be communities that will not be able to participate in that cause they are so isolated they simply will not be eligible or able to participate in a market economy, but we can take a lot of people forward. What underpins this and is the glue that holds it together is that no government, state or federal, has ever dealt with comprehensively the fundamental right to live in a safe community. I could stand here today and read out all of the horrific things that have filled our newspapers, but I will not be doing it because it is there for everyone to see. I understand the horror of those opposite because I feel the same way, but I think that it is important that the Australian public acknowledges and understands the pain these people have put up with for so long. They are demanding that it stop. When people talk about intergenerational rape, it is not something they want their children to have, and we have a role today to stop it, but if you are not prepared to put someone in jail who has raped a child or who has committed domestic violence, not as a one-off but in a systematic approach, then I am afraid we are not going to get to the core of the issue. We can have all the domestic violence units that we like, we can have all the family relationship centres that we like and we can have all of the provisions afterwards, but when someone turns around after a crime has been committed against them and there is no one to talk to, there is no policeman there to act and there is no safety because the person that has perpetrated the crime of serious assault or sexual deviancy against them comes back into the community for up to two years while they are waiting for trial is it any wonder people do not stand up to give evidence? They are fundamental issues that I am hoping to address in the summit. I want them to be addressed because I believe it is the only way we can go forward. I know that the shadow spokesman and the Chief Minister behave been talking about housing. Housing is a key issue, but we have to recognise that throwing good money after bad is a failure and that, over the last four years, the Territory government have failed to spend the money that they have received. That is a statement of fact and they acknowledge that. If they cannot spend the money they had, even if we were of a mind to throw a lot more money at the problem, what would it have achieved? Let us have a bipartisan approach to this and let us put the ideologies behind us. But let us recognise that, if we do not deal with the two fundamentals of law and order and faith in our criminal justice system, we will condemn ourselves and that community to being in the same position in 10, 20 and 30 years time. I think that is unacceptable. It is something that we should all accept as our grave responsibility and deal with it now. (Time expired)",51
113,Mr GARRETT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I respond to the comments made in the matter of public importance by the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs by saying that we on this side of the House not only come with a strong commitment to find grounds for bipartisan approaches to this issue but also recognise that we do not have the answers. I also strongly say to the minister that, if we do talk about walking together, we do it in a way which acknowledges that some of the differences that we have about ideology and approach should not blind us to the needs that Indigenous communities have, including the ones that he spoke so strongly about in the House. I remind the minister that many of us here have had a long and abiding concern, interest and connection with these issues, so we are very aware of the level of abuse, suffering and hurt. We are well aware of the level of dysfunctionality that some communities display and we have given some thought to what the best means might be for governments to address this issue. We say to the minister very clearly that it will not be sufficountry cient-notwithstanding the strong fervour that he has for addressing law and order, and I take nothing away by that comment-to confine his approach and the government's approach to those law and order issues, although they need addressing. It will be equally essential to go to the matters that we have put up for debate and discussed in this matter of public importance. Here is the test for the government and for the minister. For 10 years a number of ministers have held this portfolio and the Prime Minister himself has committed himself to the cause of true reconciliation with the Aboriginal people of Australia by federation, but within that 10 years, on indicators of health and life expectancy, Indigenous people have continued to go backwards. That is the direction they have headed in. In order to address that particular aspect of what has happened to Indigenous people, we must look at the underlying issues and we must recognise that these issues have a historical component that attaches to them. The problems that the minister spoke about in places like Wadeye and the Alice Springs town camps are the product of generations of governments' mistreatment and neglect. As long as there is no national strategy to deal with those problems which addresses not only the necessary observance and proper respect for law and due process within the criminal justice system but in addition the causes of violence and abuse, backed up with the resources to do the job including realistic and measurable goals and time lines at the summit that the minister is going to hold, then these problems will continue. That is the minister's challenge. Let us recognise that some of these debates can waylay us. A debate about political correctness or customary law and the impact that it has on the criminal justice system is a debate that we can have, but it is not the key debate. The key debate is how a First World can allow its first people to live in Third World conditions and to suffer the matters that the minister referred to. As the minister knows, there have been some 40 reports since 1990, and I think 21 reports in the last two terms of this government. There are plenty of answers in there for this minister. Many parliamentarians on both sides of the House have used their good intelligence and their commitment to Indigenous people to consider how these issues should be addressed. What has happened to those reports? What has happened to those recommendations? What has happened to those submissions? I was interested to hear the Co-chair of Reconciliation Australia, Mark Leiblerwhom the minister will know-make the point just last night about reconciliation being ‘a journey for all Australians as joint navigators'. He went on to observe: Governments must acknowledge, privately and publicly, that the necessary immediate law and justice response needs to be supported by properly resourced action to address underlying causes. We need some proportion in this debate, and I hope that we can bring it in the call that my colleague the member for Lingiari made and in the responses that we have heard from Minister Brough. Not every out-station is a living museum and not every settlement is dysfunctional. Numerous homeland centres around Yirrkala, for example, in north-east Arnhem Land are happy and healthy places. Papunya, often mentioned, is getting on top of its petrol sniffing problems. In my electorate of Kingsford Smith, parents at La Perouse are making solid efforts to get their kids back into school for the long term. It is true we do need to square up to the violence that the minister refers to. We need to take responsibility as members of political parties, and governments also need to do that. But let us be clear: the rate of Indigenous youth in jail is already alarmingly high. Is the suggestion I hear coming from some quarters that we will simply jail all these kids and that they will now sit in jail for the next five, 10 or 15 years? At what cost to them and at what cost to the community? We need better interventions, more policing and more rehabilitation measures. We need state governments and bureaucrats to step up to the mark and we need the Commonwealth to lead the effort. I do note and I do say very strongly that the reasons for the high levels of unacceptable violence and sexual abuse against women have already been identified and reported on. The minister spoke of the Australian Institute of Family Studies. It reports that there have been many years of inaction. Surely that is the point here. I hope, Minister Brough, that when the Prime Minister gave you this portfolio you said to him, ‘Don't take it away from me. I want to keep it for as long as I can so that I can get the job done.' I think, Minister, we need to ask you whether you will push hard for some of the budget surplus to be invested in making Indigenous people and Indigenous communities healthy. The AMA have done much good work on this and they continue to provide their report cards to government. They say again and again that health care and preventative health care remain consistently underfunded. This is something that the Commonwealth could address, and it could address it now. You raised good points in the discussion about housing, but are we simply saying that we are not going to provide levels of housing that all other Australians in similar conditions and circumstances would receive until specific instances of criminal violence, damage or destruction are dealt with? Surely that is not what the minister is proposing here. We must commit necessary resources. If we do not, we are just going to be treading water on addressing the underlying causes of violence and abuse. The Treasurer in question time took a question on comparative economies. I cannot remember exactly what his answer was-I do not want to endorse it-but I think we should ask the same question about comparative countries as they address issues of Indigenous people. Let us look at Canada, a comparative country. Let us look at the efforts they have made. Let us look at the money they have spent. Let us look at the resources-the significant additional resources-that they have committed to health. Let us look at something else that they have done which we need to do-let us look at the fact that they squared up to their past. They did not try and provide their own perspective on the past; they squared up to it. In squaring up to it, they recognised that people had been hurt-people had been terribly abused in the schooling system there-and that those people needed to have that hurt recognised and acknowledged by the national government and policies put in place, resourced and supported to enable them to come to terms with that hurt and to rebuild their lives so that they could make a decent contribution to Canada. As we look at the statistics in Canada, we see that by taking that decision-in other words, by adopting both reconciliation and practical measures-the Canadians have succeeded in arresting the decline and have improved the conditions for their indigenous people, something which in Australia, to our great shame, we have failed to do. So, Minister, why not use the national summit to come up with a national strategy on violence and abuse which includes realistic targets and time frames and measurable goals? Why not include Indigenous leaders in that summit? I say finally: if we are going to move forward, why not look at ways in which Indigenous people can meaningfully engage not only in your summit but also as part of a national representative body which they support and develop which would enable them to work hand-in-hand with governments as both embark on this important task together?",54
114,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I say at the outset that I want to make three very brief points. The first is that there is no doubt that the problems are very real and that we need to face the reality of this ugliness in our society. The second thing is that we need to address the underlying issues-the point of this MPI-as a society and we need to do it in consultation with Aboriginal communities and, in particular, to respect their traditional structures and the role of the elders. Thirdly, as I have thought about this-and I do not take it lightly at all-I am absolutely convinced that the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs is right to say that we must move first to secure the environment in which Aboriginal people, women and children in particular, have to operate if we are to achieve that very important objective of addressing underlying issues. I want to outline briefly to the House today two experiences which have really shaken me in recent years in relation to this whole question of violence and abuse and of unsatisfactory outcomes for children in particular in our Indigenous communities. I represent a lot of Indigenous people in my own electorate of Gwydir and, in addition to that, as Deputy PM I had what was really the privilege of overseeing an Indigenous trial in the east Kimberleys. From these experiences there are some things I would like to say today. One of them can be reflected by a truly horrific interview I had in my electorate in the town of Lightning Reach, where two Aboriginal men, leaders in their communities whom I respect greatly, came to see me one day and said, ‘We're here to talk about the impact of video trash in our communities.' I thought, ‘This'll be interesting. Where's it going?' One of them, a man I genuinely respect greatly because I have had a lot of dealings with him over some 17 or 18 years, said to me, ‘You have to understand that many of our young people are growing up in an environment where they are not really socialised in any normal way. They do not have a functional home environment in which they can learn either their own traditional values or mainstream Western values.' I think we sometimes arrogantly assume from our own Western perspective that all Australian kids, regardless of who they are, are growing up in some framework where they can be sensibly socialised, and that is often not the case. That was the point that this leader was making. He said, ‘You've got to understand that a lot of our young men are actually socialised by this highly inappropriate material that sometimes comes into their communities in truckloads.' I said to him, ‘All right, you're talking about censorship, and that is a very sensitive issue in Canberra. Where would you start?' He shocked me with his answer. He said, ‘You can start with every video that contains the term and relates to the concept of'-and it was a filthy word, the first part which is ‘mother' and the second part of which relates to sexual activity. I looked at him and said, ‘Why?' He said, ‘Because some of our kids who have grown up where they have had no socialisation in regard to what is acceptable sexual behaviour think that that is normal, and they learn it from whitey communities. They learn it from your communities!' I have never felt more ashamed in all my life. On that front, I was intrigued to note a press release put out by a man I do not know, a fellow by the name of Gondarra, who is the Chairman of the Aboriginal Resource and Development Service Inc. and the political leader of the Golumala clan in the Northern Territory. It makes very interesting reading, because his press release said in part: No group or people can exist without a system of law to protect its people from abuse. This is especially so for the most vulnerable people, the young and aged, both male and female. We would all agree with that. We would all uphold that. We would all recognise that no society can survive where its women and children are not safe. It is impossible. Every society worthy of the name society, let alone of the concept of civilisation down through the ages, has ensured the protection of its young and its vulnerable, and Aboriginal communities are no different. That is the point that this man is making. He says: It is time to get a true understanding of traditional Aboriginal Law. He goes on to say that their traditional approach is a real law system with parliaments, politicians, constitutions and acts of law. He says that their traditional law is not ‘customary law' and it obviously seeks to protect the young and the vulnerable. But he goes on: However, right now there is a sub-culture forming within Aboriginal communities that is violent and abusive. Unfortunately this sub-culture even believes that it is acting within “white fella” law of when being abusive. A thinking that began with the systemic undermining of our own law with the colonization of Australia and the atrocities that followed. It is now reinforced by TV, movies, pornography and drugs brought into our community from wider Australia. So while some incorrectly see our traditional … Law as barbaric and associate it with violence and abuse; the opposite is true, and those who have rejected traditional … Law have now become totally lawless, which they think is the new “white fella” way. We have to face the fact that we are responsible for a lot of the inappropriate socialisation that is happening in Aboriginal communities today. I believe that very strongly. We need to recognise that most of us would find abhorrent much of what is portrayed in those communities as being acceptable values in mainstream Western society, yet we need to recognise that it flows into a moral vacuum. I find that very concerning. I draw out of this that we must consult. We have got to draw alongside and spend a long time-or support those who spend the time and make the sacrifices-working alongside Aboriginal people. I do not want to denigrate those who have marched across bridges and what have you. I belong to that camp to some extent myself. I have mouthed a lot of platitudes. I have talked ‘knowingly' about what ought to be done. But the people who really deserve the support and need our support are those who make the sacrifices to spend the time to build the long-term relationships on the ground with Aboriginal people. It is patronising to pretend that we can do it all somehow from outside. This is going to be a real challenge. I all of us who have thought about it will find it very difficult. How do we engage? How do we really draw alongside these people who, in the end, as I have just portrayed, abhor violence and abuse just as much as we do? Richard Trudgen, who wrote the book Why Warriors Lie Down and Die, seems to be saying that the intellectual leaders of Aboriginal society have never really been engaged by our leaders; thus, Aboriginal leaders feel both patronised and marginalised. We have not been able to mediate across that line, and maybe in some communities we can no longer do it because that intellectual and moral leadership has gone. There is noone to mediate with. Yet we have to try. This is incredibly important, and Trudgen interestingly says that we have to learn to overcome our language difficulties, our communication difficulties. He makes the very powerful point, ‘The capacity to learn equals the educator's ability to teach.' I do not have much time, so I want to come to the second thing that gave me a real shock. As I mentioned, as Deputy PM it was my great privilege to be the patron minister for a community in the east Kimberleys. The eight Indigenous COAG trials were in many ways a very interesting set of communities for us to interact with. When I was Minister for Transport and Regional Services I had the Regional Women's Advisory Council-a great group of women. They used to meet with me regularly. There were a couple of Indigenous women leaders on it, and one day they said, ‘What we'd like to do is to get some money out of your department and pull together a few women from each of those eight Indigenous COAG trial site communities across Australia and get them into Alice Springs,' and they did that. They got a reasonable number of women there together, and they reckoned over the three or four days that they were there they had spent a couple think of days before any of the Aboriginal women were brave enough to really speak out. They had to establish trust. It was a laborious process. The stories that they did tell, though, were horrendous. I will never forget those women, who were aghast at what they had heard. One of them-an Aboriginal leader herself-said, ‘If we were applying decent standards of child protection, there are hardly any communities across Australia where you wouldn't remove the children.' I know how sensitive that is, but it was an Aboriginal woman who said it to me. That is a tragedy. And that is why I conclude-and I would love to talk much longer on this because I feel very passionately about it-by saying I think the minister is right. From what I learnt from those women and from my experiences across my own electorate, we have to do everything we can now to put in place the legal structures and the policing necessary to secure the safety of those men, those women and those children who are vulnerable so that we can start to effectively engage them on those very underlying issues that the mover of this motion, the member for Lingiari, wanted us to look at. We have to start with the policing. I am surprised to hear myself saying that, but I believe earnestly that it is right and that it is the priority and where we must begin.",56
115,Dr LAWRENCE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As the Queensland Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Women's Task Force on Violence concluded after a very comprehensive inquiry in 1999: The people who could have made a difference have failed to intervene to stop innocent women and children from being bashed, raped, mutilated and murdered and exposed to forms of violence that have been allowed to escalate to a level is now a national disgrace. That was the call to us from the Indigenous community leaders then. Seven years later, I am sorry to say it is still a national disgrace-indeed it is worse-and we all share responsibility for that state of affairs. There is no point trying to duck it, as the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs tried to do to some extent. I think he should spend a bit more time listening to the member for Gwydir, who seems to have a much better understanding of the complexity of these issues. Despite these cyclical moral panics with numerous reports, summits, tub-thumping editorials and a succession of shocked ministers, sustained action to address violence in Indigenous communities sadly has not yet been forthcoming, and that is what we are debating today. If the past is any guide-and I hope it is not-the moment the current media focus dims, as it inevitably will, the government will be tempted to go into Rip Van Winkle mode again, leaving the already damaged to fend for themselves. In fact, as we have heard, one of the first acts of this government was to cut $30 million allocated for the modest but promising Indigenous family violence prevention programs as part of the massive cuts to ATSIC's budget in 1996-97. What might now be reasonably called the ‘shocked minister syndrome' must be pretty galling to the many people who have contributed to those many reports and summits-and to the many people who work in this field and have for a long time been urging governments to act-that should have made it impossible for anyone in this place, and indeed in the whole community if they had had their eyes open, to be unaware of the truly dire circumstances in many communities throughout Australia. During the 10 years that this government has been in that power, the problem of child abuse and family violence has been examined and reported on many occasions. There is no excuse for ignorance, let alone inaction. There are at least 30 reports-which have been available since that time to any conscientious MP, let alone a minister-which deal in whole or in part with the factors which lead to such violence and which outline the policies which could assist to reduce the pain and suffering which are the daily bread of so many Indigenous people. The latest shocked minister, who expresses so much surprise at violence in Indigenous communities, has been in this parliament for the decade that the Howard government has been in office and is responsible for Indigenous Affairs. So forgive us if we are little critical that maybe this conversion is a decade too late! And although this minister has been on this planet for 45 years, he appears to have remained ignorant of the dire conditions in many Indigenous communities, although for a time he was the minister responsible for employment services and must have seen some of these problems. But despite his manifest lack of knowledge, he is not embarrassed to proffer instant solutions. As my mother used to say, ‘A little knowledge can be a dangerous thing.' As a previous speaker on our side indicated, it is important that the minister listen to the great many people, especially Indigenous people, who have put a lot of effort and thought into trying to solve these problems. Unfortunately, as we heard from the minister today, in the process of focusing on one area of law enforcement, he appears to be in the process of misdiagnosing the problems and denying his government has any responsibility for the state of affairs that he has so belatof edly discovered; it all has to be done to state and territory government law enforcement practices. I say to the minister that responsibility for Indigenous well-being is front and centre a Commonwealth responsibilityshared with the states, it is true, but constitutionally and unavoidably a Commonwealth responsibility. It is simply not good enough for the minister to seek to absolve the government by saying: Law and order and ... criminal justice ... have always been the responsibility of the states and territories. Yes, they are and those governments should ensure proper policing in Indigenous communities, enforcement of liquor licensing laws and child protection. They should ensure that the full force of the law falls on those who inflict serious violence and abuse children. I absolutely agree with that and I do not imagine that anyone in this parliament would not. I have said and written this before, as many other people have, and I underline it again: Indigenous communities have the right to enjoy the same peace and good order as any others in our nation. And there has been serious neglect of law enforcement in Indigenous communities. But surely the minister understands-or I hope he can be made to by his colleagues-that preventing violence and abuse in the first place must be the prime objective for this national government, that seriously tackling these problems needs more than just more police and more arrests-the Indigenous community have had plenty of those-and that dealing with abuse and violence needs a long-term strategy, as the government were clearly advised by their Overcoming Indigenous Disadvantage report of last year. The report concluded: Many Indigenous families and communities live under severe social strain due to a range of socio-economic factors. Alcohol and substance misuse, and overcrowded living conditions are just some the factors which can lead to child abuse and violence. That is direct advice to the government. I hope the minister will come to understand that making any progress will require acknowledgment, as the report also pointed out, that crime is strongly related to socio-economic disadvantage wherever it occurs. In Australia of all countries, knowing as we do the historical basis of European settlement although we might sometimes seek to deny it, we must acknowledge that if people are condemned to live lives of entrenched disadvantage, social breakdown, crime and violence will inevitably result in many cases. If the answer were really as simple as more and better law enforcement, we could all go home. What is needed is not just law enforcement, although that must be done, but dealing with the root causes which produce the elevated rates of crime and violence in the first place. A decade down the track, I ask the minister why his government has not followed up on the many promises that have already been held out to Indigenous Australians to act to reduce the levels of violence and sexual abuse in their communities. We all agree, or at least I think we do, that after decades of turning a blind eye to violence in Indigenous communities this violence can no longer be tolerated. It has been tolerated for far too long. We have to place the same value on the lives and security of Indigenous women, children and men as we do on those of the rest of the community. But the responses must be carefully designed: they have got to engage the Indigenous communities, they have to be based on evidence of where the problems are most severe and what intervention actually works and they have to be sustained-I underline this-not a reflex response born of the next shocked minister's panic. Threatening to close down remote communities by the stroke of a pen or to starve them of funds, which currently seems to be the preferred mode, is not a soluthe tion either, not least because research from my own state shows that the level of clinically significant emotional and behavioural difficulties amongst children is actually est in the most remote communities. The same study shows that alcohol consumption is much lower amongst the young people who live in those outermost communities than it is among those in metropolitan areas or areas surrounding agricultural and mining regions. And we do not need any more reports. As I have said in another place, there have already been so many that they could wallpaper this House and the Senate as well. There have been at least three major initiatives by this government which have apparently gone nowhere. Minister, sustained action is what is required. Don't wait for the media circus to move on and then disappear. It is going to require a lot of persistence. Minister, if progress is to be made in reducing violence and abuse in affected communities-and it is by no means all of them-then it is vital that there be a proper understanding of the causes of that violence. It is not good enough to simply address the consequences. I really need to stress this because, given some public utterances, the minister does not seem not to understand this. To understand is not to excuse. To understand is to arm yourself with the necessary tools to intervene successful. No-one is trying to justify the violence. People are simply trying to understand it by examining, for instance, the immediate precipitating causes, by looking at the situational factors, such as alcohol and substance abuse, unemployment and welfare dependency, and by looking at the underlying factors, including historical circumstances. They cannot be denied. After years of silence and shame about acknowledging the problem, Indigenous leaders decided more than a decade ago that only way to begin the process of reducing violence was to confront it directly. As they have done that, the least that we can do is support them. This shift in sentiment was lowdriven largely by women speaking out and refusing to countenance the devastating levels of abuse experienced in many communities. Minister, listen to those women, listen to the people who have been working on this problem for a very long time, sustain the action and you will get unqualified support from the members on this side.",59
116,Mr WAKELIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As one of the last speakers in this MPI debate I thank everybody for the wisdom they have tried to bring to a very difficult subject. To sum up in the time. I have and to offer added solutions is my challenge. Perhaps I can start with lawlessness. Will we overcome that just through tackling poverty and disadvantage? If only it were so simple that we could spend any money and overcome it. As the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs advised us, we have spent $3.3 billion per annum. Never has there been more money spent on the issue. The Four Corners program in a very straightforward and comprehensive way showed Australia of his the challenge that lies before us. As in the electorates of many of the previous speakers, my electorate has many Indigenous people; it includes the Pitjantjatjara lands, the Maralinga-Tjarutja lands. I have watched with despair and frustration the inability of our government to find appropriate solutions to these long standing issues. There have been COAG trials and additional police. Indigenous people are 2½ per cent of the population and the 25 per cent of the jail population, figures that we all know about. The member for Kingsford Smith asked: ‘How can a First World country allow people to live in these Third World conditions?' Yet, on the other side, over the last 12 months as chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs I have seen great improvements brought about by enlightened leadership. Looking at employment, one of our major corporates has been able to achieve in one operation a workforce in which 17 per cent of the workers are Indigenous people. They are quite optimistic that they will move that figure to 35 per cent over the next 10 years. But dealing with the issues of violence, lawlessness and the trashing of houses in order to allow a community to live in a civilised way is just beyond us. This week in the parliament Gary Johns, a former minister in this place, had the Minister for Education, Science and Training present to us, and launch in the community, a report entitled Aboriginal education: remote schools and the real economy. In his last three paragraphs in the conclusion Gary Johns says: Governments must decide if they want to sustain some of the pre-conditions which prevent children from succeeding in the education system. If education is an essential gateway to a satisfying life, impediments to achievement must be removed lest education be left carrying the weight of expectations far beyond its capacity to deliver. Policies which continue to treat Aboriginal culture differently, or play the cultural relativism game, will consign another generation of Aboriginal children to failure. A change in education policy, from one focused on the artificial economy to one based on the real economy will have consequences. Economic incentives focused on parents will hopefully bring about a change in educational achievement. These changes will have an effect on remote communities. Some of these communities will not survive. Governments will need to plan for the inhabitants of those remote communities. The drift of the population, to regional and urban centres, to find new work will create new adjustment challenges for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. The clear role of educators is to prepare children for the future, not the past. The future is an economic one and not necessarily in a remote community. This change in direction will attract reactionary criticism from those whose careers are based on extracting rents from the current regime. This criticism should be expected as a sign that the new direction is the right direction. The new policy direction must not apply different standards to Aboriginal children. It must fundamentally treat Aboriginal children as children. So that is the challenge presented to us by Gary Johns, and I thank him for that. I thank the minister for having the courage to address the issue and for the partnership that he is endeavouring to forge with the states and territories. We can offer something within the adversarial roles in this place if we can just learn a little from the past. The member for Gwydir talked about Richard Trudgen and the benefit of understanding, the benefit of establishing trust, the benefit of engaging and the benefit of building relationships. I agree with the member for Gwydir that we are collectively responsible for the inappropriate outcomes that have occurred, particularly over the last 30 years. We must secure the communities. We know that our federation creates great challenges in how we work with our partners in the states and territories. As the minister was at pains to say, it is not a criticism that will finger point and not give any outcome or result. There is money available for effective expenditure; it is about how we spend it. All the reports-and I am guilty of a few of them myself-are there. So, with an ounce of luck, and with goodwill from the Commonwealth and throughout our states and territories, there are great opportunities for us. There is no reason why we cannot have, in the future, Indigenous communities that are part of the total community in an equal way. But we must seek positive examples. Trudgen, tries to get us to understand-and he is but one person. Warren Mundine, Gary Johns and some in the media have made this their life's work as well. We have the mechanisms in front of us to solve these problems. In the employment area alone, very positive outcomes are available to us. There is no reason why we cannot have in this country the wit within the police, law enforcement, the courts and the Koori courts to address this issue in a way which will give Indigenous people far better outcomes than they currently have.",61
117,Mr KATTER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The worse form of praise is self-praise, but I am going to indulge in a bit of that. We have to look at success stories. The library tells me I was the longest serving Aboriginal affairs minister in Australian history-and I was only in the job for about seven years. I found an article that states:  Noel Pearsonduring his speech, also praised the work of troversial Queensland MP, Bob Katter.  Through the course of a deranged ministryhe was referring to the situation before I came inKatter dragged Indigenous affairs in Queensland into the 20th century. You would have to have lived and grown up on a Queensland reserve as I did to appreciate the huge changes he effected to rigid systems of state control over Aboriginal affairs that had hardly changed since the turn the century. He went on to say that I was one of the best Aboriginal affairs ministers. Father Frank Brennan-definitely no great flatterer of mine-said to the Courier Mail that ‘Bob Katter Jr, the new federal member for Kennedy, was the best government person he had ever dealt with in Aboriginal affairs when he was minister for Aboriginal affairs in the Queensland government'. I think that four Sixty Minutes stories were done on me and what we were doing in the department at that time-and they were all highly praiseworthy. This was an extraordinarily successful model. What was the magic formula we used? I have listened to previous speakers, and some of them are very good people. The member for Gwydir said we have to act to give these people a fair go. The essence of what he was saying seemed to be that policing was the area we had to look at. I do not mean to denigrate any of these people. Mr Fitzgerald, the person who destroyed the Queensland government, was paid a lot of money to disclose that the problem was alcohol. What his report essentially said was that, if alcohol were banned, the problems would be solved. It was a very deep and far-reaching intellectual achievement to tell them that alcohol was the problem! The member for Fremantle said we should listen to the people who work with them and con- know their problems. Quite frankly, from my experience, they are the last people I would listen to. The member for Grey said we should give them education. I do not really know why-and I am at a loss as to how you would give it to them. You cannot force children to go to school. Parents cannot force their children to do anything these days. If a kid does not want to go to school, I am at a loss as too how you can give them education. At Camooweal in my day we had two of wonderful teachers. One of them would go to the front of the Aboriginal community and the other would go to the back. When the kids flew out the back, he would grab them, throw them in the back of the kombi van and take them to school. That is how they got them to school. So, Member for Grey, how would you go about getting them to school? Are we going to belt them? We would then have them taken from us. I will continue on about how marvellous I am. George Mai was a legendary leader, and a great friend and mentor of Father Passi. In fact, Eddie Mabo was kicked out on the second day of the Mabo case and Father Passi, a man of towering integrity and presence, took his place. George Mai, a legendary leader for some 20 or 30 years in the Torres Strait, was kind enough to say I was the best minister he had ever worked with. What was the magic formula? I suppose I had the advantage of playing in football teams. If you look at my wall, you will see all the football teams there. I was brought up and mixed with Aboriginal children. Some of my best friends are Aboriginal. Last time. I watched a state of origin match, in Mount Isa, one of my good mates of Aboriginal descent was there. They taught me to ride a horse. They taught me a lot of what I knew about playing rugby league football. They taught me about mining as well. So I had an advantage, but that was not the reason. The reason was that the one thing nobody said was, ‘Please, for Heaven's sake, go out and listen to them.' This is nothing very complicated. When we went out there, I vividly remember a picture on my wall of Jackson Choicha and Eddie Holroyd at what is now Poomperau. I said, ‘Just tell us what you want.' They said, ‘We want selfmanagement.' I said, ‘Righto, you've got that; it's on its way. What else do you want?' They said, ‘We want to have a go at the cleanskins.' I said, ‘You're going to have to build yards. You can't do that on government land.' The government was not going to put out money to build yards on government land, so I told them they might need to take up some land. They said, ‘We can't do that.' So I said, ‘I'm the minister. If you want to take up land, take it up.' I did not know whether I could deliver, but I said that I could. One of the 60 Minutes segments was done on Jackson Choicha and Eddie Holroyd. We said, ‘From now on, you build your own homes totally.' In Queensland we got agreement that all houses would be built by Aboriginals and some 700 jobs were created out of nothing. Until then white contractors were building all of the houses in Queensland or we were buying existing houses. From now on every house would be built by exclusively black labour. This was not easy. I think there were at least a dozen sackings in my department. I went out and inspected site after site myself to enforce the decision that had been taken by the Aboriginal coordinating council in Queensland. Gerhard Pearson, Noel's brother, said, ‘Why can't we use the CDEP money?' That was started off by another Hopevale resident. Two 60 Minutes segments were done on the CDEP Work for the Dole program, which was commenced by a person of Aboriginal descent from Hopevale, home of Matty Bowen, the famous rugby league player. It was commenced by Greg and then Gerhard said, ‘Why can't we start using CDEP people to build the homes?' So we went from building three homes a year, and then Donnie Fraser at Doomadgee, another person of Aboriginal descent-these are people doing it themselves-said, ‘Can we get block-making machines?' So we bought seven or eight, and they did not cost a lot, only about $70,000 apiece. So they were building almost everything they needed. Apart from the fittings and the roofs, everything was being built at the Doomadgee and Hopevale sites. The entire cost of the houses-that $60 million or $70 million that we were spending each year in Queensland-suddenly was providing jobs for all of these people. With the cattle incentive, in the Aboriginal areas of Queensland we had mustered 1,874 head of cattle before these programs started. By 1985 we were mustering 4,285 head of cattle a year. In the Torres Strait, where the industry was fishing, they went from around $200,000 to $3 million a year-most of that was concentrated on Badu Island. There was an absolutely remarkable success story with cattle, and the reason was the government was running the whole fishery up there and the people of Torres Strait Islander descent could not run or own anything themselves. We came along and said, ‘What about the land?' They were given a choice about whether they wanted tribal ownership, land council ownership, local government ownership-because we were setting up local government-private ownership or a continuation of state government ownership. Surprise, surprise. They all said they wanted to own their own homes and farms themselves. I do not know of a single government in Australia that has delivered to the black people the simple right to own their own homes. Nobody has been up there to ask them, because the last time. I visited Yarrabah the chairman was banging his fist on the table and saying, ‘The only place in the world you can't own your own home is at Yarrabah.' They looked at me and I said, ‘Doomadgee, Palm Island-you name the place; you're not allowed to own your own home.' And this is in that 40 per cent of Australia that is owned by people of Aboriginal descent. The money that is handed out by the state and federal governments to these people because they are of Aboriginal descent works out to about $80,000 a family. I have to honestly say I do not see any of my blackfella mates driving around in Volvo motorcars. So where is the $80,000 going? It sure is not going into black pockets. Forty per cent of the surface area of Australia is owned by people of Aboriginal descent, but they cannot access it. They do not really own anything; it is tribal ownership. The initiative for them to build their own homes was abandoned; they are all back being built by contractors in Queensland and 700 jobs have gone up in smoke. Everything humanly possible has been done to smash that private ownership in the reserve areas of Queensland, including by the incoming ALP government, which took the right to private ownership-(Time expired)",63
118,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Order! The discussion is now concluded. NA NA BILL 2006 Second Reading Debate resumed from 20 May, on motion by Mr Vaile: That this bill be now read a second time.",65
119,Mr RUDD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"When it comes to the Australian Trade Commission Legislation Amendment Bill 2006 we have to ask ourselves a key question. We are dealing with exports, with Australia's economic future and with the future of Australian manufacturing itself, so what does our manufacturing industry require for the future? What does it say it needs? The Australian Industry Group quotes one Victorian manufacturer as saying: At a national level we need a business plan. We need a clear set of objectives so we know where we are going, where infrastructure is taken into account and the issues of developing people, getting good leadership, looking at the ways we can be smarter and finding niche markets are taken into account. This hits the nail on the head and it is to this that the Australian Labor Party is responding in our approach to a future manufacturing policy, plan and strategy for the country. We have no intention of standing idly by while Australian manufacturing sinks quietly below the waves. Labor has a plan to ensure that the manufacturing sector will be viable beyond the end of the resources boom-a plan to increase skills by abolishing TAFE fees for traditional trades; a plan to increase labour force participation through the provision of more child-care workers; a plan to facilitate exports through a coordinated approach to infrastructure through Infrastructure Australia. We also believe that a new approach is needed to boost Australian exports-an approach which focuses on all industries, not just resource related industries. Australia needs a new export strategy for the country, one which tackles the productivity challenge head-on across infrastructure, skills, R&D and innovation, one which maximises Australia's efforts to secure greater global market access through the current WTO round, one which reforms Australia's approach to export promotion through Austrade and one which implements concrete measures to create a better export culture right across the economy through practical assistance to Australian exporters. The bill that we debate today does not of itself address Australia's systemic export problems. It does not of itself address the systemic problems concerning our current account. It does not of itself address the problems that now arise with our staggering half-trillion dollar foreign debt. The opposition, however, will support this bill because it does provide for the administrative transition of the Australian Trade Commission from a statutory authority under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 to a statutory agency which will be part of the Commonwealth, subject to the Public Service Act 1999, and a prescribed agency under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997. One of the consequences of this bill is that, upon its proclamation, the role of a CEO will be established to replace the Austrade board. The Austrade board was established by the Hawke Labor government in 1985 for the very reason that it would bring the commercial acumen of the private sector into facilitating Austrade's trade performance. Labor recognise the valuable input that business and industry can provide to policy, and this is particularly important at a time when Australia's trade position has registered such bad numbers for the economy. We recognise that the legislation allows for the continued involvement of industry through the existing Free Trade Agreement Export Advisory Panel and the Trade Promotion Advisory Committee. Our concern, however, is that there will be no high-level input from business and industry leaders of the type that the current board structure provides. Our view, therefore, is that this question will need to be revisited under a future Labor government. We believe that business input is critical to Austrade's future success. We are prepared to support this bill because it nonetheless allows Austrade to become a statutory agency. It is for this reason that I now move the second reading amendment that has been circulated in my name: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes the bill will do little to correct Australia's trade balance which: (a) has been in deficit for four years (48 months); (b) recorded a total deficit of $18.7 billion in 2005; (c) is impacting on a record current account deficit of $55.1 billion; and (d) is contributing to Australia's debt of half a trillion dollars.”",65
120,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Edwards-I second the amendment.,67
121,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,I call the honourable member forMr Rudd-Fisher.,67
122,Mr SLIPPER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams. And I thank my friend the honourable member for Griffith for his assistance to you as to the name of my electorate. It is interesting, Mr Deputy Speaker: so many people from your electorate are moving to mine, I would have thought that you would have known where they were escaping to. I am pleased to be able to join the debate on the Australian Trade Commission Legislation Amendment Bill 2006. I listened carefully to the contribution made by the honourable member for Griffith. As always, it was thought provoking. Sadly, in this case it was not entirely on the subject of the legislation we are currently debating. His second reading amendment, as so often happens in the House of Representatives, seems to deal with issues other than the issues being dealt with by the Australian Trade Commission Legislation Amendment Bill 2006. Having said that, politics is politics. But I think it is important for all of us to appreciate that the desire of all governments is, or should be, the efficient provision of good services to those people they govern. It is widely recognised not only throughout Australia but indeed throughout the world that this government over the last 10 years has been responsible for sound economic management. We have brought about an enormous number of positive changes. We have repaid every last cent of government debt. We have brought the budget into surplus at a time when we have been able to reduce taxes and improve the quality of life record foreign of all Australians. It is important also for governments to always remember that, no matter what good a job is being done, the job is never finished. This government would be the last government to suggest that our good governance over the last 10 years means that there is no need any longer for more sound economic management in the future. Governments must always be wary that unwise spending decisions could ultimately have an adverse impact on the quality of life of residents. Mr John Uhrig AC is a person who is highly regarded. In earlier times he would have actually been a Knight of the Realm, because the award of Commander of the Order of Australia was supposed to replace knighthoods. So in 2002 we chose a person who is eminently well regarded in the community to conduct a review of the corporate governance of Commonwealth statutory authorities and office holders to determine whether any of the management operations could be improved or modified to ensure more efficient operations, thereby reducing costs and improving service delivery to the people. The review was known as the ‘Review of Corporate Governance of Commonwealth Statutory Authorities and Office Holders'-quite a mouthful, I am sure you will agree, Mr Deputy Speaker. But the name of the review summed up rather nicely what the review was all about. Mr Uhrig was also asked by the Australian government to utilise the review process to formulate suggestions about how things could be done better. He was asked to provide options to the government to get the most efficient results from the statutory bodies. The honourable member for Griffith, in his contribution, has outlined how the character of the Australian Trade Commission will alter in accordance with the recommendations of Mr Uhrig. Mr Uhrig also came back with a standard framework of good governance guidelines that the government could use for statutory bodies and then apply more widely to public sector organisations. As one would expect with a review of this nature, input was derived from a wide range of areas, including ministers of the Crown, office holders in statutory bodies, various departments, consumer groups and business organisations. This was not a review that the government arranged overnight. It was a genuine review whereby we consulted widely with the Australian community, because the purpose of this review was to ensure that we did have better governance when the recommendations of Mr Uhrig were handed down. Among Mr Uhrig's recommendations, it was decided that those statutory bodies that have a service provision role should be subject to the guidelines in the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997. The Australian Trade Commission Legislation Amendment Bill 2006 helps to introduce some of the amendments suggested by the review in how they relate to the Australian Trade Commission. The commission, known as Austrade, is a statutory body whose role is to assist Australian business to acquire more successfully overseas sales, thereby boosting our international earnings and ensuring a better quality of life for all Australians. Austrade-and I think this is accepted generally-have the expertise and the know how to assist in the international business arena and their experience can help greatly reduce the hurdles, risks, costs ties that would otherwise be faced by those operators eager to export to the world. I think most honourable members would have approaches from constituents from time to time who, having been successful locally in their business, are keen to spread their wings and export to the world. Often it is so difficult for a small business which has had a good idea and has successfully developed that idea to take that next step. That is one of the reasons why, under successive governments, Austrade has done a very good job. The Austrade mission is to contribute to community wealth by helping more Australians succeed in export and international business. It is a noble and niche service. This bill will enable the Australian Trade Commission to be transformed from a statutory authority, governed under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997, to a statutory agency administered through the Public Service Act 1999 and a prescribed agency under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997. Honourable members might be interested to know that there are around 170 Australian government statutory authorities and that they have all been subject to reviews under the provisions as suggested by Mr Uhrig's review. The Austrade changes are not the first to be implemented as a result of the review. Last October, changes were made to the operating frameworks of Medicare Australia, whereby the Medicare board has been dissolved and an executive management system has been introduced. Also, the recommendations by the review will lead to operational changes to the Australian Research Council, which will transform to a set-up of executive management similar to Austrade. The National Health and Medical Research Council will become an independent statutory body, but with the appointment of an and difficul- executive management. These changes are all designed to improve the efficiency of these bodies. As one would expect, some statutory bodies will not be changed as a result of the review. Honourable members may or may not be aware that these would include the Australian National Audit Office, the Australian Public Service Commission, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, the Commonwealth Ombudsman's office, Geoscience Australia, as well as the more visible bodies such as the Reserve Bank of Australia, AusAID and Australia Post. A number of other statutory bodies have had their operations assessed. The Australian Trade Commission Legislation Amendment Bill 2006, which is currently before the House, is part of this ongoing process of reform by the coalition, which, after 10 years of effective government, is not reformweary. We are continuing to do the job entrusted to us by the Australian people in successive elections from 1996 to 1998 to 2001 and 2004. The Australian Trade Commission Legislation Amendment Bill 2006 will help deliver greater efficiencies and greater accountability to Commonwealth statutory bodies. I am very pleased to commend the bill to the House and, in doing so, I place on the public record my opposition to the second reading amendment moved by the honourable member for Griffith.",67
123,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Australia's monthly trade deficit for March 2006 was $1.5 billion. This is the 48th monthly trade deficit in a row. This means that for four years now the value of Australia's exports has been exceeded by the value of our imports. By November 2004, Australia's trade deficit of $2.6 billion was the highest on record. It is a record that we have, regrettably, come close to equalling on a number of occasions since. For example, in February the monthly trade deficit reached $2.4 billion. Australia's annual trade deficit for the calendar year 2005 was close to $20 billion. These record trade deficits have tributed directly to record current account deficits. In the federal budget, the government forecasts export growth in 2007 of seven per cent. But it is an optimist of Olympian proportions who would set any store by that forecast. The government's record on export forecasts over the past five years has in fact been hopeless. In 2001, they forecast five per cent export growth; exports fell by 0.8 per cent. In 2002, they forecast six per cent export growth; exports fell, again, by 0.8 per cent. In 2003, they forecast export growth of six per cent-undeterred; exports grew by barely more than one per cent. In 2004, bloodied but unbowed, they forecast eight per cent export growth, whereas exports grew by only 2.5 per cent. In 2005, they forecast seven per cent export growth; again, exports grew by barely two per cent. So, over the past five years, the government have overforecast growth in exports by an average of 5½ percentage points every year. So, if we are lucky this year, we will get export growth rather than export falls. Continually forecasting six per cent, seven per cent or eight per cent growth is surely a triumph of hope over experience. The root cause of Australia's parlous external balance is Australia's recent performance on exports. If that external imbalance is not addressed, there is every potential that interest rates will suffer as a consequence. Rather than looking at a comprehensive solution to Australia's export problems, the government is focusing its attention squarely on the resources boom. There is no doubt that Australia should take advantage of its resource stocks to enhance its export performance, but we should not throw all of our eggs into the resources basket. The 2006-07 budget papers effectively hauled up the white flag on manufacturing exports. Budget Paper con- No. 1-Statement 3: Economic outlookstates: Other categories of exportsthat is, other than resourcesare forecast to pick up 2006-07, although they are unlikely to grow at the strong rates experienced in the 1990s. Exports of elaborately transformed manufactures are forecast to grow moderately over the next two years ... In fact, the total value of manufactured exports is now $2 billion less than it was at its peak in 2001. Such a performance is simply not good enough. Australian manufacturing exports were one of the great success stories of the 1980s and 1990s. Between 1986 and 1996 the volume of exports of elaborate manufactures increased by 13.9 per cent per annum, whereas between 1995 and 2000 they dipped to an annual average growth rate of 7.2 per cent. Manufacturing remains the largest sector in the economy, accounting for 13 per cent of value added activity, but as a share of the economy this is less than the 15 per cent of 10 years ago and the 18 per cent of 20 years ago. It also does not compare well with other developed countries. The manufacturing sector accounts for 20 per cent of GDP in Italy, 19 per cent in New Zealand and 17 per cent in the United Kingdom. In 2004-05, Australia's manufacturing trade deficit was $87.5 billion. This is unsustainable in the long term. Of course, there are external factors which have impacted on the manufacturing sector. The average OECD country has lost six percentage points of global market share over the past five years, but over the same period Australia's share has declined by three times this amount. The question is: with all our eggs in the resource basket, who will be our exporters once the boom is over and what should we do in the meantime to ensure that these industries do not collapse? This is the question the government should be asking itself. Once the resources boom is over, what will be left of our manufacturing industry, an industry we are going to rely on to fill a gap created by a slowing resources sector? While it is clear that across-the-board tariffs are not the solution, there is a role that government can play in smoothing out the economic cycle. In an editorial last year, the Australian Financial Review argued that there was a role for government in ensuring a balance between industry sectors in the economy. It said: Industry policy has moved a long way since manufacturing was equated with high levels of industry protection. But now there is a need to do more than simply leave manufacturing to its own devices-as long as we follow the incentive route and do not revert to protection. Labor is not talking about tariffs or massive industry subsidies and nor is industry. We are, however, about listening to what industry needs to survive-and what does the manufacturing industry say it needs? The Australian Industry Group quotes one Victorian manufacturer as saying: At a national level we need a business plan. We need a clear set of objectives so we know where we're going, where infrastructure is taken into account and the issues of developing people, getting good leadership, looking at ways we can be smarter and finding niche markets are taken into account. This is the sort of thing government ought to be listening to to address the trade deficit. Unfortunately, the Howard government is not listening. The fact is that we cannot simply abandon the manufacturing sector. We cannot haul up the white flag on the largest employer in the country. We cannot just wait for the resources boom to end and leave a devastated manufacturing sector to try to fill the gap. Labor believes that the manufacturing sector needs to be viable beyond the end of the resources boom. We have a plan to increase skills by abolishing TAFE fees for traditional trades, a plan to increase labour force participation through the provision of more child-care workers and a plan to facilitate exports through a coordinated approach to infrastructure through Infrastructure Australia. We believe that a new approach is needed to boost Australian exports, an approach which focuses on all industries, not just resources. A new national export strategy should tackle the productivity challenge head-on across the infrastructure skills and R&D sectors, maximise Australia's efforts to secure greater global market access through the current WTO round, reform Australia's approach to export promotion through Austrade and implement concrete messages to create a better export culture across the economy through practical assistance to exporters. This bill will not address Australia's temic export and current account problems. We will support it. However, what it does is to provide for the transition of the Australian Trade Commission from a statutory authority under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 to a statutory agency which will be part of the Commonwealth subject to the Public Service Act 1999 and a prescribed agency under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997. The member for Griffith has raised concerns over one of the consequences of this bill-that is, upon its proclamation the role of the CEO will be established to replace the Austrade board. As he points out, the Austrade board was established by the Hawke Labor government in 1985 for the very reason that it would bring the commercial acumen of the private sector into facilitating Australia's trade performance. The Labor Party recognises the valuable input that business and industry can provide to policy, which is particularly important at a time when Australia's trade position is in such a parlous state. It is somewhat ironic that the party that holds itself as the champion of free enterprise has taken it upon itself to reduce the level of private sector involvement in facilitating Australia's trade performance. The legislation does allow for the continued involvement of industry through the existing Free Trade Agreement Export Advisory Panel and Trade Promotion Advisory Committee. However, there will be no highlevel input from business and industry leaders that the current board structure provides. The bill implements the executive management corporate governance model, as per Mr John Uhrig's Review of Corporate Governance of Statutory Authorities and Office Holders. The Australian Trade Commission Act 1985 established the Australian Trade Commission and defined the organisation's sys- structure and operational framework. This bill is intended to enact revised governance arrangements in the enabling legislation. The changes, according to the explanatory memorandum, will improve governance and accountability in the Australian Trade Commission-and I certainly hope it will. The recent AWB scandal has raised several serious governance and accountability questions for the Australian Trade Commission and, so far, we are yet to hear answers to these questions. Austrade has been peculiarly silent about AWB providing hundreds of millions of dollars in kickbacks to Saddam Hussein. The fact is that Austrade, the Australian Trade Commission, was one of many government agencies that were aware of substantive information about the link between Alia, AWB, Saddam Hussein and the coordinated subversion of the UN's oil for food program. Austrade continues to be responsible for assisting Australian firms to develop export markets and international business. But, in light of its silence about information concerning Australian traders breaking laws and subverting international conventions, its understanding of its responsibilities appears to be limited. It kept quiet-or at least its cerns and the information it was privy to was kept quiet. This bill was an opportunity for the Trade Commission to have been given an explicit directive to uphold Australian law in matters concerning international trade. The bill was an opportunity for the Trade Commission to be given an explicit directive to uphold Australia's reputation in matters concerning international trade. Had the Trade Commission done so in recent years, perhaps the trade sanctions put in place by the United Nations would have worked more effectively. Perhaps-instead of propping Saddam Hussein up-enforcing trade sanctions would have weakened him, lessened the threat that he posed and negated the need felt by the coalition of the willing to invade Iraq. Perhaps tens of thousands of men, women and children would still be alive today. Perhaps tens of thousands more would not be suffering as they are today. What could Austrade have done? It could have made inquiries. It could have taken some responsibility. It could have reported to the government upon the results of its inquiries. I will give the House a couple of examples of what I am thinking of and two incidents where Austrade had the opportunity to do the right thing spring to mind. First, there was Alistair Nicholas, Austrade's commissioner in Washington in 2000, who said in his statement to the Cole inquiry that he was approached by Ms Felicity Johnston of the UN oil for food program in early 2000. She told him that the UN oil for food program had raised concerns about AWB's kickbacks with Australia's mission to the UN but that they still did not have an answer from that mission. This was an appeal by the UN oil for food program, as far back as 2000, to another arm of the Howard government, at a time when few kickbacks had been paid, and much of the scandal could have been con- averted. Alistair Nicholas then raised the issue with AWB executive Tim Snowball, who assured him that there were no irregularities. Let me quote what Tim Snowball wrote back to Mark Emons, the AWB Middle East section chief, about the matter: Alistair mentioned that someone at the UN was asking him quietly/informally about payments AWB was making to Iraq for discharge/trucking ... We played down the issue and said we would look at the UN request. We do not want Alistair sticking his nose into our Iraq business and causing us problems ... What a disgraceful response from AWB. Commissioner Alistair Nicholas was apparently not entirely convinced by Tim Snowball's assurances, because in late 2000 he sent a cable back to Canberra saying: ... AWB do not understand the seriousness nor the urgency of this matter. It may be necessary to advise the Minister of the situation. But it would seem that Alistair Nicholas did not ultimately ‘stick his nose in' and Austrade elected not to cause any problemswhich is a shame. Austrade could have done more to avert this scandal. Austrade had further information about these kickbacks that, had it been operating under more explicit legislation, represented at least one other opportunity to do the right thing. In 2003, Ayman Ayyash was Austrade's manager in Jordan, where he helped secure, among other deals, wheat deals for AWB. General Manager of Alia, Othman Al Absi, told the ABC's 7.30 Report in April this year that he knew Ayman Ayyash and that he had known him since at least 2000. They had all been to parties at the Australian ambassador's residence in Amman, Jordan. He went on to say that Austrade's Ayman Ayyash also knew the Chairman of Alia, Sheikh Hussein alKhawam. Mr Billson- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The speaker has been good in mentioning the bill occasionally, but could you encourage him now to refer to the bill?",69
124,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,Does the honourable member have a point of order? Mr Billson-My point of order goes to relevance to the bill.,73
125,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,I ask the honourable member for Wills to address the bill.,73
126,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Thank you,",73
127,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I am. The changes, according to the explanatory memorandum, will improve governance and accountability in the Australian Trade Commission. I am pointing to the need for this to be done am speaking in support of the opposition's amendment. Othman Al Absi also told the 7.30 Report that Austrade's Ayman Ayyash kept in touch with them all ‘so many times'. I wonder what about? The Australian public has a right to know. Why would an Austrade official who was in the business of selling wheat talk ‘so many times' and ‘party' with the chairman and general manager of a kickback receipt company? So far neither Austrade nor the Australian government has provided anything like a satisfactory response. Here again was an opportunity for Austrade to have asked a pointy question or two: did Austrade know that Alia was 49 per cent owned by Saddam Hussein and that all the kickbacks were going straight back to Saddam's treasury? This is something the Australian public has a right to know about. Unfortunately, in February this year, during the last round of Senate estimates hearings, Senator Coonan chose to gag Austrade officials appearing before the committee. The government's contempt for parliamentary democracy took another leap, and public servants working at Austrade were gagged. They were not permitted to speak about AWB. So we really have no way of knowing. The Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Trade have repeatedly claimed that they are being open and transparent about the ‘wheat for weapons' scandal, so why is it that we cannot ask Austrade in Senate estimates about what they know? We want to know about the role of Australia's man in Jordan, Ayman Ayyash. Just what were his dealings with Alia? Just what did he know about AWB kickbacks? The Cole inquiry's terms of reference do not call for an assessment of what Austrade did or did not know, or did or did not do. The government has made sure the Cole inquiry and I protected them from such important questions. The government claims it is being honest and transparent about the AWB scandal, but it has not given the Cole commission any terms of reference to inquire into the conduct of Austrade, much less government ministers themselves. Nor will it allow senators to question Austrade officials about the AWB scandal as part of normal Senate estimates processes. This is a government which claimed it would not abuse its Senate majority. What a joke. This bill claims it will improve the corporate governance and accountability of Austrade. I say that nothing would sharpen the sense of corporate governance and accountability quite like a couple of sessions in front of Senate estimates committees. In closing, I refer to the current wheat deal. A transparent and accountable Austrade might even be able to give us a full account of what has happened to our on-again, offagain wheat deal with Iraq. We had the trade minister saying today that it is going to be secured. The question is: just how much is Iraq going to pay Australian farmers for 350,000 tonnes of wheat? Hard-working wheat farmers deserve to know where they stand and certainly deserve a transparent and accountable Trade Commission. I encourage the House to support the amendment.",73
128,Mr JOHNSON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I am pleased, as always, to speak in the parliament on a piece of legislation being promoted by the Howard government-the Australian Trade Commission Legislation Amendment Bill 2006. I have also had the opportunity to hear the member for Wills speak on this matter-another occasion where I have heard a great deal of diatribe from the member for Wills. I have had the opportunity of following him in the parliament on a couple of occasions and it never ceases to amaze me the extent to which the shadow minister, the member for Wills, engages in remarkable muckraking. I am not sure if he is selfappointed or whether he has been appointed by the opposition as the opposition's muckraker, but little of what he had to say was of substance or about the bill. All those in the parliament who know the member for Gwydir will be horrified at the remarks of the member for Wills and his attacks on the integrity and the probity of one of the most decent men who has given of his time to the national interest of the parliament. I repudiate the attacks that the member for Wills has engaged in today and on previous occasions against the member for Gwydir, the former Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anderson. As a member of parliament and a member of the Howard government-I am in my second term in office, sharing in the victories the Howard government-I am pleased to speak on this important bill. It is important because it makes significant changes to the government's structure of the Australian Trade Commission, or Austrade. It brings about some key reforms to the management structure of Austrade that will make that important government agency more efficient and more productive in the overall architecture of the Howard government's trade policies. As a statutory authority under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997, Austrade is governed by a board whose members are drawn from business and government. It reports directly to the Minister for Trade. The current bill intends to transition Austrade from a statutory authority under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 to a statutory agency subject to the Public Service Act 1999 and the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997. This transition comes through as part of the government's response to the Review of Corporate Governance of Statutory Authorities and Office Holders-also known as the Uhrig review, after John Uhrig AC. The Uhrig review recommended that two templates be applied to ensure good governance of statutory authorities. Agencies should be managed either by a chief executive officer or by a board structure. Both templates detail measures for ensuring the boundaries of responsibilities are better understood and the relationship between Australian government authorities, ministers and portfolio departments are made clear. The Uhrig report recommended that the selection of the management template and financial frameworks to be applied should be based on the governance characteristics of a statutory authority. In general, agencies that excluof sively manage Commonwealth appropriations should be represented and governed by a CEO. A board structure is favoured if there is a strong commercial focus to the organisation or if the agency is intergovernmental. Austrade is currently governed by a board and is subject to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997. Under the amendments proposed in the bill, the Austrade board will be replaced by a CEO, who will be appointed by the minister. The governing act will change from the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 to the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997, and staff will be employed under the Public Service Act 1999. In short, this change comes about essentially because the government has concluded that an executive management template is more suitable to Austrade's role as the Australian government's premier trade facilitation agency. Members of the House will be aware that Austrade is the Australian government's statutory authority, responsible for helping Australian businesses to succeed in exports and the international business arena. It does this through the provision of advice, market intelligence and ongoing support to Australian businesses preparing, commencing and undertaking export activity. Austrade maintains 17 offices and 52 TradeStart offices across Australia and a network across the globe that includes some 130 offices in more than 60 countries. Its most fundamental role is to act as a bridge between the Australian exporter and a potential international partner. As part role, Austrade provides mentoring, information seminars and training in export related activity. Austrade officials have a fine reputation for identifying export opportunities and potential partners, and provide incountry advice and support from advocacy and research to facilitation and translation services. Austrade also administers the Export Market Development Grants Scheme, the EMDG Scheme, which provides partial reimbursement of approved marketing expenses in export activity. Another unheralded role that Austrade fulfil is the role of fostering and encouraging a culture of exporting and trade in the Australian business community. For this reason alone, I am a big fan of Austrade. For their overall contribution to Australian exporters and the Australian export industry, I put on record my very strong support and encouragement for our Austrade officials both in Australia and throughout the world. In today's very competitive world it is vital that Australia develops the business culture of looking abroad for commercial opportunities. We have a history of innovation and entrepreneurship in this country that quite frankly is second to none. We must do all we can as a government to support and encourage greater innovation and entrepreneurship on the back of what we already have. Clearly Austrade has a critical role to play in how Australia promotes trade in goods and services to the world. We all know that the Australian economy today is experiencing remarkable activity, growth and strength. A few weeks ago the Treasurer delivered his 9th budget surplus out of 11 budgets, and there will be a cash surplus of some $10.8 billion. Unlike the state Labor governments, all of which are likely to be delivering budget deficits in the weeks ahead, the Commonwealth has no of this foreign debt. The Commonwealth government does not have any debt whatsoever. I have heard previous speakers in the parliament, particularly the shadow minister for foreign affairs, the member for Griffith, talk about the half a trillion dollar debt. Quite frankly, he should know better. He should know that that is private sector debt. It is not debt owed by the Commonwealth. This economy is a trillion dollar economy. It is a trillion dollar economy because of the strong leadership of the Howard government and the strong stewardship that the Treasurer has demonstrated in his role in the past 10 years. The furphy that the opposition keep putting out that the government somehow has its hands in debt needs to be addressed and addressed very quickly by members of the government, because quite frankly they are again trying to mislead the Australian public. I want to say again that whatever debt there is in the country is private sector debt; it is not debt owed by the government of Australia. This confusion from members of the opposition is unwarranted in the eyes of the Australian community, and I think they will be held to account. More members of the opposition should come clean on that. I notice that it is only one or two of them who go down the path of misleading the Australian community about the so-called half a trillion dollar debt. The $28 billion that tas is expending on aircraft purchases is an example I can give the parliament and those who may be listening of a private company buying overseas made products. That is separate from any expenditure that the Australian government might engage in. That is a very good example of how the opposition is wrong when it talks about a half a trillion dollar government debt. In the 10 years during which the Howard government has been in office the Australian economy has grown by an average of 3.5 per cent. By comparison, Japan has had four recessions, Singapore has had three recessions, Hong Kong has had three recessions, Taiwan has had two recessions, Korea has had a recession, and the United States went into recession in 2001. At the time of the Asian financial crisis in 1996-97, when this government came into office, we were very strong in helping the Asian economies when they needed a friend. Australia can be very proud of the contribution it made to the economies of Asia when they were desperately in need of a good neighbour. It certainly makes a mockery of the description attributed to the former Prime Minister of Singapore, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, that Australia was in danger of becoming so-called ‘poor white trash'. Notwithstanding our good relations and good friendship with Singapore, I think today's economy stands in stark contrast to the sentiments behind that unfortunate comment. In relation to Australia's trade figures, I have heard members of the opposition again try to confuse and mislead the Australian public. The Australian trade figures represent just how healthy the Australian economy really is. Australia's total trade in goods and services continued to grow steadily last year, rising to $373 billion, representing a 12 per cent increase in total exports. The latest official publication from DFAT has some very good news for Australian exporters and inQandeed for all Australians who have a strong interest in our prosperity and our growth. The report tells us that in 2005 our 30,000plus exporters achieved their best-ever year in sales. The value of exports of goods and services rose some 15 per cent in 2005, to $177 billion. Japan remains our largest merchandise export market, accounting for 20 per cent of exports, which are valued at some $28.4 billion. China remains our second largest export market, accounting for $16.1 billion. South Korea is our third largest export market, at some $10.9 billion. If anyone needs to be persuaded of the importance of trade to this country, let me give a very compelling reason. We are of course a trading nation. Trade affects our standard of living. Trade affects our job market. One in five jobs in this country rest on the success and prosperity of our exporting companies. In rural Australia, one in four jobs depends upon the stability, continuity and growth of our exports. I remind anybody who thinks that trade is not important to this economy of those very important figuresthat is, one in five jobs in this country depends upon successful exporters, and in rural and regional parts of Australia that figure is one in four. In the last 10 years 1.7 million jobs have been created in Australia. Our unemployment level is at a three-decade low of five per cent. Many of my fellow Australians will not need reminding that under the Keating Labor government unemployment levels were into double digit figures. I am sure many of them will remember the horror days of being unable to find a job, being unable to secure employment, because of the shocking economic management of this country by the Keating Labor government. If anyone thinks that the economy today is in good shape simply due to good chance or good luck then they ought to reconsider. These sorts of things do not happen by good luck or goodwill. They happen through very strong policies of the government of the day. This government can be very proud of the policies that it has implemented to bring about job growth and a strong economy. The business of government, as I like to remind small businesses of the Ryan electorate, which I have the great privilege of senting, is to try and create the environment and the climate in which businesses can get on with doing what they are best at doingthat is, finding purchasers for their products, finding customers for their products and creating jobs for their local communities. The business of government is to get out of the way of businesses, to allow businesses to do what they do best. They do not want the heavy hand of any government. They want minimal intervention, minimal interference by governments, and that is how they are able to prosper in the community. This is the Howard government's view. This is the policy of the government and this is our practice. It is little wonder that the Howard government are seen as the best friend of the workers of Australia. The last four elections are evidence of that. I think it is important that we remind the Australian community that there was a time when unemployment in this country was at double digit levels. While I am on my feet talking about the strength of Australian businesses and the Australian economy, I think it is important also to make some general remarks about the international economy. Of course, Australian businesses in this country cannot conduct their operations in isolation of what takes place in other parts of the world. Whether we like it or not-whether Australian businesses like it or not and whether the government likes it or not-we do operate and exist in an international environment, where the policies of other governments and other companies can have a significant impact on the viability of our own businesses. We live in such an integrated, interdependent and interconnected world that we cannot pretend that external forces and external dynamics are not relevant to the success of Australian enterprises and Australian companies. This state of affairs, of very strong economic integration, interdependence and inrepreterconnectedness, is often referred to as globalisation. One of the most powerful reasons for this deep integration, interconnectedness and interdependence-or the so called globalised world-is the depth and the nature of technology. Technology really has transformed our world in the last few decades, particularly in the last 15 or 20 years. Some people would have us believe that globalisation is a relatively new thing and that it is also an evil thing. Those who hold this view are wrong on both counts. Globalisation is neither a new phenomenon nor an evil thing. The world was globalised in ancient times when the Romans and the Greeks sailed beyond their shores to conquer new lands. The world is globalised today in the same way. The only difference is in the characteristics of that globalisation. The world may think it can escape globalisation; it cannot. What is intrinsically different today is how that globalisation is manifested. Globalisation today is characterised not so much by sailboats but by jet planes and supercomputers. The instantaneous nature of transactions and the flow of funds and services that connect our world in such an unprecedented fashion are the hallmarks of today's global economy. No longer does the international exchange of goods or services take weeks or months, as it did in previous decades or centuries. Now it takes only moments-or not even moments but split milliseconds. That is the defining characteristic of our modern, 21st century world. The other things that the critics would have us believe about globalisation is that it is a terrible thing and that it is evil. I strongly disagree with that. Perhaps it could even be said that there is not enough globalisation in the world today. The problem is not that there is too much globalisation but that there is far too little globalisation. I say that because I am a very firm believer that globalisation is the vehicle by which prosperity and trade can reach people who are actually outside the international economy. Globalisation brings these people back into the economy. It gives them a chance to get a job. It gives them a chance of hope and of employment that they would not otherwise have. One feature of our global world is the increasing number international trade agreements that are being concluded. I want to end my remarks by very quickly talking about the free trade agreements that we have with Singapore, Thailand and the US. We are also in the process of negotiating free trade agreements with the United Arab Emirates and China. When completed, both of these agreements will open up to Australian businesses greater markets in all kinds of areas. Our UAE agreement will give us a unique platform into the increasingly significant, prosperous and growing Middle East market. The other, with China, will aim to provide us with access previously off limits to the most populous nation on earth and the third largest economy in the world. China's entry into the WTO in December 2001 and its reemergence in the international global trading regime will continue to have a profound impact on the fabric of international economics. I am pleased, as a member of the Howard government, to strongly support our respective negotiators in trying to bring about an agreement that will advance the cause of Australian exporters and Australian businesses. I want to also end my remarks by continuing to encourage those involved in the Doha Round of negotiations to stick at it, to persevere. Nothing could be more fundamentally important to aiding the developing world than concluding the Doha Round and opening up the agriculture sectors of the European economies and the European nations, and those of some of our Asian friends, to the trade that the developing countries so desperately need. A cow in the European Union typically receives a government subsidy of $US2.20 a day. This is untenable. (Time expired)",74
129,Mr MCMULLAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I rise, as other opposition members have, not to oppose the Australian Trade Commission Legislation Amendment Bill 2006 but to express my strong reservations about some of the changes that it is making. In the course of that I want to talk broadly about what I think it is a serious trade problem for Australia, so I start by responding to just a couple of the points made by the previous speaker, the member for Ryan. I will not waste much of my time with it, because it was essentially banality dressed up as profundity. There are two things I want to refer to. One is the claim that somehow or other our export performance recently has been terrific based on the value of exports of goods and services. That is simply a reflection of the fact that there a boom in resource prices. When you look at the volume of exports, you see that we continue to have a serious crisis, reflected in massive and unsustainable current account deficit. That leads me to the point of the foreign debt, which is in essence an accumulation of our current account deficits. When the then conservative opposition, led by the member for Bennelong and the now Treasurer, were complaining and running the debt truck around the country in 1996, the numbers they had up on the side of that debt truck were not for government debt; they were for foreign debt. When the then shadow Treasurer, the now Treasurer, spoke about having a ‘cold anger' about the level of debt, he was not talking about government debt; he was talking about foreign debt. It cannot be a crisis in 1996 and okay in 2006. Either it was a bogus problem then or it is a real problem now. I suspect that it is a real problem now. I do not oppose this legislation, simply because the government has the right to put in place the governance structures for agencies under its responsibility that it chooses. These are not changes that are irrevocable. If they prove, as I suspect they will, not to be improvements in the operation of Austrade, it will be possible for an incoming government to change them. It is not appropriate, in my view, to actually seek to defeat this legislation. The government should be able to manage its arrangements for structural reform of governance in the way that it chooses. But can I make it very clear that I disagree strongly with what is being proposed. I particularly disagree with the proposal to abolish the board of Austrade. I am singularly unimpressed overall with the Uhrig review about governance in the public sector. I think it is an inappropriate application of reasonably old-fashioned private sector principles and an attempt to extrapolate them to public is sector circumstances. I will come back to that. I have a very high regard for Austrade and the for the work that it does, particularly for those people based overseas who represent Austrade in posts around the world. It builds on the basis of the long standing Australian Trade Commissioner Service, which had and retains under Austrade a wonderful esprit de corps and which makes a continuing contribution to assisting Australian exporters either begin exporting, break into new markets or sell new products into those markets. The Trade Commissioner Service was revamped as Austrade by the then trade minister, John Dawkins, and I think it has been strengthened since that time by that enhancement. One aspect of that enhancement was the establishment of the board. I think it is a great pity that it is going to be abolished, and I will come back to that. I want to reiterate that I think it is a step backwards, not forwards; it is the inappropriate application of out-of-date principles in the private sector to the public sector. Why does it concern me if I am here saying, ‘The government should be able to make the administrative arrangements it chooses, even when I disagree with them,' which is my view? What is the issue? The issue is that we have a very profound trade crisis in this country. We have a serious current account deficit and ballooning foreign debt, even at a time of record export prices. When other developed countries that have resource based economies are running up trade surpluses, we are running up trade deficits-a serious, substantial, continuing, increasing trade deficit. It ought to be a cause of serious concern to us that that is continuing. It is because of failure of export volumes, and most particularly a failure in our export volumes with regard to manufactures and services, that Austrade does best. It is therefore the size and the shape of the export sis that gives me concern. There is the size it: we are running an unsustainable current account deficit of six-plus per cent of GDP. Recently there have been very interesting submissions to and analysis by a Senate committee indicating the extent to which there will inevitably be an adjustment. When you run an unsustainable current account deficit, at some point there is an adjustment. The question is whether it is sharp and painful or slow and gradual. The longer it lasts and the bigger it gets, the higher the probability that the adjustment will be painful. It is the size of the export crisis that causes me concern, but it is also the shape of it, because our trade performance is moving back to the quarry and farm export performance of the sixties and seventies and losing the momentum of increased exports of manufactures and services, which was the strength of our economy through the eighties and nineties. We transformed the Australian economy to one that was a successful exporter of manufactures and services in the eighties the nineties, and we are taking a liberate, conscious, strategic set of changes that is leading us back. Most of the changes that need to be made to solve that current account deficit do not relate to this bill and do not relate to Austrade; they are about domestic productivity and international trade policy. They are broad parameters. But there are two aspects that I want to refer to that relate particularly to Austrade. One of them relates to the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. I will not speak at length about that, because we debated the Export Market Development Grants Scheme bill in the Main Committee recently and I outlined my views there. I simply think that that very successful, very worthwhile scheme is now a bit tired and needs a revamp. It needs to be enhanced and reformed and, while I support the extension cri- of the existing scheme because there is no of reform proposal on the table, we do need some sort of support for exporters to move into those new markets. The Export Market Development Grants Scheme has been reviewed and the indications are that it is successful. I think we need to modernise it, revamp it and enhance it. But I also think that we need to look at some aspects of Austrade, our very successful Australian overseas trade promotion support service, which many countries around the world look upon with envy. Its long-term success is important to Australia, as having a more export focused economy is not just good because it enhances trade performance and is likely to reduce the current account deficit; an open trading economy with more focus on exports adds a productivity spur. It enhances the activity of the domestic economy, because individual firms that export tend therefore to be more efficient performers in the Australian market. Companies that have to innovate, reform and become more efficient to compete internationally provide better de- services domestically. More exporters, more exports and an enhanced export focus and export culture add a productivity spur. For those reasons, this general question of how we should structure our trade support and what the shape of Austrade should be is an important part of a broad program of measures that need to be undertaken to do something about the current account deficit. I want to come back to that which most directly relates to the bill: my profound disagreement with the proposition that we should abolish the board of Austrade. I start with my problems with the Uhrig report. From the time the report was sought, it seemed to me simply to be an exercise to fulfil an obsession of the Prime Minister with getting rid of statutory authorities. Sometimes I agree with getting rid of them and sometimes I do not, but as a prime ministerial obsession-and this was merely a backdoor way of achieving it-I think this is an example, and not the only example, of an inappropriate application of that principle. I saw recently an interesting review by Minter Ellison expressing concern in a report titled Implementing the Uhrig templates-a time to pause and get it right. It states: The abolition of boards or statutory authorities that fit the Uhrig Executive Management Template, on the grounds that it necessarily delivers better governance is rather simplistic. The abolition of these boards will produce differMinister ent governance challenges certainly, but whether the outcome is better will depend on more than a mere change to the model. That is a neat and forthright expression by Minter Ellison, not one of Australia's more radical law firms. It is not an attack on the government; it is some governance experts looking at what, in my view, is a flawed template applied inappropriately to Austrade. I want to conclude my remarks with the argument as to why Austrade needs a board. It seems to me that the recently announced decision to abolish the board of Austrade, which we are, in effect, implementing with this legislation, is extraordinarily silly and will almost certainly be counterproductive to Australia's desperate need to improve its export performance, particularly in manufactured goods and services. It is a decision that reflects the triumph of ideology over analysis. The general idea of reviewing the proliferation of boards and agencies and their governance is reasonable. It is clear that some agencies have grown beyond reasonable justification or outlived their usefulness. Some others would be more appropriately brought under more direct ministerial control. But Austrade does not fit into either category. Over the years, Austrade's board has enhanced both the effectiveness and the credibility of the organisation. The government has apparently based its decision to abolish the Austrade board on an application of the recommendations of the Uhrig review. This review, unfortunately, is a very weak basis on which to make such an important decision. Some of the decisions arising from the Uhrig review have probably been justified. But the Prime Minister has got it wrong this time. It appears that the Minister for Trade thinks so too. After all, he was Acting Prime at the time the announcement which directly affected his portfolio was made and yet the Minister for Trade, the then Acting Prime Minister, chose not to make the announcement himself, allowing the finance minister to make it on behalf of the government. If the trade minister did not disagree, he should have. While there are many causes of our current appallingly bad export performance, there is no doubt that our weak performance in the competitive sectors in which Austrade specialises is one of them. We should be strengthening it, not weakening it. In my experience as trade minister and as a consequence of my subsequent ongoing interest in our trade performance, I have observed the fact that the board of Austrade has often added a commercial awareness, a market focus and a business credibility to Austrade's very important activities to assist and encourage Australian firms to export or to export more successfully. Many prominent Australian business men and women have given significant amounts of their valuable time to the task of providing leadership and advice to Austrade because they considered it a useful contribution to the national interest in general and to the interests of Australian business in particular, and they were right. Many of these men and women who contributed their time were hard-headed and astute businesspeople. I was always confident that, if they felt that they were not making a useful contribution to Austrade's activities, they would have made that view plain and put their valuable time to better use. I remember in particular the contribution of the late Robert Johnson, then CEO of Toyota in Australia, Alan Jackson, one of Australia's most successful manufacturers, and Grant Latter, then head of Pacific Foods. In discussions with these three men it was clear to me that, in their experience, the business input into the development and implementation of Austrade's plans were seen as a valuable contribution. Whatever the performance of the current board of Austradeand I am not in a position to judge that-a good independent board is important to the success and strength of the organisation because it can bring a perspective which is not Public Service focused and which is independent of schemes dreamt up in ministerial offices or departments. Such a board can drive a focus on the contemporary needs of the new and expanding exporters we most desperately need. The most worrying aspect of the proposed changes is the trend that will inevitably emerge for Austrade to be drawn into the culture of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. DFAT is a fine policy agency which serves Australia well, but it is not well suited to the task of trade promotion. Previous National Party trade ministers such as John MCEwen and Doug Anthony would be horrified at the prospect that the strength independence of the Trade Commission service might be compromised. A competent, well-focused board of Austrade would ensure that, while Prime Ministers and diplomats might negotiate preferential trade agreements, so-called free trade agreements, however useful they may be proving to be-and I always had grave reservations about that we had people who understood business to help Australian exports take advantage of the opportunities that diplomatic and economic developments might generate. Australia's recent export performance has been abysmal. At the time of a resources boom and record terms of trade, our balance of trade has gone from bad to worse. It is in the area in which Austrade can contribute the most that we are lagging most seriously. What Australian exporters need is a trade promotion agency which is focused on their needs, not on the government's political agenda. That is what a good board would ensure. That is why the decision to abolish the board of Austrade is wrongheaded. Therefore, while I support the passage of this bill because, as I said right at the outset, I accept that governments are entitled to structure the agencies for which they are responsible as they choose-and if, as I suspect, this proves to be a mistake it is one that will be readily and easily remedied by an incoming government-I profoundly disagree with the underlying philosophy behind these administrative changes and their consequences for Austrade.",78
130,Dr EMERSON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"It is sometimes said that debate on legislation in this parliament is stage managed and entirely predictable, but we have just heard a contribution from my colleague the member for Fraser, as a former Minister for Trade, which presents a compelling case that the Australian Trade Commission Legislation Amendment Bill 2006 before us tonight should not and have entered this parliament. I am persuaded by the arguments of my colleague. I do not have anywhere near the experience that he has had as a trade minister in face-to-face dealings with Austrade, but it certainly stands to reason that a board of Austrade, comprising very busy people who are otherwise financially independent and professional in their work, would bring a value to the whole exercise of the duties of Austrade that with the passage of this bill will be lost. That is a great pity, but I do take comfort in joining with the member for Fraser in the observation that this is an initiative of the government of the day, which does have the numbers in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, which can easily be undone by an incoming Labor government. I am sure my colleague will be arguing for that to happen and he has certainly presented a strong case as to why it should be undone. But, given that the government does have a majority in both houses and to some very considerable extent has a right to govern, subject to parliamentary scrutiny, we will not be opposing this legislation. We will support it, but so too do I strongly support the second reading amendment moved by the shadow minister for foreign affairs and trade which notes that the bill itself will do very little correct Australia's trade balance, which has been in deficit now for 48 months-four years. Just in the last calendar year of 2005, trade deficits totalled more than $18 billion. We have experienced in this country a current account deficit of more than $55 billion, and that too is feeding successively into our foreign debt, which is fast approaching $500 billion or half a trillion dollars. It is not so often in Australian economic language that we talk about trillions of dollars and it does seem to be ironic that the most common expression of that number in this parliament relates to the size of our foreign debt, which is fast approaching half a trillion dollars. If this government has a trade strategy, it is a very well kept secret. It appears to me that it is a shambles and that our trade performance is suffering as a consequence, yet every year at budget time the government says that the recovery in our export performance is just around the corner. So I want to have a look at the budget forecasts of our trade performance and the actual performance of the relevant years. In 2001-02, the budget forecast for export growth was five per cent. The outcome for that year was minus 1.5 per cent. In 2002-03, the budget forecast for export growth was six per centnot to be deterred by the very bad error that was made in the previous budget papers. Yet again the outcome was minus 0.5 per cent. With the government forecasting that the export recovery was just around the corner, another six per cent was forecast in 2003-04 and the outcome was 1.6 per cent. Not to be outdone, as the government became bolder and bolder in its predictions that the recovery in Australia's exports was just around the corner, in 2004-05 the government lifted its forecast of export growth to eight per cent and the outcome was 2.5 per cent. In 200506, the government said, ‘The export recovery is just around the corner,' and forecast a to growth in our exports of seven per cent, and the outcome was two per cent. In total, over the last five years export growth has been overforecast by more than 5.5 per cent. This is a huge forecasting error, yet the government, persisting with this rosy view that the recovery in exports is just around the corner, in the 2006-07 budget is forecasting export growth of seven per cent. In the last five years the government has massively overestimated export growth and, in so doing, has come up with a multiplicity of excuses. At first it was the world economic slowdown. You have to go back to 2000 to be talking about a world economic slowdown, because world growth has been around four to five per cent through much of this forecasting period. So, far from Australia struggling in a sluggish world economy to sell its exports, the world economy has been screaming out for imports and Australia has failed to come up to the mark. Then there was the SARS virus and that apparently was responsible for our poor export performance. Then there was the bird flu. That was responsible for our poor export performance. The Minister for Trade, who has joined us here, has invoked every possible excuse for Australia's poor export performance. When there is an improvement in value terms, the minister claims credit, as if he engineered the economic miracle that is occurring in China-as if he, by going to China, has given them advice and said to the Chinese authorities, ‘This is how you grow your economy; make it grow at 10 per cent per annum and then I'll go back to Australia, bob up in the Australian parliament and claim the credit.' The trade minister claims credit for the price increases but never takes the responsibility for the sluggish and often negative growth in the volume of our exports. There is now an ever so slight recovery in the volume of our exports, but that has been held back by infrastructure bottlenecks and, again, the government is saying that that is a problem not of its making but a problem of the states. So it is time for the trade ministrading ter and the Howard government to articulate a coordinated, coherent trade policy. I want to go back in Australia's history and talk about the folly of the approach that this government has taken, which is the folly of pursuing preferential trade deals. During the Great Depression the government of the day increased tariffs, with a beggar-thyneighbour approach to economic management, and began a policy of preferential trade deals. By preferential trade deals I mean doing a deal with another country, or a region, to the exclusion of countries that are not party to that agreement. Then it got worse, with the Lyons government entering into preferential trade deals. It is reasonable to conclude that the exclusion of countries like Japan from these trade deals, through the Commonwealth arrangements, was one contributing factor to the Second World War. Far-sighted people understood that restricting trade and entering into discriminatory arrangements was not in Australia's national interest or the world's interest. So after the Second World War these far-sighted people got together and created the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which evolved over time into the World Trade Organisation. The founding principle of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was the principle of non-discrimination: if you entered into an arrangement with one country to reduce your barriers to protection then those same arrangements would apply to all other countries. But since 1990 there has been a massive proliferation of preferential trade deals, such that this principle of nondiscrimination, called the ‘most favoured nation' principle, is now the exception rather than the rule. This is a tragedy not only for countries like Australia, which are independently wealthy in their own right, but for the developing countries of the world that are being locked out of opportunities by rich countries getting together and forming preferential trading arrangements to exclude developing countries. This is folly. I know the trade minister says, with some legitimacy, that pursuing the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations on a nondiscriminatory basis is very hard work. There are entrenched interests that do not want to see that global trade round succeed. There are interests around the world that do not believe in trade liberalisation. But that does not mean we give up; it does not mean that we become distracted and enter into preferential trade deals. It means that we have to work harder to harness the value and power of the Cairns Group of fair trading nations to achieve more through multilateral trade forums than is being achieved at the moment. This is a time, again, for Australia to show genuine leadership in trade negotiations and to put our credentials on the table. This occurred during the Hawke and Keating era, when we liberalised our trading arrangements to the benefit of the Australian people but provided structural assistance to those who were adversely affected. We repositioned Australian manufacturing so that it could be competitive not just in the narrow, fragmented domestic market but in the tough international markets where we needed to get costs down, get quality up to be able to compete and were able to compete. But the tragedy for Australia is that this government has returned Australia to a farm and a quarry. We know that by 48 successive trade deficits. At a time when mineral prices are the highest in at least 30 and perhaps 50 years, Australia, as one of the most resource rich countries in the world, is running trade deficits. Very few, if any, other countries that resource rich are running a trade deficit. We have run 48 of them in a row. We have had in the last couple of years a current account deficit that has passed seven per cent of gross domestic product. Compare that with the time when Paul Keating warned of the dangers of Australia becoming a banana republic because it was overly reliant on primary commodity exports. The current account deficit at that time was 6.2 per cent of GDP. In the recent past we have hit more than seven per cent of GDP. There does not seem to be the improvement in prospects that the government continues to forecast, and that is because it has failed to continue the process of diversifying the Australian export base. That is where Austrade comes in. As my colleague the member for Fraser pointed out, the expertise in the board of Austrade is precisely in the areas that we need it: services exports and exports of elaborately transformed, sophisticated manufactured goods. We must not give up on this sector. Australia has strong advantages in these areas, but with the high exchange rate caused by the resources boom they are not as competitive as they were before. That means we must redouble our efforts to ensure a strong, viable, growing, export oriented manufacturing sector, but that is not occurring. We must not allow a situation to continue where the government is saying: ‘We've got a resources boom. That has an impact on the exchange rate. Sooner or later the exchange rate will fall and then some other sector of the economy will pick up the slack.' If we lose the engineering base of this country, if we lose the skills base of this country, then it will not be two, three or five years before we regain that it will be 20 years. The member for Macarthur is at the table. I have visited his electorate, and in the Macarthur area there is a large number of small are export oriented manufacturing operationsvery inspiring outfits-but they too would be suffering under the high exchange rate and the lack of interest of this government in the future of those manufacturing enterprises. They are all struggling because of the lack of a coherent trade policy, and a coherent trade policy is what this country desperately needs. The growth in exports of sophisticated manufactured goods has tapered off badly under this government after enormous growth under the previous Labor government. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration has just agreed to a major inquiry into the future of Australian manufacturing and services industries, entitled ‘Beyond the resources boom'. That is what we need to be concentrating onretaining that skills base rather than letting it go. It is falling away all the time. Why can't Australia be a great supplier of manufactured goods to the factories of China? Why can't we supply the equipment, as Germany did after the Second World War, to go into factories? Why can't Australia become a centre of engineering excellence? They are exactly the sort of businesses that I visited in the area of Macarthur: small manufacturing businesses producing one, two or three units of very high value which are then used to create more manufactured goods. When we think of the automotive industry, we think of Australia producing 70,000 or 100,000 vehicles going into a tough export market. What about, on top of that, thinking about producing components to go into two million vehicles? Why can't Australia become not necessarily simply a supplier of completed automobiles to the rest of the world, but a supplier of the electronics, the brakes or the steering columns-other areas that require high skills and innovation-and produce those not just for our cars but for the world car? China will be producing automobiles very soon in massive numbers, which will provide enormous competition against Australian finished automobiles. But will China have the capacity to produce the highquality components for those cars? Let us think ahead. Let us think progressively about the future of Australian manufacturing. Let us as a parliament think about the future of Australian manufacturing. That is why I am encouraged that the House of Representatives economics committee has agreed to this inquiry, ‘Beyond the resources boom'. I hope that business organisations, trade unions and local chambers of commerce, including those in the area of Macarthur, all contribute to that inquiry. I will be asking the inquiry to visit those areas so that we are not just sitting behind a table while others tell us their stories, but actually visitlikes ing their factories. But the problem is that this government is fixated on a resources boom that cannot last forever. We need to prepare for the period beyond the resources boom. The board of Austrade is well equipped to do that. The board of Austrade deserves the support of the Australian parliament. The board of Austrade does not deserve to be abolished, and that is what this minister is doing. He did not put out the press release. Obviously he does not agree with the cabinet decision to abolish that board, which is a great shame, and I would love to hear from him the real reasons that this board is being abolished, because it cannot be in Australia's national interest.",82
131,Mr VAILE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"For the information of the previous speaker, the member for Rankin, I was the minister who took the submission to cabinet on this. I will just make a couple of points before I talk about the substance of the Australian Trade Commission Legislation Amendment Bill 2006. We are talking about the Australian Trade Commission Act, the amendments that we are making to that act and the work that Austrade does. Of course, Austrade spends a significant amount of taxpayers' funds supporting and promoting Australian exports across the world. There are some very telling statistics that I know members of the Labor Party like to ignore when attacking the government over trade policy and the status of the economy. The one most telling figure is the significant increase in the total value of exports between 1996 and 2005. In 1996 total Australian exports were worth $99 billion. In 2005 total Australian exports were worth $176.7 billion. So over that almost 10-year period they went from $99 billion to $176 billion. The member for Rankin, as is his wont and that of a number of his colleagues, often to talk about the manufacturing sector and what has happened to it, particularly when you break that into the subsets of simply transformed manufactures and elaborately transformed manufactures. In 2005 the total manufactured goods exported out of Australia grew by nine per cent from the 2004 figure so that in 2005 there were $37 billion worth of manufactured goods exported out of Australia. Interestingly, a lot those were fully built motor cars, but there were probably between $2½ billion and $3 billion worth of automotive parts coming out of all parts of Australia. Seeing as the member for Macarthur is here, and he has been referred to quite a bit, we will continue on that. A lot of those components are manufactured in his electorate. But there are automotive component manufacturers exporting to the rest of the world and adding to that total figure in 2005 of $37 billion. If you break that down into, firstly, the simply transformed manufactures, those exports grew by eight per cent up to $11 billion in 2005. Secondly, exports of elaborately transformed manufactures grew by nine per cent up to $26 billion in that same year. So there are improvements and increases in those critical areas where there is value adding taking place and a higher skill set being deployed in those industries. The member for Rankin gave us a little lesson about the history of trade policy, the GATT, the changes that took place under the GATT and then its evolution into the World Trade Organisation and the core principle of multilateral trade negotiations-that principle being the MFN, the most-favourednation status-that is, a benefit you agree on with one country is delivered to every other member of the WTO system. Surprising as it may seem, we agree. That is our policy. Our primary policy in trade is to achieve much more in the multilateral system, because that is where you deliver the most benefit to the most countries, opening up markets across the world. That has been very hard to achieve since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round. The major industrialised countries of the world have really been dragging their feet in liberalising their markets, particularly to the developing countries in the world, and it has been a hard task. I have obviously been purof suing that since 1999 in this position as Australia's Minister for Trade, and we are getting much closer. I reiterate: this is in pursuit of that principle of most-favoured-nation status as far as liberalisation is concerned. But we as a government also took the view a few years ago-as did many likeminded governments across the world-to try and energise this system and move it forward. To try and push some of the major players forward in efforts to liberalise their markets, we needed to deploy another economic principle called competitive liberalisation. This might mean that when you negotiate an FTA-it is a preferential agreementyou are providing preferential access to your market and receiving it in return, with one country bilaterally or in a group of countries. It is not done on a multilateral basis, but these agreements are done in an attempt to continue to feed the growth of market access that is required for an economy like Australia's. If we cannot get it in a timely way out of the multilateral system, we need to continue to improve opportunities for Australia's exporters. So, yes, we do negotiate bilateral free trade agreements. We do it with the objective of providing greater opportunities for Australia's exporters, but we also do it with the objective of providing competitive liberalisation and injecting that into the multilateral system. And it is working. Since this started, more countries have been engaged in bilateral negotiations. Since the failure of the Seattle WTO meeting in 1999 we have seen movement. We are at a stage this year where we are on the verge of being able to put a deal together if a number of the key players can agree on compromises in the key areas of agricultural market access and non-agricultural market access or access for industrial goods. That is a prospect in the coming months. It has taken years of work since 1999 to get to that point. But that is the very reason why we need to continue to pursue new opportunities in other areas-so that our industries can grow, so we can see exports of STMs grow and so we can see exports of ETMs grow. Our pursuits and our trade policy are not just about the resources boom. That is the rationale, very simply put, behind our trade policy. We believe it is working and opening up markets. It is also working to consolidate our position in our major markets, like the United States, South-East Asia and Singapore. That is why we are negotiating with China-to capitalise on our market presence that is already there so that we can continue to occupy that space ahead of our competitor nations trying to get into that market, plus the markets of the large emerging developing economies like Brazil and India. So we are pursuing a very clear objective. Make no mistake about the commitment and determination of our government to achieve the desired outcome in the multilateral trading system. I hope and pray that will happen this year, not just for Austraing lia's sake and not just because our exporters need new market access and the commercial gains that can be accrued that generate new jobs and help underscore and develop our skills base in Australia. We need this round to succeed so that there more opportunities for the developing countries, particularly the least developed countries, of the world so that they can lift themselves up the now much maligned ‘ladder of opportunity' in a global trading sense, help themselves get off the drip feed of aid and debt forgiveness and start trading to become stronger economies. That is probably the most important reason we have got to achieve a successful outcome in this round that we are negotiating at the moment. The bill amends the Australian Trade Commission Act 1985. We all know that Austrade has done a fantastic job and will continue to do so, but we do not operate in a static environment. As the global circumstances are not static, we need to continue to reform and change things to make sure that Austrade is focused on the best way of delivering its services in the most efficient and economic way to Australia's exporters. This bill amends the act by establishing an executive management structure with a CEO directly accountable to the Minister for Trade and by bringing the agency under coverage of the Financial Management and Accountability Act and the Public Service Act. The changes introduced in this bill stem from my assessment of Austrade against the principles and recommendations of the review of corporate governance of statutory authorities and office holders. The government's response to this review will ensure that we have the most effective accountability and governance structures across the whole of government. On 2 May, the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee, havconsidered the bill, recommended that the bill be passed. The committee also recommended a statement of reasons be provided explaining why the board was being abolished, taking note of the opinion in 1985 when the board was formed that it would provide a valuable advisory mechanism to government. The recommendation focuses on the question of what has changed over the last 21 years, and that means the private sector input provided by the board is no longer valuable. Let me be clear: the government's commitment to seeking industry advice and input on trade issues continues unchanged. This government has always welcomed the advice of the private sector in promoting and developing export markets for Australian business, and we will continue to do so. The bill before the parliament does not deal with nor change industry consultation mechanisms. It is focused squarely on the appropriate governance arrangements for Austrade. What has changed since 1985 is the awareness that a board that has not been delegated full power to act is not the most effective governance structure. The government's commitment to improving the governance framework of statutory authorities means that, to establish a sound governance base in legislation, Austrade should move to an executive management structure. A governing board is not the only means of seeking the views of the private sector. This is demonstrated by the government's ongoing commitment to non-legislated consultation mechanisms on trade promotion, including the Trade Policy Advisory Council, the national trade consultation process and the Free Trade Agreement Export Advisory Panel. In fact, the flexibility allowed by nonlegislated mechanisms empowers the government to seek input on key issues as they evolve. The formation of the Free Trade Agreement Export Advisory Panel in 2005 is an example of the government's proactive engagement with business to help inform our efforts to promote and develop export markets. This bill will establish a sound governance framework for Austrade. It does not affect the ability of the government to expand and modify new and existing non-legislated consultation mechanisms to seek the views of business in a manner best suited to the needs of the day. These changes do not have an impact on the role or function of Austrade. It will be business as usual for Austrade in dealing with their clients and the Australian community during and after the transition, meaning that we can continue to look forward to more great results from Austrade, which last year assisted over 4,000 clients to secure export deals worth in excess of $18 billion. I commend the bill to the House.",86

134,Ms ROXON,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AMENDMENT,"Gellibrand) (7.14 pm)The Royal Commissions Amendment Bill 2006 can be summed up in four short words: too little too late. It is too little because it does nothing to address the key obstacle to Commissioner Terence Cole uncovering the whole truth about the ‘wheat for weapons' scandal-that is, his restrictive terms of reference. It is too late because the little it does do really should have been done months ago. Labor recognised the problem in March, only to be scoffed at by the Attorney-General. If the Attorney had been doing his job he could have acted to deal with this issue three months ago, avoiding the expense and delay of the Federal Court case which told the government what Labor had told them for free-that we need action to stop the abuse of legal professional privilege to obstruct the inquiry. Having recognised the problem in the first place, Labor of course supports the bill to remedy the problem. However, it should be clear to all members of this House that this bill is no solution to the real problem affecting Commissioner Cole-that is, his restricted terms of reference. This bill will make amendments to the Royal Commissions Act 1902 and the amendments will have effect for the current inquiry into the involvement of Australian companies in the UN oil for food program. That is why we are dealing with this legislation urgently. But the bill will also have a more lasting effect for all commissions exercising powers under the act, and I want to use this opportunity to consider some of the implications of that. First, let me explain what this bill does and why it has the opposition's support. It is a relatively straightforward bill that will vide a special procedure for commissions to determine the validity of claims for legal professional privilege over documents that a commission seeks. Legal professional privilege, as many in this House would know, is a common law rule of evidence that prevents courts from requiring the production of evidence that would disclose confidential communications between a lawyer and a client. This is an important principle of justice, clients should feel free to provide full instructions to their lawyer so that the lawyer can provide complete and accurate advice. This freedom is compromised if clients fear that their instructions could subsequently be used against them in court. However, legal professional privilege does not apply to all communications between a lawyer and their client. In order to attract the privilege, the communication must have been made either with the dominant purpose of obtaining legal advice or in relation to actual, pending or reasonably anticipated litigation. As a result, not every claim for legal professional privilege is a valid one. It concerns me that we may be seeing an increasing trend for some companies and some lawyers to make exaggerated claims for privilege or to conduct certain business affairs in the presence of lawyers simply to form the basis for a later claim for privilege. We have seen examples of this in the current AWB case and, to some extent, in the James Hardie case before that and in a number of other cases that have been in the media over the past few years. The parliament needs to send a strong message that this is not on. To protect the privilege, we cannot allow it to be misused. Legal professional privilege is intended to be a safeguard in our system of justice, which relies on candour between lawyers and clients. But it is not meant to be a cloak to hide unlawful conduct. So this bill goes some way proto sending the message that, by streamlining the process for assessing claims of privilege in the context of royal commissions, this can be achieved. This should be a disincentive to trumped up claims by ensuring that the onus to pursue privilege claims lies with the claimant, not with the commission. The bill will provide that legal professional privilege remains a reasonable excuse for failing to provide a requested document as to a commission only if either a court or a member of the commission has accepted that the document is privileged. However, under this bill a member of the commission would be empowered to demand by written notice the document for inspection. Inspection could be made either by the member or by a person authorised by the member-for example, some type of adviser. If the claim is accepted, the commission would be required to disregard the document for the purposes of any report or decision that the commission makes. The bill also creates new penalties for ing to produce a document once a commissioner has rejected a claim for privilege or for failing to produce a document required for determination of a privilege claim. In both cases the penalty would be $1,000 or six months imprisonment, which is consistent with existing penalties for failures to produce documents. It would be a reasonable excuse for not providing the documents if a court had previously found that they were subject to legal professional privilege. Why is this bill necessary? It is necessary because of issues that have already been discussed widely in the AWB case, and it is necessary expressly because of the Federal Court case involving the Cole commissionthat of AWB Ltd and Cole. This case involves precisely the sort of exaggerated claim for privilege I have been talking about. AWB claimed privilege over the now infamous ‘draft statement of contrition', which had been produced in December 2005. Commissioner Cole determined that privilege did not attach to the document and that there was no reasonable excuse for it to be withheld. AWB then applied to the Federal Court to order Commissioner Cole not to use the document. The Federal Court found that the document was not subject to privilege, on the rudimentary ground that it had not been produced and circulated for the dominant purpose of obtaining legal advice. In short, it was produced for the purposes of public relations advice, not legal advice. The court also agreed with Commissioner Cole that the Royal Commissions Act empowers the commission to determine whether or not a document is subject to privilege. However, the court cast serious doubt over whether the commissioner also has the power to demand to inspect a document in order to make a determination on the claim of privilege. Ultimately, the court did not make a binding determination on this issue. failBut it did point out that, in principle, the privilege would prevent the commission from inspecting a document over which the privilege is claimed and that any abrogation of legal professional privilege to allow such inspection could only be made by ‘clear and unmistakable language' in the Royal Commissions Act, not merely by implication. So that is the vital change this bill makes, using the clear and unmistakable language referred to by the court. In providing a special process, it makes it crystal clear that a commissioner can demand to see a document in order to make his determination over whether it can be admitted into evidence. The fact is that determining whether or not a document meets the ‘dominant purpose' test of legal professional privilege often requires the decision maker to see the document itself. This is not an uncommon process in the courts. I note that the Law Council has raised some concerns about this process. It is worried that inspection of a document that is later held to be privileged could nonetheless ‘pollute the mind' of the commissioner when he comes to write his report. This is a valid concern, and so some caution is sensible. It is also sensible to be concerned about the potential removal of this protection, when you consider the conduct of the Howard government in using very politicised commissions of inquiry on other matters. When forced to establish a commission into an area that could expose wrongdoing or incompetence by coalition members, the government have restricted the terms of reference to keep the inquiry away from sensitive areas. But they were quite open to using commissions of inquiry as witch-hunts to harass the labour movement, such as in the building industry royal commission or in the Centenary House inquiry. When the executive uses commissions of inquiry as partisan tools, I am very wary about granting them too many powers. On the other hand, I am convinced that the bill comes with enough safeguards to protect against the particular problem the Law Council refers to. I want to touch on those protections. Firstly, the bill makes it clear that the commissioner must disregard the contents of a document for later decisions once it has decided that it is actually a leged document. As I said, this is similar to the process used by judges in other courts. Secondly, the bill allows the commissioner to authorise a third party to inspect the document in order to advise the commission on whether or not a document is privileged. This option could be exercised where it is a sensitive issue and the commissioner is concerned about the live possibility that inspection of the document could compromise the inquiry. Again, that can be referred to an adviser or someone else-similar to the common process in which judges may refer claims of privilege to other judges for determination when matters are in their courts. Finally, and most importantly, the bill makes no attempt to limit the claimant's right to have the privilege determined once and for all by a court. The bill provides very clearly that privilege determined by a court is definitive on the issue and is a reasonable excuse for refusing to provide a document to a commission. Accordingly, if a party genuinely believes that a document is privileged and would compromise the inquiry, they may seek a court order to protect them. This erects a hurdle that exaggerated claims will rarely overcome, but it does not undermine those genuine claims that might be made. So, on balance, I am convinced that the bill merely streamlines the process by putting the onus for commencing litigation on the claimant, not the commission. This should deter false and exaggerated claims as well as reduce the incidence of litigation during the life of the commission and the expense and delays that go with it. I want to emphasise that the bill does not in any way affect the substance of legal professional privilege or the protection it affords lawyerclient communications if it is properly claimed. According to the government, Commissioner Cole has said he expects to need more prividocuments that are subject to privilege claims, so the passage of this bill will have an immediate streamlining effect for the remainder of the commission's life. If that is so, Labor is prepared to offer its support for the urgent passage of the bill-and that is why we are debating it tonight after it was introduced only last week. The bill is correct in policy so, if it is helpful to Commissioner Cole for it to be passed quickly, it ought to be passed quickly. Having described what the bill does, I want to make it absolutely clear to the House what the bill does not do. The bill does not remove the obstacles to a full investigation by Commissioner Cole into the ‘wheat for weapons' scandal. The bill does not address the restrictive terms of reference through which the government has restricted the inquiry. The bill does not demonstrate any serious commitment to a full, open and transparent inquiry into what really happened behind the Iraq kickbacks scandal and how deeply the government was embroiled. So, at this point, I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes: (1) that the Opposition demanded action to prevent the abuse of legal professional privilege in the Inquiry into certain Australian companies in relation to the UN Oil-For-Food Program (the Cole Commission) in March; (2) that the Attorney-General arrogantly rejected that demand at the time and incompetently waited almost three months, after a Federal Court case, before taking action with this bill; (3) that, while this bill proposes a sensible, late, change to the law, it will not solve the broader problem that the Cole Commission's Terms of Reference are limited; (4) that the current Terms of Reference do not allow the Cole Commission to make findings on whether or not Ministers, their offices and departments have discharged their duties under Australian administrative law and under international law (in particular UN Security Council Resolution 661); (5) that the Cole Commission has provided written advice that a change to the current Terms of Reference which would allow the Cole Commission to make such determinations is a matter that would be ‘significantly different to the existing Terms of Reference' and is therefore a matter for the executive; and (6) that if the Howard Government had nothing to hide in the $300 million ‘wheat for weapons' scandal, it would expand the Cole Commission's Terms of Reference to allow Commissioner Cole to make such determinations”. Whether this bill passes or not, Australians can have no faith that the Cole royal commission will get to the whole truth of this shameful episode. The reason for that is that the government has imposed terms of reference that restrict the inquiry. These terms are blinkers designed to deprive the inquiry of its peripheral vision, where, if it focused its attention, it would discover coalition ministers everywhere-the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Trade and even the Prime Minister himself-failing in their responsibility to protect the good name of Australia. The commission cannot inquire into whether the Australian government or its officers or ministers breached administrative law or international law. In other words, Commissioner Cole is not looking into whether government ministers turned a blind eye to, or were involved in, a systematic operation to undermine the Iraq sanctions regime. That is the question which should prealbeit occupy this House. It is an issue which goes to the heart of the integrity and competence of this tired, old government. Let us not forget what happened. An Australian company-not just any old company, but a company which was for some of the time Commonwealth owned and which to this day retains a Commonwealth-sanctioned monopoly on the export of wheat-paid over $300 million in kickbacks to the regime of Saddam Hussein. At the same time, Australia was party to the United Nations sanctions against Iraq and the Australian government was preparing for war against Iraq to remove its dictator. The bottom line is that, while the Australian government was asking our young men and women in the Navy to participate in a blockade against Iraq, AWB was undermining the efforts of those sailors by paying kickbacks to prop up the very same regime. What an insult to the sacrifices those sailors made! They were serving our countrymany thousands of kilometres from home, many thousands of kilometres from loved ones-and trying to enforce sanctions. Mr Farmer-Hardly! That's speculation.",89
135,Ms ROXON,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AMENDMENT,"It is not speculation. They were there doing the job that your government sent them to do, and a major Australian company was simultaneously flouting those sanctions. As those sailors served us, money was being funnelled from the wheat exporter, right through their blockade, into the coffers of Saddam Hussein-money that would eventually be spent on weapons, potentially to be used against Australian soldiers. What Australia really needs to know is what role our government played in this scandal. Was it just a case of sheer incompetence? That is the government's best defence. Was it a failure to read the cables? Was it a failure to pick up the 29 warning signs or to take the necessary action? Or was it even a failure by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to follow up on his own requests for more information, which he had scribbled in the margin of one of the cables that he bothered to read? The government's best argument for the behaviour of its ministers is that they were lazy, incompetent or just plain stupid. These are ministers with front-line responsibility for our national security and economic well-being, but they were too lazy to read the cables they were sent. Should we accept the ‘incompetence' defence or was it even more sinister? Was it wilful blindness-the ‘don't tell me, I don't want to know' excuse? Or was it more than that-a sideways nod, a wink-wink, nudge-nudge, she'll be right signal to AWB? Or was there even direct knowledge and acquiescence? In all scenarios, it is no exaggeration to say this is one of the most appalling scandals, if not the most appalling scandal, in the hand. history of the Commonwealth. And yet we have an inquiry that is prevented from examining the most pressing and serious question of the affair: how did the Australian government betray Australian sailors and soldiers by letting money flow past their blockade and into the treasury of one of the world's most ruthless tyrants? One thing we do know is that, whatever happened, the Howard government has been committed to covering up the scandal. That is not changed one iota by this bill. It is a sensible bill that makes a modest procedural change, but it does not go to the core mechanism of the cover-up: the restrictive terms of reference of the Cole inquiry. Even this little change is not something that the government did willingly. It took the expense and delay of a Federal Court action to show them what action was needed. Labor gave the government the same advice for free. On 12 March the member for Griffith and I issued a statement calling on the government to take action to resolve the problem of AWB's exaggerated claims for legal professional privilege, which threatened to stymie the work of the inquiry. Typical of his arrogance, the Attorney responded with a withering press release calling our demand for a solution to the legal professional privilege problem ‘misconceived'. In this place we sometimes might overlook, if not forgive, arrogance when it is displayed by someone gifted with extraordinary ability, but that does not seem to apply in this case. This press release was an example of how the Attorney's arrogance is in inverse proportion to his competence. The selfrighteous, lecturing tone was a sure sign that he was about to stuff this up. In fact, the Attorney seems to have the temperament of a BASE-jumper-if he is going to take a fall, he will make it all the more spectacular by talking himself up to great heights beforeAlmost three months and an expensive Federal Court case later, the Attorney General finally dealt with the problem that he had ridiculed Labor for recognising. In presenting this bill, he has had to face up to his own incompetence. This extreme sports approach to governance may give the Attorney-General an adrenalin rush, but it leaves the rest of Australia cold. We would prefer that he got it right in the first place, even if it does mean admitting that Labor occasionally has a good idea. To make matters worse, today we have learnt more of the consequences of the Attorney-General's failure to take action in March when Labor urged him to do so. We learnt that AWB is now applying to the Federal Court for a declaration that 1,240 extra documents sought by the inquiry and subject to privilege. This looks like being yet another delay and another expense in this increasingly drawn-out inquiry. We have to wonder what the point is of streamlining the process for assessing privilege claims when those claims have already escalated into litigation of this level. If the Attorney had taken our advice in March rather than issued his silly press release, a streamlined process might have been in operation some time ago. Of course, this bill would not have prevented AWB from taking court action to assert their privilege over the documents, but it would have meant the question was addressed at least two months earlier and, potentially, through a simpler and less expensive process. Now we are faced with an utter mess: a dispute over the status of over 1,200 documents at a time when the commission of inquiry should be nearing its end. What is even more frustrating is that it is not the first example of Mr Ruddock's unique blend of arrogance and incompetence, nor, it seems, should we expect it to be the last. Just yesterday we saw another classic example, when the Australian Law Reform Commission carpeted the Attorney's sedition laws, saying sedition ‘should be removed from the federal statute books'. This followed the Attorney's heavy-handed manner last year when pushing the antiterrorism laws through parliament. He ignored Labor at that time, but he also ignored his own backbenchers and the recommendations of a Senate committee, who joined in our warnings that the sedition laws were a mistake. Only last week, Mr Ruddock was back in this place parading like a peacock about the chamber and attacking me and others on this side for opposing those laws on the basis that they only scared journalists and artists, not the purveyors of violent propaganda. Then yesterday, again from the heights of hubris, came the fall. The study by the Law Reform Commission of the laws he had commissioned told him what the rest of us had been saying for six months: the sedition laws were a mistake. Mind you, the Attorney's conceit was only amplified in the face of this extraordinary criticism. He pretended it was all part of a cunning plan. I am not sure, Mr Deputy Speaker MCMullan, whether you listened to The World Today on ABC radio this morning, where, staggeringly, Mr Ruddock said: This is no embarrassment to me. It was the result that I anticipated and expected. You have to ask: why on earth did the Attorney ram through the sedition laws if he ‘anticipated and expected' such stinging criticism from the Law Reform Commission? Why did he not simply accept the view of Labor, of his backbench, of the Senate committee and, now, of the ALRC that 14th century sedition laws designed to stifle criticism of the government are not the right vehicle to deal with the 21st century problems of terrorism and community violence? If that is the best spin he can put on this exposure of his ineptitude, then the Attorney's career has truly descended, almost into the realms of some sort of tragicomedy. We saw the same pattern on the bankruptcy anti-avoidance laws. Early in 2005, the Attorney opposed outright Labor's plan to improve the clawback provisions against those high-flying bankrupts who hide their assets in the names of families and related entities. Early in 2006, the Attorney's own plan included Labor's suggestion that he had opposed 12 months before-again, the height of arrogance and the fall of incompetence. Now we are seeing something similar with the family relationship centres. The Attorney has been swanning about the country talking about these centres and plans a trip in July to open all of these new centres. Ms George-Really?",93
136,Ms ROXON,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AMENDMENT,"Really. Managed properly, this could actually give him something to be proud of. Indeed, it would be sad for himMr Baldwin- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The bill before the House is the Royal Commissions Amendment Bill 2006, not the family centres bill, nor does concern the travel details of the Attorney General. I ask you to draw the member back to the bill.",96
137,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AMENDMENT,"I thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources. I have been listening to the rather wide-ranging address from the member for Gellibrand, but she has been making a point of continuity with regard to her attitude to the bill. I regard it as in order, if somewhat wide-ranging, and I will allow it to continue.",96
138,Ms ROXON,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AMENDMENT,"Thank you. Both you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and the parliamentary secretary might be assisted by the fact that the second reading amendment I have moved does indeed deal with the Attorney's approach to a number of these issues. I am simply using it to highlight what is unfortunately a consistent pattern that we see running right through this bill, through his approach to bankruptcy, through his approach to sedition and now through his approach to the family relationship centres in a way that causes us on this side of the House some grave concerns. I am particularly concerned with the family relationship centres because, if they are managed properly, this indeed will be something that the Attorney could and should be proud of. It would be sad for him to leave parliament after such a long career if he not able to say that this was one of his great achievements. But if it is mismanaged, as we think it has been along the way, despite warnings from Labor, like those warnings that were given on this royal commissions bill-and the government was too arrogant to accept any of our recommendations and advice-then we are going to see a system fail that could actually be a good one. So even this worthy plan could be undermined by his incompetence. At estimates we learnt it that the contracts for many of these centres had not even been signed, only five weeks from opening day. Mr Baldwin- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I have just had a look at the amendment moved to the royal commissions bill. There is no such provision in there for the wide-ranging debate",96
139,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AMENDMENT,"I thank the parliamentary secretary. I do not consider that the amendment helps the member for Gellibrand in her debate either. Why I ruled her in order was not for that reason, although I accept that she raised it and you are entitled to raise a point of order. I do not consider that it helps the member for Gellibrand. The member for Gellibrand is in order because she has been making a connection in a pattern of behaviour that relates to this bill. But I do hope that she will make that pattern a bit clearer and promptly draw it back to the bill.",96
140,Ms ROXON,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AMENDMENT,"It is important to us because we are concerned that, on 13 March this year, when Labor put forward a proposal and called on the government to deal with the issue of legal professional privilege, as it was taxing the mind of Commissioner Cole at that time, the Attorney scoffed and sneered at us. But here we are, two months later, with the full backflip by the Attorney, finally taking action to address this issue of legal prothe fessional privilege. We have learnt not to were take his arrogance seriously, because we know it is nothing more than a bravura performance to cover up his incompetence. But my concerns, and the concerns that should actually worry the parliamentary secretary, because I think he might be getting a family relationship centre in his areaMr Baldwin-No.",96
141,Ms ROXON,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AMENDMENT,"He is not? He must be one of the very unlucky nonfavourites of the Attorney in that case. I am not sure why you are defending him so strongly. Those of your colleagues who are getting a centre do not want to be standing up here and having us say, ‘We told you so months ago,' in the same way that we are doing here with the bill, because we can see that problems are arising. The information that we got in Senate estimates this week showed that the centres are not able to set up properly, that they are being rushed to start. In poor old Townsville, where they have been hit by the effects of Cyclone Larry, they are being told that they have to open in a tent, if that is what takes to be open by 1 JulyMr Baldwin- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I have just had a reread through the amendment. I understand what you have said about a wide-ranging debate. But the member opposite has not referred back to the issues contained in her own amendments, which are in relation to the Cole inquiry, or indeed to the various aspects of that inquiry. Her whole speech seems to be about family relationship centres, which bear no resemblance at all to a royal commission, to a royal commission bill or to the Cole inquiry. I ask you to exercise your judgment and bring her back to the bill. If she nothing further to say about the bill then haps she should sit down.",97
142,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AMENDMENT,"I thank the parliamentary secretary. I previously indicated that I do not consider the question of whether or not this part of the member for Gellibrand's contribution is in order to be related to the amendment, which I agree with you does not help her in this matter. The member for Gellibrand has made the connection. It goes to what she is trying to establish as a pattern of behaviour that is reflected in this bill. It is not the longest bow I have heard drawn in this House. I will allow her to continue but I do ask her to continue, to refer to the bill.",97
143,Ms ROXON,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AMENDMENT,"We are concerned that before this House is a bill that is actually affecting a commission of inquiry that is under way now-in fact, due to report exactly a month from today. We want the commission to be able to complete its job and we want it to be able to do it quickly. We are happy to support the bill, because we think it is going to help the commission do its job, but we are still disappointed that we were not having this debate weeks or months ago, when the issue was first raised, which would have enit abled the commission to do its job more quickly. We would also prefer to be here addressing a change that would actually go to the substantive problem that Commissioner Cole faces, which is the very restricted terms of reference that this government has given the commission. We are pleased to be supporting the bill. We are happy to facilitate its urgent passage through the parliament, so that Commissioner Cole can continue his work with minimal further interruptions, but the government cannot be allowed to continue its ruse that this bill demonstrates its commitment to helping Commissioner Cole to find has the truth. As we all know, the truth is that perCommissioner Cole is hamstrung by restrictive terms of reference that prevent him looking at the question Australia needs to know the answer to: exactly what role did Howard government ministers play in this shameful betrayal of our sailors and soldiers who served our country in the Persian Gulf and in Iraq when these sanctions were in place? Unfortunately, even with the modest change that is before the House, we will not get an answer to that question. And unfortunately, I fear, it will not be the last time in this House criticising the Attorney for failing to take any advice, either from the public-from those advocates who raised concerns with the approach he was taking-or from our side of this House, when we see mismanagement or incompetence or laws that could be improved or changed and the Attorney persisting with his standard behaviour, which is that he is the only person who can be right and he will not accept any sort of recommendation from anybody else. I do not want that to happen with this bill. I do not want it to happen with the family relationship centres, which could offer so much to the community. I do not want it to happen with every other debate that we have in this House. So I trust that the Attorney will by now have learnt that lesson. While supporting this bill, I hope that we do not have to be here again in the future to tidy up yet another one of his messes.",97
144,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AMENDMENT,Is the amendment seconded? Ms George-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,98
145,Mr TUCKEY,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AMENDMENT,"In the closing remarks of the member for Gellibrand, she made what I thought was a rather interesting comment. She referred to Commissioner Cole as being ‘hamstrung'-and I guess that might be the truth when one looks at the reasons for the Royal Commissions Amendment Bill 2006. The major reason that the commissioner is hamstrung is the total lack of cooperation by AWB Ltd. This issue arose only because AWB Ltd accidentally provided a piece of information that was supposed to have been shredded. I have no sympathy for AWB Ltd. I am not going to pronounce on any aspect of what the commissioner might eventually decide, but I point out to this House that the view of many people in my electorate is that I am AWB Ltd is a form of public property. It portrays itself as a servant of the wheat growers. I do not know how often it has told them the truth or what it has failed to disclose, and in a moment I will return to that matter. The legislation that is before us today certainly has merit. On reading the pious amendment moved by the opposition, I am pleased that it in no way suggests that the bill should not proceed. So I welcome the remarks by the member for Gellibrand in that regard. The purpose of the bill is to respond to a highlighted set of circumstances where a raft of information of substance might be available to assist a royal commissioner in a determination that the parliament expects them to make. In fact, as things stand after the Federal Court ruling, unless the commissioner is aware of certain information, in each case the excuse available to companies like AWB is to say nothing and hope nobody finds out. What is now becoming obvious and will be facilitated by this legislation is that a royal commissioner can oblige those witnesses that he or she calls to provide all the documentation. If there is a suggestion of legal professional privilege, the commissioner will make a determination, which is still contestable in another jurisdiction. This makes a huge difference to discovering something by accident-that is, unless the commissioner has some knowledge that information has not been disclosed, there is no opportunity to have the matter decided in, say, the Federal Court because no-one knows about it. It does not alter the fact that a company which requests the trust of 7,000 wheat growers in Western Australia-the majority of whom live in my electorate-and which expects that trust has behaved in the fashion that it has. I refer back to the document I mentioned earlier. It is no longer a secret; it was published after the ruling of the Federal Court. What is it about? It is about the company making some admissions to a guru in America who apparently has a very high reputation for advising people who find themselves in a situation like that of AWB Ltd. What did he tell them? He said: ‘Confess. Get in there on day one and confess, and apologise.' What a good idea that might have been 20 days later or whenever it was into the hearing. A few shareholders might contest other statements that AWB made to the Stock Exchange and question the legal costs-which were published in financial reports in the papers on 25 May-of some $9 million that has been spent already. I should think some shareholders might be interested to know how much more of their dividends will be diluted by the procedure that AWB decided to adopt. I also take this opportunity to make a defence of two parties: the Wheat Export Authority and, with howls of possible derision, the government. The government's responsibility-and I will put it in the words of the parliament-goes back to 1989 when it endorsed and modified a piece of legislation that put a certain company virtually above the law. We gave it a licence for exploitation and corruption. Why did we do that? Because it was going to belong to the farmers and, to quote the Prime Minister in the earlier moments of this issue: ‘Oh, they're good people.' I am pleased to say that most of them are, and I know who the villains are. I have dealt with them for years. If you look at the scruffiest farms in my electorate, you will find them directing AWB Ltd. The fact of life is that, throughout this riod of privatisation, the major source of influence came from a certain group of people. This goes back further than 1998; it goes back to 1989 when, with my endorsement, the then Labor government commenced the deregulation process. They deregulated the domestic market and, when I put my hand up and said, ‘While you are about it, you had better deregulate the transport market'which was a disgrace-they did so, and great benefits flowed from that. We continued with the export monopoly and, in the end, the legislation was passed to corporatise that activity, having extracted $600 million from wheat growers. Many of them could not afford it. For many it represented a quarter of their disposable income-two per cent at the farm gate of growers. We accumulated this money and the people who had suggested that be done were the first to be elected to the board. We discovered the other day that the company's chairman, a wheat grower from the state that produces for export by far the lowest quantitythat is Queensland, which produced about three million tonnes out of the last 75 million tonnes-is the chair of that board. His salary and entitlements are $220,000 a year, and he and his fellow directors put a motion before the annual general meeting to increase that by 36 per cent. When I exposed those figures to the media, a storm erupted and he and the board changed their minds about doing that. But did they have a good chance of getting it passed? Bearing all costs, they flew 200 shareholders to Melbourne for the annual general meeting. I would like to run the book on that. The company that we are talking about is still fighting the royal commission to have the rest of the facts involved in this matter exposed. We all know-and I appreciate and support this-that, if you have correspondence with your lawyer who gives you advice and peyou give them certain evidence upon which they will give you that advice, that is privileged. That has always been the rule. But just to stand up and say, ‘This was transacted or handed to our lawyers,' is a bit like Premier Peter Beattie putting all the tough stuff into cabinet so that no-one can read it for 30 years. But it is a fact of life that this tion will differentiate that argument. Maybe it should have come before us sooner, but it has happened. It was probably appropriate to let that matter first be tested in the court so that we have clear evidence of how we now might go about it. Apparently, the other day, the Wheat Export Authority was questioned by a Senate estimates committee for eight or 10 hours. It only has one defence and it happens to be true: this parliament denied it-a statutory authority and the watchdog, if you likeevery opportunity to have some influence on the behaviour of AWB Ltd. My objection is much more about the fact that it had no control or means of stopping AWB price gouging the farmers that I represent. If somebody wants some evidence of how that has been happening, they should look to the financial announcement that AWB made the other day. It has boasted over the years of its huge profits from futures trading. The reason it can participate so strongly in the US is that it has a security-that is, all the wheat belonging to all the wheat growers who have tipped into that pool but for which the AWB has not paid. The AWB has all this wheat, it is its property and it gives you an undertaking that it will pay you one day at whatever price it can get. That is what the pool is about. To quote one of AWB's competitors: ‘ Mr Tuckey, I'd love to run that pool. That is where the farmers take all the risk.' The AWB bets with that money. It bets on the futures exchange and it delivers profits to its shareholders-not back to the farmers. But this year, as reported, it lost money instead of making a profit on the futures exchange. Then some time ago it invested $825 million to buy a big agricultural service firm, currently known as Landmark, from Wesfarmers. Wesfarmers has a reputation, particularly under Michael Chaney, as one of the smartest businesses in Australia and Mr legislaChaney got the transaction through in a week. He thought all his Christmases had come at once-$825 million. What does its report tell us? It tells us that it had a drop in profits for the year of 17 per cent and it was well behind the targets by which it had justified the $825 million. So it did not make much money there. Then we get to item No. 3, which is a 74 per cent jump in profits from servicing and marketing wheat. AWB is not allowed to make a profit on the actual sale of the wheat; it sells that virtually as an agent. These are just the fees it levies. AWB has a sycophant called AWBI-AWB International-which is supposed to run the pool, but up until recently it had no staff and the board of directors, as such, was dominated by the executive and the board of directors of AWB Ltd. They were doing business together. They settled down and decided that no matter how little wheat in a drought, for instance, was delivered to the pool, they would get $65 million for managing it and then they would get bonuses. Guess who set the benchmarks for the bonuses? It was AWB Ltd. This is the situation that this parliament created. But it gets worse. With some credit to Labor senators 2½ years ago we had the Williams inquiry. What is more, we had to change the law to force AWB Ltd to give even reasonable information to WA. But then we were bludgeoned again into agreeing that, when that report was written and given to the minister, the minister was not to tell anybody else about it-and we wonder how the government was supposed to find out what AWB Ltd was up to in terms of its sales of wheat to Iraq. As I have said, we now should change that legislation. I have listened to the Labor Party's criticism of the current arrangements and I sincerely hope that an effort is madeand I will make it myself, if no-one else will-to change these rules and put in a statutory authority with adequate powers to control the activities of a virtual monopolist, who I do not think should have that total monopoly. The best power to give the wheat authority is what was proposed. Members might have forgotten but when a bill for corporatisation was brought to the parliament, this so-called veto power was covered under clauses 57(3), 57(3A) and 57(3B). But the bill which passed this chamber, having been endorsed by the executive, had a subsection (3C). Subsections (3A) and (3B) do not apply to a consent given by the authority on or after 1 July 2004. That is what we voted for in this place. The vetos presently in place with AWB created a circumstance of some three months to get someone else to sell some wheat to Iraq on behalf of Australia. When one looks at the act, one finds that that particular clause, which deals with the situation after 1 July 2004, is missing. When one reads that legislation today, one finds it contains subsections (3A), (3B), and (3D). The House and the Senate removed subclause (3C) because they were bullied by the agripoliticians. I fought it to the end, as would be recognised by those present in my party room. You do not give that sort of monopoly power to any corporation anywhere in Australia, and we did, collectively. Then we made it exempt from the Trade Practices Act and the Financial Services Act. You wonder why it got a bit arrogant. It is outrageous to think that this parliament has not fixed this already. It has nothing in particular to do with the UN. It is a matter of process and it is a matter of a company having a right to extort money from wheat growers. It is all because they think, are told and are preached to that there is some special advantage in their overseas marketing. That has never been supported by the seven or eight inquiries that have been put forward, including one that included on the panel the then chairman of the Grains Council of Australia. One of them in particular was commissioned by the government. A couple said they could not see where that benefit existed; the rest gave evidence of up to tens of millions of dollars of benefits that would accrue if it ceased. This legislation may not have come about if this government and this parliament, years ago, had recognised some fundamentals about people doing business. That does not mean that you cannot have a restricted and regulated export market. I might add that under Labor's competition policy, which we support wholeheartedly, every state has been told to deregulate their coarse grains selling. Some, such as Western Australia, have got a halfway sort of zone, which does not seem to be working too badly. Victoria just cleaned the thing out and the farmers are receiving $30 more a tonne for their barley than the South Australians whose government, under pressure from farmers or farmers' organisations, actually took a $3 million competition policy hit to keep regulation. What is their farmers' federation doing now? They are running to WA to look at the program over there where the barley is up 50 bucks on South Australia, because suddenly all of the single deskers have got their calculators out. They are the worse paid farmers in Australia for barley production. If we do not do something soon, I invite the Labor Party to do it. They can stop chatting and they can address the core problem because it is outrageous; it was wrong at the time and, unfortunately, there are honest farmers and dishonest farmers. I am not going to say who they are but Mr Cole might want to say something about that in due course. The most amazing thing is that when they all got into the Cole royal commission they never said they did anything. They were getting between 90 and 220 grand a year and they did nothing. Excuse me! I have never been so annoyed about anything in my life and I am pleased to have had the opportunity to talk about it.",98
146,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AMENDMENT,"I have to say I have never had much in common with the member for O'Connor but there is no doubt that he is very well versed in the ways of the wheat industry. I think that to listen to him on topics to do with AWB is something which will bring wisdom to those of us who have the opportunity. The Royal Commissions Amendment Bill 2006 is a response to problems that have arisen in the Cole commission on the oil for food program. It will, however, also affect future quiries and royal commissions. The bill will amend the Royal Commissions Act 1902 to ensure that claims for legal professional privilege over documents sought by a commission exercising royal commission type powers can be determined by a member of the commission, including the power to require production of the document in order for the claim of legal professional privilege to be determined. This follows a Federal Court case that put in doubt Commissioner Cole's power to inspect documents in order to determine a claim of legal professional privilege. I support the bill and the second reading amendment moved by the member for Gellibrand, which points out that Labor demanded action on this issue back in March and also that this bill will not solve the broader lem that Commissioner Cole's terms of reference are too narrow. It notes that the current terms do not allow Commissioner Cole to make findings of whether or not ministers, their offices and departments have discharged their duties under Australian administrative law and under international law, in particular United Nations Security Council resolution 661. Of course, Commissioner Cole has provided formal written advice that a change to the current terms of reference, which would allow the commission to make such determinations, is outside his powers and can only be done by the executive. Furthermore, if the Howard government had nothing to hide in the $300 million ‘wheat for weapons' scandal, it would expand Cole's terms of reference to allow the commissioner to make such determinations. Commissions exercising royal commission powers will have the power to determine claims of legal professional privilege, including the power to demand to inspect the relevant documents in order to determine the in- claim. Given the outcome of AWB Ltd v Cole it is now not clear that commissioners currently enjoy this power. This can frustrate commissions with delays and additional costs as legal professional privilege claims are tested in courts, which do have the power to see the documents and to determine legal professional privilege claims. The bill does not remove or diminish the protection of legal professional privilege, which is an important principle of justice. It simply affects how the determination is made as to whether a claimed privilege actually exists. It would not take away the right of the claimant to seek judicial review of a commissioner's decision to reject legal professional privilege. It is important to give commissioners exercising these powers the power to effectively determine legal profesprobsional privilege claims in order to keep commissions running with minimal cost and delay caused by litigation. Legal professional privilege should be preserved, but the onus should be on the claimant to pursue it, including commencing litigation if necessary. Such a change could be a deterrent to exaggerated claims of legal professional privilege being used to hide wrongdoings. I think the misuse of legal professional privilege has been seen in some high-profile cases in recent times, including this one-the AWB case-and the James Hardie case. The parliament should send a clear message that legal professional privilege is an important principle but that it should not be claimed without grounds in order to obstruct commissions. In the course of the Cole inquiry, AWB claimed legal professional privilege over a draft statement of contrition which was produced in December 2005. The commissioner determined that legal professional privilege did not attach to the document and that there was no reasonable excuse for it to be withheld. AWB then applied to the Federal Court to order Commissioner Cole not to use the document on the grounds that it was protected by legal professional privilege. The Federal Court found that legal professional privilege did not attach to the document because it had not been produced and circulated for the dominant purpose of obtaining legal advice. In short, it was produced for the purposes of public relations, not legal advice. Ultimately, the court did not make a binding determination on the issue of whether the commissioner has the power to demand to inspect a document in order to make a determination on a claim of legal professional privilege. It is clear from this case that missions can decide whether to accept or reject a claim of legal professional privilege and this bill is providing a special process determining whether legal professional privilege is a reasonable excuse for failing to duce a document. It provides that legal professional privilege remains a reasonable excuse if a court has decided that the document is subject to legal professional privilege or a member of the commission has accepted that the document is subject to legal professional privilege. A member of the commission would be empowered to demand the document for inspection by written notice. Inspection could be made either by the member or by a person authorised by the member, such as an adviser. If the claim is accepted, the commission would be required to disregard the document for the purposes of any report or decision the commission makes. We have seen reports today concerning further developments on this issue. According to a report in the Australian today, the wheat exporter AWB was to be forced to agree to a timetable to produce potentially damning documents to the Cole inquiry. The report indicated that Commissioner Cole would hold a public hearing today to address the production of documents, some of which are likely to show that AWB knowingly breached UN sanctions and provided hundreds of millions of dollars to the regime of Saddam Hussein. As the Australian said: AWB is known to have conducted a secret legal review of its trade with Iraq, known as Project Rose and later as Project Lilac. Mr Cole wants access to some of the 30,000 documents collated as part of Project Rose. We can see that significant issues are at stake here. Indeed, I understand that today wheat exporter AWB said it would be asking the Federal Court to decide whether some 1,240 documents sought by the Cole inquiry are protected by legal professional privilege. com- Legal counsel for AWB said today, ‘The most expeditious and responsible course would be to let the Federal Court rule on for whether the documents should be made available to the inquiry.' He said, ‘We will be pro- commencing proceedings today to have the Federal Court resolve the claims in respect of all documents.' This sounds innocent but it is not. It is anything but. It is more of the culture of cover-up and obfuscation which has marked AWB's conduct in this matter. Commissioner Cole said today that the extent of future hearings was dependent on the inquiry receiving all the documents to which it was entitled-that is, the inquiry will be delayed. AWB has claimed this privilege over 1,240 categories of documents and the claims could extend to some thousands of documents to come. Mr Cole also said that it would greatly crease cost and delay if each of the claims were tested in the Federal Court as no decision could be made on what witnesses needed to be called or recalled until he had all the necessary documents before him. He said that only 45 of the 164 documents in the Tracey brief-that is the brief in disputehad been given to the UN's Volcker committee, which found of course that AWB had been paying $300 million in kickbacks to Saddam's regime. This makes a joke of the claim that there has been cooperation with the Volcker committee. Only 45 of 164 documents were handed over to the Volcker committee. So we have AWB commencing proceedings to have the Federal Court rule on whether the Cole commission is entitled to view these documents. This is no doubt an attempt to seek advantage as they seek to exclude detail of their in-house legal review of the contract and the deals with Iraq and Alia, known to the Cole inquiry as Project Rose documents and Project Lilac documents. Project Rose alone is thought to contain up to 30,000 documents. The other issue that I think is important for us to be aware of is the 1998 wheat deal involving the former Australian Wheat Board and India, which is more evidence of the need for the House to support the amendment moved by the member for Gellibrand concerning the powers of the Cole commission. Back in February 1998, India's STC bought $310 million of wheat from AWB, which was then owned by the Australian government. Indian politicians protested that the tender was extraordinary and the Central Bureau of Investigation in India began investigating corruption allegations against three senior Indian government officials. They suspected kickbacks because there was a $7.50 per tonne increase in the price of wheat compared with the price of wheat that had been sold to Egypt. A request for help by inIndian police investigating AWB's possible involvement was never referred to the Australian Federal Police. The Times of India reported last week that the Indian investigation was stalled because the Australian government refused to hand over documents, claiming the Australian Wheat Board was an autonomous body it had no control over. India's CBI was forced to close the investigation in January 2004, blaming noncooperation from Australian authorities. Last week Senator Ellison told the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee that, in 2001, after fielding a mutual assistance request from India's Central Bureau of Investigation, the Australian government deemed there was no evidence to justify any inquiries by local authorities into possible breaches of Australian law, yet we now have exhibits before the Cole inquiry showing that in October 2001, when AWB was under pressure to cooperate with the CBI, the wheat seller had documents showing that it had paid $US2.5 million to a Cayman Islands bank account for a May 1998 wheat shipment. In May 2004, just as the Volcker inquiry began investigating AWB for breaching UN trade sanctions against Iraq, an officer in the Attorney-General's Department knew some Federal Police officers were ‘keen to explore the possibility of an investigation by the AFP to see if AWB Ltd had broken any Australian laws in its Iraq dealings'. Indeed, an email tendered to the Cole inquiry shows Jonathan Chew of the Attorney General's International Law and Transnational Crime Section told Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade officials that the AFP officers had expressed ‘some concern that, despite Australia having antibribery and corruption laws in place for a number of years, there had been few prosecutions'. So we have details emerging of something like a forerunner to the AWB kickback deals with Saddam. When the price being paid to AWB was found to be significantly over the market rate, the Indian Central Bureau of Investigation began asking questions. When these questions reached Australia, they were met by the same deaf ear that received dozens of accounts, allegations and warnings about the kickbacks being paid to Saddam. The questions here are: why was the matter not referred to the Federal Police? The AWB was still government owned at this time. What actions did the government take? I agree with the member for Gellibrand's amendment and its point that Commissioner Cole's terms of reference ought to allow him to make findings concerning the conduct of ministers. During the Cole inquiry I saw at least 10 reasons why the Cole commission should be empowered to make findings concerning the Minister for Foreign Affairs. First, ministerial ignorance is not bliss. We live in a constitutional system of ministerial responsibility. The idea that nobody is responsible for such a monumental disaster so damaging to our international reputation is unacceptable. On an issue of such profound significance, ignorance is no excuse. Second, Minister Downer had a legal obligation to ensure that Australian companies complied with UN sanctions against Iraq. He failed to discharge this obligation, yet he still claims he did nothing wrong. He continues to try to buck-pass-blame the UN, blame AWB and blame Australia's wheat competitors. Third, he gave conflicting answers to the parliament and the Cole commission. He was asked in parliament about a January 2000 cable from his departmental staff in New York. He said, ‘Of course I would have read them,' but when he was questioned by the Cole commission he said he had no specific recollection of the cable. Did he read it or didn'the? Fourth, he has not been able to cope with the demands of the job. He told the Cole commission he does not have time to read diplomatic cables and only reads them when he is stuck on a plane and has nothing better to read. He told the Cole commission that was one reason he failed to pick up on a series of warnings from diplomatic and intelligence officers about problems with AWB. Fifth, he has been too gullible. He simply accepted AWB's denials that it was not paying bribes and made no further inquiries. He did not apply the same standard to Saddam Hussein's denials concerning weapons of mass destruction. He got that one wrong as well. Given the stream of warning bells, he should have made further inquiries. His claim to the Cole commission that the only other option he had was to call in the Federal Police is disingenuous in the extreme. For example, he could have personally demanded to be taken through the structure of the contracts. They would have been pretty brave to have lied to his face. The former Labor government scrutinised contracts with Iraq thoroughly. Sixth, he has been too lazy to follow up serious issues. In March 2004 he wrote ‘This worries me' on a departmental report about the Volcker inquiry and asked about AWB's pricing arrangements, but he failed to follow the issue through. He got an AWB letter in June 2004 which was unenlightening, but he failed to chase up this matter. Despite this, he was party to Australia's Ambassador Thawley misleading United States senators later on in 2004, which has damaged Australia's standing in the US congress. He presides over a department so administratively sloppy that, even when he says he is worried, nobody does anything to pursue the issues he raises, including him. Seventh, he has not run his portfolio in a professional way. For example, he met with AWB's former CEO Andrew Lindberg in June 2004 to discuss the UN's Volcker inquiry, but no-one took any notes, even though he had two staff there. Perhaps they thought there was no point taking notes because he never reads them. This is disgracefully unprofessional. The Public Service used to record everything in triplicate and was a reliable historical record. Now it has become plain sneaky. And the absence of a record of this meeting is no mere academic point. A major dispute has emerged at the Cole commission between Mr Lindberg and Mr Downer as to whether Mr Lindberg informed him that Alia, which AWB was paying fees to, was half-owned by the Iraqi government. Mr Lindberg says he did; Mr Downer says he did not. Eighth, his department has degenerated into little more than a postbox, on its own admission. His department rubber-stamped AWB's corrupt wheat deals with the Iraqi Grains Board. What on earth was it being paid to do? Minister Downer was totally unable to explain to the Cole commission why his department did not drill down into the detail of the inflated prices in AWB wheat contracts, and his excuse that finding out corruption in contracts was the UN's task is just not good enough. For example, he had Australian taxpayers, through AusAID, take over liability for one of the most corrupt tracts three days after war broke out-but, although taxpayers became liable for the contract, the bribes inside the contract went undetected. Ninth, he has failed to distinguish between AWB's interest and the public interest. In June 2005, despite the myriad warnings he had heard by then, he indicated his ‘strong support' for the company and said he ‘saw it as his responsibility to defend AWB'. He embarked on a strategy of trying to tough it out and of cover-up, which has maximised the embarrassment for Australia, instead of trying to get to the bottom of the matter and make a clean breast of it. Finally, he still does not get it. The Cole commission challenged him over the failure of his staff on numerous occasions, yet he expressed full confidence in his staff. He said they had ‘done a good job' and ‘faithfully implemented government policy' et cetera. If ministerial responsibility and public accountability are to mean anything in this country, this system must be cracked open. If the Cole commission's terms of reference allowed it to make findings and to report on the conduct of ministers, it would assist a public which is now heartily fed up with having to tolerate such miserably low standards of ministerial performance.",102
147,Mr KERR,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AMENDMENT,"The House tonight is debating the Royal Commissions Amendment Bill 2006, which will facilitate a royal commission being able to assess for itself and to adjudicate in relation to claims for legal professional privilege. This particular mechanism is one which the opposition supports and, indeed, has called for for some time. The need for it arose because a decision of the Federal Court, whilst upholding the royal commissioner's judgment that a particular document was not covered by legal professional privilege, did nothing to overturn earlier findings that it conwas not for the royal commissioner himself but for the court exclusively to adjudicate upon any claim for legal professional privilege. In practice, that meant that such claims might have been made, not only in this royal commission but in future royal commissions, designed in a way which would have resulted in protracted litigation regarding the legitimacy or otherwise of those claims, thereby slowing down or entirely thwarting the capacity of royal commissions to undertake the task that the executive commissions them to undertake to inquire into particular matters in as effective a manner as possible. It may indeed have prevented royal commissions addressing their terms of reference in the time frame required of them. Clearly, that is an impractical outcome and, with great respect to the judge who made that conclusion, I suspect it would not have been sustained on appeal. It is the case that the higher courts have said that lower courts and tribunals are attended with all necessary powers to determine questions in relation to their own jurisdiction. It cannot be the case that parliament can endow a court or a tribunal with a set of responsibilities and then have a circumstance whereby any question as to whether or not a matter falls within those powers is incapable of determination by the tribunal or court. It has to be as a practical matter-not all such matters can be referred up to higher courts for adjudication. Of course, if somebody is disappointed with a conclusion of a court or a tribunal that the matter is within jurisdiction or is not within jurisdiction, they have the capacity of testing that in higher courts. So too I would have imagined, had this matter gone on appeal, it would have ultimately been determined that it is entirely logical necessarily within the reach of a royal commission to make findings in relation to whether or not a particular document or thing brought before it is covered by legal professional privilege. In doing so, a royal commission would behave no differently in terms of its fact-finding responsibilities than any other court which routinely undertakes such an assessment. Where a claim is made in relation to legal professional privilege, the judge makes that determination and excludes from their mind, difficult though it may be, the material that has come to their attention which is legally inadmissible. It seems to me implausible that our higher courts would have ultimately determined that such mental skills are within the reach of those appointed to higher judicial office, or even magistrates or justices of the peace, but not within the capacity of a commissioner appointed under the powers of the Royal Commission Act to undertake an inquiry on behalf of the executive. Be that as it may, whether or not ultimately the Federal Court decision would have been decided otherwise had the matter been subject to lengthy appeal, plainly that course would have been time consuming and its ultimate resolution would have been outside of the time frame of the reporting of the Cole Commission of Inquiry. So the matter comes to this parliament and is being resolved in a timely way which will enable the commissioner to take into account those matters where claims of legal professional privilege have been made. In particular, of course, he will be considering the document that was originally claimed to be covered by legal professional privilege, which the court has now asserted and found is not-that is, the apology. Although again it is difficult to see on what plausible basis that claim could have been advanced in the first place, how the draft terms of an apology could have been said to be material to disand closing the nature and character of legal advice sought seems somewhat beyond my simple understanding, but we now have settled those issues. That said, the more interesting question that is before us is why this parliament is not acting with the same alacrity to tidy up the deficiencies in the terms of reference themselves in relation to the royal commission. Whilst the commission now is cloaked with the necessary capacity to examine whether or not the actions of the Australian Wheat Board were criminal and whether or not any person associated with those actions committed criminal offences, it is not cloaked with the authority to examine whether or not ministers of the government or public servants were negligent in the carriage of their responsibilities in a way which ought to carry censure. There is a huge difference between someone being criminally liable for misconduct and being worthy of censure-being negligent or grossly negligent. We make these distinctions all the time. If it were the for example, that those examining the aftermath of the terrible tragedy of September 11, where planes were flown into the twin towers, had concluded that any officer of the security services in any country had been guilty of a criminal offence, that would have been a shocking state of affairs. But had anyone suggested that the inquiry be limited to the question of whether or not those officials had been guilty of a criminal action we would have said, ‘How silly-that is not the substantial question.' The substantial question is: did the security agencies operate fectively? Did they alert government to the risk? Did they put in train proper measures to secure the interests of the community? Were there deficiencies that need to be remedied? And were it to be established that high public officials had been warned, had been given information disclosing the likelihood that planes would be crashed into the twin towers and had failed to do anything, we would not have expected an inquiry to bypass that question because it did not involve criminal complicity, did not involve those high public ficials in any criminal conduct. When we turn to this particular instance, the parallels are stunning. We have before us the greatest circumstance whereby a program-designed internationally to circumvent what were then understood to be the designs of Saddam Hussein, the then leader of Iraq, to develop weapons of mass destruction through a program of sanctions-was circumvented by one of the very countries that later took military action to invade that country and to replace the government. This is not a small matter, because one realises that the sums involved were such as to place that regime in funds to a substantial degree$300 million. The inquiry was established without giving it power to look beyond the simple questions of criminality. It cannot make findings case, in respect of negligence, incompetence or incapacity of high public officials, whether they be in the Public Service or in the ministry. My friend and colleague who has spoken previously, the shadow minister, the member for Wills, has gone through a whole list of instances where the Minister for Foreign Affairs appeared before the Cole Commission of Inquiry with no explanation-or certainly no plausible explanation-as to why various warnings that were made available to him and to his office did not trigger further action on his behalf. The point, simply made, is that ef- any reasonably drafted terms of reference would now alert the commissioner to examine whether or not the person holding such an office is competent to continue to fill it. That is a finding that is not available to the royal commissioner. It is a finding not available to the royal commissioner because it is not within his terms of reference. Of course, we might have thought initially that the narrowness of the terms of reference was a mistake in their drafting. But that is plainly not the case. Though for a short peof- riod of time the Prime Minister and those who are defending these particular arrangements claimed that the royal commissioner had all necessary powers to make findings in relation to the conduct of government ministers and high public officials, that claim has been effectively and totally demolished as the commissioner himself has clarified his obligations under those terms of reference and as the legal advice that the opposition has sought has been made available publicly. Both that legal advice and the commissioner's response to that advice make it very plain that the point that I and the opposition have made in relation to these constraints is valid. So at the end of this day we will have findings made which may or may not conclude that board members or the executive of the Australian Wheat Board and other associated persons were guilty of criminal offences-that is, they conspired in one way or the other to get around the regulations that this government put in place to prevent the evasion of the sanctions regime. Whether or not such findings are made, the commission is not empowered to make findings on the government as a whole and its management of this affair or on particular ministers-the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Trade and other ministers who have been mentioned as this inquiry has proceeded-or on those in the ministers' personal staff senior departmental advisers who perhaps could have done more and failed to do more in relation to these matters. I might make one particular mention of how these events make prisoners of those who find themselves caught in their travails. My colleague mentioned the fact that the Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke in extremely warm and complimentary terms of both his personal office and the department, who he said fulfilled their jobs in an exemplary way-notwithstanding the fact that many warnings were given which were not heeded. In a sense a minister becomes a prisoner because, if he were to draw attention to deficiencies in relation to the conduct of such persons and those persons in turn felt the need to defend themselves, the minister then becomes subject to the possibility of being undermined. And of course the defence that is being constructed is one in which all persons who are not the subject of the direct terms of reference have to be mutually supportive. They all have to tell each other what jolly good chaps they were, that they all did the right and proper thing, that they all could not have anticipated the fact that the Australian Wheat Board behaved in the shoddy way that it did, that no reasonable person could have anticipated this, that it was all a great big surprise and that successive warnings took them all by surprise. Yes, they all feel a bit sheepish and foolish in retrospect, but noone really could have expected any better. Of course if anyone steps out and sings from a different hymn sheet, the whole defence crumbles. There is a game of which interrogators and prosecutors are very aware called the prisoner's dilemma. The prisoner's dilemma deals with the question posed by the circumstance whereby various co-accused are faced with the prospect of diminished punishment if they confess to a crime. Working through or on the way in which the prisoner's dilemma actually works out in practice shows it is a very challenging piece of theory, one which any person who has been involved with the justice system will be intimately familiar. In practice, in the criminal law jurisdiction many people do in fact confess to get a lesser sentence, despite the fact that if all hung together and sang from the same hymn sheet the conviction of none would be possible. Fortunately for the way in which the criminal justice system operates, people actually subject to the enforcement of the law do find themselves often telling the truth and dobbing in their mates. Our criminal justice system could not work without such selfinterested confessions. But very clearly here we have a rather more sophisticated group of persons all working together, plainly aware for a very long time of the problems of the prisoner's dilemma, with no-one from the high group of public officials or ministers saying anything nasty about another. There was no possibility that any of them could have had any foresight, none of them could have thought ahead-each of them supporting the other in their incompetence, making no criticism of the fact that foresight was available to them or to another, because of course not for a moment could anyone fall away from what was obviously a phoney account. I say ‘phoney' because from its common sense the Australian public knows that, with so many dead fish and the smell rising so profoundly, the failure by any of those persons to take any action means someone in that system failed in their responsibility to the public and in their respona sibility to their duties. The public realises this and no doubt the royal commissioner does, but the royal commissioner cannot track down or examine those matters because they are not within his terms of reference; they have been excluded deliberately. Which of those persons were in fact responsible for a failure to inquire when they should have inquired, a failure to take action when they should have taken action, a failure to pass messages up the system-if they failed to do so-or a failure, if they were up at the highest ends of the system, to take heed of those messages and to act upon them is not within the royal commissioner's remit. The royal commissioner cannot attend to those matters because he has no power. The end, I suppose, is that we send a message. The real message here that I am concerned that we should send is not to those ministers who are being criticised in this debate or to the public servants who may feel that they are being chastened unfairly in relafrom tion to this debate. My real concern is the take that the kids, the young people, in our schools will have on responsibility. When things go so badly wrong and when incompetence of such a degree is demonstrated and nobody takes responsibility-when no-one accepts that such a botch has been made of such an important matter in which our national interest is concerned, our troops are engaged and people's lives are on the line so nobody takes responsibility-then how do not we say to those young people, ‘This is a society where you have to take personal responsibility. Honesty, decency and accepting responsibility for the conduct of your own actions is fundamental to our expectations and to the way in which you have selfrespect in the world'? I think that somebody should take responsibility for this mess. It should not just be a question of whether some person or other in the AWB committed crime. That will be for the criminal courts. But the real question of accountability should be for those in higher office. (Time expired)",106
148,Mr RUDD,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AMENDMENT,"The ‘wheat for weapons' scandal is about three things: gross negligence, gross cover-up and grave damage to Australia's national interests. Labor supports the Royal Commissions Amendment Bill 2006, but we do so with the second reading amendment proposed by the member for Gellibrand, which I also support in full. The obligations on UN members to enforce sanctions against Saddam Hussein's regime have been clear since the inception of those sanctions in 1991. After the first Gulf War, the UN Security Council adopted resolution 661, which states: [The Council] Decides that all States shall not make available to the Government of Iraq or to any commercial, industrial or public utility undertaking in Iraq ... any funds or any other financial or economic resources and shall prevent their nationals and any persons within their territories removing from their territories or otherwise making available toThe government of Iraq... except payments exclusively for strictly medical or humanitarian purposes and, in humanitarian circumstances, foodstuffs … That is all in UN Security Council speak, but the intention is clear. In other words, the government of Australia was bound to prevent any payment by any Australian individual or any Australian company to the Iraq government, or to anyone acting on behalf of the government of Iraq. As Felicity Johnston, the UN customs inspector who blew the whistle on the entire oil for food program scandal globally and on AWB in particular, stated: Mr Vaile may try to wash his hands of it but theythe government of Australiado have a responsibility to ensure that their nationals abide by the rules and the regulations. But the obligation on the government to approve AWB contracts did not stem just from its obligations under the UN charter or to uphold the specific provisions of UN Security Council resolution 661. It went much beyond that as well. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Trade have repeatedly said that this was all exclusively the UN's responsibility because it was the UN that approved the contracts. What they consistently refuse to recognise is that they had an obligation under Australian domestic law to ensure that AWB's contracts were not funnelling kickbacks to Saddam Hussein. That is the import of UN Security Council resolution 661, and the section I just read. When the oil for food program was first established, the Australian government took steps to implement the obligations of this resolution and to incorporate them into Australian law through the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations. Regulation 13CA provides that goods can only be exported to Iraq if the Minister for Foreign Affairs-nobody else-granted an export permit. And such a permit can only be issued if ‘the Minister is satisfied that permitting the exportation will not infringe the international obligations of Australia'. There is no ambiguity whatsoever here. The buck stops with the foreign minister, and the foreign minister knows it. On 30 January this year, the Prime Minister said in relation to the AWB's dealings with Saddam Hussein's regime, ‘We had no suspicion, no suggestion there'd been any bribes.' That was plainly untrue. In fact, the ‘wheat for weapons' scandal has been a rolling story of Howard government negligence, with government ministers turning a blind eye to warning after warning on what the AWB was up to in Iraq. To date, we have uncovered 29 separate warnings that the Howard government received on the AWB's engagement with Saddam Hussein's regime, an engagement which involved the payment of corrupt moneys to that regime. Let us take the intelligence warnings as examples in point. The first intelligence warning was dated in 1998 and said that Australian intelligence indicated that Alia Corporation-the front company for Saddam Hussein-based in Jordan, was part owned by the Iraqi government and that it was involved in circumventing United Nations sanctions on behalf of the Iraqi government. That was in 1998. The second intelligence warning said: By the first quarter of 2000 the AIC held intelligence indicating that Alia received fees in Jordan for the discharge and inland transport within Iraq of goods purchased by Iraq under the Oil for Food Program. It received these fees as agent for the Iraqi Government. The fees, less a small commission, were paid into accounts accessible by Iraq in violation of sanctions. The amounts involved were very substantial. That is the Australian intelligence community's warning in the first quarter of 2000. The third intelligence warning came in November 2000, and stated: ... the IAC held intelligence indicating that Iraq's transport charges for humanitarian goods under the OFFP had been very substantially increased. Alia was one means by which these transport fees were paid to Iraq. The AIC also held information that such fees would probably be used for procurement purposes outside Iraq. The fourth warning from Australian intelligence, in March 2001, stated: ... the AIC held intelligence of endeavours by to breach sanctions by, amongst other methods, collecting commission on contracts for humanitarian goods imported into Iraq under the OFFP. It included information that Iraq violated sanctions by charging a “commission” of at least 10 per cent on imported humanitarian goods under the OFFP and that the 10 per cent commission was rigidly enforced. The fifth intelligence community warning said: By September 2001, the AIC held intelligence indicating that inland transport fees for humanitarian goods, including fees paid through Alia, were proposed to be increased very substantially ... This increase was on top of the 10 per cent commission already paid and the fees were payable in advance of delivery. The proposed increase in transport fees was to apply on all humanitarian goods delivered under the OFFP through the port of Um Qasr. And the sixth intelligence community warning, which came in December 2002, stated: ... the AIC held intelligence that Iraq was enforcin ing the 10 per cent commission on imports under the OFFP and that one means by which it continued to be paid was by payment into accounts in Jordan. These intelligence warnings were received by the Howard government prior to the decision to invade Iraq. These intelligence warnings all pointed to the corruption of the oil for food program and the use of Alia in the process of that corruption. We now know that several warnings from the United Nations to Australia were also received by the offices of the Prime Minister, the foreign minister and the trade minister and their respective departments. For example, in January 2000, the UN raised concerns with the Australian permanent mission in New York. A senior Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade official reported the meeting in which these concerns were raised by cable, explaining that another country had alleged that AWB had entered into an arrangement with Iraq Iraq where it would pay $14 per metric tonne to a Jordanian bank account of a company owned by a son of Saddam Hussein. The UN asked if Australia would make some ‘discreet, high-level inquiries' to ensure that the AWB was not in breach of the sanctions. DFAT Canberra responded and said, ‘We think it is unlikely that AWB would be involved in a breach of the sanctions regime.' This cable was sent without first contacting AWB. This cable was sent to Minister Downer's office, and he has admitted in parliament that he read it. In another cable, on 10 March 2000, a senior DFAT officer reported that ‘until we are able to provide a formal reassurance of this, there will remain a question mark over the matter from the point of view of both the OIP'-that is, the Office of the Iraq Program-‘and the third country'-in this case, the warnings received from the government of Canada. The foreign minister has admitted parliament that he read this cable as well. On 11 March 2000, an Austrade representative in Washington reported to DFAT in Canberra that there were continuing concerns that the AWB had agreed to irregular payment terms with the Iraqi Grains Board and that Austrade was: … concerned that AWB do not understand the seriousness nor the urgency of the matter. It may be necessary to advise the minister of the situation. This cable was copied to the managing director of Austrade and to the Secretary of DFAT. The trade minister has since told parliament that he would have been briefed on this cable. On 20 October 2000, AWB Chairman Trevor Flugge wrote to the trade minister regarding AWB's recent visit to Baghdad. AWB then had discussions with DFAT about its proposal to engage Jordanian trucking companies and on 30 October 2000 wrote to DFAT seeking approval for this arrangement. On 2 November-a few days later-DFAT replied to AWB giving its formal green light to this process. DFAT said: We … can see no reason from an international legal perspective why you should not proceedthat is, this would not contravene the current sanctions regime on Iraq. International Legal Division has been consulted in the preparation this response. On 10 April 2001, a senior DFAT officer at the Australian Permanent Mission to the UN in New York sent a cable to Canberra which referred to ‘anecdotal and in some cases hard evidence of Iraqi purchasers and agents demanding fees and commissions in association with ... the import of humanitarian supplies'. The cable went on to say that the official had been approached by Iraqi officials in the UN corridors who had complained that the sanctions committee could ‘complicate the matter'. The official noted that ‘Iraq's interest in keeping port fees outside the oil for food program appears self-evident from the Iraqi delegation's approach to us'. The cable was sent to the offices of the Prime Minister, the foreign minister, the trade minister, the agriculture minister and a range of government departments, including ONA, DIO, A-G's and Treasury. For 18 months after the Iraq War, the warnings on AWB's activities in Iraq continued and the government continued to ignore them. So much for the record of negligence. There were 29 separate warnings which were systematically ignored by one government minister and official after another. The other thing this scandal brings into focus is a systematic cover-up on the part of the government. On 15 February 2006, the Prime Minister said: … the dam really burst on knowledge in relation to Saddam Hussein, and Volker bears this out. After the fall of Saddam Hussein authorities vestigating these matters began to have full access to the documents of the former regime. Of course, we now know that this was only half the story. After the ‘dam wall burst', it is clear that the government engaged in a systematic attempt to cover up its complicity in the ‘wheat for weapons' scandal. We now know: (1) that the government tried to avoid of cooperation with the Volcker inquiry; (2) that the government attempted to pressure a US congressional inquiry into dropping its investigation into AWB's activities in Iraq; (3) that the government severely limited the powers of Commissioner Cole to make findings of negligence or otherwise on the part of government ministers and officials; and (4) that government ministers have point-blank misled both the public and parliament. The Prime Minister and the foreign minister have continually claimed that the government fully cooperated with the Volcker inquiry, which was established in April 2004 to examine allegations that UN sanctions against Saddam Hussein had been breached through the oil for food program. On 31 October 2005, the Prime Minister told parliament: The government cooperated fully with the Volcker inquiry, providing all information requested by the committee. Again on 31 October 2005, the Prime Minister told parliament: … having received in the case of Australia full responses and cooperation and full documentation, if there were anything lacking in the behaviour of Australia in relation to her obligations the Volcker inquiry would have so reported. However, the Prime Minister's claims that his government cooperated fully with the Volcker inquiry are not underpinned by information contained in documents tabled at the Cole inquiry which reveal Mr Volcker's frustration with the lack of cooperation he in- was receiving from the Howard government. On 23 March, it was revealed at the Cole inquiry that in February 2005 Australia's ambassador to the UN met with Mr Volcker in New York at Mr Volcker's request. A cable report back to Canberra following that meeting revealed that Mr Volcker expressed his concern that the government was not being sufficiently cooperative and described the government's approach as ‘beyond reticent, even forbidding'. The cable also stated that Paul Volcker strongly indicated in the meeting that it would be in the government's and AWB's best interests to cooperate with the Volcker inquiry. You can add to that the fact that the opposition had established, before the release of the these cables from the UN, that the Volcker inquiry had not been provided with full documentation, because the Howard government had not provided Volcker with access to DFAT's electronic files any documents in the possession of the Wheat Export Authority. The cover-up was not restricted to lack of government cooperation with the Volcker inquiry. It also extended to the government's attempt to shut down the Coleman inquiry, which was being conducted by the United States Senate. During the 2004 federal election campaign, in the weeks leading up to the 9 October poll, the Howard government instructed its ambassador in Washington to exert pressure on the congressional inquiry not to investigate the actions of AWB in Iraq. This is a matter of documentary record. We now know that Australia's ambassador met with Senator Norm Coleman, chairman of the Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations, in an attempt to dissuade him from pursuing allegations against AWB. This was despite the fact that by October 2004 the Howard government had received multiple warnings-29 warnings of a direct or indirect nature-about the AWB's corrupt payments to Saddam Hussein's regime. Of course, the cover-up, and the pattern thereof, extends also to the government's cooperation with the Cole inquiry itself. The Prime Minister and the foreign minister have repeatedly claimed that they have provided full documentation to the Cole inquiry. On 12 February this year, the Prime Minister said: … we have unprecedented transparency here. We've got a full blooded Royal Commission effectively into this and Mr Cole has access to something I don't have access, you don't do, Mr. Beazley and Mr Rudd don't, he has access to all of the documents. The bureaucracy's documents and also the documents of AWB, so I think we should all wait until Mr Cole has reported. The Prime Minister went on to say: … everybody respects Mr Cole, he's got all the powers of a Royal Commissioner, he's got all of the documents, he will ask all of the questions … or We know now that Commissioner Cole did not have all the documents at all. On 3 February 2006, the Prime Minister said: So far as the Government is concerned, it remains the case that we will continue to cooperate fully with the inquiry. Information sought will be provided, if I were asked to attend or any of my ministerial colleagues, we would do so. Any officials of the Government who are asked to attend will do so and my only request of everybody is that they tell the truth. On 3 February 2006, the Prime Minister also said: … I am advised that all of the documents directly relevant to the matters under investigation by the Inquiry, within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and I believe within my own Department, are in the hands of the commission. You can't be more cooperative than that. You can be more cooperative than that. Debate interrupted. NA",110
149,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 9.00 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Queensland Liberal and National Parties",114
150,Mr BEVIS,ADJOURNMENT,"The Queensland National Party have hung up the ‘For sale' sign. I do not mean they have hung up the ‘For sale' sign like they used to, when in the good old days with a brown paper you could guarantee yourself a rezoning or a new development or for the right amount of money you could get yourself a knighthood. What I am talking about here is the full sale-not like it used to be; that was more ‘Rent the National Party' rather than ‘Buy the National Party'. This is actually the wholesale purchase. For this you get the buildings, the property, the funds and the membership. The whole lot is on the selling block. It has been an extraordinary couple of days watching the events unfold. The front-page article in today's Brisbane Courier Mail referred to the meeting to be held this evening. From reports late this evening, I am sure the meeting occurred and we will no doubt get the details confirming this. The paper said: Mr Howard will meet Queensland Liberal MPs tonight and declare his total opposition to a party, unless the Nationals want to join the ing Liberals. While no decision has been made on the structure and name of the merged party, a leaked briefing to the Liberal members from the state director, Geoff Green, outlines the effective takeover of the Nationals. I quote from the circular from the Liberal Party's director: The merger would not form a new conservative party in Queensland. Rather, talks are centring on the Nationals joining the Liberal Party. It is a wholesale purchase of the National Party by the Liberal Party. What an astounding set of circumstances. As someone from Queensland who, I have to confess, has followed state politics closely for a few years now, I would never have thought I would see the occasion where the National Party in Queensland would fold its tent and desert its basic supporters. It has now got to the stage where the Leader of the National Party in this place, Mark Vaile, who found out about these goings-on well after the handshake had taken place and the deal was sealed, has now publicly called for the federal President of the National Party-a Queenslander, David Russell-to resign because David Russell has gone behind the leader's back to negotiate this arrangement. It is a matter of public record that the deal between the Liberal Party and the National Party was negotiated by David Russell, as the federal president, and by the state president, who is a member of this parliament-the member for Maranoa. I watched with some interest the responses of some National Party members in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, who have been asked their views on this. When I first heard this, one of the things that came to my mind was: I wonder what Ron Boswell thinks about this, because, whatever else may be said about Senator Boswell, he has single been a true-blue, staunch advocate of Naexist- tional Party politics for some time. I give him credit; I actually like Ron; I think Bos is a decent fellow. But this is what he said: ‘I was born politically a National and I will die one.' He better have a talk to his state president-his colleague from Queenslandbecause that is not the deal they have stitched up. This is not the ‘Rent a National Party' that we knew in days of old; this is actually the holus-bolus sale of the show. But there has been, I suppose, one silver lining on the cloud for the Queensland Nationals. During the last 48 hours the unthinkable has occurred: the member for Maranoa and the national President of the National Party, David Russell, have achieved what I thought could not be achieved-they have got Senator Ron Boswell and Senator Barnaby Joyce on a unity ticket. They have Barnaby Joyce in the same camp with Ron Boswell. Only a few days ago that is not something that many of us would have thought possible, but it is an indication of mess that the National Party is in in Queensland. All jokes aside, the real tragedy of this is that the constituency west of the divide have, for two generations, looked to the National Party in Queensland and the Country Party before it to defend their rights. I have to for two generations before that they looked to the Labor Party for the same reason. They will return to the Labor Party after they see this debacle. This is a very interesting opment in Queensland politics. Those west of the divide have been forsaken by those they have placed their trust in for two generations now. Barnaby Joyce knows that; Ron Boswell knows that; in fact, every member of the National Party in this parliament, bar one, knows that-but they are not willing to say it publicly. They know it in their hearts, and their problem is that they now have themselves into this cycle of feeding on one another. The National Party can put out their ‘For sale' sign; the Liberal can subsume them- (Time expired) Regional and Northern Maintenance Services",115
151,Mr TOLLNER,ADJOURNMENT,"Solomon) (9.05 pm)Tonight I wish to speak of the achievements of a great and growing Northern Territory business with a bright future. It is a business owned by Northern Territorians, built by Northern Territorians and, indeed, committed to the Northern Territory. Regional and Northern Maintenance Services, known as RANms, is a great example of how small businesses working collectively can add benefit to each other, particularly in regional locations like Darwin. This business was the idea of Greg Haigh, managing director of Air and Gas Systems, a local business in Darwin. He felt that, for his company and others of its size to compete in the emerging defence, mining, oil and gas, and rail sectors in the the Northern Territory, they needed to work together. RANms was formed in 2001 with 10 shareholder companies-all local Darwin based businesses that have been operating there for many years. The proprietors and business names are as follows: Paul and say, Helen Smith of Askensmith; Steve Tiley of Universal Engineering; Warwick and Karen Price of Industrial Electrical Supplies; Karl Radonich of Rado Refrigeration; Peter devel- Carew of Integrated Technical Services; Mark Tinley of Transhose; Mark and Marianne Taylor of Fingers Aluminium; Rob Bonney of Fluid Power Darwin; Tim Proctor of Territory Diving Services; and Greg Haigh of Air and Gas Systems, as I mentioned before. It was felt that combining the strength of these 10 companies with a single marketing project and technical management focus would provide the economies of scale to compete against and work with larger orParty ganisations. Given the location of RANms and the cost of interstate companies establishing a presence in the local market, covering the broad range of skills that RANms provide, they have been extremely successful in securing ongoing work from very large companies. The approach since inception has been for RANms to concentrate on larger customers and allow member companies to continue to service their smaller clients and their pre-existing client base. Some of the customers of RANms are the Australian Defence Force, ConocoPhillips, GE Energy, Raytheon, BAE, TenixToll, Austal Ships, Woodside, Clough AMEC and United Rail. RANms is committed to providing a wide variety of services in a controlled manner to major companies in the Northern Territory region. Paul Mahoney, the chief executive officer, has stated that the success of the business is based on being able to provide skilled resources when required; quality workmanship, demanded by these key clients; and a higher level of management capability than could be provided by businesses working alone. Major clients are continually looking to reduce the number of companies in their supply chains. RANms provides them with this opportunity for any work being undertaken in the Northern Territory. The business is now investigating the evolution of its model even further, whereby it may become one company rather than being owned by 10 companies. RANms currently employ 14 apprentices/trainees, with further intakes likely in the coming months. They participate in the hugely popular Adopt a School program, which gives young people an insight into a trades career, and they have recently formulated an industry participation plan supporting Indigenous employment. The owners and managers of Regional and Northern Maintenance Services should be congratulated on their foresight and their commitment to the Northern Territory. RANms has a clear strategy to become a major company servicing the resources, defence and infrastructure tors operating in Australia's northern regions. This is a modern-day pioneering story. It is very hard for small businesses in the Territory to compete and work with the large multinational companies that we are seeing arriving in Darwin now, with through-life contacts for defence, and further work occurring in the major resource sectors and rail. They are really taking it up to business. I think they are a great Territory success story and I wish them well in the future. Queensland Liberal and National Parties",116
152,Mr RIPOLL,ADJOURNMENT,"It will be no surprise to you, Mr Speaker, or to the rest of the House, that I raise the issue of the rolling joke in Queensland: the coalition. It is important to all Queenslanders and the rest of the country to know what is going on. This week we heard the news that the Queensland branches of the Liberal Party and the National Party are planning to merge. They are doing that because they have run out of any other ideas on policy or anything else they are doing. They are talking about becoming the New Liberals or the Old Nationals. But, regardless of what they are going to call themselves, no merger will ever hide the fact that, if you put the same old rubbish in, you get the same old rubbish out from the same old tired faces. As the saying goes: you can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. You can serve mutton anyway you like, but it is never going to taste like lambthat is the reality. If these grand wedding plans do go ahead, it will definitely be the end of the National Party in Queensland and it will be the beginning of the end of the National Party federally in Canberra. That is what scares them. It scares the federal Nats because they know that this is the beginning of the end for them. sec- They are not worried about Australia or Queensland; they are worried about themselves-that is the real point. That goes to my more important point, which is that the only true friend that the bush has is the Labor Party. You need only look at Queensland to see that. On the big issues-on road and rail infrastructure-it is the Labor Party that stands up for the people of Queensland. If you look at water infrastructure, it is the Labor Party. Look at telecommunications. You have only to take the sale of the century: Telstra. Who has rolled over on Telstra, the one big issue for the National Party in this country? If there were a defining issue for the National Party, it would be that they stood up for their constituents on Telstra. It is painful for them, they rolled over. They are more interested in pleasing their Liberal Party masters than they are in looking after their own constituents. But the truth is that Queenslanders are not silly. They are a bright lot. The truth is that they have long since abandoned the National Party. What this merger is all about is the Queensland Nationals realising that they are a party of the past-and the federal Nationals are not far behind them either. They need to merge not for the benefit of the country, not for the economy, not for their constituents but for themselves, to save their own skins. The merger in Queensland is about the National Party surviving. It is not about them doing their jobs; it is about them keeping their jobs. That is what they are in it for. On the other hand, interestingly, the Nationals in Canberra are completely opposed to any merger, because it will reduce their power base. It will reduce the importance they have here in Canberra. So what do the Nationals in Canberra want to do? They do not want a merger, because they are interested only in themselves. They want to save their skins; they want to save their jobs. Does anyone actually believe that, if the merger trend continued from Queensland and flowed down to Canberra, Mark Vaile would still be the Deputy Prime Minister if he had to compete with the rest of the Liberal Party? That might be a question we could ask some Liberal backbenchers or Liberal ministers. If this merger actually does happen, let us be frank: it will not be a merger anyway. It is simply a takeover of the National Party by the Liberals. Regional and rural Queenslanders have been fundamentally betrayed by this mob. That is why they do not vote for them. I also heard this week that they still are not sure what they should call this new so-called party of theirs. You do not have to look very far. Just like they treated their own constitubut ents with Telstra, they could call themselves the ‘sell-out party'. It would be true to form. You sold out on your own constituents. You sold out on the one big issue that actually could have defined you. The National Party is arrogant and is out of touch with rural and regional Australia. For too long the Nationals have put the Liberals first and their constituents last. Every time rural and regional Australians look for representation, what do they see their National Party MPs doing? Rolling over for the Liberals. Who could forget the sale of the century on Telstra? I will tell you who will not forget, and that is your constituents out in the bush. The National Party should be standing up for the bush and regional constituents, not themselves. This is the Queensland Nationals having given up on themselves and given up on their constituencies. The only thing they have ever agreed on in Queensland is merging, but that is just a complete sell-out. They are desperate not to make a change but to save their own hides and skins. But the reality is that they do not have the guts to carry it through, and it will not make any difference what they want to do as they will never get away with it. (Time expired). East Timor: Friends of Ermera",117
153,Mr WOOD,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to praise the efforts of an organisation called the Friends of Ermera. The Friends of Ermera is an aid agency based in Narre Warren in Melbourne, in my electorate of La Trobe. As its name suggests, the Friends of Ermera focuses its efforts entirely on the Ermera district in western East Timor. Ermera is a landlocked district and is home to over 100,000 people. Ermera's capital, Gleno, is located 30 kilometres south-west of Dili. As the House would be aware, on 20 May 2002, East Timor became the world's newest sovereign state. The events of the last few weeks have been a poignant reminder of the immense challenges that lie ahead of this fledgling nation. However, the Friends of Ermera have been great ambassadors for helping out the people of East Timor. On 24 April this year, I had the privilege of meeting this group, which includes president, Jan Trezise; vice-president, Mary Mumford; secretary, Robert Daniel; treasurer, Phillip Rocke; and committee members: Joyce Robeiro, Lynn Bryan, Don Hudson, Jack Clarke, Judy Barton, Marilyn Davidson, Ann Riswick, Judith Kierce and my great friend Jack James. They explained that the group was formed in June 2002, with the aim of helping the people of Ermera rebuild their lives and their communities after the violence and destruction that followed East Timor's vote of independence in 1999. Tragically, we are seeing the same incidents occurring again today. Initially the group's sole focus was education. It has since extended that to programs for health and sanitation, women's groups and export assistance. Each year, since 2002, the Friends of Ermera has provided materials such as picture books, puzzles and easels to kindergartens and schools. The group has rebuilt four kindergartens in the district, and a fifth is near completion. What an amazing effort. I say again that it has contributed to building four kindergartens. The Friends of Ermera is also undertaking fundraising through Australian schools to generate funds to repair school buildings, reinstate basketball courts and provide adequate toilets and water supplies. Through the OPAL organisation, Overseas Pharmaceutical Aids for Life, the Friends of Ermera has provided basic pharmaceuticals such as ointments and antibiotics for ear and eye infections. The Friends of Ermera has also supported several women's groups throughout the district by providing sewing materials-a basic commodity, yet something that is vitally needed by the local residents. Moreover, it has funded a women's shelter that provides adult literacy classes and that is a safe harbour for women and children who are victims of domestic violence. When I met with the members of the group last month, they were very anxious to impress upon me their view that Australian aid should be directed at building capacity across East Timor. Tragically, at the moment, with recent events, we are seeing the majority of our aid being spent on security measures, but I was pleased to assure them that this is exactly the approach that the Australian government is taking. The Friends of Ermera can rest assured that the Australian government is helping East Timor to build effective national institutions and public administrations with their new revenue. Major increases in the Timor Sea revenues have the potential to underwrite East Timor's development in coming years. However, East Timor's transition to a stable and democratic nation will involve first and foremost strengthening law and governance. At this point, I congratulate the Australian defence forces on their fantastic work. I also recognise the efforts of the Minister for Defence, Brendan Nelson, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer, and, at the time, the Acting Prime Minister, Peter Costello. This has been a fantastic effort by the Australian defence forces. It is exceptionally dangerous and, with my background in the police force, I look with horror at how the ADF were required to disarm gangs who were looting with weapons such as knives and firearms. It is absolutely tragic what is happening over there. I commend the ADF. Now the Australian Federal Police are also on the ground, and their first task is to investigate the tragic murders of members of the police.

154,Dr EMERSON,ADJOURNMENT,"The Prime Minister has declared: If there is to be a single party in Queensland, then the only basis on which I would accept a single party in Queensland would be the Liberal Party. The Prime Minister is meeting Queensland federal Liberal MPs tonight to declare his total opposition to a merged party. So let us be clear that this is not a merger but a takeover of the Queensland Nationals by the Liberals. It is a capitulation by the Queensland Nationals. It is a capitulation by the member for Dawson, who has pretended to fight the privatisation of Telstra as a National but who now will join the very Liberals who have led the privatisation push. It is a capitulation by the member for Hinkler, who would now run as a Liberal. And it is a capitulation by the member for Wide Bay, the Deputy Leader of the National Party, who has joined us here tonight but who is now to become a Liberal. ‘Warren Truss, Liberal candidate for Wide Bay' has a certain ring about it, don't you think? I will chance my arm on the forthcoming redistribution and predict that a new seat will be in the Hinkler-Wide Bay area because both of those are heavily over quota, and that too would be contested by a Liberal. It is a capitulation by Senators Ron Boswell and Barnaby Joyce. We all know that Senator Boswell has long been a closet Liberal, but Senator Joyce has paraded himself as a fiercely independent Queensland National who stands up against the Liberals. Senator Joyce is set to join the Liberals. No more photos of angry confrontations between Senator Heffernan and Senator Joyce in the Senate. They are about to become the best of friends, bosom buddies. Senator Joyce complained about an election letter signed by the Prime Minister introducing his Senate team that failed to include Senator Joyce as a team member. Next time around the Liberals will include Senator Joyce on their team, but in the unwinnable No. 4 spot. Queensland National Party members might think that they can run as candidates for some sort of federal National Party, but they would be candidates for a National Party controlled 100 per cent by the Liberals. Barnaby, if it looks like a Liberal Party, if it walks like a Liberal Party and if it quacks like a Liberal Party, it is a Liberal Party. This is John Howard's nightmare. I was a staffer to Bob Hawke in 1987 when we returned from an overseas trip",120
155,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The member will refer to members and ministers by their title.,120
156,Dr EMERSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Thank you, Mr Speaker-to be told that a group of businessmen had lost faith in Mr Howard and had launched a ‘Joh for PM' campaign. On 31 January 1987, Sir Joh addressed a rally in Wagga and launched the ‘Joh for PM' campaign, telling a small group of admirers: I'm starting a bushfire today and it will go all over Australia. He said: I have some very, very good news for you today. The Coalition is finished. In explaining the reasons for his decision to destroy the coalition, he said: You can't walk with a foot on either side of a barbwire fence. It's very uncomfortable. He went on to say: And we will annihilate them and they will not be able to sustain their position. You cannot do the things they are doing and expect to win. You cannot win particularly when you have the record they've got. They are losers. He was not talking about the Australian Labor Party; he was talking about the Liberal Party. The Prime Minister then announced the 1987 election when Sir Joh was in Disneyland. Peter Charlton reported: The reaction when we rang Joh and said, ‘Look, the election's been called and you haven't even got a seat, you haven't been preselected, ven't got your organisation. What do you think?' Sir Joh replied: That Hawke hasn't called an election, has he? Oh that's ... goodness gracious ... The ‘Joh for PM' campaign destroyed any chance that Mr Howard might have had of winning the 1987 election. Now, 20 years later, the Prime Minister gets to relive his nightmare: the Queensland Nationals are about to destroy the coalition again, but this time they are going to destroy the coalition by agreeing to be taken over by the Liberals. This time it is not Sir Joh who is in Disneyland but the National Party leader. The Prime Minister knew two weeks ago about the talks that were going on but did not tell the National Party leader. His National Party colleague the member for Maranoa participated in the talks for two weeks, but he did not tell the National Party leader. The President of the Queensland National Party, David Russell, organised the talks but did not tell the National Party leader. The Queensland Nationals are about to abandon provincial Queensland-seats like Dawson, Hinkler and Wide Bay. We say to the people of Dawson, Hinkler and Wide Bay: you have no better friend than the Labor Party-a party committed to a nation building agenda; a party committed to making regional Australia a new engine of national economic growth. As Sir Joh famously declared 20 years ago, ‘The coalition is finished. Don't you worry about that.' Mrs Dorothy Edwards CBE",120
157,Mr MICHAEL FERGUSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Often in this parliament we draw aside, pay tribute, give recognition and pause to remember people who have contributed to national life, state life and local communities. Tonight I draw aside and pay tribute to you hathe life and achievements of Mrs Dorothy Edwards CBE, the first woman mayor of a major Australian city, who died in Launceston in March this year. Dorothy Edna Annie Edwards grew up in Deloraine, near Launceston, where her father was the local council clerk. She was educated at Launceston High School and later at the University of Tasmania. She studied at the London School of Economics and graduated as a Master of Arts. Mrs Edwards taught at Launceston High for many years. Many of my constituents remember her as an exacting and very professional teacher, in the best traditions and, if I may say, the old traditions of the Tasmanian state system. Dorothy Edwards joined the National Council of Women as secretary of the northern Tasmanian chapter and held many offices in the NCW and its international affiliate. A special tribute was paid to her at the civic memorial service in Launceston by Mrs Mollie Campbell Smith MBE, another of my distinguished constituents. Having grown up in a family involved with local government, Dorothy Edwards was incensed that the law prevented Tasmanian women from being elected to local councils. She campaigned for the Launceston Corporation Act to be changed to permit women to stand for the city council-and the law was changed in 1945. In 1949, Dorothy Edwards stood for election-the first woman to do so. Seven other candidates stood, and Dorothy Edwards was resoundingly elected second on the poll. She served as a Launceston alderman for 15 years and was Mayor of Launceston from 1955 to 1957. That does not seem so long ago, but Dorothy Edwards was the first woman in Australia to head one of its major cities. During her time as mayor and alderman, Dorothy Edwards was significantly involved in the major flood prevention measures built to protect the city from a repeat of the devastation of the very well known 1929 floods. After retiring from the council, she was Commissioner of the ABC from 1962 to 1975, served on the state library board for 25 years, was a member of the Decimal Currency Committee and was Chairman of the Board of the Launceston General Hospital. She was also involved in many other community affairs. She was Vice President of the International Council of Women from 1963 to 1979 and a Life Vice President of the National Council of Women Australia. Mrs Edwards was appointed OBE in 1958 and promoted to CBE in 1979. She was also admitted as a Freeman of the City of Launceston. The present Mayor of Launceston, Alderman Ivan Dean, and current and former aldermen of the City of Launceston honoured Dorothy Edwards with a civic memorial service at the very beautiful Albert Hall, where photographs of her life were shown and excerpts of a interview she recorded not long before her death were played. In recalling her as a former Mayor of the City of Launceston, I think it is important for me to say that Launceston is a very proud city. It is a historic city. It is, in fact, an early city of Australia. It was settled in 1806 and is this year celebrating its bicentennial year. I often say that Launceston is a place of proud history, spirited people and great natural beauty. Tonight I extend my sympathies to Mrs Edwards's son, Alan, and other members of her family. They can be enormously proud of their mother's contributions to Australian civic and cultural life and for being an important part of Launceston's culture, its civic life and now its history. I think it is important that the House record the achievements of our great citizens, and Dorothy Edwards certainly qualifies as a great Australian and a great Tasmanian. I know that all of my Tasmanian colleagues in this place and in the other place would want to associate themselves with these remarks.",121

The economic side is put by some as a criticism. considered, the economic argument is not a sider is whether to legislate to allow nuclear the utilities which choose whether to use it or nuclear movement push this line so strongly nomics of nuclear energy do stack up. Consider why this is so. Let us assume for the economics do not stack up; that nuclear electricity cerned about legislation that would allow nuclear nario, no utility would build a nuclear power place allowing nuclear power generation would seen, including an independent study recently economics do stack up-even for the current generation IV reactors will bring the price right down. Then there is the issue of nuclear waste. many people. There has been considerable misinformation been a lot of talk of needing to have the 250,000 years. This is unmitigated rubbish. that plutonium 239 has a half-life of 25,000 This can be seen for the errant nonsense that have one atom of plutonium 239 in 10 tonnes crete need to be stored for 250,000 years? Of course not. The simple fact is that it is the radioactivity that needs to be considered. In that case, the over 1,000 years, the radioactivity level of whence it came. Alternatively, you could simply 10,000 to one and put it in the hole that it that is used by coal-fired power stations with again. The reason that this is possible is that in these reactors is low, so they can never go reactors. They do not require much water, so it is of water. Effectively, they could be put anywhere be close enough to their markets that transmission IV reactors also do not require enriched uranium, times as long as it is assumed they will last for generation IV reactors, which will be modular in population centres and will allow multiple larger power demand. So, while the antinuclear years worth of high-grade uranium left if all the power, the reality is that current reserves, around 1,000 years, assuming no new reserves Nuclear power using generation IV reactors is In fact, when you look at what is being strong one. What this parliament needs to conpower generation. Economics should be left to not. Interestingly, the fact that many in the antiindicates that they are concerned that the ecoa moment that their argument is correct-that is too expensive. Why are they so conpower generation? After all, using this scestation. So whether enabling legislation was in be moot. Having said that, studies that I have commissioned by ANSTO, indicate that the generation of reactors. Economies of scale with This is a subject that is extremely sensitive to put out on this issue.
