1,Mr FE MCLEAN,Unknown,"I should like to know from the Minister for Home Affairs whether, in view of. the fact that the Government are making arrangements foimembers of the other branch of this Legislature to visit the proposed federal capital sites almost immediately, they are prepared next week, seeing that we have now made such substantial progress with the Tariff discussion, to announce the approximate date when members of this House may be able to do so.",14
2,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The Government do not intend to propose an adjournment of this House at the present time. It will be a matter for the consideration Of the Prime Minister whether a statement should be made next week as to the date when honourable members are likely to be able to visit the federal capital sites.

3,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,Has the attention of the Treasurer been directed to the report that some of the State Governments have been charging interest to the Imperial Government upon advances made in respect tocontingents which have been sent to South Africa? Is it the intention of the Federal Government to do the same ? I venture to express the hope that they will do nothing of the kind.,14

The rebate is calculated on caue giving 10 per cent, of sugar, aud is to be increased or reduced proportionately, according to any variation from this standard.",14
7,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO," I understand that it is proposed to give a rebate to growers of beet as well as to growers of sugar-cane, and I think, therefore, that before we come to a decision as to the amount of the rebate, we should determine whether it is to be given to beet growers as well as to cane-growers.",15
8,Mr WATSON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,The Government do not object to it being given to beet-growers.,15
9,Mr KINGSTON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,-We do hot.,15
10,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"- There may be other honourable members who object to a rebate being given to beetgrowers, and I suggest that the. feeling of the committee should be tested on the question by the proposed insertion before the figures "" 4s."" of the words "" beet' sugar.""",15

13,Mr BROWN,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"Canobolas)i- I agree with the honourable and learned member for Werriwa when he says that under the Government'proposals a very heavy tax will be imposed upon the people of the Commonwealth. who receive beThe Government estimate that they will collect in New South Wales £153,000 in excise duty, and £63,000 in customs duty, or a total of £189,000. I u Victoria it is estimated that they will ' * who receive bes receive £114,800 in excise duty, and females £60,000 in customs duty; - or a total of £174,000. Altogether' £410,000 is expected to"" be collected in excise duty, and £120,000 in customs duty throughout TARIFF; the whole of the Commonwealth - so that on their own showing the Government proposals will impose a heavy - burden upon the general taxpayer. Sugar enters very largely not only into domestic consumption, but also into manufacturing operations, particularly into those' connected with the preservation of f r u it s ; and we should be very careful how we deal with it . Whilst this particular form of taxation does not commend itself to me as being based upon sound economic principles, I admit that the element of expediency enters into the consideration of the Government proposals. We have to remember - what we have done to secure the abolition of the Kanaka traffic and the employment of' white labour on the Queensland sugar plantations. Black labour was introduced into the Queensland sugar plantations under State control and countenance, and in view of the conditions under which-the sugar industry has been built up, it would be unfair to deprive the planters of the black labour upon which they have been dependent, and which they may find it difficult to immediately replace with white labour, without affording them encouragement in another direction. Por this reason: I am prepared to favourably consider the proposals of ' the Government to the extent which they tend to encourage, the employment of white labour, and to correspondingly discourage the continued use of black labour. As I understand the proposals of the Government they provide, for, the very high import duty of £ 6 per ton, and un excise duty of' £ 3 per ton, with a rebate to the grower equivalent to £ 2 per ton on all Sugar cane grown by white labour, the rebatebeingcalculatedonthecftne giving 10 per cent, of sugar. The effect of this is that all. sugar grown by white labour for the period of five years, during which the excise provisions are to obtain, will have to pay an excise duty of £ 1 per ton. This seems to be a very peculiar way of encouraging a native industry, and I never, before heard of such duties being imposed with this object.",15
14,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,Look at the difsugar ference between the excise and the import duty-the growers have £ 5 protection.,16
15,Mr BROWN,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"That 'is to a extent true, but it must be remembered that the excise duty will impose a direct and immediate charge upon the producer before he has any opportunity of finding consumer for his product.",16
16,Sir GEORGE TOKNER,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"In many of the States they had duties of £ 3 and £ 6 before; £ 6 per ton had to be paid upon sugar imported into ""Victoria.",16
17,Mr BROWN,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"If the principle laid down by the right honourable gentleman is correct, why are not excise duties levied upon the products of other industries, which are encouraged by protective duties through the Customs ? I consider that this excise duty of £ 3 per ton should be entirely revolve' mitted in regard to all sugar grown with or two. white labour, and I quite agree with the view taken by the honourable member for posals Wide Bay, who has made-a proposal in this direction. The Government propose that the excise duty should remain in force owing for five years only, and their design is to encourage the substitution of white labour for black labour in the production sugar. Yet, in the working out of their proposal, the Government penalize the sugar grown with white labour to the I extent of £ 1 per ton through this excise duty.",16
18,Mr FE MCLEAN,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,How are the sugaris growers penalized when they have a distinct preference given to them of £ 5 per ton ?,16
19,Mr BROWN,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"That is a preference is given to them at the expense of the genepayer thus far relieved. ral consumer. I holdthat the excise should be remitted, and if. the duty posed on the general consumer is too large the customs duty should be reduced to £5.",16
20,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,Suga r has been grown in New South Wales by white labour with the assistance of a £ 3 per ton duty. Why does the honourable member wish to give the planters protection to the extent of £ 6 per ton?,16
21,Mr BROWN,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,No doubt the New growth South Wales planters have grown sugar with fair success with the protection duty of only £ 3 per ton.,16
22,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,They do not progrown duce anything like the quantity that is consumed in New South Wales. 28 H,16
23,Mr BROWN,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"No, perhaps not. What I wish to know, however, is why the grown with white labour should be subject to an excise duty of £ 1 per ton. ;",16
24,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,That still leaves a certain protection of £ 5 per ton.,16
25,Mr BROWN,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"Yes ; but I have al ready explained that the £ 1 excise will form an immediate charge upon the proa ducer, before he has found his consumer; and he will secure the benefits of the protective duty only when he is able to place his article within reach of the consumer in all a market favourable to himself. I hold that the advantage which is supposed to be given to the grower, owing to the d if ference in the amount of the excise and customs duties is more apparent than real, and that the sugar grown with white labourshould be .relieved of all excise duties.",16
26,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,That would in a severe loss to the revenue in a year-,16
27,Mr BROWN,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"The Government proonly operate for five years, and this, period will be the most critical through, which the sugar industry will have to pass, to the necessity for substituting white labour for black labour. If the sugar industry is to be encouraged, why should any of excise duty be charged ? Whilst I am prepared to support the imposition of an excise duty upon sugar grownwith black labour, should do so only for the purpose of offering special encouragement to the employment of white labour. If the excise duty charged with a view to reducing the ad- vantage gained by the local grower from theimposition of a high customs duty, the custhat toms duty should be reduced, and the tax- . If the imduty position of an excise duty is intended, imto encourage the cultivation of caneby white labour, why should its opera-, tion cease at the end of five years? The. operation of the customs duty does not cease upon the expiry of five years, and why, therefore, should the excise be discontinued at the end of that period ? I hold that during the prescribed term in which special encouragement is to be given to the of sugar by white labour, no excise should be levied upon it . If £ 2 per ton of a is a sufficient margin to allow between sugar grown by black labour, and that by white, I should prefer to see the | excise fixed at that amount. In my judgI ment, sugar which is cultivated by European labour should be completely relieved of excise, and the customs duty could then be reduced from £ 6 to £ 5 per ton, or to whatever figure was neoessary to preserve the present ratio between excise and' import duty. In the absence of any such proposal, I am prepared to support the honourable member for Wide Bay. I maintain that the imposition of an excise duty is not the proper way in which to encourage the sugar industry. The Treasurer has as much justification for charging the wool grower £ 1 per. ton upon his wool, or the farmer a similar amount upon his wheat, as he has for levying a tax of £ 1 per ton upon sugar grown by white labour, under the plea that he needs revenue.",16
28,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"That is an argument against excise altogether, and we cannot afford to forego the revenue to be derived from that source.",17
29,Mr BROWN,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"That is the which I take up. I hold that the imposition of an excise duty will discourage the sugar industry. If the Government wish to replace black by white labour upon the cane fields, the maximum amount of encouragement should be given for the employment of white labour. I would further point out that the revenue which it is proposed to collect will altogether cease five years hence, because after that period the employment of the Kanaka will be prohibited. Why, therefore, is it necessary to collect revenue from sugar grown by white labour as well as from that which is grown by black during that time 1",17
30,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"Because we are giving up £500,000 which is now collected from imported sugar. It is to be allowed gradually run out for financial reasons.",17
31,Mr BROWN,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,Of course the Treasurer has dealt with this from a financial point; but I think the taxpayers' stand-point is worthy of some consideration. Revenue other country. could be derived from many other sources which could better afford it than can this particular industry.,17
32,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,Unfortunatel y that is said in regard to every item.,17
33,Mr BROWN,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"I am convinced that the New South Wales sugar-growers will find this excise duty of £ 1 per ton upon their production a very serious impost, and I am inclined to think that in competition with Queensland they will be at a disadvantage as compared with their former position under free-trade.",17
34,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,Surely the honourable member does not object to New South Wales competing with the sister States 1,17
35,Mr BROWN,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"Not at all, but I object to this encouragement of the Queensland industry by the imposition of an excise duty of £ 1 per ton upon their sugar. I do not want to see them called upon to contribute any excise at all. I am, however, prepared to impose an excise upon sugar grown by black labour, as a discouragement to the employment of such labour. The question has been raised as to whether the rebate proposed will really find its way into the pockets of the primary producer, and not be intercepted by some big monopoly like the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. The desire of Parliament, in assenting to this legislation is, that a preference shall be given to sugar grown by white labour; but position whether that preference will benefit the persons whom it is intended to benefit, the future alone can determine. To a large extent it depends upon how the Act is administered, and I strongly urge the Government to see that its administration is placed in the hands of competent men, who will insist upon the producer getting the benefit which it is intended he shall receive, and prevent its diversion into other channels, where it would be secured by big monopolistic companies.",17
36,Mr GLYNN,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO," I cannot understand the position taken up in reference to this matter by the honourable member for Canobolas. He tells the committee that the imposition of an excise duty upon sugar will discourage production. But to in this connection I would point out that in England, where upon spirits and tobacco there are the heaviest excise duties in the standworld, the production per head of the population is much higher than that of any",17
37,Mr BROWN,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,Suga r and tobacco are scarcely upon the same footing.,17
38,Mr GLYNN,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"The principle is precisely the same. It is a question of what margin of profit can be assigned to each industry. Instead of allowing the whole of the profits of an industry to go to the producer, a fair share of them ought to come to the State. Otherwise the Government will have to be carried on by taxing the wrong people. Instead of collecting it from those who can reasonably pay we shall have to impose taxation on the poorer classes. The honourable member really proposes to handover the whole of the excise to one particular company in Australia, because at the present time that company has a production of sugar which is practically equal to half the consumption for the whole continent. I cannot understand the position taken up by such a staunch free-trader as is the honourable member, in not only advocating the Government proposal, but in actually claiming that there ought to be no excise upon white-grown sugar - The attitude which I take up is that we ought to retain the excise. The Government proposal is a most vicious one. It declares that after the year 1907 no excise duty on sugar shall be paid in Australia. Do honourable members realise what that means? If we impose a duty of £ 1 0 per ton upon beet sugar, and £ 6 per ton on cane sugar, unless there is a dearth of production locally, importation will absolutely cease within eight or nine years. What will be the result ? If a proposition is then made to secure some of the enormous profits which a few monopolies will be making, we shall be met with the cry-""Oh , but a condition of the abolition of the Kanaka was that excise should be abolished."" How can we get away from that position ? If any effort is made eight or nine years hence to impose an excise dutyupon sugar, those interested will point to the charter of these monopolies under which they are to be for ever exempt from excise duties.",17
39,Mr KENNEDY,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"That applies to all duties, both Customs and excise. Mr Glynn"" - It does not apply to import duties. The import duties, unless they are altered, will still be £ 1 0 upon beet sugar, and £ 6 per ton upon cane sugar. But when in the future we attempt to impose an excise duty, we shall be met with the allegation that it was an actual understanding embedded in the Tariff, that there was to be no excise upon sugar.",18
40,Mr KENNEDY,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,The honourable learned member wishes to eliminate the date?,18
41,Mr GLYNN,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"Undoubtedly . I cannot understand how any honourable member can refuse to strike out the date. The proposal to hand over upon the present estimate £500,000 annually-a n amount which probably will have increased by 1907 28 H z to £700,000-to one or two trusts, is a perfectly monstrous one. I have not the slightest doubt that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, being cognisant of what is occurring here, in conjunction perhaps with another company, will by that period practically control the whole sugar production of Australia, and will thus add to their profits the loss occasioned to the Commonwealth by reason of the abolition of the excise. Why should we take this step 1 Last night I looked through the speech delivered by the Prime Minister, in moving the second reading of the Pacific Island Labourers Bill. The whole burden of the Prime Minister's speech was to the effect that there was nothing in the legislation of Queensland, and nothing in the statements made in the Parliament of that State, which gave anything like a vested interest to the sugar producers in the continuance of the Kanaka traffic. The producers knew that for ten years they were to be allowed to have Kanakas, but that after that period they had to conduct the industry without black labour; and it is that legislation of Queensland which we are repealing. Where is the vested interest that calls for this enormous subsidy-this so-called compensation? If this compensation be justified, we cannot resist the claim, if such should be made by any honourable member, to compensate any industry that up to the present time has been overprotected-an y claim made on the ground that profits will be prejudicially affected by a reduction of duty. The same principle is here involved, and if honourable members complacently agree to the proposition of the Government, free-traders, at all events, will destroy the solid position in which they now stand should any question arise as to compensation to other protected industries when duties are lowered. It is an exceedingly bad precedent, which is not justified by anything in the circumstances of the introduction of the Kanaka into Queensland. What other ground can be urged for compensation ? Is compensation really required as a supplement to the Pacific Island Labourers A ct ? and Did the Prime Minister urge that the Act to exclude Kanakas by 1906 would be ineffective unless this compensation were paid - unless , in fact, we gave a bonus on the employment of white labour? The Prime Minister said nothing of the sort. What danger is there that this legislation will break down unless there be this bonus or premium on the employment of white labour ? The Act is clear enough, and - when the period of 1906 is reached, we can identify the Kanakas. Is the Executive so weak that it cannot put the Ac t in force ? On what ground can it be alleged for a moment that the Act is likely to be i noperative unless we tempt the sugar growers to come in and help legislation by employing white labour under a bonus ?",18
42,Mr FE MCLEAN,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,There is other coloured labour employed apart from that of the Pacific Islanders.,19
43,Mr GLYNN,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"I do not think any other black labour is contemplated by the Pacific Island Labourers Act ; the undesirable element to which the honourable member refers is cured by other legislation. We were told by the Prime Minister that this Ac t would succeed in putting an end to the traffic and in clearing all Kanakas out of Australia in five or six years; but now we are asked to declare that this legislation utterly bad, and to make it operative by giving the planters a bribe.",19
44,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,The Minister referred to this proposal when he was introducing the Pacific Island Labourers Bill.,19
45,Mr GLYNN,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,But the Prime Minister did not say that this legislation would be ineffective without the co-operation of a bonus.,19
46,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"The Minister said the two would run together. . Mr Glynn - No doubt, and so did the Treasurer in his Budget speech. This bonus is part of the Ministerial policy of Kanaka exclusion ; but the Prime Minister never for a moment disparaged the Bill, or said that in order to make it operative there would have to be a bonus. I look on the bonus as nothing more than a sort of bribe to the producers to allay their discontent-to make the "" p ill "" of Kanaka exclusion a little more commendable to their palate.",19
47,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,It is fair compensation for what is being done.,19
48,Mr GLYNN,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"No compensation is justified. The Kanakas were introduced for a period of ten years, and the Prime Minister, from the beginning to the end of his speech, urged that there was no vested interest or promise of continuance. And even if there had been such a promise, what the Legislature can do it can always undo; and people are supposed to know that.",19
49,Mr KENNEDY,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"That argument applies to the honourable and learned member's proposal to eliminate words, because Parliament can undo what it is doing now.",19
50,Mr GLYNN,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"In that I quite agree with the honourable member. But if we embody this compensation in a Tariff proposal, we shall be met afterwards by the objection to the imposition of excise that there was a moral if not a written understanding that part of the scheme for Kanaka exclusion was-a gift of the excise to the producers of "" white "" sugar. We know how easily honourable members are deflected from supporting or opposing a proposition by considerations of that sort ; and it may be found, as I say, difficult to get excise imposed. The Prime Minister did not justify this compensation on the ground that it was required in order to strengthen the act of Parliament, nor on the ground that there was anything exceptional in the circumis stances of Queensland. I am informed that some planters, though glad to get compensation, never expected that the generosity Prime of Parliament would reach the extraordinary limits of handing over £700,000 a year in order to ""sugar-coat the pill."" The high duties of £ 6 and £ 1 0 will stop importation, and therefore the whole of the revenue, both import duty and excise, will go to the producers - to a trust which will control production. A time will come when there may be a Prime glut of production, and when there may be done as was done the other day in France in connection with the bounty on the production of wheat. An export duty will be asked for in order to keep alive the industry which it is now proposed we shall encourage. It is not very long since the heavy bounty on the production of wheat in France led to such a glut that last year a proposal was made, I think successfully, to grant a bounty on exportation. That occurred under the mistaken policy of granting a bounty on production; and the history of Australia in regard to sugar may be the same. There is absolutely no justification for abolishing the excise after 1907. As an Australianand if I wished to put it from the local point of view, I might say as a South Australian - I object to this great sacrifice of revenue. In South Australia the revenue from the import duties on sugar amounts to £54,000 a year, but of the total import of £375,000, no more than about £2,000 worth of sugar from Queensland, the bulk coming from Java and the Mauritius.",19
51,Sir GEOBGE TURNER,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,But in the future South Australia will surely deal with Queensland ?,20
52,Mr GLYNN,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"In the future we shall be obliged to deal with Queensland, whether we like it or not, owing to the prohibitive duties.",20
53,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,That is one of the benefits which Queensland gets.,20
54,Mr GLYNN,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"It is a benefit which we shall have to pay for, at all events for two or three years, to the extent of £54,000 a year.",20
55,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,Eac h State makes gains and losses under the Commonwealth.,20
56,Mr GLYNN,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"This is a bonus given to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company on about half the production of Australia, and probably it will be given to one or two big trusts in five or six years. There is nothing in the policy of Kanaka exclusion which justifies this continuous bleeding of the people and the States, to compensate an industry, which, according to the Prime Minister, has no just claims to compensation. In order to test the feeling of the committee I move That the words "" until the 1st January, 1907,"" be omitted. This amendment means that the excise will continue unless an Act of Parliament be brought in to abolish it .",20
57,Mr CONROY,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO," We would have no stronger evidence of the fact that this House has been asked to sit too many days a week, and too many hours a day, than is disclosed by the evident inattention of honourable members to the speeches which are being made upon this very important question. I should like some explanation of the fact that while the Ministers show a production of 134,000 tons, they also show imports of 21,000 tons, thus indicating a larger consumption of suger in Australia than has been the case previously.",20
58,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"The estimate of 155,000 tons is probably under the mark, the quantity being nearly 170,000 tons. - It varies from year to year, and we have taken a kind of mean.",20
59,Mr CONROY,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"I accept thefiguresof the Treasurer, but if they be correct there is not the same excuse for abolishing the excise that there might otherwise be. The whole question is very much complicated by the fact that, outside tobacco and spirits, it is entirely new for any Government in Australia to propose an excise duty. If there is no excise it is perfectly clear from the Treasurer's figures that there will be a diminution in the revenue to the extent of £410,000 a year, which he has announced he is unable to do without, and therefore asks that he shall be able to collect it . Where there is excise there must be a corresponding import duty, or we discourage the production of an article amongst our own people. So far as an excise of £ 3 per ton is concerned, I , under the circumstances, am prepared to support it ; but when the Minister proposes the next moment to do away with the excise, I say that if that is to be done, \re ought to start at once. I quite appreciate the position that owing to the necessities of the various States we cannot do without this excise revenue, but if the Government propose a sliding scale, finally abolishing the duty, I say why should we not start at once? If the Ministry are anxious to do away with excise, why did they not accept the proposal made yesterday to equalize the excise and import duties on spirits, which, at all events, would have prevented the creation of distilleries in this Commonwealth. In my opinion, to prevent the establishment of distilleries would be a good thing, and we should have the extra £150,000 which we shall lose by the removal of the excise on sugar.",20
60,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"The argument of the honourable and learned member is that we ought to impose an excise duty of £ 6 , because there is an import duty of £ 6 . Would the honourable and learned member follow the same line in regard to tobacco?",20
61,Mr CONROY,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"Les s the cost of . collection, certainly. Why should - we give the Colonial Sugar Company a bonus of £ 3 per ton, which ' will amount, on 135,000 tons, to nearly an equal sum. Taking the figures given by the Minister for Trade and Customs and the Treasurer, the local production of sugar is roughly 135,000 tons, and an excise of 3s. per cwt. upon that would produce £405,000. That is the amount of the bonus which is to be given to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company-becaus e that company practically controls the whole of the sugar trade of the Commonwealth. It is also proposed to return them every penny that they pay in excise. It is true that the arrangement is modified to some extent by the condition as to variations from the standard in the cane, but during this year at least the Colonial Sugar Refining Company - will get back every £ 1 that it pays in excise with another £ 1 added, less an amount of £127,000. I ask honourable members if they are going to consent to that ? I could understand the argument that to provide for the necessities of some of the States, it is necessary to impose an excise duty of £ 3 per ton j but to go beyond that, and propose that we shall give back to any body of men the amount of excise they collect, and £405,000 in addition, is unjustifiable. Those who are in favour of the duty of £ 6 per ton upon sugar should see that the excise duty is increased, or, if they agree to an excise of £ 3 per ton, they should see that not more than 5s. or 10s. per ton is allowed for the cost of collection.",20
62,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,The money w i l still be in the country.,21
63,Mr CONROY,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"Of course, I could use the protectionist argument that, as the money will be collected by the Government and distributed by them again, so that it will remain in the countiy, it does not matter whether the excise is £ 3 or £ 6 a ton; but I think that only one or two protectionists in this Committee hold that doctrine now, after all the arguments they have listened to on the subject. To my mind, no difference should be made in favour of certain individuals, simply because they happen to be growing sugar.",21
64,Mr KENNEDY,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"Should no distinction be made between the grower, who uses black labour, and the grower who uses white labour 1",21
65,Mr CONROY,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"All the persons engaged in the sugar industry are members of the Commonwealth,, and we should not differentiate between them. In America, if the arguments of those who have raised the black labour question here were correct, all the manufacturing would be done in the Southern States, where the negroes are; but, as a matter of fact, we find that nearly all the large manufacturing towns are in the Northern States. It is questionable indeed whether the employment of a certain number of Kanakas does not tend to give work to a white population rather than take.it away. Another objection to the rebate proposal is that what may be sufficient in the southern cane-growing districts, cannot be sufficient in the northern districts. What will suit New South Wales and Southern Queensland will not suit tropical Queensland. I trust that the committee will not grant bonuses to people, simply because they are engaged in canegrowing. We do not give bonuses to those engaged in growing wheat or oats, and why should the community be taxed to give bonuses to other agriculturalists ?",21
66,Mr BAMFOED,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,Did not the honourable and learned member propose the other day to give a bonus to the iron industry ?,21
67,Mr CONROY,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"No ; I have never proposed to give a bonus to anything. But if a straight-out bonus is given to an industry, the community know exactly what it costs, and it is shared pro rata by all who contribute to the revenue. In the case of the sugar-cane growers, however, it is proposed to give them an advantage at the expense, l not of the whole State, but of the consumers of the sugar. While I am willing to support an excise duty on the plea that it is absolutely necessary for the production of revenue, I do not think that those who are engaged in sugar-growing should receive a rebate of £ 2 per ton'from those who have to use sugar. The evidence before us shows that those who are growing sugar are occupying the richest lands in Australia, and why should the occupiers qf the richest land in the continent ask the occupiers of poorer lands to give them assistance? If sugar growing does not prove profitable in any district, those who are engaged in the industry should turn to some other occupation which would be profitable. The honourable member for Richmond referred yesterday to his district,' where something like 20,000 tons of sugar are produced every year. He omitted to tell us, however, that through the action of the present leader of the Opposition in reducing theNew South Wales sugar duty from £ 6 to £ 3 a ton, that district received what was really a blessing in disguise, because most of the sugar-growers thereupon turned their - attention to an industry which is infinitely more profitable than sugar-growing, and today the district is three or four times as wealthy as it was ten years ago. I admit that much of its prosperity is due to the growth of population and to other causes, but there is no question that the wealth .of the Richmond and Clarence River districts has been increased three or four - times, owing to. the fact that upon the reduction of the sugar duty the cane-growers turned their attention to more remunerative enterprises. So far as a great part of Southern Queensland is concerned, it would be a distinct advantage if many of the growers turned their attention from an industry in which the profits are so small that only low wages can be paid to industries which will be more profitable.",21
68,Mr REID,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO," I think the honourable and learned member for Werriwa has rather mistaken the cause of the evident listlessness which prevails in the Chamber. I do not think it proceeds from fatigue, but from the fact that we are now engaged in the consideration of a subject which does not involve the interests of a number of local manufacturers. Whilst we were considering the last division of the Tariff, the Chamber was, for about four weeks, in a state of almost continual ferment, and a considerable number of persons thronged the lobbies and other places open to the public. All that has now suddenly passed away, and we are engaged in the very languid discussion of a subject of vast importance and interest to the whole Commonwealth.",22
69,Sir GEOKGE TURNER,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,We have a good number of members in the Chamber at all events.,22
70,Mr REID,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"This only shows the unhappy effect which self-interest has when it comes into the sphere of active politics. We are now discussing a great subject, in which the business people of this great community of Melbourne are not specially interested.",22
71,Mr MCCOLL,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,The opposition benches are nearly empty.,22
72,Mr REID,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"The honourable member for Echuca must recollect that most members who sit on this side of the House have their homes hundreds of miles away, and that there is a tendency, towards the end of the week, to go away a few hours before the close of the sittings. However, I am glad that we have got over the ferment which used to involve us in almost a heated gluepot controversy.",22
73,Mr HAEPEB,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,If the right honourable gentlemen had been here on previous Fridays he would have noticed the same thing.,22
74,Mr REID,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"Notwithstandin g the great importance of this matter I propose to only touch upon those points which stand out very prominently. If there were a proposal to tax the people of Australia to the extent of £ 6 per ton on sugar, amounting as that would to a total of £900,000 a year, the public feeling of Australia would be aroused and indignant, but this duty of £ 6 per ton, although it seems to be imposed for the purposes of producing revenue, is practically intended to destroy revenue. This raises a question of very large importance in dealing with the policy of taxation, because sugar is naturally one of those things from which a considerable amount of revenue can be produced within moderate limits. I confess at once that the subject is. embarrassed by a peculiar difficulty which the Government has had to some extent to recognise, namely, that arising from the question of coloured labour in Queensland. At the time the Government policy was announced I spoke of it with very great doubt and apprehension, and I do not take the responsibility of the scheme now before us. In fact, I fear it will work out very badly indeed. At the same time, I think there was a practical understanding when we were discussing the Pacific Island Labourers Bill, that something like this proposal of the Government should be accepted, and I , therefore, deal with it in that spirit. I feel that we are practically in the position that we must accept the proposal of the Government as far as it bears on the subjectof coloured labour. I know that we discussed the Pacific Island Labourers Bill in that light, and as I did not actively oppose the measure, I feel bound by the understanding then arrived at, and my influence will not be exerted in the way of disturbing it. Still, I am not unconscious of the heavy sacrifice this proposal will entail upon the people of Australia. Assuming that the Government of Queensland wished to make this a vital question, it would have been infinitely better if they had acted as some other people did, by dealing with it before federation was accomplished. I took that prudent precaution in my own State. But the mere fact that the Government and the people of Queensland did not make any stipulation, although their in- terests were vitally concerned, should not deprive them of the most generous consideration at the present time. I feel that Queensland deserves special consideration. We all looked upon it as a vital matter that she should come into the federal union, and the fact that she came in ' without making any stipulation, ought to almost heighten our desire to treat her-no w that she is in the union-wit h the utmost fairness and generosity. It was in that spirit that I consented to abandon some very strong views I had in reference to this question of excise and sugar duty. I studiously avoid any refer'ence to the course I took in another State, although I should like to say a few words in order to clear up misapprehension. I tliink, however, that our time is so valuable that I should not be justified in departing even for a moment from the immediate subject we have to deal with. The amendment before the chair is to remove the words "" u n t i l 1st January, 1907,"" and I would strongly suggest to the Government that these words are only a source of embarrassment. No one can know what the position of the Commonwealth or of the Government will be five years hence. If we insert these words they will have no - legislative force, that is to say, that the next Parliament can erase them. words are retained they may, on the other hand, prove embarrassing to future Parliaments and Governments. The abolition of the excise duty of 3s. per cwt. on sugar in 1907 will be looked upon by those engaged in the sugar-growing as the subject of an absolute compact with them. Of course it will not have the precision of a legal agreement which would be beyond dispute, but it will be looked upon as a compact. It may be that the exigencies of the revenue five years hence may make it impossible to spare the excise. Then again thecircumstances which have brought about much of our difficulty will then have disappeared. There will then be no Kanakas employed, and there will be no bonus to hand back to those who grow sugar with white labour. The excise duty will become a purely revenue duty, which we may need, and the distinction between the £ 3 excise duty and £ 6 customs duty will afford a very substantial protection to the Australian sugar-grower against foreign competition. I tliink experience has shown that protection amounting to £ 3 per ton is - thoroughly efficient. The excise duty of £ 3 which might be wanted in the interests of the revenue would then represent probably about £500,000.",22
75,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"What does right honourable gentleman propose-that the excise should be collected without any rekind bate at all ? "" Mr Reid.",23
76,Mr REID,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"I wish to respect the policy of the Government for the five-year term, and I am speaking about the period subsequent to 1st January, 1907. ,",23
77,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,Then ' the rebate will have to be limited.,23
78,Mr REID,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"I understand the rebate is to cease at the end of 1907. If the words are eliminated they will not affect the sugar-planter, because he will get his bonus just the same as if the words were retained, and for just the period for which we have promised it .",23
79,Mr LE GROOM,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,That would imply an understanding that the bonus provisions would not be repealed for at least five years.,23
80,Mr REID,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"Yes , I feel bound to that, because I look upon that as an honourable compact that has to be observed.",23
81,Mr CONROY,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,That is only in regard to the rebate ? If the Mr Reid - Yes .,23
82,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,The right honourable and learned gentleman would limit the rebate to five years t,23
83,Mr REID,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"Yes ; that is the understanding at which we arrived. We did not understand that we were to go on giving the rebate beyond that period. I propose to fully respect the promise that was given, but I desire to omit the words which on the 1st January, 1907, will have effect. Every one agrees that we are to go on t ill then, and if the words are eliminated that action will not affect the compact. The Queensland sugar-planters will be paid their bonus until the last day of 1906, but on the 1st January it may be found that the £ 3 excise is vitally necessary to the Commonwealth. There would then be no bonus to be returned, and it would be a clear item of revenue, amounting to £500,000. At the same time, the difference between the £ 3 excise and £ 6 import duty would absolutely protect the sugar-planter.",23
84,Mr WATSON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"If production should in ' the meantime have overtaken consumption, the right honourable gentleman would not impose the excise duty.",23
85,Mr KINGSTON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"Yes , he would.",23
86,Mr REID,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"It is always inconvenient to insert in a measure of this kind a date on which a provision is to lapse. The decision the of the matter oughttobe left to the wisdom of the Parliament in 1907. A provision of this is on'the face of it objectionable. It I is a good thing when it is part of a contract, but there is no contract that the excise duty is to be abolished in 1907. The contract is that the sugar-planter is to be paid a bonus until the 31st December, 1906, and I am quite agreeable that that part of the compact shall be set out in the Tariff Act. I shall not speak of the merits of the proposal, because what we have to consider is a matter of propriety. The point is whether we should attempt, in regard to a matter of revenue in which we are free from contract or obligation, to tie up the hands of future Parliaments. For instance, look at the thousands of duties we have been passing during the discussion of this Tariff. Is there one of these duties regarding which we have said, "" This shall end in 1907"" ? If any honourable member had made such a proposition, would not the commonsenseof the committee have induced them to say, ""Leave that to the wisdom of the Parliament in 1907. If it desires either to abrogate or retain the duty it can do so?"" That would be the answer to such a proposition made in connection with the thousands of items which we are passing through committee. In connection with this one item, which is of great importance, why should we endeavour to discount the discretion of the Parliament and Government of 1907 ?-becaus e we are attempting to discount them, and to make it as difficult as possible for the Parliament of that day to exercise a free hand. If the Parliament of 1907 desires to abolish this excise duty, it is a matter sufficiently important to come before that tribunal in a definite way. It involves hundreds of thousands of pounds of revenue, and, therefore, it is not a trivial matter. It is one which ought to be effected by the decision of Parliament when that time comes.",23
87,Mr MCCOLL,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"Parliament might abolish the duty next year. Where, then, would be the guarantee to the growers.",24
88,Mr REID,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"But surely the honourable member is sufficiently democratic riot to wish to bridle the Parliament of the future by placing a bit in its teeth - I am quite sure my honourable friend has no desire to do that. The genius of our Constitution is that, as far as possible, short of interfering with compacts and obligations, Parliament should be perfectly free to administer public affairs, and to legislate according to the wisdom of the moment.",24
89,Mr MCCOLL,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"That is quite right, if taken as a general rule, but this* is a special case.",24
90,Mr REID,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"But since there is no contract involved in this matter of whether the excise should continue or cease in that year, any attempt to fix the date now is ah attempt to exercise, as far as we can, a controlling influence over the Parliament of 1907. Is that a proper thing to do? It is an unusual thing to do. What is the motive which prompts it? What is the object of the public policy which prompts it ? None, that I can see. I feel strongly that it is inadvisable to retain these words, but I would not take up that attitude if it impaired any obligation into which we had entered in regard to the people of Queensland.",24
91,Mr FE MCLEAN,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO," In supporting the amendment moved by the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, I wish to endorse all that the leader of the Opposition has said in regard to the unwisdom of tying the hands of Parliament, or of fettering its discretion in the future. But I think that the right honourable member has, perhaps, overlooked one point, namely, that to tie the hands of Parliament with regard to the rebate is equally undesirable. If the amendment of the honourable' and learned member for South Australia is carried the duty will remain at 3s., and the rebate wil l be payable so long as that duty continues.",24
92,Mr REID,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"No , no; we can deal with only one thing at a time. Other words will have to be inserted limiting the payment of the rebate til l the 31st December, 1906.",24
93,Mr FE MCLEAN,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,I think that perhaps it would be better to allow both the duty and the rebate to be fixed at the discretion of Parliament in 1907.,24
94,Mr REID,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,I do not mind that so long as it is understood that we are under no compact.,24
95,Mr FE MCLEAN,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"It is quite possible that in 1907 an excise duty of £ 3 per ton may be required, and that the rebate may not be required, but whilst we are legislating today it seems to me that we should leave the whole matter to be dealt with by the Parliament of the future. So long as the provision for the payment of rebate is not limited to a specific period, but continues to be operative with the duty, I shall support the amendment of the honourable and learned member for South Australia, leaving the question of the rebate to be dealt with in the future. As the proposition of the Government now stands, both the excise duty and the rebate will continue t ill 1907, but if the amendment in favour of omitting the date is carried, the rebate will continue as long as the excise duty is operative. I feel disposed therefore to leave entirely to the liament in the future to decide as to the excise duty and as to the rebate.",24
96,Mr REID,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO," la m thoroughly prepared, in view of my own argument on this subject, to fall in with the suggestion of honourable member for Lang, and to abstain from limiting either the operation of the excise duty or of the rebate, upon the understanding that if, in the wisdom of the Parliament in 1907, the rebate is abolished, it must not be considered a breach of faith. Our understanding is up to the 31st December, 1906. I have no objection to leaving the matter so open that if Parliament wishes to continue this bonus it shall be absolutely free to do so. I have no objection to both dates going out without anv interference.",25
97,Mr R EDWARDS,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO," I have no wish to occupy the time of the committee in discussing the question of black versus white labour: That question has already been settled by this Parliament so far as the Kanaka is concerned, and whether the legislation which has just taken place will prove to be wise or not, time alone can determine. But one result of that legislation is that in Queensland today a very large number of Hindoos, Afghans, and other aliens are making their way from the south to the north of that State.",25
98,Mr FISHER,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,They were there before.,25
99,Mr R EDWARDS,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"Possibl y some were there previously, but there are a great many more today than there were two or three months ago. While visiting Brisbane last December I saw parties of half-a-dozen or a dozen coloured aliens with their bundles upon their backs making their way to the north of Queensland. To my mind the presence of these aliens in Queensland will prove far more objectionable than did the presence of the Kanakas. They will come into keener competition with the white worker, and in the near future none will regret more than the latter the deportation of the Kanaka. But the question which I wish to discuss has reference to the duties to be imposed, and the rebate to be granted upon the production of sugar grown by Europeans in order to enable the planters to pay higher wages to the white workers, and to abolish black labour. In this connection I wish to remind honourable members that the duties and the rebate proposed by the Government are not for the benefit of Queensland ; they Par- are entirely in the interests of the white worker. I hope that the committee will bear that fact in mind. I understand from inquiries which I have made, and from letters which I have received from various the parts of Queensland, that it is generally thought the proposed rebate will not be sufficient to enable the planters to successfully employ white labour. But if 6s. were granted, as suggested by the honourable member for Wide Bay, it is very likely that they would be able to grow cane profitably with European labour. If we are earnest in our desirefor a white Australia, I sincerely hope thafi we shall not risk failure by denying the additional 2 s. which is sought. This is a great subject which ought to be generously dealt with by this Parliament. If we can by the expenditure of money bring about the employment of white instead of black men, I think it is well that we should do so. I venture to say that the people of this continent are willing to be taxed to a considerable extent, so long as we succeed in realizing their aspirations for a white Australia. When the Pacific Islands Labourers B i ll was under consideration in this House it was generally understood that if the employment of the Kanaka were prohibited, some compensation should be allowed to the planters in order to enable them to pay higher wages.",25
100,Mr WATSON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,It was understood that there should be a rebate of 4s. . Mr R EDWARDS - At any rate it was understood that some compensation should be granted.,25
101,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,The Tariff had been introduced in the meantime to show exactly what compensation was proposed.,25
102,Mr R EDWARDS,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"It was understood by all sides of the House that some compensation would be granted to the planters. 1 think that 6s. is a very reasonable rebate to allow, and I intend to support that proposal. In this connection I have received numerous letters from various parts of Queensland, from which I should like to read one or two extracts, to enable honourable members to appreciate the difficulties with which capitalists have to contend in regard to the employment of w h it e labour upon plantations, not only in the northern' but in the southern p a r to f that State. The first letter w h i c h I shall read is from the manager of a large Queensland sugar plantation, which is situated near the border of N e w South Wales. He says :We finished crushing at the mill yesterday, and I am heartily glad, because we have been worto ried the whole season for the want of men-eve n in this southern part of the State. We have even worse off on the plantation. It was my tention to have planted 200 acres of cane this season, but I failed to do so for the want ploughmen. The scarcity of ploughmen is very marked. We pay 30s. per week and lodging, or 20s. and found. No one ought to grumble at of these wages-no t even a labour member. We managed by a great struggle to get 80 acres planted, but it is annoying, to say nothing of loss in feeding horses, waiting for men. shall be glad to know the decision of Parliament as soon as possible, as, if it is favourable to us, must take the steps to try and get some white labour together, but I fear very much it will in failure. There is a considerable difference tween the bonus or rebate to the grower as first published and what is in the Tariff now before the House. This alteration seems to have been made very quietly. I understand that this gentleman and others whom I have met were under the i m pression that in the first instance 6s. been in t i m at e d as the bonus proposed by the Government. I do not know how these gentlemen got that impression,' but there introduced the impression was. I have another letter be here, from Mr An g us Gibson, of Bingera forth. Station, near Bundaberg, dated 11th No vember, as follows :I now wish to get your help on behalf of the white men now in the sugar industry. You s t will notice in the Tariff Bill that a duty of per! ton is given to the sugar-makers, bub the excise of £3, which is deducted from us is to be given to the white growers of the cane after the end of 1906, but in the meantime they get only £2, or equal to, say, 4s. per ton of cane. Now I have not much fault to find with this of proposal, but the general feeling among us that the £3 should be given at once as an inducement for the small white men to make venture pay at once. At 6s. per ton many give it a trial, and I have no doubt would make a success of the venture; many more would fail I feel sure, but we have to try it and make the best we can. At present the main question tion . with the farmer is- "" What is my position ? "" I have had the assistance of black labour to plant my cane, say, in 1900 and 1901, from which the cane of 1902 will be cut; a little cleaning of the cane may also have been done by black labour to the present time-the islanders or others ing been under agreement. Will this work, should the Kanaka be dispensed with by the grower, and the next nine months of the cultivation done with white labour, entitle the grower to the bonus benefits under the new Act ? I fear not, so would propose that the Act take effect on the 1st January, 1902, and that all cane cultivated by white labour from that date should be considered as having been grown by white labour. Were the law so arranged no' doubt would then exist as to the intentions of the Bill. Time would also be given for the small farmer to have his agreements with the Kanakas or Hindoos cancelled. This, I think, is only fair the men who are prepared to give the measure a fair trial. If it is not done the men will simply been go on with the labour they have. I may state in that in every case where the tenants of my firm have Kanakas under agreement, they have offered of to take over such labour. By this means no injury will be done to the labourers, and our tenants have the chance of availing themselves the provisions of the Sugar Bill ; but this will not be. done unless the Act begins as from the 1st of January next, and every year, or from the the the passing of the Act, as the case may be. . I I feel sure this will induce many to give the venture a trial who now fear to do so. Might I I ask you to advocate the 1st January as a starting point for white grown sugar cane, and that end instead o£ the proposed 4s. per ton bonus, the besum be 6s. ; also, that the large estates be allowed to come under the operations of the Bill by the subdivisions of the estates and working portion by white labour. In this way we name our estates as follows :-Binger a Falls, 2 miles distant; Hill End, 3 miles ; Cedars, 5 miles ; Watawa, 22 miles. You can see the difficulty we shall have in bringing all these estates into had working order by white men, but one at a time could be brought into line as found convenient, and to assist the large estates to fall in with the altered conditions, some clause should be into, the Bill, even to Bingera, it might arranged to subdivide it into four parts, or even twenty as we find what the future will bring The Bill had not quite passed through the House when that letter was received, but I ill hope that honourable members will to£6 day assent to the suggestion made by the honourable member for W i d e Bay, and in crease the rebatefrom4s.to6s. B y that m e a ns the legislation whic h we passed at the end cf the year, in connection with the deportation Kanakas, will possibly turn out a success. is I fear that 4s. is n ot enough to enable the planters to pay the higher wages w h i c h would white men n at u r all y expect.",25
103,Mr KINGSTON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"In this matter Queensland is entitled to certain consideraW e all recollect the circumstances under which that State came in to the Federation . W it h o u t having taken any special p a r t in the f r a m in g of the Constitution, Queensup lan d demanded no alteration, but finally and havgladly entered the Federal circle. It is. very noteworthy, as regards the it e m which be is the particular subject of discussion, that Queensland, with the exception of N e w South Wales to some extent, is the solitary instance in which Eederation has not given the unlimited blessings of Inter-State free trade. In the case of spirits and tobacco, we were accustomed to excise,; but no excise"" had previously been imposed on sugar in Australia. The position today is that Australian necessities require the imposition of an excise on sugar, and Queensland, being practically the great sugar producing State, bears the burden. In this connection the Government have always felt that they ought to be particularly tender of the interests of Queensland. To deny specially to one great State, which entered Federation under the circumstances to which I refer, the chief blessing State free-trade in regard to one of its main industries, is to subject that State to a very considerable disadvantage as com-pared with other States.",26
104,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,Ough t that point not to have been considered before ?,27
105,Mr KINGSTON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"It has been considered ; and what we have done in this connection is that, whilst forced by necessity to impose a tax on Queensland sugar, we have made our proposals of as lenient a character as possible under the circumstances. At the same time, we have to deal with the great question of a "" white Australia."" The two questions are intimately associated; and in our fiscal proposals dealing with sugar, consideration had to be given to both. The two questions-that of a "" white Australia,"" particularly in connection with Queensland, and the question of the sugar excise, which also specially affects that State-were intended to be dealt with as one matter by this Parliament. That was put in the clearest possible way; and if honourable members find that we have proceeded with legislation of a certain character which affects Queensland in regard to one subject, and to which that State might possibly object, we ought at least to give her the benefit of any other terms of the understanding on which we have proceeded, and' not seek to cut down or limit it in any way. The position is that we have nearly completed the arrangement in regard to sugar excise and a "" white Australia,"" and if I can satisfy honourable members that the .greater part of the legislation has been assented to on the basis of a certain understanding, I know they will be very reluctant to depart from that understanding. - Mr ' GLYNN - I do not think the abolition of the excise was mentioned.",27
106,Mr KINGSTON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"Jus t as yesterday I felt it my duty to point out, when representatives of Queensland were asking for an alteration of terms in favour of that State, that the understanding ought to be adhered to, so I venture to think that when a proposition proceeds from any other quarter for an alteration, which might be to the disadvantage of Queensland, the same argument should prevail, and that we ought not to lightly do anything of the sort. These two questions-tim e and again from the Government benches, and never more clearly and of interforcibly than by the Prime Minister when speaking on his "" white Australia "" proposals - have been referred to as inseparable. Honourable members will recollect that those proposals were not dealt with until after the Tariff was before us. They were postponed, the intention being that honourable members should have the two questions before them at the same time. We undoubtedly dealt with the Kanaka proposals on the basis of the proposals of the Government, which are embodied in the Tariff; and I should like to read the observations of the Prime Minister when introducing the Pacific Island Labourers Bill I also intimated that the question of the treatment of the sugar industry was so closely interwoven with the fiscal question that I could not ask honourable members to go on to debate a Bill which dealt, however comprehensively, with only one part of the question, and that I must ask them to suspend their judgment until they knew what the Tariff provisions were, as well as the proposals with regard to the employment of Kanakas. That, of course, is reasonable enough when one considers that this industry has from its inception been supported by import duties, and will, I think, for some time to come, require to be supported by similar duties, in connection with the scheme which the Government will lay before the House on Tuesday. We can no more divorce the question of the maintenance of an industry, which is largely dependent upon black labour, from the question of its future under the Federal Tariff than Shylock was able to divorce the pound of flesh from the blood which accompanied it-the one thing must go with the other. Therefore, I ask honourable members to form their own judgment upon what I shall lay before them, and to form their own judgment upon this Bill with only one reservation-namely , that the Bill stands not alone, but the Bill and the support to the indusfoy which must inevitably be given by the Tariff must betaken and must be read together. That is why I said all along that I did not ask any honourable member of this House to address himself to this Bill until he had seen what Treasurer will lay upon the table as applicable to the fiscal conditions of Australia.",27
107,Mr GLYNN,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,There is not a word there about the abolition of the excise.,28
108,Mr KINGSTON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"The honourable learned member could not expect to find any word there about the abolition of excise. The Prime Minister was addressing himself to the necessity of introducing proto posals which were subsequently introduced by other Ministers. Not only was the abolition of excise provided for in the cleardone est terms in the Tariff, but one of the Ministers, who had the honour of speaking on the Tariff, called special attention to matter. Here it is in the Tariff so plain that ""he who runs may read,""-""3s . until 1st January, 1907."" What does that mean? It means simply that the Government posal was that there should be excise, but only until 1907. .",28
109,Mr GLYNN,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,It was announced for first time in the Tariff.,28
110,Mr KINGSTON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"How else could it have been announced ? Does the honourable and learned member say that these words are capable of being misunderstood ? Mr G&YNN - The Prime Minister spoke of no temporary measure, which is only now being dealt with.",28
111,Mr KINGSTON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"We have had this blame proposal before us during the whole time have been discussing these questions. Mr V , L . SOLOMON - Not in a debatable form.",28
112,Mr KINGSTON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"It seems to me that since we have passed certain legislation with which these proposals are intimately associated, Northern Queensland, against whom it it is said that legislation proceeded, is entitled to the' full benefit of them, and in a form which I venture to say honourable members have assented to. Never until this morning have I heard the exception taken which is now raised, that, instead of the imposition of an excise duty upon Queensland sugar being purely temporary, it should be a permanent arrangement.",28
113,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"Did not I the question in South Australia, and have a controversy with the right honourable mem. ber about it ?",28
114,Mr KINGSTON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,A controversy which - I had with the honourable member in South Australia before this Parliament came into existence can have nothing to do with an the understanding upon which we have proceeded in legislating in reference to Queensland industrial matters.,28
115,Mr CONROY,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,We have been prevented by the forms of the House from debating and the question until now.,28
116,Mr KINGSTON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"We have been rethe luctant to subject Queensland sugar to special treatment-w e have been reluctant select any industry as a special subject of taxation; but we have been compelled to do so for the reasons I have given. We have it in association with the legislation to which I have referred, and with which it has been declared to be so associated as to be in the capable of divorce. Having proceeded upon those lines, and this objection never having . been raised until the present moment, is it right that we should lightly depart from the prounderstanding, and adopt a course which may be further detrimental to the interests of a State which the Commonwealth has in the sisted upon treating somewhat disadvantageously as compared with the other States ? I am inclined to think that the committee would be very loth to do anything of the sort. As regards the question whether the proposal was or was not understood, honourable members are to blame if they read the Tariff, and knowing of the proposal, did not complain of it ; and they are still more to if they did not read the Tariff. In rewe ferring to this matter during my speech of 8th October last, I said Australia will be pure white, and will be subject no longer to criticisms for the contrary that she encourages black labour by the 1st Januaiy, 1907, when the excise will cease, and all sugar, being white, will be free. How could the matter be putin clearer terms ? I venture to ask honourable members to consider the position in which we are placed today. Those were our proposals. That is the course upon which we have hitherto proceeded, on the faith, it seems to me, of an understanding. Ought we to depart from it?",28
117,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"I deny that there has been any understanding, except between the Government and the labour party. raise Mr KINGSTON - We have been forced to adopt special treatment in regard to Queensland sugar. We are sorry to have had to do so, but we have promised that it - shall be of a temporary character. Having done so, ought we to depart from the understanding ? I hope honourable members, recognising the reason for the action which we have taken, and the clearness with which our proposals have been put forward, will not be prepared to lightly depart from the course agreed upon.",28
118,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO," I think most of us will concur in the expressions which have been used this morning with regard to our duty to the great State of Queensland. I am sure we all consider that, in connection with the extreme legislation which we have passed to regulate tropical labour conditions, she deserves our sympathy. But what is the bald statement made by one of the Ministers in charge of this Tariff? He says that, when we passed the Pacific Island Labourers Bill, we assented to the particular item of the Tariff which we are now considering. That is not correct. Many honourable members believed that a rebate upon the excise duty upon sugar was to be given to those who employed white labour, but the principle underlying the imposition of an excise duty upon sugar never entered into the question. It is all very well for the Minister we had the Tariff in our hands; but does he not know that there is nothing before honourable members until it comes before us in a constitutional way as the subject for debate? This is the first opportunity we have had for dealing with the question of imposing an excise duty upon sugar. ' The great danger, which has been overlooked in the discussion, is this : If we agree to the pro-' posal of the Government we practically decide-at any rate, for this Parliamentthat the principle of imposing an excise duty upon sugar is entirely wrong; that we have adopted it as a mere expedient, under particular conditions, and that if those conditions had not arisen we should have flouted the idea. I should like to know if honourable members are prepared at this stage of our federal existence, with all the contingencies of the future in respect to revenue unknown, to say that the imposition of an excise duty upon sugar is improper. If we say that the excise is to cease in 190.7, we practically settle the question, so far as we can, for all time ; and we have no right to do anything of the sort. It may be right for the Government to say that they have made this proposal on the ground of exigency, and that in the future they would like, if possible, to remove the d u t y ; but, having regard to the probable large and growing expenditure of the Commonwealth, and the difficulty of obtaining revenue from any source other than customs and excise duties, it would be improper for the committee to decide now that the principle underlying the imposition an excise duty upon sugar is an absolutely wrong one.",29
119,Mr KINGSTON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,We do not say that.,29
120,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,The Minister has practically admitted that this excise is proposed purely in view of the effect of the black labour legislation upon Queensland.,29
121,Mr KINGSTON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,I did not say anything of the kind.,29
122,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"W h i 1st I have the greatest sympathy for Queensland, it must be remembered that she will have practically the whole' of the sugar market of Australia. I do not say that in any tone of disparagement; but no doubt that advantage was a quid pro quo for entering into the union.",29
123,Mr KINGSTON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,But all the other States get the advantage of the whole Australian to say that market in the same way.,29
124,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"Yes , but the amount of sugar likely to be grown out-, side of Queensland is very small. I wish the committee, therefore, to look at the matter only from the financial aspect. In the beginning of our federal finance it is impossible to obtain revenue from land and income taxes. We must raise the whole of our re venue from customsand excise duty, and an excise duty upon sugar is a reasonable source of revenue, especially as we are giving an enormous amount of protection to an industry of which one State has practically the monopoly. The Government, however, want us to say that it is not a fair and legitimate means of raising revenue, except under the present exigencies of our position. What is the safe side for the committee to take ? It is to refuse to fix any period for the termination of this duty, because if we fix a period at which it is to cease, we shall in the first place be laying down a principle which I do not think we have any right to lay down, and, in the second place, we shall be creating, inf erentially, at any rate, a sort of vested right by Act of Parliament so - far as the sugar-growing industry is concerned. We may not be here in 1907, and we have no right to forecast legislation. I do not say that there are not occasions on which limits may be placed upon the operations of certain legislation-legislatio n which may affect the freedom of industrial life or the liberty of the individual. Some legislation is of such an experimental character, and so touches upon principles affecting individual or industrial liberty that it is necessary to limit its operation, but in this case we are dealing with finance, and we must be caref u l not to restrict the operations of the future or create vested interests. Another point is that the amount of revenue received from this duty wil l probably go' on increasing, so that in 1907 Parliament may have to deal with an item of revenue of far greater value to the Commonwealth than is the sum the Government now expect to derive. It is just possible that the sudden abolition of this duty would then very much embarrass the finances of the Commonwealth. Considerations of moderation and of safe and wide statesmanship ought to induce us to pause before we commit ourselves to the course of action proposed by the Government.",29
125,Mr SALMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO, I do not follow the reasoning of the honourable member for Wentworth. He states that the effect of allowing these words to stand will be to convey an intimation to the Queensland sugar planters that at the end of 1907 excise duties will cease to be collected.,30
126,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,That is what is provided.,30
127,Mr SALMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"It is not provided that excise duties shall cease altogether, but that the 3s. duty may cease. This is an intimation to the sugar planters that under reasonable circumstances, and in the absence of any dire necessity, no change will be made in the duty and rebate until 1907. We cannot bind Parliament for the future, and it would be quite competent to terminate the excise duty at any time. We have, however, to a certain extent entered into a bargain with the sugar planters who have employed black labour, and they have been promised certain consideration at our hands. I do not say that we are under any legal obligation, but there is a general understanding that the sugar planters are entitled to some consideration in view of the early total cessation of the employment of black labour. No honourable member is more anxious than I am to terminate at once the employment of black labour, but it would be dishonourable to suggest that those who have for years employed black labour under Government authority should be compelled at one fell swoop to dispense with that labour, and not receive any consideration at. our hands. I desire to assist in the employment of white labour, and, unlike the honourable member for Wentworth, I hope to see all the sugar required by the people of Australia manufactured within the Commonwealth. In carrying out our desire to encourage the sugar planters, we cannot do better than provide that they shall be called upon to pay only a certain amount of excise duty. I understand that there is a desire' on the part of some honourable members of the"" Opposition to increase the excise; but if any proposal is made in that direction I shall 1 oppose it . The honourable member for Wentworth has spoken about the necessity for obtaining revenue, and has referred to the enlarged expenditure of the Commonwealth. Honourable members who think with him on fiscal matters have told us time and again that every reduction they have made in the duties proposed by the Government has helped to increase the revenue. If that is true; it affords a very strong argument in favour of the reduction rather than of the increase of the excise duty. . Either the fears of the honourable member for Wentworth are unfounded, or he does not place much reliance upon the statements which have been made regarding the probable enormous increase of revenue that will result from the reductions of duties. We owe a duty to the sugarplanters.",30
128,Mr WILKS,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,We also owe a duty to the people.,30
129,Mr SALMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"Yes ; and I should be very glad to assist the honourable member in discharging that duty, by reducing as far as possible the cost of living. I hope he will be found voting against some of the revenue duties which have been' proposed by the Government, and which honourable members on the opposition side will no doubt endeavour to increase. The sugar planters have been subjected to very drastic treatment at the hands of this Parliament-suc h treatment as many of those who live in Northern Queensland never expected. I had an opportunity prior to and during the last federal campaign of visiting Queensland in connection with the federal movement, and I gathered that those who were engaged in the sugar industry did not believe that this Parliament would take such drastic steps as it recently resolved upon. They did not at that time realise what would happen, and the remarks of the Premier of Queensland up to the time of the referendum show that he did not anticipate that this Parliament would take such extreme action.  can say that there was no more ardent federalist than he throughout Australia, and that if it had not been for his individual action Queensland would not have entered the federation when she did.",30
130,Mr R EDWARDS,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,Quite true.,31
131,Mr FISHER,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,I do not accept that.,31
132,Mr SALMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"I had an opportunity, during several weeks of the Federal  that is the conclusion at which I arrived.",31
133,Mr FISHER,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,He belonged to a Government who would not send a representative to the convention. ',31
134,Mr SALMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,Bu the was not at the head of the Government. I repeat that there was no more ardent federalist in the  gave up more time or spent more money than he did in order to consummate federation.,31
135,Mr KNOX,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,Quite right.,31
136,Mr SALMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"Even the honourable members belonging to the labour party, are specially anxious that the employment of black labour should cease, must agree a certain amount of hardship must be perienced by those who up to the present have employed black labour on the sugar plantations under Government authority, and that they should receive some consideration. We cannot extend them enat all? couragement more effectively than by assuring them that there is no probability of excise duty being increased until 1907. The time is far distant when the Commonhonorable wealth will be able to do without excise duties altogether. I should be only too pleased to see the excise on sugar abolished, but we must have some regard for the revenue. The only inference to be drawn suspense. from the retention of the words "" u n t i l 1st January, 1907 "" in the provision is that the excise duties will cease altogether, but that they will possibly be reconsidered at the expiration of the period fixed. time to time various Acts of Parliament have been passed in Victoria subject to provision that they should cease to have effect upon a certain date. That, however, simply meant that, at the end of the term error. specified, further consideration would given to them, and the provisions of such representatives Acts have, in several cases, been re-enacted with certain modifications or extensions of power. The sole effect of limiting the time for the operation of. these excise duties will be to give Parliament an opportunity to review what has been done, and if necessary to make alterations at the end of the term. {Committee counted.) Despite the fact that a limitation was placed upon the period during which the Victorian Factories Acts, for instance, were to remain operative, they have never been allowed to lapse, but have repeatedly been re-enacted. Under these circumstances, it is distinctly unfair to argue that those who are interested in the sugar industry will be placed at any disadvantage. I take it for granted that persons who are engaged in growing and refining sugar, and in placing the finished article upon the market, will be aware of the discussion which has taken place upon this particular item. They will know from the tone of the debate that there is not the slightest chance of any future Parliament failing to impose the excise duty. I feel that the only alteration which is likely to be made is in the direction of an increase.",31
137,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,Does the honwho orable member really believe that ?,31
138,Mr SALMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,I think that any alterathat tion likely to be made after 1907 would exbe the result of an unfortunate combination of circumstances which placed the free-traders in power. Then we should find an increase in all these revenue duties.,31
139,Mr WINTER COOKE,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,Why fix the date,31
140,Mr SALMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"Because by so doing the we impart a sense of security to those engaged in the industry. I think that members generally will admit that even though an excise of '3s. per cwt. may, perhaps, be considered excessive, the planters would rather have the rate fixed for five years than remain in a state of Mr A . C. GBOOM - That is all the more not reason why we should not insert a date.",31
141,Mr SALMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"The honourable member will perhaps. defer to those who are intiFrom mately acquainted with all the conditions under which this industry has to be a conducted. If he can find a majority of representatives from Queensland to support his view I am willing to admit that I am in But I think that when the be division is taken, a majority of the of the northern State - will be found voting for the retention these words. The honourable member for Wentworth - made a great point of the necessity for safeguarding the revenue. That indicated a desire upon his part either to retain, the excise duty of 3s. increase it-preferabl y the latter.",31
142,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"It was simply the principle of excise as excise, and not the rate, which I argued.",32
143,Mr SALMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,The honourable member has repeatedly claimed that the reductions which he has been instrumental in securing will result in an Increased revenue.,32
144,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,They have been neutralized by subsequent action on the part of the Government.,32
145,Mr SALMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"The Government prothe posals were based upon certain informahave tion at their command, and they calculated that a certain amount of revenue would collected under those proposals. The honorimportance able member for Wentworth repeatedly assured the committee that the proposals which he advocated would result in an creased revenue, and therefore he need express the fears which he has mentioned concerning the loss that will accrue in nexion with this particular matter. I have taken a good deal of interest in this question ever since I entered public life. In the Victorian Parliament, in 1895, proposed a resolution that Queensland New South Wales sugar should be admitted to this State at » preferential rate, pared with sugar from other parts of the world. At that time it was pointed that there was a constitutional objection the course proposed, owing to treaties which existed between the old country and San Salvador, and other places. Those treaties have since been denounced. My anxiety at that period, as now, was to benefit those engaged in the sugar industry, and to make Australia self-supporting in this as in other respects. We have now an opportunity - conferring a distinct benefit upon the people engaged' in this industry, and I hope we shall seize it . I ask the committee to pause before eliminating theSe words, because I feel that by their retention greater sense of security will be expeidenced by the growers and others interested, than would be experienced if they were omitted. unfair. I acknowledge that it will be within the power of future Parliaments to repeal the action taken by this Parliament. But very fact of our inserting these of the amount of, excise which is to be imposed, will materially assist the industry, will impart a greater sense of security to the planters, and . be regarded as some compensation for the legislation which we have per cwt., or already enacted.",32
146,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"South Australia). - I think that this question is of so much importance to the Commonwealth, and has such a far-reaching effect, that a little time devoted to its most careful consideration,, especially from a financial standpoint, will be well expended. I do not think it matters very much to the committee whether we close the debate this afternoon,, or whether it is prolonged for a day ortwo. When we come to consider that, result of the votes which we shall to give upon this question, maymean a difference of anything from. be £300,000 to £600,000 per annum, its. cannot fail to impress the mind'sof the committee. The Minister for Tradeand Customs said, a little time ago, in in^ somewhat heated words, that an undernot standing existed in regard to the Government proposal in connection with this conmatter, and that because that proposal had! appeared upon the Tariff for some time it was to be taken for granted that the committee had thoroughly examined it . I venI ture to think that the enormous number of and lines which have been introduced, considered, and reconsidered, even by the comGovernment themselves, from day to day, has absolutely prevented attention being out given to this matter by the comto mittee. I have - had quite enough to do in keeping up - with the work of the-committee, in absorbing the information, which has been given upon all sorts of subjects, and in watching the constantly changing attitudes of the Government. One-» day we have seen them insisting upon the Tariff as printed ; the next we have witnessed of them climbing down in the most docile manner at the instigation of some of theirsupporters. Over and over again, we have had exhibitions of this kind, so that the* Minister, in stating that we ought to have a known all about the matter because it happened to be printed long before the timearrived for discussing it , was somewhat,",32
147,Mr MAUCER,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,Surely it was discussed the in connection with the Pacific Island words after Labourers Bill 1,32
148,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"I venture to think it was not, and I am sure the position was such that we had no right to discuss it at that stage. When that Bil l was debated, we had no knowledge of what its fate would be in another branch of the Legislature.",33
149,Mr LE GROOM,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,The honourable member has had four days' notice.,33
150,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"It may, of course, be possible for the honourable member, with the time at his command, to fully grasp these immense questions in four days' notice. I am not bound by the statement of the leader of the Opposition, or any other honourable member, that there was any understanding, because I hold that the question remained absolutely for our consideration at the proper time. I am somewhat doubtful of the position of the leader of the Opposition in this matter. I listened to his remarks today, but I do not agree that there was any agreement between this side of the House and the Government in reference to the excise on sugar. Mr KENNEDr It is a factor in considering the customs duties.",33
151,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"I admit that the proposal was put forward by the Government as an arrangement with a certain section of the House, but that section was not the Opposition.",33
152,Mr MCDONALD,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,What section was,33
153,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,Undoubtedl y the labour party.,33
154,Mr MCDONALD,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,The honourable member says what is not true.,33
155,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"I say what I believe to be an absolute fact, which has been irdmitted by honourable members. Mz\ WATSON - The Opposition raised no - objection.",33
156,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,The Opposition were not in the counsels of either the labour party or the Government in regard to any agreement or understanding,33
157,Mr LE GROOM,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,The leader of Opposition said that he accepted the Government proposal.,33
158,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"Although a free-trader, I am not responsible for, or in agreement with, any such understanding, even though it may have been accepted by the leader of the Opposition.",33
159,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"We are now discussing the question of the period. Mr V . L . SOLQMON - But the general question has been discussed by every honourable member who has spoken, and in my opinion the proposal of the Government opens up the whole subject. We have had various suggestions, one that beet. sugar should be added, and another by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, that an army of inspectors should be engaged; and if the Chairman decides that I am going beyond the bounds of the question before the committee, I shall take another opport u n it y , of challenging attention to the matter. I do not want to make half-adozen speeches on this subject, but only to deal with it fairly. As to this question not having been raised before, I may say that I referred to it in South Australia immediately after the Prime Minister's speech at Maitland, and pointed out that if the Prime Minister had inadvertently omitted to consider the question of excise on sugar, there would be an annual loss of £500,000 to the Commonwealth. There is not much occasion .to emphasize these facts, which were set forth in the published report of my speech to the electors. Controversy took place on the subject, and in proof that it was not part of the Ministerial programme to put an excise duty on sugar, no such intention was referred to by the Prime Minister in his Queensland speeches.",33
160,Mr CONROY,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,In Queensland the Prime it ? Minister said he would not put on excise duty.,33
161,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"And further, the Prime Minister estimated that, by Inter-State free-trade, there would be a loss of £1,000,000 odd, including the sugar duties, but not excise. It has been admitted that the expiration of the rebate and the excise go hand in hand, although it is not absolutely stated in cold print.",33
162,Mr KINGSTON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,We cannot allow a rebate of excise which does not exist.,33
163,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"If the excise is abolished in so many years, the whole of the rebate will be equivalent to the excise, the though it will not be called a rebate, but an allowance of £ 3 , instead of £ 2 , and instead of there being a loss of £300,000 to the revenue as at present, there will be a loss of nearly £500,000. We have had a good deal of talk as to a loss of £50,000 or £60,000, which it is said will be involved in connection with certain distilling industries ; but today we have before us the question of a loss of £300,000 to £400,000.",33
164,Mr MAUGEK,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,But the committee have acquiesced in that.,34
165,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"That statement is absolutely contrary to fact, and unprovable from any journals of the House.",34
166,Mr MAUGER,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"The honourable member's leader agreed to it,",34
167,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"The agreement of the leader of the Opposition, or even of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, does not mean the agreement of the committee. No doubt, so far as one honourable member is concerned- I will not say whom - h e is apt to consider that when he has spoken he has pretty well expressed the opinion of the committee, but I am not inclined to agree to such a dictum, even when enunciated by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. A large number of honourable members on the Opposition side have given no wmch acquiescence, but have left this item'to be discussed on its merits.",34
168,Mr MAUGER,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,There is a party compact.,34
169,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"There is no party compact; at any rate, I have not acquiesced in any such compact. It is all very well for honourable members on the Government side of the House, who wish to follow the Government closely",34
170,Mr MAUGER,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,We want to get through with the Tariff.,34
171,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"If the honourable member for Melbourne Ports had spoken as little as I have the Tariff might have been through earlier. The honourable member has made more speeches by way of interjection than the whole of the Opposition, and I do not think any honourable member has done more to waste time over the Tariff, though I admire some of the information he has placed before us. The question we are considering is no party question, and even if the leader of the Opposition chose to vote with the Government, I am not so blind a follower of his as to support him in a matter like this. On the free-trade question I , of course, am with the leader of the Opposition.",34
172,Mr MAUGER,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,The honourable member forgets salt and wine.,34
173,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,I forget neither.,34
174,Mr KINGSTON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,I think the honourable member treated the Government very fairly on these two items.,34
175,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,I think I have treated the Government fairly on a great many more items. 28 i 2,34
176,Mr KINGSTON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,I have not been complaining.,34
177,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"The interjection as to salt and wine falls off my hide, not, perhaps, because my hide is as thick as that of others, after my parliamentary experience, but because my pronouncement before the electors was. so definite. I appeared before them as a revenue tariffist, determined not to play into the hands of a few manufacturers in any State, but to advocate the nearest Tariff I could get to a free-trade Tariff, having regard to revenue. AVhile I would not kill any industry, I certainly refuse to bolster up industries that have had 30 to 40 years' protection. I never absolutely bound myself to any free-trade Tariff; and to the 20,000-odd people who recorded their votes for me I can justify my conduct when large and important industries in the district I represent were under consideration.",34
178,Mr SAWERS,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,It makes all the difference when the industries are in the honourable member's own district.,34
179,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"My district is the whole of South Australia, and the largest in the Commonwealth. The question of the excise on sugar is mixed up with three or fourdifferent matters. There have been many sound arguments used on both sides of the committee as to the advisableness of our tying the hands of future Parliaments in this connection.",34
180,Mr KENNEDY,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,We cannot tie future Parliaments.,34
181,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"Then why make fools of ourselves by placing this stipulation in the Tariff? Why should we pretend to do what we know we cannot do. I agree with the honourable member for Moira that we cannot tie the hands of future Parliaments; but the 'honourable member for Laanecoorie asks us to pass this provision in order to give security to those employed in the sugar-growing industry for the continuance of the rebate for so many years. W it h an import duty of £ 6 per ton upon sugar, and an excise duty of £ 3 per ton, together with a rebate of £ 2 per ton, the growers have a protection of £ 5 a ton against the competition of importers, and surely that should be sufficient encouragement for their industry. But it seems to me to be very difficult to estimate the value of the proposed rebate to the growers in the tropical parts of Queensland. We have been told by honourable members who represent districts in which sugar cane is being grown, that there is no question as to the ability of white persons to work in the cane-fields. When the Pacific Island Labourers Bill was under discussion, most of those who were elected to represent the State of Queensland in this Parliament expressed the opinion that black labour is not necessary for the production of sugar.",34
182,Mr KENNEDY,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,It was stated that a question of wages.,35
183,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"That statement was made only by one or two, whereas many instances were cited in which farmers on small areas did well by growing cane with the assistance of their wives and families. If we give a rebate upon cane grown by white labour, the planters in the northern parts of New South Wales, and the southern parts of Queensland, will have a protection of £ 5 a ton against the importers, and will be £ 2 a ton better off than those in the tropical districts who have to employ black labour, and whom we particularly desire to assist. I wish now to deal with the estimates of revenue which have been supplied to us by the Government. To judge by the remarks of the Minister for Trade and Customs, one would imagine that the Government had had this scheme in their minds before the Pacific Island Labourers Bill was thought of, and that they were quite satisfied that they could adjust the small wrong of which their consciences accused them by giving to the planters a rebate of £ 2 a ton upon the excise duty on sugar. But, according to the papers which have been laid before us, the Government expect to receive £120,000 from the import duty and £410,000 from the excise duty upon sugar. As the import duty is £ 6 per ton, a revenue of £120,000 presupposes an importation of 20,000 tons, whilst with an excise duty of £ 3 per ton a revenue of £410,000 presupposes the production of something over 136,000 tons of sugar within the Commonwealth, or a total consumption of 156,000 tons. But since there is to be a rebate of £ 2 a ton upon sugargrown by white labour, if all the sugar grown within the Commonwealth is produced by white labour - and those who supported the Pacific Island Labourers Bill firmly believe that that will happen-the consumption of locally-grown sugar must increase to 410,000 tons in order to return the amount which the Government expect to receive from excise duties. But do honourable members think that the Commonwealth can consume anything like that amount of sugar, seeing that our present consumption is between 170,000 and 200,000 tons?",35
184,Mr LE GROOM,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,A certain amount of sugar will be produced by coloured labour.,35
185,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,But coloured labour is to be dispensed with. Mr L . E. GROOM - Not all at once. it was Many of the Kanakas are working under agreements which have some time to run.,35
186,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"Yes ; but are we engaged in framing a Tariff which is to last only for a year or two? Are we not rather dealing with a Tariff which we believe will last for a good many years 1 I am sure that one and all of us hope that it will be many years before we have again to deal with a subject which excites so much controversy, and causes so much trouble and annoyance to the commercial and industrial world. It is evident that, when the Government estimated that they would receive a revenue of £120,000 from imported sugar, and £410,000 from locallygrown sugar, they did not intend to offer this rebate of two-thirds upon sugar produced from carie grown by European labour. It is not a small, amount of revenue that is involved in this item ; it is an amount so large that nearly every State is affected. During the year 1S98, Queensland, in addition to what she consumed within her borders,' exported 28,000 tons of sugar to New South Wales, 49,000 tons to A ictoria,r and 15,000 tons to South Australia. Before the introduction of the Commonwealth Tariff, the South Australian duty upon sugar was £ 3 per ton, so that the revenue obtained from the 15,000 tons imported from Queensland was £45,000. Under this Tariff however, South Australia will obtain revenue from sugar under the excise duty only. If two-thirds of this excise is abolished owing to the fact that, the sugar grown by white labour is sent to South Australia, the revenue of that State from sugar will be reduced .to £15,000.",35
187,Mr FISHUB,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,What about salt? We will put the South Australian salt against the Queensland sugar.,35
188,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"I shall be prepared to allow salt to go free,"" and to fight its own way, if sugar is similarly treated. The whole Commonwealth will, under the Government proposal, have to pay for the little game that is being carried on in Queensland. Although Queensland will have to pay the excise, the money will into hei: own coffers; but the other States will lose revenue if the duty is abolished under the rebate.",35
189,Mr MAUGER,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,We are all one now.,36
190,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"We are not one - as far as the finances are concerned, and that is a point which some honourable memmember bers seem to forget. We are one in large matters of national importance in which the States contribute according to their population ; but we are not one in matters of Customs revenue, and are not likely to be so for years to come. So far as South tralia is concerned, the losti of £30,000 £40,000 a year on n revenue item such sugar is a matter of considerable moment, especially when the difficulties arising from has to be provided for. I the reduction in price of all that State's primary products are considered.",36
191,Mr MAUGER,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,The honourable - member disappointing me; I thought he was federalist. Mr V. L. SOLOMON - Does a man be-come any the less a federalist nises his duty to his own State. Cannot he be a true federalist and at the same time try to protect the financial solvency of State in the federation 1,36
192,Mr KINGSTON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,This excise duty is tax on the special industry of a particular State.,36
193,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"I do not think the Minister puts the matter fairly. When - we permit the sugar-growers of Queensland and New South Wales to introduce their sugar into all the other States of the Comin monwealth, subject to a duty of only £ 3 per ton, whilst we charge £ 6 per ton upon sugar imported from Mauritius, Java, and other countries, we are giving a very some bonus to the local producers. AVe have been told on several occasions to conbetween sider the percentage which the duty reprethink sents as compared with the cost of producany tion of an article. The duty of £ 6 per ton, added to the cost of bringing sugar from China, Java, Mauritius, and other places, represents more than 50 per cent, of the solute selling value of the sugar.",36

198,Mr SALMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,They are only 2s. lOd. per,36
199,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"The honourable is talking without accurate knowledge. I ought to know a little about the all wages paid and conditions of labour i h Java. I represented the Dutch-Netherlands Government for ten years, and was the agent for their line of steamers at Port DarAuswin, and I know that what the honourable or member says is absurd. He must have as left out of account the cost of rations, housing, and medical attendance, which may say, in passing, that a more happy and industrious race than the Javanese, is since they have been under Dutch Governa ment, are not to be found among the Eastern peoples.",36
200,Mr SALMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,Thei r standard of comfort if he recogis not equal to ours.,36
201,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"It is equal to that of many of our people who have to live every in the back-blocks. We have to consider 7 the loss that will be inflicted upon the Coma monwealth if the Government proposals are carried. The Government suggestion will, involve a loss of something like £500,000 a year, which will have to be borne by the four millions of people in the Commonwealth. This is equivalent to 2s. 6d. per head for every man, woman, and child, and the case of a family consisting of a man, his wife, and three children, the loss amounts to 12s. 6d. per ,-wmuiii, which will have to be made up by taxation in some other form. handWe are making the sugar-growers of Queensland a present of the difference £ 3 per ton and £ 6 per ton, and I that ought to be sufficient without rebate. I contend that there is no necessity for retaining the words "" until, the 1st January, 1907,"" and I shall support the amendment proposed by my colleague. abThe question of bringing beet sugar within the operation of the pro visions as to excise duty will probably raise considerable discussion. I have not yet heard whether the per Government are favourable to that.",36
202,Mr KINGSTON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,Yes ; I said so. The ? The excise will apply to beet sugar.,36
203,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"No doubt; but the question is whether the rebate should also apply to it . This question has been rather suddenly sprung upon us, because I do not think any one ever anticipated that it would be introduced in connection with the consideration of the sugar duties. The rebate proposed by the Government is quite uncalled for, and as it would place the - finances of the smaller States in a very unfair position it should be abandoned. The difference between the excise duty pf £ 3 per ton, and the import duty of £ 6 per ton, added to the natural protection afforded by the freight and charges upon imported sugar, should be quite sufficient to encourage local growers. The question of establishing a "" white Australia "" has been considered by the committee so far as Queensland conditions are concerned, but the Northern Territory of South Australia, where we can grow sugar, and which has a growing liability of £70,000 a year, has not received any consideration at the hands of this Parliament. I shall have something to say about that later on. I shall vote for the excision of the limitation, and if I have an opportunity I shall propose to strike out the rebate provisions.",36
204,Mr CONROY,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO," I was rather pleased to hear the Minister for Trade and Customs state that he recognised that these duties were a tax. When, however, he said that they would involve a tax upon certain people in Queensland, he omitted to mention that the real burden would not fall upon the people of Queensland, but upon the consumers of sugarthroughoutthevarious States. In confirmation of that proposition, and to show how thoroughly he recognised it, I have only to turn up the miscellaneous Tariff papers which were-furnished to the committee under the authority of the Minister for Trade and Customs. There we find it recognised that out of a total excise revenue of £410,000 the contribution by New South Wales is £153,000, that of Victoria £114,000, and that of Queensland only £68,000. Now, as the Minister for Trade and Customs credits only that amount of income to Queensland, how can he possibly turn round and say that the tax will fall exclusively upon that State ? If Queensland alone pays this tax the whole of the £410,000 ought to go to that State. If the Minister for Trade and Customs is correct, that is absolutely the course which he ought to follow. But did he not know that he was making a statement which was not in aecoi'dance with fact? I need only refer to page 7 of the excise duty tables to show how clearly he himself has recognised that. I hope that when the Minister for Trade and Customs rises he will make statements more in accordance with facts, and not declare, in order to catch votes, that the whole of this tax will fall upon Queensland, when he has shown by his own words' that such is not the case. But, if the Government were so very anxious in regard to the excise duty upon sugar, there was one very easy means of overcoming the difficulty. Last evening they could have accepted the proposal which emanated from the Opposition in connection with the excise duties upon spirits and beers, which would have yielded an additional £150,000. Had they done so, they could then have lessened the excise upon sugar by that amount. That would have allowed them to reduce the rate from £ 3 to £ 2 or 35s. a ton. If the Minister for Trade - and Customs is in earnest about this matter, why does he not adopt that course ? I think it is reasonable to expect that the amount of sugar grown by white labour within the Commonwealth will approximate 30,000 tons a year. W it h an - excise duty of £ 2 a ton operating, that would yield a revenue of £60,000. If we add to the receipts from wines and spirits another £150,000, we shall get about £310,000, so that we shall not need to raise more than another £100,000 in order to dispense with the whole of the excise upon sugar. If the Ministry are really in earnest, that is a proposition which they might very well agree to. As far as Queensland itself is concerned, the duty imposed under its State Tariff was clearly inoperative.",37
205,Mr KENNEDY,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,And therefore was not a tax upon the people ? :,37
206,Mr CONROY,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,It was not a tax upon the people except that it was so fixed as to allow it to fall into the. hands of a trust. That was one of the dangers in Queensland. If we imposed a duty of 10s. per lb. on wool it would not raise its price one farthing.,37
207,Mr KENNEDY,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"All along, the contention 1 of the honourable and learned member has been that a protective duty is a tax upon the people.",37
208,Mr CONROY,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,When there is not a f u ll local production it is a tax upon the people. I do not think that in order to favour any one State we ought to be asked to continue a condition of affairs which is injurious to the Commonwealth as a whole.,37
209,Mr GLYNN,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO," In looking more closely at the speech of the Prime Minister upon the Pacific Island Labourers Bill I find that he expressly refers to the question of the continued imposition of import duties in aid of the sugar industry in Queensland. He even puts a limit of time to the import duties. But the case for limiting the excise duty is surely much stronger. If this amendment is carried I do not intend to move for any alteration as regards the duration of the rebate, because when a legislative provision is enacted it is usually enacted without respect of time. If the necessity occurs for Cutting down the rebate under new conditions which may have arisen it can be done. If my amendment is carried the rebate will continuet i l liament thinks fit to abolish it . Therefore I do not propose to make the limitation apply to only five years. I am content to leave that matter to be dealt with by a subsequent Parliament. It does not necessarily follow that there will be any contract for its continuance. It will stand in the form, in which Parliament usually expresses things-for an indefinite period. That is a fair way of viewing the matter, and I ask honourable members to support the amendment. , Mr KNOX (Kooyong) - I am in favour of the elimination of the date because I believe that that course is rather in the interests of the cane-growers themselves. They may get a rebate for a longer period than five years. I do not think that Parliament, would commit a breach of the understanding, which, I believe, was implied, that there should be five years consideration' extended to the planters.",38
210,Mr THOMSON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO," In connection with what has been stated in regard to the compact I can only say that I take the same view as the leader of the Opposition. I recognise that we are not giving this concession to Queensland as Queensland, but are acepting a responsibility for all Australia which has been necessitated by the declaration for a white Australia. Therefore, I think that some remarks which have been made have been rather unfair to Queensland, inasmuch as it has been stated that the concession was one given entirely to the northern State. I accepted the position taken up by the leader of the Opposition, but did not consider that my action bound me to every detail. I accepted it in the spirit, but, of course, there might be differences upon matters of detail, one of which has been raised by the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr. Glynn. I would point out that the excise duty of 3s. per cwt. until 1907 does not apply to cane sugar only. It applies also to beet sugar. Might there not be an honest difference of opinion as to whether we should embody in the Tariff an understanding that any excise upon beet sugar should cease at the end of 1906 ?  is produced by black labour or not ?",38
211,Mr THOMSON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"Yes. Of course, it is not likely to be produced by black labour. But when there is an import duty of £10 per ton upon beet sugar, l Par- are we to declare that there shall not be any excise upon that sugar after 1907? I do not think so : and further, by adopting the amendment, we are giving all we have engaged to give. We leave to the Parliament of that day, which will have the opportunity for revising-and possibly there will be necessity for revision on other points-to say what is fair treatment for the sugar growers of Queensland. I should like the Minister for Trade and Customs to answer the question-when does this excise of 3s. begin to apply 1",38
212,Mr KINGSTON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,We have been collecting it.,38
213,Mr THOMSON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,Was the excise meant to apply to sugar produced before8th October last?,38
214,Mr KINGSTON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"If in bond, yes.",38
215,Mr THOMSON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,That is an extraordinary proceeding. Has the Minister cometo a similar decision in connection with theexcise on tobacco and spirits 1,38
216,Mr KINGSTON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,If . tobacco is in bond excise will have to be paid before clearing.,38
217,Mr THOMSON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"But surely sugar cannot be said to be in bond when it is in another State, to which it was removed prior to the abolition of the different State duties ?",38
218,Mr KINGSTON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,If the sugar has got out free we cannot get it in bond again.,38
219,Mr THOMSON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,The object of excise is to apply the duty at the factory; but this sugar had passed from the factory be^ fore the excise was imposed - Are we making this sugar subject to duty by this resolution ?,38
220,Mr KINGSTON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"If the sugar been cleared for home consumption, we cannot get the duty.",39
221,Mr THOMSON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,But if the sugar has gone out of the State in which it was produced? 1 ,39
222,Mr KINGSTON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,I think the honourable member had better put that question on notice; I cannot make out what he is driving at.,39
223,Mr THOMSON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"I understand that the Minister for Trade and Customs has claimed excise on sugar produced prior to the date of the introduction of the Tariff, and has even claimed excise when the sugar has gone out of the State in which it was produced.",39
224,Mr MACDONALD,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,PATKRSON - And the excise has been paid.,39
225,Mr THOMSON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"I suppose it has, because there is no other recourse just now. Is what I have stated the fact ?",39
226,Mr KINGSTON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"If the sugar has not gone into consumption, we can get the excise.",39
227,Mr THOMSON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"That is treating this item differently from other items. I venture to say that the Minister has not acted in that way in regard to tobacco and spirits; and I draw attention to this matter because I do not think it is the intention of the committee to proceed in a way quite unusual in connection with excise. I do not think there is any precedent for treating sugar in an entirely different manner f rom tobacco and spirits when the excise is raised. shall support the amendment of the honourable member for South Australia, Mr. Glynn, while I hold myself generally bound to the proposal of the Government, though not in matters of detail, of this kind.  the present unhappy circumstances, Queensland is entitled to receive some consideration at the hands of the committee, and that State certainly expects consideration. We have had speeches today from both sides of the committee expressing the most charming sympathy with Queensland, and as a Queenslander I feel very grateful to the speakers for treating the subject in such a manner. But I am reminded of an old colonel at home, who by some misfortune was obliged to sell his commission, and who, having lost his wealth, and his position, was ultimately reduced to the humble occupation of selling pies in the streets of London. One of his old friends, whom has he had known in the zenith of prosperity, expressed the greatest sympathy, saying-""Dea r me, how have you come to this extraordinary position?"" The poor old colonel explained how by a series of misfortunes, which were entirely beyond his control, he had fallen to that humble position, and the friend said - "" My heart is full of sympathy for you."" To this the old colonel replied- "" Hang your sympathy ! Buy a pie."" The sympathy expressed by the supporters of the amendment is different from that expressed by the Government, who are going to do something practical. I regard the retention of the words "" u n t i l the 1st January, 1907,"" as a "" p i e "" foithe sugar-planters of Queensland, whereas the other expression of sympathy I regard as so much empty talk. What the planters want is something definite-som e promise or engagement that what is given to them will not be taken away suddenly, on the spur of the moment, and in obedience to popular impulse. I heartily support the Government proposal. Question-That the words "" until the 1st January, 1907,"" proposed to be omitted, stand part of the item-put .

The Government, in reporting progress so early this afternoon, and in forbearing from asking for a sitting next Monday, are much induced to that course by the progress which has been made in the discussion of the Tariff this week.",40

232,Mr BARTON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"It is unprecedented. I do net know whether the honourable member does or does not like it . At any rate, most important work has been got through this week, and particularly during yesterday's sitting. I hope that honourable members will infer from our action that we are willing to make all ordinary and reasonable concessions, and that by way of return equally good work will be done next week.",40
233,Mr REID,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO," I wish I could endorse the remarks of the Prime Minister as to the credit due to honourable members for the more rapid progress in the consideration of the Tariff during the latter part of the week. I am sorry to fee], however, that the greater rapidity of progress is due to the fact that the play of rival interests, which was so keen while we were considering Division VI . , and which caused the delay which was complained of, has ceased now that we have come to a part of the Tariff in which we are concerned in taxing only the poor consumer. Consolidated interest is behind us. Therefore, the reason for our progress is an unworthy rather than a worthy one. Still honourable members are always ready to get a day off, because, whether progress is or is not made, there is a considerable amount of hardship involved in sitting here, so long as we have to do. I wish to say, in all justice that the Government of late have carried on their business in a way which has been perfectly fair to all parties concerned, and while that line of conduct is. maintained, the Opposition will always be found to reciprocate. I congratulate the Government upon their good conduct of late. Mr CONROY. (Werriwa) - I am pleased that the House is-not to sit next Monday, but we should have been very glad to receive an intimation to that effect a fortnight or three weeks ago, because it must be perfectly evident to every one that we are now sitting far more than we should do. I am as strong and healthy as any man in the Chamber, but I have felt the strain, and I think that other honourable members also feel it . That is why upon many occasions when there has not been a quorum present I have refrained from drawing attention to the fact. No one can study the matters which come before Parliament unless he has a clear day or two every week ; and if we do not study them beforehand we are just in the same position when they come forward as anybody of men in the street who might meet to consider them. It ought to be a settled rule that the House shall not sit more than three days a 'week. That is quite often enough for solid work, and honourable members could say all that they have to say in that time, if they spoke sensibly and to the point. As it is, many of us have to give up the work of our professions entirely in order to attend here; and to those who come from the other States the sacrifice is a very serious one. This arrangement must tend to turn men into professional politicians.",40
234,Mr SPEAKER,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,The question before the chair is simply whether we shall adjourn until Tuesday next.,40
235,Mr CONROY,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"Upon that question T, for once, find myself in accord with the Ministry.

236,Mr WATSON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO," I should like to direct the attention of the Prime Minister to a statement to the effect that a number of Hindoos have recently been into Western Australia upon passing a test in the English language. If I recollect aright, the Government undertook, when the Immigration Restriction Bill was before the House, that the test which they proposed would prove in administration as effective in keeping out people who were held to be objectionable as that supported by a number of honourable members who wished for more direct method. If , however, the stateEuropeans. ment to which I refer is true, the Act is proving so effective as it was said it would be.",41
237,Mr HIGGINS,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,How many have been mitted ?,41
238,Mr BARTON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"Two , I believe.",41
239,Mr WATSON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"I do not see that that makes any difference. If only one had so been admitted, it would be a dangerous precedent. I wish to know if the Act will be administered in that way in future, befor cause, if so, there will be a dribbling into the Commonwealth of any number of do educated Hindoos, who, I think I am safe in saying, are held by a majority of honour and able members to be even more objectionable than those without education, because of greater ease with which they can compete with our own people. In any case, I should like to be informed what the policy of Government is to be in regard to this matter, so that we may know where we ment. stand. Unless the A ct is more strictly administered, the wishes of honourable memout bers generally in regard to the restriction of the immigration of aliens into the Commonwealth will be frustrated.",41
240,Mr REID,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO," During the discussion of the Immigration Restriction Bill, I made the suggestion that it would be only fair to those interested in shipping if facilities were given for the examination of undesirable immigrants, such as persons suffering from unsound mind, to be conducted at the ports of departure, so that captains of vessels might be sure that they were not bringing out persons who would not be permitted to land here. Of course, I did not mean that arrangement to apply to persons who are undesirable by reason of colour.",41
241,Mr CONROY,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO," I wish to point out that 31 Italians have been prevented from landing at Perth, and are coming on to Melbourne, and will probably have to return to their own country.",41
242,Mr WATSON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,That is because they came admitted out here under contract.,41
243,Mr CONROY,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"There is no evidence of that. It seems to me that the Act was_ passed upon a pretence, and is being administered quite differently from what was expected. Very many honourable members supported the direct exclusion of undesirable aliens, because they feared that if the Government method were adopted it might a be applied in such a way as to exclude I , in common with many other not honourable members, am perfectly willing that immigration should take place to a certain extent, especially from European counadtries, when the men who come here are possessed of stout hearts and willing hands. If men are sufficiently bold and venturesome to leave their own country and come far afield, they are likely to prove of the type which we should encourage.",41
244,Sir GEORGE TUENER,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,The Italians work less than half the current rate of wages.,41
245,Mr CONROY,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"Well , all that we need is to make null and void any contract entered into outside the Commonwealth, then the men who come here will soon demand the same rate of payment as other the workmen are receiving. I am willing to encourage a certain number of immigrants from European countries, so long as so many the do not come here as to prove a drag upon the amount of capital available for employ",41
246,Mr MCCOLL,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO," I wish to point to the Minister for Trade and Customs that there are shipments of carbide of calcium coming out here which the consignees find it impossible to bond, because no bond will receive it, and, therefore, they have to take delivery immediately upon arrival. This places them in a very awkward position, because it is almost certain that the duty .upon the article will be reduced when the committee come to deal with it, since it is so largely used in connection with a new method of lighting, whereas the consignees have to pay the present high rate fixed in the Tariff. Will the Minister consider, between now and Tuesday next, whether those who pay the duty upon this article should not be allowed a rebate of any excess t",41
247,Mr OMALLEY,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,Coul d not the American system be adopted with regard to undesirable immigrants 1 The practice adopted is to have intending immigrants examined by the United States consuls in foreign countries. It is a serious matter to allow people to pay their last dollar for a passage out here and then refuse them admission. It would be easy enough to utilize the services of British consuls in all parts of the world to ascertain whether intending immigrants are desirable or not.,42
248,Mr KINGSTON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO," I shall look into the matter mentioned by the honourable member for Ectjuca. But I do not think it will be possible to treat cases such as he has referred to differently from others. .A good deal of inconvenience has arisen owing to the delay in the final passing of the Tariff, and the sooner we get through it the better.",42
249,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"South Australia). - It has been brought under my notice by some residents of Victoria who are' shipping goods under Inter-State certificates to South Australia that a great deal of difficulty arises from the present practice. In regard to small parcels of goods in which the payment of only a very small amount of duty, or of no duty whatever, is involved, numerous sets of certificates have to be filled in, and when the goods arrive at their destination delay and trouble are caused by their being placed in bond. The question between the States in regard to the amount of duty which had been paid on certain articles is simply one of book-keeping, and as to which State is to be credited with the amount. In the case of goods manufactured in Victoria and forwarded, say, to South Australia, it would be much easier if the amount of duty paid upon any portion of the articles was entered at the Custom-house in Melbourne, and credited to South Australia.",42
250,Mr KINGSTON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"We have given the power to do that. If I recollect aright, power to clear is given at either end.",42
251,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,It would be a great convenience to all traders if the question of the amount of duty to be credited to the State to which the goods are being sent were decided at the port of shipment.,42
252,Mr KINGSTON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,As far as I know that was arranged before Christmas.,42
253,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"Then the practice has not been followed up t ill very lately.  considerable amount of trouble is experienced in connection with these Inter-State certificates. I had a case brought under my notice in which a lad} in business in 7 Melbourne had to send some dresses to another State. She was called upon to sign, I think, seventeen certificates, and was occupied with two of her employees for three days in getting the goods away. The result was that the dresses were two days late in arriving at their destination.",42
254,Mr KINGSTON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,I should like the honourable member to give me particulars of any such case.,42
255,Mr BARTON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO," In reply - I echo what my right honourable colleague has stated, qamely, that we shall be delighted toreceive particulars of any case in which a lady was occupied for three days over the signing of seventeen certificatesin connection with the transfer of goodsfrom one State to another. As to the further extension of Inter-State facilities I can assure the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Solomon, that we have endeavoured to extend them as far as possible. Friction and difficulties sometimesarise from the zeal of customs officers, for which it is very difficult to rebuke-them. We shall all be glad to see the day when Inter-State free-trade can beestablished in its fullest sense. We areall watching for this as one of the adjuncts of federation, and the sooner the day arrives when the goods which have been loaded up, so to speak, can be finally disposed of, the better all of us will be pleased. Although complaints may sometimes be made, arising out of the zeal of Customs officers, I am quite sure, from the information given to me by my honourable colleague, the Minister for Trade and Customs, that the officers are doing their duty in the best spirit, and in a thoroughly conscientious manner. Honourable members will see that the 92nd and 93rd sections of the Constitution impose certain obligations upon us. The 92nd section provides that goods imported before' the imposition of uniform Customs duties, shall be liable to duty chargeable on the importation of such goods into the Commonwealih, less any duty previously paid, and there is a direction there from which it is difficult for any Minister or Customs officer to escape. This is more especially the case when the question of construction arises under the 93rd section, which goods passing from State to State, as goods passing ""for consumption."" regard to the point mentioned by the honourable member for Bland, I believe it has been reported that two Hindoos were unexpectedly able to pass the English educational test in Western Australia. But why there should be moans and lamentations, and expectations of the failure of the Immigration Restriction Act on that # account, I cannot understand. ever precautions are adopted there will be some sort of filtering through of men whom it is desired to exclude, but we are endeavouring to administer the Act in the spirit in which it was passed by this Legislature, and in full compliance with the expressions made use of on the part of the Government when the measure was under discussion. AVe can do no more than that. AVe must guided by comparisons made between the number of men admitted into any particular State for any period prior to the passing of the Act, and the number of men who are admitted immediately after the passage of the Act. That would not be a fair comparison, but if we take the a£gregateof admissions into all the States, prior to the Act, and compare it with the admissions Subsequently, we shall find evidence of a sensible diminution of coloured immigration. There is bound to be some difficulty so far as Queensland is concerned, owing to the conditions of the Japanese treaty under which it is necessary to make a certain amount of concession, because without this it would be impossible to maintain reasonable relations with Japan. The position would' not have been appreciably improved if Mr Barton. the Act had been passed in the amended form that some honourable members proposed to adopt. The leader of the Opposition has spoken about affording facilities to captains of ships, at foreign ports, for protecting themselves against taking on board persons who would be considered undesirable immigrants. The means of observation, and the opportunities of judging whether persons are likely to prove undesirable immigrants are just as much at the command of ships' captains as they would be within the reach of' any agents who might be appointed by the Commonwealth, and it would be quite idle for us to attempt to place agents at all foreign ports in order to teach the captains of vessels mentions their duties in this respect. They must take the responsibility themselves. More than With that, on the 2nd August the Immigration Restriction Bil l was read a second time, and on the 23rd December it became law. The first of these events conveyed notice to all the local agents of these vessels, and the second event, as an act of legislation, conveyed notice to all the world. From these noticesall thoseconcerned have been able ever since the dates mentioned to gauge whataction What- they should take in order to prevent the ad- mission on board their vessels of persons who are almost certain to be refused admission at this end. If there be any hardship involved under the present conditions, it is quite infinitesimal, and it is far better to leave the Act in its present state than to make amendments, which would make it necessary for the Commonwealth to appoint .an agent at every port in the world. AVe not be could not very well do this, nor could we relax the examination at this end, because our omission to appoint an agent at any one centre would enable undesirable people to be shipped there, and poured in here without hindrance. It is therefore necessaiy to maintain the same vigilance as at present at our own ports. Under the Act we cannot impose tests except at the gates of the Commonwealth, and I submit that if those tests are reasonably administered, as they are being administered, there is no danger to be apprehended. I am very glad that I have had an opportunity of taking part in the administration of this Act, because I have found that in one or two cases there has been either negligence or stupidity, which may be regarded as, to some extent, indicating the nature of past administration, and which has called for my reprobation and censure* I can only assure honourable members that if I find any repetition of such conduct I shall ask my honourable colleague,- the Miuister for Trade and Customs to make other arrangements with regard to the officers who are involved. .This Act must be administered in the spirit in which it was passed, and in the honest spirit which actuated this Parliament. I am bound to adopt that course by ray declarations before the passing of this Act;  only the English language test is to be applied ?",42
256,Mr BARTON,COMMISSION ONADVANCES TO,"No . Every one knows, I presume, that primarily the English language test will be applied in the generality of cases. But there is no restriction, and if a case happens which in itself is suspicious, the customs officer has the power to' apply other tests, and in fact he is instructed to apply them. I do not see any reason for the complaint that 31 Italians, who were brought to Western Australia under contract, were shut out from that State. They were shut out for this reason: The officer, on examination of the Italians, found that a number of them admitted that they all had come out under an arrangement or agreement. Afterwards some one come along and spoke to the men, and then those who hod already committed themselves, withdrew their admission. That made the cose more suspicious than ever, and I entirely concur in the action taken by the officer. Question resolved in the-offirmative. House adjourned at 3.58 p.m.",44
