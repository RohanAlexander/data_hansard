1,Mr MASSYGREENE,TRANSPORT OF PERISHABLE,"Is the Assistant Minister of Defence aware that, by reason of the arrangements made for the transport of troops, .nearly all the refrigerated space for perishable produce that would otherwise be available during November for the carriage of perishable produce from Australia to England has been commandeered, and that conseGovernment quently producers are unable to ship this produce to England, although it is badly needed there ? Will the Minister ascertain if steps can be taken to minimize convenience as much as possible ?",4
2,Mr JENSEN,TRANSPORT OF PERISHABLE,I shall be pleased to make an inquiry into the subject. NA MATERIAL .,4
3,Mr FENTON,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,"As hitherto quite a large quantity of the material used by the Postal Department has been imported from an enemy's country, will the Postmaster-General take immediate steps to have this material manufactured in Government workshops in Australia?",4
4,Mr SPENCE,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,"The policy of the Department is to use all the Australian material that .we can get, that is, to give preference to Australian goods. Whether we can manufacture the whole of our'requirements is another question. I am looking into the matter. INFORMAL VOTING .",4
5,Mr CHARLTON,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,"Has the attention of the Minister of Home Affairs been directed to the fact that at the last election a large number of informal vote3 were cast, especially for Senate candidates? Will he inquire as to the reason for this, with a view to taking action that may prevent it in the future?",4
6,Mr ARCHIBALD,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,Yes . GERMAN STEAMER BEE LIN.,4
7,Mr HIGGS,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,"I wish to know from the Assistant Minister of Defence whether it is the intention of the Defence Department to send on to northern ports the German steamer Berlin, which was seized, was, until recently, in the possession the Prize Court, or to tranship her cargo at Sydney, to be sent on there. Will the Minister endeavour to have a decision arrived at as soon as possible, so that the consignees of the cargo may know what to do?",4
8,Mr JENSEN,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,"I shall inquire into the subject at once, and shall try to give the honourable member an answer today. October and COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT STEAM-SHIPS.",4
9,Mr CARR,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,"As it is the policy of the to establish a line of Government steamers, will the Prime Minister consider the advisability of utilizing the large number of German steamers now the inheld as prizes of war?",4
10,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,The matter is receiving the attention of the Government. MINISTERIAL DESIGNATIONS .,4
11,Sir JOHN FORREST,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,"I ask the Prime Minister what authority there is for the appointment of Assistant Ministers. Is the office of Assistant Miuister provided for in the Constitution, and are the Assistant Ministers who have been appointed to be salaried Ministers?",4
12,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,"The right honourable gentleman knows that the Constitution provides a certain sum for the remuneration of the Ministry as a whole, no sum being set down for individual Ministers. Beyond the offices specifically named . in | the Constitution, it is indifferent what titles are used, but I have always held the view that it is not desirable to have Honorary Ministers. At the same time, additional Ministers are necessary, and the term Assistant Minister is a better designation than that of Honorary Minister for the gentlemen who are so called, because they are really assistant Ministers. The term Assistant Minister is a better designation thau the term Honorary Minister for gentlemen whose position is honorary, but who at the same time are giviug assistance.",4
13,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,"Will the right honourable gentleman indicate what the distinction is, if there be one, between an Honorary and an Assistant Minister ?",5
14,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,Perhaps we are falling into a bad habit; but last session we heard of an Assistant Minister of Home Affairs - |*| the pluck to do the thing properly ?,5
15,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,Will the Prime Minister make it clear that the whole Ministry is remunerated out of the sum provided for in the Constitution; that no unauthorized payment is made to any Minisber ?,5
16,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,There is no remuneration for Ministers other than that provided for by the Constitution.,5
17,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,"Is there any distinction in function, or any other distinction, between Honorary and Assistant Ministers ?",5
18,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,"No ; but the Assistant Ministers are now being made use of more fully than has been usual, and will give greater service to the country. Thoy will be in many instances really Assistant Ministers, and I regard the designation which has been adopted a better one than Honorary Minister. Mr Glynn"" - The Prime Minister will remember that when in 1901 two members of the Executive Council were called Honorary Ministers a discussion on the whole question arose. I ask the right honourable gentleman whether he has considered the application of Chapter II . of the Constitution, which expressly limits the number of Ministers administering departments to seven, until Parliament otherwise provides. As a matter of fact, the so-called Assistant Minister of Home Affairs in the last Administration was merely a member of the Executive Council, and was only colloquially designated Assistant Minister.",5
19,Mr MAHOUT,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,That is all that is being done now.,5
20,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,Then it is a farce.,5
21,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,In that case the right honourable gentleman started the farce.,5
22,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,The gentlemen who are being termed Assistant Ministers were gazetted as Honorary Ministers.,5
23,Sir JOHN FOBREST,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,They are not Honorary Ministers.,5
24,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,They ought to be termed Assistant Ministers.,5
25,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,I entirely agree with that.,5
26,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,I heard my right honourable friend say during his term of office that more Ministers were needed.,5
27,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,Why had you not,5
28,Sir JOHN FORREST,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,"The interjection that I made just now had no reference to emolument. The Constitution provides for only seven Ministers of State, and makes no mention of Honorary Ministers. In my opinion, members are improperly designated Honorary Ministers, and those so designated are merely members of the Executive Council under summons. Later : On Mr Greene asking, upon notice, of the Assistant Minister of Defence, Whether employment has been refused to any men applying for work on the troopships for the Imperial Expeditionary Forces on the grounds that they were non-unionists f",5
29,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,"There is a point .of order arising out of this question which may as well be settled now, as to whether, the honourable member is in order in ad : dressing this question to the Assistant Minister of Defence. Our Standing Orders are perfectly clear in directing that questions should be addressed to Ministers, and there is no authority justifying an honourable member addressing. a question to an Assistant Minister of Defence. He does not exist as such. I think that the old rules should be followed until the Government have validated this new procedure of theirs. Until the matter is put on the proper basis, we should resort to our old practice, which is just as easy as the course now being "" pursued. As a matter of fact, there is ' no such designation as ""Assistant Minis- ' 1 ter."" The course adopted by Ministers'* is creating a function by an act of ministration without reference to the House, which is a course that to be followed. There is a proper way which should be taken in dealing with these matters. Ministers need more assistorder ance, but they should get it in the proper way, and if they approach the House i that way I can promise them that they will receive the help and support of honourable members of the Opposition.",5
30,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,"Yes , and abuse later on ticular for increasing the expenditure.",6
31,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,"The honourable member need not increase the expenditure by a penny if he does not wish to do so. It lies entirely with Ministers as to they pay themselves at the present time. My point of order is that this question is addressed to a personage who does not in fact exist. He is gazetted as an "" orary Minister,"" and u n t i l the other designation is gazetted, or better still, until steps have been taken for providing the office, the old designation should observed, and the question addressed to the Minister representing the Minister Defence.",6
32,Mr MASSYGREENE,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,"B y way of personal planation I may say that when I gave notice of the question yesterday, I had it written out as a question to be suborable mitted to the Minister representing Minister of Defence. Apparently there has been an alteration made. I do not know at whose suggestion.",6
33,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,I do not think the point of order is a material one.,6
34,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,It is certainly intended to be frivolous or unfriendly.,6
35,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,"Tb e Leader of the position has no objection to the designathe tion of ' ' Minister assisting the Minister of Defence.""",6
36,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,No .,6
37,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,"Then what is the difference between that designation and ""Assistant Minister of Defence."" It is merely a transposition of the words.",6
38,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,You should adhere to the old designation.,6
39,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,"I do not know that there is anything in the Constitution in regard to Honorary Ministers. What right, then, is there to address a question to an Honorary Minister? The one designation is as good as the other. I suggest to my friend that he. should not raise any point upon this matter. I quite agree with him that the work of the Ministry has been adtoo great for the number of Ministers provided by the Constitution. However, ought not that is another matter.",6
40,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,"The leader of the Opposition has asked whether it is in to address a certain question to an Assistant Minister. There is nothing in n the Standing Orders nor, do I think, in any authority on Parliamentary pro-ced'ure that will direct me as to what designation should be used. In this parinstance the question was originally addressed to the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, but, in accordance, I understand, with the desires of the Government, it ' was placed what on the Notice-paper to be asked of the Assistant Minister of Defence. In the circumstances I do not see that there is any question of order in the matter. It Honis purely a matter of taste. I do not know of any constitutional objection to a question being addressed to an Honorary Minister as the "" Assistant Minister be of Defence."" If the House decides otherwise I shall, of course follow its instrucof tion, but I do not feel called upon to decide that it is not in order to address exa question to a Minister in such terms.",6
41,Mr JENSEN,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,I would ask the honmember for Richmond to re-submit the his question on Wednesday next. NAVAL BASES.,6
42,Mr LAIRD SMITH,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,"A b o u t two years ago land in the constituency of Denison was purchased for a naval base, not but no work has been done there. I ask the Assistant Minister of Defence Opwhether he will immediately commence establishment of the proposed base?",6
43,Mr JENSEN,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,"The matter will be brought under the notice of the proper authorities.  ter's attention to the fact that,-over two years ago, land at Port Lincoln was surveyed and purchased for a sub-naval base. Will the Minister also see that the works there are put into hand?",6
44,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,And at Jervis Bay too ?,6
45,Mr ATKINSON,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,What about Beauty Point?,6
46,Mr CHARLTON,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,"Is the Minister representing the Minister of Defence aware that Admiral Henderson reported that Port Stephens should be one of the first submarine bases in Australia, that the work in connection with the submarine base at Port Stephens is not completed, and that though this port is one of the best harbors in Australia, there are no forts there, and there is nothing to prevent an enemy entering it at any time ? Will he take these facts into consideration when dealing with defence matters ?",6
47,Mr JENSEN,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,"Yes . TICK FEVER IN QUEENSLAND.  of Trade and Customs aware that, though red water and tick fever are still rampant in Queensland, over a thousand horses from Queensland have been landed in Victoria within the last few weeks'? Will he say what steps are being taken to prevent the spread of tick fever, and whether the practice of sending stockhorses in particular:-in large numbers, from Queensland to other States during the next month or two is to be permitted ; and can he tell us what provision is to be made to prevent the spread of tick fever in other States?",7
48,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,"It is a matter entirely for the States, as honourable members opposite have refused to give the Commonwealth additional powers in regard to this and other matters. However, if the honourable member will place his question on the notice-paper I shall have it looked into and give an answer as soon as possible.",7
49,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,May I supplement that answfr? I am aware that some such fact has arisen and I regret it . Apart from any feeling in any part of the House I hope that Australia will unite to deal with these matters in the only possible way in which they can be properly dealt with. PRICE OF WHEAT.,7
50,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,"Has the attention of the Prime Minister been drawn to the complaints of the Farmers and Settlers' Associations throughout Australia regarding the differential prices of wheat windhave been declared owing to our recent difficulties? The Forbes Farmers and Settlers' Association has, among others, made a request. I wish to know whether there is any power to enable the Commonwealth to fix a uniform price, .and, if so, whether the matter will be taken.into consideration at once.",7
51,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,"Subjec t to what the Attorney-General says, I do not tliink there is any such power under the Lemmon wealth Constitution. But I do not think we could equitably fix a uniform price for every port of Australia. Wheat is of less value in the district where it is raised tlian in a district to which it has to be transported. I have observed in the press the differential prices that have been fixed-apparently for political, and not for economic reasons-and I regret them.  Prime Minister if he does not think that some courtesy is due to me in this matter from the honourable member for Cook, wUo claims to be acting on behalf of Forbes, which is in my electorate. I specially represent the farmers and settlers, and I have yet to learn that the fixing of the price of wheat is a Commonwealth matter.",7
52,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,Is the honourable member asking a question?  it is a matter that has not been left to the States. The price of 4s. 9d. was fixed by a Labour Government.,7
53,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,Order ! The honourable member must not under cover of asking a question rise and make a speech. If he persists in doing so I shall have to take another course.  mentioned that the price was 4s. 9d. when I should have said 4s. 2d.,7
54,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,The honourable member is aggravating his offence. If he repeats it I promise him that I shall deal with him in a way that he will probably remember.,7
55,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,As a matter of personal explanation I would like to say that for a number of years I was secretary to the Forbes Farmers and Settlers Association.,7
56,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,Is the honourable member asking a question?,7
57,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,No . I am making a personal explanation arising out of the statement of the honourable member for Calare.,7
58,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,"The statement of the honourable member for Calare was distinctly out of order, and I have reproved him for making it. I cannot allow a. personal explanation relating to something which was distinctly out of order.",7
59,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,"But the honourable member for Calare has placed me in a available false position by his statement, and, Chief although it was out of order, nevertheless it is on the records.  I be permitted to make a personal explanation when the honourable member for Cook has finished?",8
60,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,"An honourable member is permitted to make a personal explanation provided that it is relevant to some question before the House, or if he has been misrepresented. Otherwise he is not permitted to do so.",8
61,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,As I seem to have upset the honourable member for Calare to such an extent I shall not pursue the matter any further. SYDNEY QUARANTIN E STATION .,8
62,Colonel RYRIE,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,Can the Minister of Trade and Customs tell me whether it is his intention to take steps with regard to the removal of the quarantine station at North Sydney?,8
63,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURE OF POSTAL,"I am not surprised, at the honourable member being unable to complete his question without laughing, seeing that, since he has been in this Chamber, he has submitted the same question toevery Minister of Trade and Customs. The matter has heen referred Excise Actto the quarantine authorities, and I have not seen any - reference' to it since I have Inter-Stite been in the Customs Department on this occasion. However, I do not think that there is any! intention to remove quarantine station in the near future. NA VOTING.",8
64,Mr SINCLAIR,CHECKED ROLLS OF ELECTORS,"the Minister of Home Affairs, upon notice I. Whether his predecessor directed the Chief Electoral Officer under Regulation 24A of the Commonwealth Electoral Act to prepare nnd issue to candidates at the last Federal election a checked roll of the electors who »voted in their division? 2. Has this instruction been cancelled, and if so, for what reason ?",8
65,Mr ARCHIBALD,CHECKED ROLLS OF ELECTORS,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The former Minister, Mr MCColl, issued a direction to the Chief' Electoral Officer in regard to comparison of the certified lists of voters used at the polling and the scrutiny of absent votes in connection , with the recent election, with a view to the result being made to candidates. 2. The present Minister has intimated to the Electoral Officer that in the absence of legislation requiring any such action to be taken, he does not approve of the preparation of a check roll at the present juncture.

ELECTION OF CHAIRMANOF ' COMMITTEES. Motion (by Mr FISHER ) proposed - That the honourable member for Riverina, Honourable John Moore Chanter, be appointed 'Chairman of Committees of this House.",8
66,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CHECKED ROLLS OF ELECTORS,Parramatta) 11.3] - I suppose that there is nothing shall or honourable members on this side of the House to do but to submit to the decree got. of the Caucus.,9
67,Mr SHARPE,CHECKED ROLLS OF ELECTORS,It hurts the right orable member.,9
68,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CHECKED ROLLS OF ELECTORS,"The Caucus is got in the last Parliament. hurting no one on this side, but judging by their faces, I think it has hurt a supporters of the Government. These satisfied. things happen, however, in the best regulated families. The decree has gone forth that the honourable member for Riverina is to be Chairman of Committees for the next three years, and if my honourable friend, the former occupant of the chair, who commanded the respect and esteem of the whole House, is content in this matter we, of course, must be. As N y m constituents. says in Henry V . , "" T h in g s must be as they may,"" and so we shall submit to the control of the honourable member for Riverina. We have had experience of him as Chairman of Committees, and I drawn ? frankly confess that his appointment will not be unwelcome to me. We know whan such statement. we are getting with respect to Committee control, and I , for one, have none but feelings of the utmost kindness to intended Chairman of Committees.",9
69,Dr MALONEY,CHECKED ROLLS OF ELECTORS,"The nicest speech that I have heard the right honourable member make for some time. Mr JOSE PH COOK - What is the use of my saying anything else ? I am simply pointing out that it is utterly useless for the Opposition to do anything in this case but to submit to the decree of the Caucus as determined in advance. The real Parliament has already chosen the honourable member for Riverina for this office, and this motion is therefore a mere formality.",9
70,Mr SHARPE,CHECKED ROLLS OF ELECTORS,"Did not the Libera l party, when in power, choose their Chairman of Committees before Parliament met!",9
71,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CHECKED ROLLS OF ELECTORS,I make a protest against monopoly.,9
72,Mr WEST,CHECKED ROLLS OF ELECTORS,The right honourable member makes a splendid clown.,9
73,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CHECKED ROLLS OF ELECTORS,"I should object to that remark, bu t that I know that the honourable member cannot help being offensive. I shall, therefore, allow it to pass. the The honourable member is always a credit to his constituency.

80,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CHECKED ROLLS OF ELECTORS,"I made no reflection on the honourable member's constituents; I merely desired to indicate that, whatever might be the result of the re-election of the honourable member for Ballarat, his constituents alone were responsible for his return. I hope and expect that we shall receive from the chair the same fair play that was meted out to us by the Chairman of Committees in the last Parliament, the honourable member for Perth. I avail myself of this opportunity to pay a tribute of admiration and respect to the former occupant of the chair. No honourable member ever had a more turbulent Committee to deal with, and no one dealt with it in a calmer and more judicial manner than he did. I wish the intended occupant of the chair well.

81,Mr CHANTER,CHECKED ROLLS OF ELECTORS,"I sincerely thank honourable members for the honour they have conferred upon me. The duties of Chairman of Committees will not be novel to me. I can assure the House that, as Chairman, I shall extend to every member his full rights and privileges, and that my endeavour will be not to allow any honourable member, no matter on what side of the House he sits, to exceed those rights and privileges. I intend, while in the chair, to hold the scales fairly, to know no party, to try to do justice to the position, and to uphold the best traditions of the office. NA ARBITRATIO NBIL L. SECOND READING.",10
82,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [11.12] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. I wish to explain that it is designed to enable the Executive to appoint a Deputy President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. A difficulty has arisen which makes its passing necessary. Mr Justice Higgins' first appointment as President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court ran out a day or two before we took office. Recognising that it was a matter of urgency, the Executive [3] re-appointed His Honour on the day following its accession to office. It was naturally thought that he would appoint without delay a deputy to act during his absence from the Commonwealth, so that the business of the Court, which is very much congested, might be carried on. Unfortunately, however, we were unable to get into communication with Mr. Justice Higgins for some few days, and delay was occasioned. Subsequently he accepted the appointment, and was sworn in before Mr Justice Madden, who is now in England. Mr. Justice Powers was quite willing to accept an appointment made in this way, but the Chief Justice thought that the President had no power, when outside the Commonwealth, to appoint a deputy. A conference of the Justices was held, and it was decided to notify me that, in their opinion, no power existed whereby an appointment could be made in the circumstances by a Judge outside the Commonwealth; and their Honours recommended that legislation should be introduced for the purpose of giving the Executive power to make the appointment. This measure is intended merely to cure the defect discovered by the Justices; it goes to that extent and no further. What it actually does is to enable the Executive to appoint a Deputy President, in view of the fact that Mr Justice Higgins is out of Australia, and will remain there for some months, and it is clearly impossible for him to make an appointment and comply with what the Chief Justice and his colleagues declare to be the law. It is the intention of the Government to make this appointment at the earliest possible moment. The business of the Arbitration Court is now so congested as to create circumstances likely to bring about a breach of industrial peace. For weeks the Court has done nothing, and there are cases which have been on the list for two years. This in itself is a condition of things nearly approaching a public scandal. There ought not to be an hour's delay in re-creating the machinery necessary for the speedy hearing of these industrial causes. The object of this measure is to do what could have been done, and would have been done, without any legislation at all, or any consultation with this Parliament, if the President had been within the Commonwealth. The measure, it will be seen, is one that relates purely to procedure; it confers no further powers on the President, it does not interfere with the manner in which he is to conduct the cases, and it is, as I have said, introduced solely because His Honour is out of the Commonwealth.",10
83,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AND,"Angas) [11.19] - I am glad that the Attorney-General has referred to the desirability of expediting the work of the Court, because it is a matter that very substantially affects the commercial public as well as the general working classes of Australia. I do not for one moment suggest that the Judges are not admirably doing their work ; I have more than once paid a tribute to the President of the Court for the exceptional energy and zeal which he has thrown into the discharge of his exceedingly onerous duties. We cannot, however, ignore the fact that owing to the great number of claims filed - and , probably, in the ordinary course of administration, properly filed-there has been delay in the hearings. This delay it was desired by the preceding Administration to overcome by an amendment of the Act, or some other method. However, I am not going into questions of policy at the preseut time. This Bill , having come before us with the approval, if I may so term it , of the Judiciary, can be readily accepted. I think the idea in the original drafting of the Act was to make provision, as is done in several Acts of Parliament for the appointment of Deputies, where there are presidents or commissioners. matter of fact, the Bills which have been drafted in connection with the Murray make specific provision for the appointment of a Deputy by the Governors of the States or the Governor General, and for the duration of the office, and so forth . I desire to draw the attention of the Attorney-General to only one point. Is there' likely to be any inconvenience arising from the fact that, in the absence of the President, an appointment can be made by the Governor General? I take it that were the President here the appointment of a Deputy would be for a specific purpose; it would scarcely be said to be an appointment for an indefinite t w in . If the Governor General does make an appointment, that must, to some extent, affect the power of the President to do so.",11
84,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,In what way?,11
85,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AND,"If a Deputy is appointed for a particular purpose, and not as a standing Deputy, there is no inconvenience, but if the appointment is for an indefinite time, and does not expire with the accomplishment of the particular purpose, it may be that there is an implied limitation on the President to make a similar appointment.",11
86,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,The President cannot appoint a Deputy for a longer period than that for which he himself is appointed.,11
87,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AND,"That is the reason I am raising the point. The President holds office for seven years; and I do not think that, in the absence of the President, the Governor General would make an appointment for seven years.",11
88,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,The - Governor General could not do thab; the President could cancel the appointment just as he could have made it .,11
89,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AND,That is the p o in t could he do so ?,11
90,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,I think so.,11
91,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AND,"I am not quite sure on the matter, and I am glad to be able to draw the attention of the Attorney General to it . This is a B i ll for Committee, and I shall not delay honourable members longer. Mr. JOSEPH ' COOK (Parramatta) [11.25] - I shall not delay this measure, and certainly not with any intention of opposing it . The few simple statements of the Attorney-General in introducing the measure show the need for keeping As a the door of this Court open every moment that it is possible to do so. I hear with some amazement from the Attorney General that this Court is so congested that there is business there of two years' standing.",11
92,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,I say there are causes on the list two years old.,11
93,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"The Attorney General rightly describes the position as approaching a public scandal; and I emphasize a point on which we both agree, namely, that the Court has completely broken down as a Court for facilitating and dispensing justice in the disposition of our. industrial affairs.",11
94,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,I should think the Court must break down if the High Court undoes all the work!,11
95,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,The Attorney General makes it perfectly clear that the Court is not doing its business.,11
96,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,I said nothing of the sort. Mr. JOSEPH COOE: - As it ought to do. S,12
97,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,I agree with that; the High Court has the right to upset every decision.,12
98,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,I say that the Court is not doing its business as it was intended to do it .,12
99,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,That is right.,12
100,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND,It is not the fault of the Court.,12
101,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,I did not it was the fault of the Court.,12
102,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND,Then the honourable member cannot say that the Court has failed.,12
103,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"It is the result of trying to do an impossibility; it is as impossible to control and regulate the industrial affairs of this huge continent in a Court of this kind as it is to pull down the moon. Some more facile instrument will have to be created before we can hope to have matters adjusted with that swiftness requisite in the constantly changing industrial conditions. This rigid Arbitration Court will never do that, and is not doing it ; and the Attorney-General says the attempt is approaching a public scandal.",12
104,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,"I must insist on the honourable member saying why I said it was a public scandal, and why there was this congestion.",12
105,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,It is because of the congestion of business?,12
106,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,"Quite so, and why is there that congestion?",12
107,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"Because of the unworkableness of this tribunal, which you do not propose to alter.",12
108,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,Do we not?,12
109,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,There is no proposal to do so.,12
110,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,If the honourable member were not there we would do so.,12
111,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,May I ask my honourable friend whether this Bill is intended to carry out the proposal in paragraph 26 of the Governor General's Speech? Mr HUGHES' - Certainl y not.,12
112,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,That another matter?,12
113,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,Yes . [ 8 ] -»,12
114,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"I suppose this Bill ' is intended to meet the Attorney General's letter to the Post Office? The Bill, I take it, is merely to cure a technical defect; and that will not touch the condition of affairs sketched by the Attorney-General. The trouble sought to be met by the Bill is only two weeks old, whereas the other trouble I speak of is, according to the Attorney-General, two years old.",12
115,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONCILIATION AND,What about the appeals to the High Court from this Court? say Mr. JOSEPH COOK - That is not sought to be cured by the Bill.,12
116,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONCILIATION AND,We may be doing it with the other Bill for all the honourable member knows.,12
117,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"All the machinery the Government can or will create to deal with the High Court or any other Court will not help one bit in disturbing the rigidity of the Arbitration Court in its technical forms. I am convinced that the time is not far distant when we shall have to revolutionize this method of settling industrial disputes, because, as we see in many of the States, the rigid lumbering machinery is breaking down. The previous Government did propose to cure the evil by another method entirely. Mr BRENNAN. - And a more cumbrous method 1",12
118,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"Not at all ; but by a method sufficiently facile to meet the growing complexities of our industrialism, and enable relief to be given at the moment when it is needed.",12
119,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,That cannot be done without an amendment of the Constitution.,12
120,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"Of course not, and we proposed to make such an amendment of the Constitution as would enable us to carry out that object. I fancy, however, that the Attorney-General is on another track altogether. After all, this is not so much a party matter. We are all interested in maintaining industrial peace, and we on this side ought to be given credit, even when we differ from our friends opposite, if we approach the question in a spirit of sincerity and with an earnest desire to settle industrial is troubles from day to day. It is a staggering fact, and a grinning commentary on all our previous efforts to bring about industrial cohesion, when we are told that the business of the Oourt is two years in arrears- a fact which, in the opinion of the Attorney-General, approaches a public scandal. That is the best of all reasons why we should not interpose the slightest obstacle to the passage of this Bill , so that the doors of the Court may be re-opened at the earliest possible moment, and every facility granted to those who have disputes to have them settled in a peaceable way.",12
121,Mr JH CATTS,CONCILIATION AND,"Cook) [11.31] - I should like to point out to the Leader of the Opposition that, no matter what scheme we may have for settling tliese in dustrial disputes, if we refuse to provide the necessary machinery the scheme will break down. If , as has been suggested by the honourable gentleman opposite, we were to have a system of Wages Boards, and these Boards were too large and cumbersome, if their machinery were not sufficient, and sufficient chairmen were not provided, that scheme of Wages Boards would break down. So too, if we have an Arbitration Court with only one Judge to do the work of half-a-dozen Judges, that Court will become water-logged, and cannot do its work. The main trouble with the Commonwealth Court of A r b i tration is that we bave one Judge to do the work of several Judges, and the way to get over the difficulty is to appoint additional Judges who can give their whole time to the work, clear off the arrears, and prevent them accumulating again.",13
122,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"How many Judges do you suggest ? . Mr JH CATTS - I do not suggest the number; that can be readily ascertained by the proper But whatever number should be provided. If , in administration of any branch of the law, we fai l to provide the necessary Judges and accommodation, we must have the same state of affairs arising as at present exists in connection with the Arbitration Court. It is not a matter of difference of policy, but merely a question of providing the necessary machinery. I have no desire to delay this measure. It is highly important and necessary, and should go through immediately. But I do impress upon the Attorney-General that the provision of further facilities for the hearing of these cases is a matter of extreme urgency. The Leader of the Opposition, was a little acidulated in his criticism, as he usually is, but I would remind him that he was in office for twelve months and did nothing. He had to learn from the Attorney-General today that the work of the Court was two years in arrears. How comes it that the honourable member was leading a Government and did not know the state of affairs in connection with the Court? The honourable gentleman stated that his Government had. a policy to put forward to better the condition of things in the A r b i tration Court, but the fact remains that they came before Parliament with proposals to wipe the Legislature out and so prevent Parliament doing any work.",13
123,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND,Order !,13
124,Mr JH CATTS,CONCILIATION AND,"The Liberal Government sought a double dissolution, and so prevented us from doing anything to improve the conditions of the Court.",13
125,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND,Sa y no more ahout it . We are all sorry for it now.,13
126,Mr JH CATTS,CONCILIATION AND,"I have no doubt that others, besides the honourable member, are sorry. I do not think it lies in the mouth of the Leader of the Opposition to urge any criticism against the party now in office in regard to the work of the Court not being properly attended to. I sincerely trust that almost immediately we shall have proposals brought forward for an extension of the machinery, apart altogether from the question as to whether we shall have an A r b i tration Courb or Wages Boards. That matter of policy can be taken into, consideration at any time when it is necessary to perfect our industrial arbitration machinery, but, in the meantime, in f u r therance of the policy laid down in the authorities present Act , it is incumbent upon Parliais required ment to provide the machinery for the im the mediate hearing of all cases now listed and the prevention of congestion in future.",13
127,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,"Batman) [11.35] - I do not propose to discuss the general question of arbitration at this stage. An opportunity of doing that will come later, but I propose to reply in a half-a-dozen words to the statement of the Leader of the Opposition that the disclosure made by the Attorney-General is a grinning commentary upon the arbitration system. It is a grinning commentary, not on the arbitration system, but on the hypocritical utterances of persons outside this House who have spoken nominally in the interests of peace, but bave exercised ail ' their influence in the courts to prevent the merits of arbitration cases being considered. The present congestion in the Court has not been caused by the consideration of the merits of cases brought before the Court, but by the technical objections raised by those who are the enemies of arbitration. That fact ought to be kept constantly before the mind of the public. I did not agree entirely with the honourable member for Cook when he says that the cure for this evil is to be found in the appointment of more Judges. I say that that cure is to be found in an educated public opinion which will rise in revolt against the hypocritical attitude of those who say they are friends-of industrial peace, while, at the same time, they are doing everything they possibly can to promote industrial warfare. I desire to say further that the fact of the A r b i tration Court being congested with work is not a proof that the Court is a failure. On the contrary, that fact is some proof that the institution is a success. The fact that a tribunal is being approached in such numbers by persons in need of adjudication is proof that there is a strong belief in the public mind that the awards of that tribunal are worth having.",13
128,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND,And the awards being observed.,14
129,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,"As the Postmaster General remarks, the awards of the Court have been almost universally observed, and have tended, in a large measure, to bring about general industrial peace. . I no not intend to discuss the merits of Arbitration Courts at this stage. merely rose for the purpose of answering the statement of the Leader of the Opposition that the present congestion of work in the Court is a grinning commentary on the system of arbitration. I say that it is a grinning commentary, although upon those whose public attitude has been favourable to industrial peace, but whose acts have been prejudicial to the bringing about of industrial peace.",14
130,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,"Richmond) [11.38] Permit me to say in answer to the honourable member for Batman thab it is quite true that the Federal Arbitratio n Court has been congested, and it is quite true, also, as the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out, that that congestion is a grinning commentary on our arbitration system. I think we should endeavour to get down to the first cause, which is not that stated by the honourable member for Batman. Tne cause of congestion in the Arbitration Court is that'there has been a conspiracy taking place under cover of the union movement to get behind the Constitution and force into the Federal Arbitration Court every single union throughout the length and breadth of Australia. That is the real reason for the congestion. We all remember the letters that appeared in the Worker from "" Brother "" so-and-so in South Australia to "" B r o the r "" so-and-so in New South Wales asking the workers to assist in creating a dispute extending beyond the boundaries of the one State so that they could manufacture a case to take to the Federal Arbitration Courb. It is that policy which has been the primal cause of congestion in the work of that Court. What happened in Brisbane in connection with the Tramway Union ? We all recognise the conspiracy that took place there, and we know that that conspiracy was responsible for one - of the greatest cases ever brought before the Federal Arbitration Court. We know, as a matter of actual fact, that the Tramway Union in South Australia could have settled their case in their own State, and are the same position obtained in this State. All through there has been an express endeavour on the part of the Labour party, by a conspiracy all over Australia, to crowd the unions into the Federal Arbitration Court so as to get Federal control of the unions for political purposes. That is the sole reason at the back of the Federal arbitration legislation which the I party opposite are going on with now.  talking through his neck.",14
131,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,"I . am speaking the truth, and no one knows it better than does the honourable member who has just in terjected. Honourable members opposite are putting forth all their political endeavours to get the unions behind them as one solid body throughout Australia. They recognise that there is no better method by which to bring that about than in forcing all the unions to go to the Federal Arbitration Court. Honourable members opposite are the chief conspirators in this huge conspiracy to which I have referred, and are primarily responsible for the congestion which has been brought about in the Federal Arbitration Court. Question resolved in the aflirmative. Bill read a second time. Standing Orders suspended, and Bill passed through its remaining stages. Motion (by Mr FISHER ) agreed toThat the Standing Orders be suspended in order to enable the Committees of Supply and Ways and Means to be appointed before the Address-in-Reply to His Excellency the Governor General's opening Speech has been agreed to by the House, and to enable all other steps to be at once taken to obtain Supply, and to pass the Supply Bills through all their stages without delay.

It is not advisable that I should attempt to make a financial statement at the present time. It is, indeed, impossible to do so in the circumstances at present existing. Facts and figures might easily be submitted to show the state of the public accounts, but u n t i l the Budget statement can be delivered the true financial position of the Commonwealth cannot be made known.",15

The ex-Treasurer wil l admit that that is the best I can do in the circumstances.",15
135,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILIATION AND,The Government are not in the same position as usual. There bave been three months in which to get the Budget papers ready.,15
136,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,There is no difficulty on that score.,15
137,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,The right honourable gentleman can tell us the state of things fro m the revenue side.,15
138,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,"Yes . The dissolution, as honourable members are aware, prevented the Budget statement being made. My honourable friends opposite know that they did not make any financial statement at all for the present year. The fact that Parliament was not sitting placed the country under certain disabilities, which, SUPPLY. however, we are not considering at the present time. Then, on the 4th August, war intervened, and the late Government, with the concurrence of the party which I have the honour to lead, and of the country, I think, undertook to incur all the unauthorized expenditure which was necessary to protect ourselves, and to assist, as far as possible, with contingents and otherwise, the Mother Country. U p to the present time there has been an extraordinary expenditure of about £1,250,000 on defence alone.",15
139,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILIATION AND,"Speciall y for war, in addition to the ordinary expenditure?",15
140,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,"There has been an additional expenditure arising almost wholly out of the war, amounting to approximately £1,250,000.",15

142,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,"U p o n expeditionary forces, mobilization, and every other conceivable thing arising out of a condition of war.",15

146,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,"N e a r l y £1,000,000 has been expended. I can give the exact figures.",15
147,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILIATION AND,We merely wish to know what amount the Treasury has already paid.,15
148,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,"U p o n expeditionary forces, £817,000 has been actually expended in one branch.",15
149,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,What branch is that?,15
150,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,It must be the military branch.,15
151,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,"It includes both m i l i tary and naval expenditure. Then an expenditure of £200,500 was necessary to cover the mobilization of the Forces.",15
152,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILIATION AND,That is the same thing.,15
153,Mr FISHEE,CONCILIATION AND,"Of that sum, £50,000 is being expended in the purchase of rent motor lorries for the British Government, but it is expected that £200,000 will required.

This is a fitting opporsimilar period in 1913-14. tunity to deal with the matter raised the Leader of the Opposition as to whether this defence expenditure should porated in an ordinary Supply Bill or not.

168,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,"Yes . I am not in a position to make any statement on the subject, and the question is whether the matter should be discussed now.",17

An y tentative ment at the present time might reach quarters where a false impression might be created, which could not be afterwards corrected. As far as the finances generally are concerned, the position is not acute; but as for the obligations for the future, it must be recognised that we shall have an enormous defence expenditure, and that the position in regard to our ordinary expenditure will be fairly critical. I suggest to honourable members that they should allow this bare provision for a month to go through, and thus meet the necessities of the day. I undertake, within a month, and before another Supolv Bill is brought down, to deliver a Budget statement covering the whole ground, so that not only may the people of Australia be informed of our position, negotiations but also that people elsewhere, whose good opinion we value, may know the whole facts.",17
175,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILIATION AND,"Swan) [12.9] In the first place, I congratulate you, Mr . Chanter, on again occupying the position of Chairman of Committees. I remember sitting under you for some years, during which you gave satisfaction to all members of the Committee, and I . feel sure that you will do so again during your present term of office. I sympathize with the Leader of the Government in regard to the position in which he finds hinfself in now asking for temporary Supply, and his difficulties will not be increased by anything that I shall say or do. At the present time, my duty is to assist him to the utmost in providing against the troubles that have arisen. There is no reason why we should not dispose of the Supply Bill quickly, and no reason for wishing for a statement at the present moment, seeing that the Treasurer will be in a better position to deal with the subject when he presents his Budget, which he hopes to do withi n a month. We are confronted with difficulties that we could not anticipate, and we must do nothing to accentuate them. But before I deal with the present position as disclosed by the Treasurer, I am very sorry to say there is a matter- a personal matter to a large extent-to which I have to refer, and which, although it is somewhat ancient, I cannot allow to go by without a protest. I refer to. statements which have been made throughout the country by a great many honourable members on the other side of state- the chamber-and I am sorry I cannot exclude the Treasurer from the list-that I had misrepresented the financial position by withholding information with regard to the position at the Treasury at the time the double dissolution took place. Such statements have been freely made, not by the Treasurer himself only, but by the press, and especially the Labour press, throughout Australia, and have come from sources from which one would not expect them, and in addition to honourable members. It has been said that when I made my last speech on the subject, on 25th June last, I withheld information, and tried to gain an advantage.by misleading the Houso as to the state of the nnances, and capital was sought to be made of the fact that I treated the surplus that was carried forward at the end of 1912-13 as revenue available for the coming year. I may point out that it has always been the practice in the Commonwealth, and in the States, for a deficit or surplus, as the case may be, at the end of a financial year to be carried forward to the next year. In the case of a deficit, it has to be liquidated in the next year; and in the case of a surplus the balance is taken into consideration and is available in estimating the next year's expenditure. That was the practice adopted by the right honourable gentleman when he was at the Treasury. In his last year of office he had to credit at the end of the year the sum of £2,261,000, and he arranged to spend the whole of that amount during the following year. That he did not do so might have been a very good thing for himself and for the country, but there is no doubt at all he intended to do so. And I simply followed the same course. In fact, I used almost the same o language as the right honourable gentleman, in plain words, when introducing the Budget on the 2nd October, 1913. These were my wordsThe total estimated revenue for the current year amounts to £21,462,000, which, added to the surplus of £2,653,223, makes, the total amount available for this year's expenditure £24,115,223. Then I went on to sayThe expenditure is estimated to cover whole amount available, viz., £24,115,223. Including, not only the estimated revenue, but the amount carried forward. What could more clearly express the intention of the Government at the time ? We were going to spend all the revenue we expected to receive, and also the surplus carried forward Next we come to a statement. I subsequently made, to the effect that we were to have a surplus of about £1,000,000-it was actually £1,223,000at the end of the financial year ending 30th June, 1914. What did the present Treasurer say? He interjected on the 11th June last, "" Has not the right honourable gentleman spent more than his income?"" And I replied, ' ' Seeing that at the beginning of the year there was a surplus of £2^643,305, and that there will be a surplus of only £S24,305 at the end of the year, I should say that that question is unnecessary."" The surplus was actually £1,223,000. Then I went on to say I thought there would be a surplus of £1,000,000, and the honourable member for Kennedy, the present Speaker, asked, "" In respect of the year's transactions V and I said, "" On the transactions of the year ending 30th June, and inclusive of the surplus."" It seems to me that I kept nothing back. I made it clear that we intended to use all of the £2,600,000, as well as the revenue for the year, while I clearly stated that we expected to have at the end of the financial year a surplus of £1,000,000; that is, a balance of £1,000,000. It was quite open to the Government to spend the whole surplus of £2,600,000 on 30th June, 1913. We had Parliamentary authority to do so; Parliament knew that we intended to do so; and that we did not do so and had £1,223,000 to the good is, I think, a matter for congratulation rather than for misrepresentation and abuse throughout the country.",17
176,Mr JH CATTS,CONCILIATION AND,On what did you cut down the expenditure?,18
177,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILIATION AND,"The money was not spent to the extent proposed in the Budget, but that is not my point; my argument is that it was grossly improper and unfair for any one-and the Prime Minister is not clear of the charge-to say that I had withheld the true position. In one paper it was said, without the a tittle of justification or evidence, that I was sorry for my action, and had apologized for it . All I can say is that these tactics are neither fair, justifiable, nor creditable.",18
178,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,I say they are grossly unfai r and improper.,18
179,Sir JOHNFORREST,CONCILIATION AND,"I think so, too. I am sorry to have to refer to these statements. As one honourable member interjects, they are scandalous. I am not accustomed to them. If I - could not keep my seat and go through a parliamentary election without misrepresenting my fellow men and those try in g to do their duty honestly and well, I should be sorry to be here.",18
180,Mr JH CATTS,CONCILIATION AND,You have done a good deal of it .,19
181,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILIATION AND,Never . challenge any one in this Chamber to say that I have ever made a misstatement.,19
182,Mr JH CATTS,CONCILIATION AND,I bowled you last session.,19
183,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILIATION AND,"For one honourable member to make misstatements about another honourable member and endeavour to put him into a position which he kuows is not the true position is grossly u n fair ; in fact, he is not f it to associate with.",19
184,Mr JH CATTS,CONCILIATION AND,You did it last session.,19
185,Sir JOHNFORREST,CONCILIATION AND,"I never did. The honourable member is referring to some little interjection which I made, and was shown to be in error by the Hansard record, and he seeks to make something out of it .",19
186,Mr JH CATTS,CONCILIATION AND,You would not admit it . You said that the records were wrong.,19
187,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILIATION AND,"That is not fair fighting. It is what in the ring they call "" hitting below the belt,"" of which there has been a great deal throughout the country. I do not think honourable members opposite are quite as ashamed of their conduct as they should be. - It is very satisfactory to know that there was a credit balance in the Treasury on 30th June last of £1,223,000. As I said just now, it should be a mattei for congratulation, especially in our present circumstances, that the late Government did not spend all the money they might have spent.",19
188,Mr JH CATTS,CONCILIATION AND,What were the commitments?,19
189,Sir JOHNFORREST,CONCILIATION AND,"I cannot be. bothered by the honourable member. I do not wish to have interjections from a man who makes statements as the honourable member does. I do not want impertinence from such a man. It is a matter for congratulation that we have this money available. I understand that the amount has increased during the last three months to over £1,500,000. I am glad to see that we have this money available for the services of the present year. The Treasurer must be congratulating himself on the fact that he has over £.1,500,000 sterling with, which to begin the year. I am glad of it . I merely say once more-Why not be fair in these I matters; why not be generous? I am desirous of being generous to my opponents. When I can do so properly, I out will always be generous. It is fortunate that we have this money, because it is a very good start for the year. It ought to insure to us that, with economy and care in regard to current accounts, there will not be any reason for imposing auy additional taxation. I am very glad that there was no mention of extra taxation in the Governor General's Speech yesterday, because this is not a time' for increasing the burdens of the people. It is a time of great financial difficulty, both in regard to the war and also in regard to the terrible season with which we are confronted. My right honourable friend has said this morning that he intended to keep the whole addi-' tional expenditure caused by the war separate from the ordinary expenditure on defence. In my opinion, there is no necessity for us to mix up in any way the current expenditure witli the extraordinary expenditure due to the war. The expenditures can be kept separate and distinct. We can easily do this, and can clearly show the whole expenditure in connection with the war, and what has* been expended in regard to our ordinary services.",19
190,Mr FISHEK,CONCILIATION AND,They are being kept - separate.,19
191,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILIATION AND,"We raise millions by loan for certain purposes, a.nd the accounts are kept separately. We know exactly how much has been spent out of loan account and how much has been spent out of the current account. The expenditures are not mixed up at all. 'That is what my right honourable friend ought to do in regard to the war expenditure. ",19
192,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,We are doing it .,19
193,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILIATION AND,"Whateve r money we raise for this purpose we ought to raise it specifically, and know what we have. The war account ought not to be mixed up in any way with the current account. To do that would only lead to confusion. The amount which we are asked to vote on war account should in clude the expenditure for mobilization and everything extraordinary; in fact, everything which has made the expenditure increase from what it would have been if there had been no war. I made an arrangement before I left the Treasury that that was to be done, and I was under the impression that it had the f u concurrence of the Treasury officials. Honourable members will notice that these Estimates include £1,650,000 for the Expeditionary Forces. I should like to know whether that amount includes what has been expended already without parliamentary authority-that is, on mobilizing and everything else.",19
194,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,Yes .,20
195,Sir JOHN FOBREST,CONCILIATION AND,"If that is so, I think that the Government is not proceeding constitutionally. Illegal expenditure without the authority of Parliament has taken place, and that illegal action requires to be validated by an Indemnity Act. I want the right honourable gentleman to put the matter on a proper footing, and to do what I would have certainly done if I had had the opportunity. We knew that there was no authority to spend this money. A great emergency arose, and we took the responsibility. But the very first thing we would have done on meeting Parliament would have been to tell honourable members how much we had spent without authority, and ask them for an indemnity. To legalize what has been done is, I take it , the only course to pursue. If we. once admit that a Government can spend money without authority, an'd when it meets Parliament neither ask for or obtain an Act of Indemnity to cover the illegal expenditure, where will it lead to ? We must look upon it as a grave illegality to spend money without authority, and the only justification in this case was that there was no Parliament in existence, otherwise we would have had to summon Parliament. We were in a dilemma, and we took the responsibility. It was a great responsibility to take, and the expenditure ought now to be covered by a special parliamentary approval, and not as the right honourable gentleman now proposes to do by antedating this Bill to the 1st July, and to pay this illegal expenditure out of that vote as if nothing was the matter. The Treasurer ought to get a special validating measure to cover the expenditure up to today. Therefore, I hope that he will consider the matter.",20
196,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,"The Bill says so. Sir JOHN FORR.EST - I have looked through the Bill, but I did not see a word.",20
197,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,Clause 4 reads The said sum shall be available to satisfy the l l warrants under the hand of the Governor General in respect of any purposes and services set forth in the said schedule.,20
198,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILIATION AND,That is the ordinary clause in every Bill.,20
199,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,"No , that is an extra.",20
200,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILIATION AND,"Not at all. There is nothing in the clause about the illegal expenditure; there is no indemnity, as I contend there ought to be.",20
201,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,I consulted the Crown Solicitor.,20
202,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILIATION AND,"That officer seems to have overlooked a very important matter. If we pass the measure in its present shape, and tliere is no indemnity given for spending the money without parliamentary authority, the flood gates will be opened, and the Government can do the thing every year, and never tell Parliament anything about the matter. I desire to know how much money has been spent without parliamentary warrant. I am not asking the right honourable gentleman to do what I would not do myself. It is well known in the Treasury that I said, "" The very first thing we should do when we meet Parliament is to make a clear statement of the expenditure on account of the war and to ask for an indemnity for that amount, and get an appropriation for the proposed future war expenditure."" To take any other course is to act improperly. It is not doing what has always been done. I have never known a case in which a Treasurer who spent money without authority did not specially ask Parliament to validate his act.",20
203,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONCILIATION AND,"You have had no experience of a big war, though.",20
204,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILIATION AND,"The honourable member knows very well that this is only a matter of A , B, C.",20
205,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,What did you do when you left a deficit?,20
206,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILIATION AND,I have never left a deficit.,20
207,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,"Oh , yes, there was.",20
208,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILIATION AND,Not while I was in office.,20
209,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,"Yes , you were.",20
210,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILIATION AND,"I assure the right honourable gentleman that I have never had a deficit yet, but if I did I should take the first means possible to validate any wrong doing.",20
211,Mr FISHEE,CONCILIATION AND,"Not "" w r o n g doing."" That word should not be used.",21
212,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILIATION AND,"Well , it is an illegality. I hope that the right honourable gentleman will deal with this matter in a much more serious way than he has done.",21
213,Mr FISHEE,CONCILIATION AND,I consulted the Crown Law officers in the matter.,21
214,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILIATION AND,And they have done nothing.,21
215,Mr FISHEK,CONCILIATION AND,They considered nothing was necessary.,21
216,Sir JOHNFORREST,CONCILIATION AND,I do not agree with them. Some special action is necessary. When you break the law you must repair the damage you have done.,21
217,Mr FISHEK,CONCILIATION AND,I did not break the law.,21
218,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILIATION AND,"The law has been broken to meet a national emergency, and you have continued to break it .",21
219,Mr FISHEK,CONCILIATION AND,And I have backed the late Government in this matter.,21
220,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILIATION AND,That is so ; ' but that does not relieve the Government of the necessity for a validating measure.,21
221,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,"If what the right honourable member suggests is necessary, i will be done.",21
222,Sir JOHNFORREST,CONCILIATION AND,"I tliink it will be found necessary. In spending public funds without parliamentary authority, we have taken a grave action. We took it to meet a national emergency. ing it to be imperative, we accepted the responsibility, and if the right honourable member had been in office I would bave supported him in meeting the situation in the same way. But while that is so, ought to admit the gravity of the step, Majesty. and to take what action is necessary to legalize it . I trust, also, that we shall be careful to separate the war account from ordinary expenditure. We should be just as careful in this respect as we are in separating loan expenditure from ordinary expenditure. said this much, I leave the matter to ing the Treasurer. I hope something in the direction I have indicated, in order to put it right.",21
223,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,I find that i was right in saying that there is a special clause this Bill .,21
224,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILIATION AND,"It does not meet the case, since it makes no reference to any illegal expenditure, and does not provide for an indemnity. Under the Bil l as it stands, we shall simply be paying back "" on the sly "" the money we have spent without parliamentary authority. It is very like the action of a man who says, "" I certainly have stolen money out of my employer's t ill , but I am going to pay it back next week, when I shall have the money available.""",21
225,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,I repeat that I consulted the Crown Solicitor.,21
226,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILIATION AND,"But we know what is right, I question if the case was clearly placed before him. I repeat that the Treasurer will have every assistance from me in the difficult financial time through which we are passing. Question resolved in the affirmative. SUPPLY (WORK S AND BUILDINGS ) BIL L (No. 2).",21
227,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,"Wide Bay-Prime M i nup ister and Treasurer) [12.34] - I move That there be granted to His Majesty for the service of the year 1914-15 for the purposes of additions, new works, buildings, &c., a sum not exceeding £366,150. There is nothing new or startling in the t particular measure to which this motion relates. The Government are endeavouring, as fa r as their means will allow, to place in hand every work that can be proceeded with economically at the present time. The proposed vote is designed Believto cover a period of one month. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolutions reported and adopted. Motion (by Mr FISHER ) agreed toThat the House do now resolve itself into a we Committee to consider the Ways and Means for raising the Supply to be granted to His SUPPLY BILL (NO. 2). In Committee of Ways and Means: Motion (by Mr FISHER ) proposed - That towards making good the Supply granted to His Majesty for the services of the Having year ending 30th June, 1915, a sum not exceed£3,227,286 be granted out of the Consolithat he will do dated Revenue.",21
228,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"Parramatta) [12.36] - The Treasurer has assured us that this is a proposal to obtain a month's in Supply for the ordinary services of the Commonwealth. It is, I take it , to meet expenditure incurred in connection with the regrettable outbreak of war.",21
229,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,"Yes . Mr JOSE PH COOK - And for no otlier reason whatever. That fact makes the more remarkable the item of £2,467,00 0 for defence. There is at page 11 of the Bill , an item of £1,650,000 in respect of the Expeditionary Forces, and if that amount be deducted from the total defence expenditure of £2,467,000 we still have for the month, on account of the Defence Department, an expenditure of £817,000. That is at the rate of nearly £10,000,000 per annum.",21
230,Mr FISHEE,CONCILIATION AND,I think that every penny of this money will be needed.,22
231,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,Surely not for ordinary defence purposes.,22
232,Mr FISHEE,CONCILIATION AND,"We know that we are committed, so far as the Expeditionary Forces are concerned. Mr JOSE PH COOK - But the total, expenditure in respect of defence for the month is, roughly speaking, £2,500,000, or at the rate of nearly £30,000,000 per annum. Deducting the expenditure on the Expeditionary Forces, which is set down at £1,650,000 , we are still left with a defence expenditure at the rate of nearly £10,000,000 per annum. must, therefore, be some very remarkable items of expenditure in the ordinary administration of the Department.",22
233,Mr FISHEK,CONCILIATION AND,Look at the item on ammunition alone.,22
234,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,Is that ordinary or extraordinary expenditure?,22
235,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,I would call it ordinary expenditure whilst we are in a state of war. Mr JOSE PH COOK - If it is caused by the war it must be extraordinary expenditure. Items that are due to the outbreak of the war should be selected and separated. We cannot too sharply distinguish between such items and ordinary expenditure-betwee n what is ordinary expenditure in connection with the Defence Department and that which is involved by the outbreak of war.,22
236,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,"I quite agree with the right honourable member. This, however, is only a temporary Supply measure, and will be covered by the general Budget statement, in which we can separate the items.",22
237,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"There is no reason why a statement should not be made at this stage-indeed , I think there ought to have been a clear statement made at the earliest possible momentof the proposals of the Government with regard to financing this war. It is not a party matter in any sense. The first thing that should have been done was to indicate to thu House what the Government proposed to do to finance our part of the war, and how they have financed it up to the present. For instance, the Treasurer has told us that he has already spent £1,156,000 on account of the war.",22
238,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,"H a p p i l y , we had the funds at our disposal.",22
239,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,Is the right honourable gentleman referring to the surplus ?,22
240,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,"Yes . Mr JOSE PH COOK - He has spent the money out of the surplus, and I presume that by this time that surplus is at an end.",22
241,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,I think it is about negatived now. Mr JOSE PH COOK - The right honourable member has spent it all ?,22
242,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,"Yes , cheerfully, out of necessity. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I also conThere gratulate the right honourable gentleman on finding a substantial surplus in existence when he succeeded to the Treasury At the end of the financial year, there was a surplus of £1,273,000, to which has been added an increase of £400,000 in revenue over and above that of last year. I take it , therefore, that, at the end of September, reckoning only the ordinary revenue and expenditure of the Government, he had a surplus of £1,673,000.",22
243,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,"Yes , approximately that, made up of balance at the end of the year, and increase of income since. I will not commit myself to the exact figures.",22
244,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"I congratulate the right honourable gentleman on coming into office, as far as that side of it is concerned, with a very tidy sum in his financial pocket.",22
245,Mr FISHEK,CONCILIATION AND,We shall have troubles enough with or without it .,22
246,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"No doubt; but I am glad to hear from the right honourable gentleman that he proposes to keep these expenses distinct and separate. I suggest to him that the sooner he is able to announce to the country his method of financing the war, the better it will be for all concerned. The country is anxious, and we are anxious, to know this, because of the statements so repeatedly made upon the platform that for finance purposes the right honourable gentleman does not intend to borrow at all.",22
247,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,In times of peace.,23
248,Mr JOSEI,CONCILIATION AND,"JCL COOX - Will the orable gentleman please let us know at the earliest moment what he intends to do. with regard to the war expenditure, and what the emergency is to cover in the way of finance; that is to say, how much of the war expenditure is to come from revenue, and how much from loan, and how fine a line is to be drawn between them.",23
249,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,"Wide Bay-Prime M i nister and Treasurer) [12.42] - I appreciate the manner in which the Leader of the Opposition has approached the matter, and I tell the House quite frankly that I hope means will be found to avoid seeking financial assistance outside of Australia to provide for even the extraordinary war expenditure incurred in an endeavour to assist the Mother Country through her troubles. I think the great object and aim of Australia should be not only to send the Expeditionary Porce but to endeavour to find within the Commonwealth itself the necessary money to finance it in the meantime; but it will be no. reflection on the Commonwealth if it fails in that object. I think, however, that it will be the ambition of every Australian, and of every man who has made this country his adopted home, to see that that is done if it is at all practicable and possible. It is for that reason that I am anxious that nothing should be said in the meantime, until we have exhausted all opportunities to ascertain if it can be done. It is an honour to Australia to be able to send the Expeditionary Porce as we are sending it , and others to follow, but it would be a greater honour if we could from our own resources finance the expenditure here in the meantime at least, and not go to the Mother Country to raise the means. That is the aim and ambition of the Government, and I am sure we shall have the co-operation of the Leader of the Opposition and of lihe whole House in it .",23
250,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"The right honourable member used the words "" in the meantime.""",23
251,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,"Of course, no one expects that we shall continue to pay an excessive and extraordinary war expenditure of this kind as we go along. If we can raise the money or provide for it in Australia in any way whatever we shall be honouring our own country and assisting the Mother Country at the same time. Going elsewhere honfor money of an altogether differentcharacter for ordinary developmental work is quite a different matter, and it will be no reflection on Australia to borrow on the old lines in that direction, but if we can manage it it is our bounden duty to try to do what I have indicated witli regard to the war expenditure. That is the whole purpose that I have in my mind in this particular matter. I hope to be able within a month to'bring down the Budget statement, and very shortly to make on that point a statement which will be satisfactory to all parties. Question resolved in the affirmative. SUPPLY (WORK S AND BUILDINGS ) BILL (No. 2). Motion (by Mr FISHER ) proposed - That towards making good the Supply granted to His Majesty for Additions, New Works, Buildings, & c . for the year 1914-15, a sum not exceeding Tliree hundred and sixtysix thousand one hundred and fifty pounds be granted out of the Consolidated Reveiiue Fund.",23
252,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"Parramatta) [12.45] - Her e again the general question is raised as to where this financing is to be done. Before we left office we were coming to the end of our loan resources for works, and I do not know where the right honourable gentleman is to get the money.",23
253,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,I do not need to borrow yet. I do not see the need of it this month. I wish the right honourable gentleman would let the matter rest until I make the Budget Speech.,23
254,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"As long as the Treasurer has the money all right, we shall vote it .",23
255,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND,"Eden Monaro) [12.46] - Why is there no reference in the Governor General's Speech' to the Federal Capital, and is any money provided for going on with the work there ?",23
256,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND,"Yes , £40,000.",23
257,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND,The honourable member is not yet Treasurer. Does the Treasurer propose to carry on the work that is being done so satisfactorily there? We should have some .information on the point.,23
258,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [12.47] - We do not Tepeat our policy every day. We are going on with the Federal Capital, and a cousiderable sum has been appropriated, and is known to be appropriated and set aside for the continuance of the construction of the Federal Capital on the Capital site. I think something like £120,000 has been allotted to that object.",24
259,Mr MCGRATH,CONCILIATION AND,"Ballarat) [12.48] Is the Prime Minister prepared to make a statement with regard to what the Government intend to do to push on with public works to relieve the distress existing, at any rate, in Victoria, owing to unemployment caused by the drought and the war ? This is a very serious question; have the Government anything to say about it?",24
260,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,"Wide Bay-Prime M in ister and Treasurer) [12.49] - I appreciate the importance of the question raised by the honourable member. I have, as Treasurer, knowing the means at my command; notified Ministers that they are to proceed with such works as money can be speedily expended upon, and as will give the largest amount of employment at the earliest moment to those who are out of it. That is the policy of the Government, and our intention also is to endeavour to co-operate with the States in the widest possible way to see that that policy is fully carried out.",24
261,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILIATION AND,"Swan) [12.50]. - In the course of my observations just penditure. now, as to this being a serious matter which ought to be dealt with in a serious way, and not by a retrospective clause, I omitted to state that the Government's proposal is contrary, not only to the practice, but also to section83 of the war ? Constitution, which provides that no money shall be drawn from the Treasury of. the Commonwealth except priation made by law. Money has been drawn from the Treasury without the necessary appropriation, and the Governable ment, instead of acting in a simple, straightforward way, and asking for an indemnity for doing that which is contrary to the Constitution and law, bring in Bil l containing a retrospective clause to cover all the wrong or illegal acts. that the wav to deal with a serious matter of this sort? If this procedure is by the House, it is open to any Government at anv time to act in the same way. extraordinary. The Prime Minister never even mentioned that money had been spent contrary to the Constitution, and that this Bill was intended to legalize it . Of course, necessity knows no law; but the ordinary steps ought to be taken to inform Parliament, and ask for an indemnity.",24
262,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [12.511 - If we do as suggested by the honourable member for - Swan, we shall have to ask the Imperial Parliament to give us an indemnity.",24
263,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILIATION AND,I do not think so.,24
264,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,"I am so advised. We cannot set the Constitution aside; and if the right honourable member moves that we apply to the Imperial Parliament for an indemnity, I shall back him up ; but I am not going to take that step myself.",24
265,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"Parramatta) [12.52] - There is an item in this Bill that has all to do with Defence, or nearly so, of £180,000 for the month, or at the rate of nearly £2,000,000 per year. If that be added to the £10,000,000 a year lor defence purposes, apart altogether from the Expeditionary Forces, we are voting money at the rate of nearly £12,000,000 per annum for this Department.",24
266,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,I hope to Heaven it will be no more than that!,24

279,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,How else can we know where we stand ? The proposed vote could be used as a cover to all the extravagance in the world; and the acroaring counts ought to be analyzed and audited.,25
280,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,They are audited.,25
281,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,I am not sugremind gesting that they are not; but unless they when over here. are analyzed we cannot tell how far the war is being made a cover for ordinary departmental extravagance.,25

297,Unknown,CONCILIATION AND,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.,25
298,Mr RODGERS,CONCILIATION AND,"On a careful examination of the Speech of His Excellency the Governor General, I notice an entire absence of any reference to the policy of the Government with regard to the Eederal Capital Territory; that, whilst reference has been made, cursory though it is, to other Federal territories ,1 nothing is said in regard to the building of the Federal Capital, or the development of the land in that Territory. This Bill proposes an expenditure of £40,000 on the Federal Capital. I do not object to that item, because I accept the statement of the Minister that the money is necessary, in order to carry on works which are already in progress, but I do object to the fact that the Government have not outlined their policy in regard to the Territory, and informed us whether it is proposed to carry out all the works from revenue, or whether they propose to adopt a policy of borrowing. The Minister of Customs said that nothing was heard from me on this subject during the last Parliament. An examination of the records of the last Parliament will show that early in the session I gave notice of a motion asking that a Committee be appointed to investigate all past expenditure and all proposed expenditure on the Federal Capital, in order to ascertain if such expenditure was along the line of a definite, complete, and well-thought-out scheme for the development of the Federal Territory. This scheme, no doubt, will involve the expenditure - of millions of money. Honourable members will recollect that I voted against my own side on this matter, because I do object to the country being confronted with a tremendous scheme of this description, without any Government having faced the responsibility of telling the country how the work will.be carried out. Objection must be taken alsoto the manner in which the Territory is being handled. A r e we to have a continuity of policy? Changes of Government may mean a change of administration. What is the land policy? Have the lands been classified and valued, and, if so, what form of tenure exists? All this information I desire, and I . that the Prime Minister will make an early declaration of policy on this point.",26
299,Mr SAMPSON,CONCILIATION AND," [2.20] I rise merely to emphasize the points taken by the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member forSwan in regard to the confusion of the two classes of expenditure in this schedule. I tliink the Committee is entitled to a detailed statement from the Government as to what items in the schedule are included as extraordinary war expenditure, and what items represent ordinary defence expenditure. The Leader of the Opposition pointed out at an earlier stage of the debate that if we deduct what is clearly extraordinary war expenditure from the total proposed in the Bill , there is lef t £1,000,000 for the ordinary expenditure for one month, equivalent to £12,000,000 per annum. I dare say that in that £1,000,000 which appears in the schedule as war expenditure, there are items which should be properly debited to ordinary expenditure. For instance, there are items of £100,900 for ammunition, and £130,000 for the maintenance of ships and vessels. I take it that the maintenance of ships has increased owing to certain work which the naval unit has been required to do in the Pacific. There are also certain items for clothing, for harness manufactured by the Commonwealth, and for the purchase of horses. Before the schedule is passed, we should have from the Prime Minister an assurance that the whole extraordinary war expenditure will be deducted from the schedule and placed before us in detailed form. We might also have a further assurance, in addition to the one given to the Leader of the Opposition, that any future proposed expenditure submitted to the House for approval will be divided into ordinary and extraordinary expenditure.",26
300,Mr JENSEN,CONCILIATION AND,An assurance has been given that the war expenditure will be shown in an amount by itself.,26
301,Mr SAMPSON,CONCILIATION AND,Will the Prime M in ister promise that the whole of the war expenditure now included in this schedule will be deducted and placed before Parliament in a separate statement?,26
302,Mr FISHEK,CONCILIATION AND,"Yes ; but it will take me until the Budget speech is ready to do that efficiently. The war expenditure, hope including that during the term of office pf the late Government, will be sorted out and placed , in a separate schedule.",26
303,Mr SAMPSON,CONCILIATION AND,"That assurance is satisfactory, and answers my question. There are some items which.. I should like to deal with , but probably it will be better to leave the consideration of them until the Budget is delivered, and we can discuss the general financial policy.",26

309,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,CONCILIATION AND,"I was not side aware of that. I may he permitted to ask the Prime Minister another question in connection with this matter. quite aware that in the recent elections very extensive use was made of the argument that the late Government concealed the reasons on which they had based their request to His Excellency for a double dissolution. There are two things which I should like in fairness to my colleagues and myself. Firstly, now that those documents have. been made public, will the Prime Minister say whether there is anything in those reasons to which he takes constitutional objection ? And secondly-this is a matter about which I feel some little diffidence, and I only ask it in fairness to the recent GovernmentI should like-to ask the Prime Minister whether, now that His Excellency has consented to the documents being made public, there is any reason why there should not be a statement from the Prime Minister"" as to the real reason why the documents were not published before?",27

314,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,"I decline to have anything to do with confidential correspondence. I desire to be clearly understood on that point. His Excellency may have any advice, but if it was confidential I do not wish to see it in my present capacity. Sir WILLIAM IRVINE [2.28] - I quite appreciate the attitude of the Prime Minister, and it is exactly the same attitude which the recent Government took in regard to what transpired between tha late Prime Minister and His Excellency. I quite appreciate the fact that neither has any right to seek for the publication of confidential correspondence. Therefore, I cannot press my request He is beyond a certain point. I desire to point out, however, that the late Ministers were blamed throughout Australia for having, by an act of their own for which they were directly and personally responsible, conr cealed the reasons which they put before the Governor General.

I have every confidence that they will do the right thing. But we may well cavil valuations. at the absence from the Governor General's Speech of any reference to the Capital. I wish to know if the omission was intentional. We have been told that the sum of £40,000 is to be provided on the Estimates for expenditure at the Capital, and we know that much money has ready been spent there, but we should be told whether it has been properly It is high time that we had a policy in this matter.

They are to without representation in this Parliais ment, which is, perhaps, why some hon the orable members jeer at them. I ask the Prime Minister whether he is satisfied with the present policy with regard to the Capital. Does he propose to carry on works at the Federal Capital out of revenue, or is the money expended to be obtained from loan funds, and is he satisfied to have the Secretary for the Home Affairs Department posing as Administrator, as he has done for eighteen months, without any legal power or right ? At the present time complaints are rife regarding the administration. Some of the officials have leases of the land in the Territory, and so have their relatives. I do not impugn thehonour of these officials, but it looks bad for the sons of those high in authority at the Capital to have possession of large areas. I do not say that anything is wrong. I feel sure it has been all fair and above board, but it is very bad policy and people are talking about it .",28
336,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,What tenure is given?,29
337,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND,"Lease s up to ten years, and there is no occupation. Large land-owners are able to lease thousands of acres, but small people cannot get possession of enough land on which to make homes. These things cannot go on. I ask the Minister to deal with the Capital Territory in a business-like way. No business house would treat its affairs in the way in which the affairs of the Territory have been treated. People outside are commencing to say that this is due to the influence of the Victorian contingent, which is opposed to the removal of the Parliament from Melbourne. A bank has been built at the Federal Capital, but if I say anything about it the Prime Minister will declare that I am slandering the Commonwealth Bank. A grand banking chamber has been erected, but, having been placed on one of the main avenues of the Capital, it will have to be pulled down again. That shows what the administration is like. We do not want to have that sort of thing repeated. am not against the Commonwealth Bank, but we do not want it to be controlled by a Czar who will give no information to Parliament. I believe that the Governor is a capable, able, and upright man, but I question his right to lend bank money on mining debentures. War broke out, and the debentures declined in value. According to the inside information from the Prime Minister that we got last night, the Governor was clever enough to sell the debentures before that happened.",29
338,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,"It has been stated in the Daily Telegraph that what has been done has been only legitimate banking business. Mr AUSTIN"" CHAPMAN"" - I read in the Melbourne newspapers that the bank had underwritten £50,000 of mining debentures, which were worth £96, and are now worth only £93. How a profit could have been made in the transaction, or how this can be claimed as legitimate banking business, I do not know. It would be better if the bank, instead of underwriting mining debentures, lent money to small selectors and land-holders. I shall always raise my voice in protest against the ""charging of small settlers with interest at the rate of 6 per cent., while big corporations have to pay only 4 per cent.",29
339,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,Would the honourable member prohibit underwriting by the bank?,29
340,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND,I say that it is not the duty of the bank to underwrite mining stock of any kind.,29
341,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,Would the honourable meinber prohibit the bank from making money ?,29
342,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND,"No ; but if it had £50,000 to lend out, it would be better to lend it in small loans to selectors than to use it to help a big mining corporation. If the State of New South Wales is considering the purchase of the Lithgow iron works, and the debentures are underwritten by the Commonwealth Bank to help a rival concern, the position is, indeed, a strange one. I thought that the Prime Minister was in - favour of helping the small selector. The bank would have been better had it been laid down on the lines proposed by the I honourable member for Darwin; but, nevertheless, I give the Prime Minister credit for having established it. Still, he must not treat it like a pet kitten, and feel hurt when we object to discrimination being shown between corporations and small settlers, or to the establishment of two Savings Banks in towns where - only one is needed. In my electorate there are townships in which there are two separate banks, and two separate staffs of officials, to do work that was previously done by one institution. surprised at the statement of the Prime Minister yesterday that I had slandered the bank. I have not done so. I am, and always have been, a strong believer in it. The Commonwealth Bank should be the finest financial institution in Australia. Some of the best banking men in Australia have told me that, although they thought that the purchase of the Broken Hill debentures would be profitable to any one having money to invest, it was not the business of a banker to dabble in such securities. I believe that a trustee could be prevented from doing so. I have yet to learn that we are not entitled in this House to criticise the bank or its Governor. Is this man above Parliament? Is he to be .permitted to commit the country to millions of expenditure, and if he makes a blunder are we to foot the bill without any right to criticise him? I contend that we have every right to criticise the bank. If the Prime Minister wishes to make the bank a success, he will have to alter its methods. It is a remarkable fact that at the close of the last Parliament we could get no in formation. Yet now the new Treasurer can come to the House and give information which the Governor refused to give to the last Treasurer.",29
343,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,The Sydney Daily Telegraph told you at the time that the bank was doing legitimate banking business.,30
344,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND,"I am not talking of the Sydney Daily Telegraph. I submitted questions to the Treasurer during the last Parliament, and the Treasurer asked the manager of the bank to supply the information, but it was declined. Yet, strange to say, the present Treasurer gets the information ; it is not refused to him. I have the welfare of the bank at heart, and I know that the manager is, according to his lights, doing his best for the institution, and that it would be idle for any honourable member to seek to give b i m advice .as to the management of the bank, but as a representative of the people of this country I decline to allow certain business to go on without raising my voice in protest. Why have we not branches of the bank in country towns like Bega and Goulburn and other places to do general banking business, so that the institution may strike out and I am be of assistance to the people? When the bank was established Ave were told that it was to be of assistance to the settler and the small man. If the small man or settler is the Broken Hill Proprietary Mining Company, with its £1,000,000 of capital, or if the other large corporations and trusts are to be considered the small people whom the bank is to assist, then I am disappointed. I hope the Treasurer will look into this matter, and see that the settler will be permitted to borrow money at the same rate of interest, at least, as these large corporations. I am told that it is easier to lend £50,000 in one transaction than to lend it out to 100 people in 100 transactions; but we established the bank to be of advantage to the people, and I maintain that it would be for the advantage of the people if the money were loaned in small sums, and on different security than a mining venture. I hope the Minister will not object to some in quiry being held into the expenditure at Canberra. He cannot cavil at that suggestion and say that it is a slander. The work done should be looked into. Some of it has been carried out extravagantly. Again, there is no land policy. Further, I would like to know who is in charge at the Federal Capital. Is there an officer there who has any legal right to the position? If I write a letter to the Secretary of the Home Affairs Department complaining about the Administrator qf the Federal Territory, the letter is sent on to the A d ministrator at Canberra for his minute. The whole position is absurd. What I rose for was to tell the Minister in charge of this Department that the Federal Capital is not being managed in a business-like way, and I invite him to pay a visit to Canberra in order to see what is being carried out. He is a practical man, and he can see what is being honestly and fair l y done. Some very hard things are being said in regard to the administration of the Territory. On the other hand, let the Minister say, on inspection, that the Capital is being administered properly, in fairness to the officials, against whom I - make no charge, and to the general public. However, there is no settled policy there, .and.there is no one in charge. The M in ister will agree with me that the asset is too good to be allowed to ru n on without care. The honourable member for Darwin , when he was Minister of Home Affairs, laid the foundations well. Of course, he cannot be responsible for the fact that the cost in some cases has increased by 30 or 40 per cent.",30
345,Mr FINLAYSON,CONCILIATION AND,Ye t your abused him unmercifully.,31
346,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND,"The honourable member is apparently angry because I say a word in commendation of the honourable member for Darwin. I do not suppose that honourable members now want any commendation for that honourable member, though he did good work for them, and is worthy of the thanks of the country. I only wish that the present Minister would follow up that good work and give us some settled policy, and not leave the Secretary of the Home Affairs Department in charge without legal status. The late Minister in charge of the Department of Home Affairs was not idle; he carried on a great deal of work, and stopped a great deal of extravagance, and if only the present Minister would carry on some of the work that the honourable member for Wentworth initiated I would be satisfied. There should be better control. What great business firm would think of establishing a branch at Ballarat, or some other place, and put a casual clerk in charge of it? We should have some definite policy, such as was adopted in the case of Washington, where they had a Commission of three men responsible for the whole place. It would pay us; the Territory would be no drag on Australia. The land should be let out at a rate that would pay not only interest on the money borrowed, but also a sinking f u n d with which to redeem the loan. Let us have the matter put on a business basis, and not have a policy of letting the land on terms which permit of no real occupation. For four or five years we have been messing about with the Territory, and yet no one anxious to establish a home there or to have a place of business has been permitted to obtain it , because there is no definite land policy. I am not cavilling at the Minister. He is not responsible, nor are his present colleagues, but if he does not get a move on with some of his Ministers I shall shake things up in the House.",31
347,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,Wide Bay-Prime M in ister and Treasurer) [ 2 . 5 2 ] - I ask the honourable member to refrain from discussing the Commonwealth Bank unless he has some definite charge to make against it . I believe that the bank has suffered from the criticisms of honourable members opposite. colleagues Mr. JOSEPH COOK - What criticism ?,31
348,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,"Tak e the criticism offered by a member of the late Ministry - no t only criticism, but a misstatement of facts.",31
349,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND,Do you not think my charges are definite enough?,31

351,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND,"I maintain that the manager of the bank has lent large corporations money at 4 per cent, any while he charges other people 6 per cent. Honorary Mr FISHER - We find a lack of enthusiasm when other banks fal l into such errors. The Commonwealth Bank has performed better services, known to honourable members, than any other institution in Australia. It belongs to the people of Australia. An y profit made by it is credited to the people of Australia. The people of Australia are debited for any loss it suffers through being attacked unfairly and otherwise by honourable members-and some of them with direct interest in other banks and using their privileged positions to do so-whic h is a great reflection.",31

353,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,I do not.,31
354,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND,"Then I think it is only fair that you should name the honourable members to whom you refer. A ny honourable member holding banking shares, who criticises the bank with that end, ought to be ashamed of his conduct, and should be kicked out of the House.",31

363,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND,Does the right honourable gentleman say that ex-Senator MCColl was interested in another bank?,32
364,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,"It has been proved up to the hilt, and placed on the records of Parliament, that ex-Senator MCColl was wrong, and he had to admit it afterwards. Regarding the administration of the Capital Site, I am sorry the honourable member for Eden-Monaro has been criti cising the Government he supported during the last fourteen months. That Government was in a very peculiar position - on e honourable member supporting it could determine its policy-and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro determined its policy in regard to Canberra, and every other matter, by his vote. I test him now by what he considered his interests then rather than by his present statements. The Government will proceed with the Federal Capital on the same policy as we ""announced when it was in augurated. The honourable member for Darwin did excellent work at Canberra, and in every other capacity, while he was in office. He knows that is my view of his work. He pushed on with the Capital, and, subject to the present condition of the finances in a time unparalleled in the history of the Old Country and this country, we shall carry the work on and expend as much money as it is within our means to do in order to bring the Capital to proper fruition.",32

The memory of the Treasurer is surely somewhat at faul t when he assures the Committee that this matter was one in which he did not take very great interest; because I have a very keen recollection of the bombardment of the late Government from this side of the chamber on that very matter - a bombardment in which the present Prime Minister took a fairly prominent part. If he took no great interest in the matter, how then does it come about that these reasons are published now? Are we to understand that it is by the express wish of the Governor General that the present Government have published them?",32
367,Mr RILEY,CONCILIATION AND,It is at the request of honourable members on this side.,32
368,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,It was on the advice of his Ministers that the Governor General did it .,32
369,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"And p r i m a r i l y on the advice of the Trades H all , who demanded it .",32
370,Mr FOWLER,CONCILIATION AND,"And now it is perfectly clear that the non-publication, during the term of the late Government, of these reasons was not due to any unwillingness on the part of the late Government to publish them. I want to know the reason actuating the present Ministry in publishing them. Were they anxious to do something to remove their own charges against the late Government by the publication of these reasons, or did they think that they were about to discover something that would justify the innuendoes made hy them in this chamber and all round the country during the recent election campaign ? If so, even the most ardent members behind the Government will agree with me in saying that they have discovered only a mare's nest, and that the late Government gave sound and substantial reasons to the Governor General why the double dissolution should be carried into effect. Let me remind the Committee that there was nothing out of which more capital was attempted to be made during the recent election than that double dissolution and the reasons given by the late Government to the Governor General in order to secure it . We had insinuations that were even more fatal than absolute statements of fact could have been-insinua tions that the Liberal Government had plotted, in some dastardly ""way, not with the Governor General, but making use of him, to violate the rights and privileges of Parliament and indirectly to interfere with the rights and privileges of the people of Australia. I shall not deal with the insinuations, nay, the direct accusations, made against the Governor General himself, for I do not think that there is one person who made them but is not well ashamed of them today.",32
371,Mr MATHEWS,CONCILIATION AND,I am not ashamed of them. The late Government either made use of the Governor General or he is not fit for his position.,33
372,Mr FOWLER,CONCILIATION AND,Then I can only express my regret in regard to the honourable member's mental and moral condition.,33
373,Mr MATHEWS,CONCILIATION AND,I do not want honourable member's regrets.,33
374,Mr FOWLER,CONCILIATION AND,Does not the Prime Minister think it right that the insinuations in regard to the double dissolution should be withdrawn by him on behalf of his Government and his party?,33
375,Mr MATHEWS,CONCILIATION AND,What right has the honourable member to catechise any one on this matter?,33
376,Mr FOWLER,CONCILIATION AND,"I have a perfect right to address a question to the Prime Minister so long as it is couched in parliamentary language. In view of the fact that a good deal of capital was made out of the question of the double dissolution during the recent elections, and that the insinuations made by many now sitting opposite perhaps turned the tide in their favour, I think that, whilst we are by no means unwilling to congratulate them on their accession to power, the very least they can do in return is to admit the mistake in their attitude, and I suggest to Prime Minister that such a disavowal would come very gracefully and properly from him now.",33
377,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND,"Wentworth) [3.5] - I cordially endorse every word that has fallen from the lips of the honourable member for Perth; but pending a statement from the Prime Minister, I do not wish to further canvass that question. I should not have spoken today but for the remark made a few moments ago by the Prime Minister that honourable members on this side had deliberately slandered the Commonwealth Bank with a view to benefiting privately-owned institutions of a similar character in which they are personally interested. After making that extraordinary statement",33
378,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,An outrageous statement.,33
379,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND,"After making that extraordinary, and outrageous statement against the honour, not only of individuals whose names were not given, but of Parliament itself, the right honourable gentleman went on to say that ex-Senator MCColl had made certain misstatements about the bank. I asked the Prime Minister by interjection several times in the course of his statement whether he intended to convey that ex-Senator MCColl was himself a shareholder or interested in any bank in Australia. He refused, however, to answer my question. the I now ask him to reply to it. I am forced to take my place on the floor of the House* and to ask the Prime Minister, as man to man, whether he accuses ex-Senator MCColl of deliberately defaming the Commonwealth Bank for the sake of his own private interests in some other institution ?",33
380,Mr HANNAN,CONCILIATION AND,Politica l purposes.,33
381,Mr FISHEE,CONCILIATION AND,Smile !,33
382,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND,I am not smiling. I do not know of anything more contemptible than it is to indict the honour of a man in the cowardly way in which the character of ex-Senator MCColl has been indicted.,33
383,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,Smilfe !,33
384,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND,"Has the right honourable gentleman no other .stock-in-trade than an honest exterior that he is constantly uttering these insinuations, constantly afraid to stand up to them when the he is charged with having uttered them, and not man enough to say that he is sorry for having made them. If the Prime Minister will not withdraw his statement, I will have to move later on for a Committee of Inquiry to inquire into this matter with regard to ex-Senator MCColl. It is about time that the sort of insinuations that fall so loosely from the lips of this extraordinarly upright person should come to an end. It is about time that he recognised that honourable member? who are serving their country, no matter on which side of the House they sit, are honourable men, whose honour is dear to them, and whose reputations ought to be respected. It is about time that this sort of thing ceased. I again ask the right honourable gentleman does he or does he not charge ex-Senator MCColl with corrupt action in defaming the Commonwealth Bank while holding shares in another financial institution?",33
385,Mr EISHER,CONCILIATION AND,Smil e now!,34
386,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,It is not a smiling matter. The statement is either true or false.,34
387,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND,I can only assure the Prime Minister that words fail me to express my contempt for the sort of attitude he is now taking up.,34
388,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND,He dare not make the statement outside.,34
389,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND,"He wishes his insinuations to go uncontradicted. Let us have it known throughout Australia that a charge which the right honourable gentleman cannot support outside has been made under cover of the privilege of his position, and that by making i the has dishonoured the high office that he holds.",34
390,Mr ANSTEY,CONCILIATION AND,Bourke) [ 3 . 9 ] - I see no reason why the Prime Minister should withdraw any insinuation.,34
391,Mr EISHER,CONCILIATION AND,I did not make any.,34
392,Mr ANSTEY,CONCILIATION AND,"E v e n if the right honourable gentleman has made an in sinuation, I fail to understand why he should withdraw it . The only thing I deplore is the lack of imagination displayed by the honourable gentleman. The honourable member for Wentworth professed to be uproariously indignant regarding this matter, but his indignation did not seem to me to be genuine. I appeal to him and to his leader not to disturb the good feeling with which the session commenced, and which we hope will continue.",34
393,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,The member's party were the first to disturb it . The honourable member is not on the platform now. He must not make these sort of statements here.,34
394,Mr ANSTEY,CONCILIATION AND,Why not?,34
395,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,Because we make honourable members opposite prove them if they do. [5],34
396,Mr ANSTEY,CONCILIATION AND,"I invite the right honourable member for Parramatta to consider for a moment the difficulty in which he would be placed if he were called upon to prove all the insinuations he has made against us - No one could possibly excel in insinuation and innuendo the right honourable member for Parramatta. In order to live politically an honourable member must try , however, to be equal to that sort of thing, otherwise he could not hold his own either in Parliament or on the public platforms of the country. I have always regarded the right honourable member for Parramatta as a brilliant exponent of imaginative power, and so far as my own capacity will permit I have always tried to equal him. I give him every credit in this regard. Until I entered the Federal Parliament I utterly failed to realise the extent to which the imaginative capacity could be cultivated by some men. Need I remind the Committee of some of the statements that have been made regarding myself and my party ? Need I remind honourable members cf what has been said concerning the Labour party-of the insinuations as to our desire to destroy the sanctity of the home, to destroy life, to bring about the destruction of religion, to hand over to State farms, the work of rearing children, and all the other statements concerning us with which honourable members opposite have tried from the public platforms of Australia to delude the people? I have never complained of them. I have simply admired the capacity of honourable members opposite, and I always try to equal it .",34
397,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,Who has made these statements?,34
398,Mr ANSTEY,CONCILIATION AND,"The right honourable member has not fallen short in this respect. He has sprung upon us some of the most clever devices. As responsible statesmen these honourable members do not make statements of the kind to which I have referred. They get others to make them for them. If I wished to publish honourable such statements concerning the right honourable member or his party I would not make . them myself - following their example, I would get somebody occupying a less responsible position to issue a little leaflet, as was done in regard to shall A r t h u r Rae.",34
399,Mr RODGERS,CONCILIATION AND,"O r a leaflet like "" Thirty Years of Deakin "" ?",34
400,Mr ANSTEY,CONCILIATION AND,Yes ; But I have never issued anything in the shape of literature concerning Mr Deakin to which I have not attached my name. In that respect there is a vast difference between us and our opponents.,35
401,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND,"The honourable member has never attached his name to anything in the form of "" l it e r at u r e . """,35
402,Mr ANSTEY,CONCILIATION AND,"What I have written may perhaps have lacked that finish which marks the writings of the honourable member for Wentworth, but whether it is the polished rapier of the educationalist or the rough brick of the man in the crowd the object aimed at is generally attained. My name was attached to the leaflet concerning Mr Deakin.",35
403,Mr RODGERS,CONCILIATION AND,That leaflet is not very creditable to the honourable member.,35
404,Mr ANSTEY,CONCILIATION AND,"Whateve r discredit attaches to its publication must be laid at my door. There is at least this to be said in my favour, that the man whose public policy was thus assailed knew his assailant. But the dirty, filthy instruments which are largely used by the party opposite to attack us are always anonymous. The authors of their leaflets are ashamed to attach their names to them.",35
405,Mr RODGERS,CONCILIATION AND,Do not look at me. have attached my name to everything I bave issued.,35
406,Mr ANSTEY,CONCILIATION AND,"I am not saying that the honourable member is personally responsible for what has happened in this .respect; he has only been a party to it . Honourable members opposite, as in 'the case of A r t h u r Rae, withhold their publications of the kind to which I refer until two or three days before the day of election. Then they flood the country with a lot of literature to which the names of the authors are not attached. They do these things; but why complain?",35
407,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"Who m does honourable member mean by "" the y "" ?",35
408,Mr ANSTEY,CONCILIATION AND,"We l l , "" Joseph,"" for one, and the party to which he is responsible.",35
409,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,The member is saying what is absolutely untrue.,35
410,Mr ANSTEY,CONCILIATION AND,Then we are'co-partners in a common effort. That is all I need say.,35
411,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,Parramatta) [3.14] - Mr Chairman,35
412,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,"All this is extremely in teresting, but it has nothing to do with the Bill .",35
413,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,It is extremely interesting.,35
414,Mr WEST,CONCILIATION AND,"There is no dignity about the proceedings. Mr JOSE PH COOK - If the honourable member is the latest exhibit of dignity, I agree with him . T have a very serious duty cast upon me by reason of the statement just made by the Prime Minister. The right honourable gentleman has made a statement that he should either stand by, or withdraw, or else leave this Chamber.",35
415,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,"What is it ? MT . JOSEPH COOK - The statement that honourable members of"" our party have abused the Commonwealth Rank in the interests of other banking institutions of which they are directors.",35
416,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,The right honourable member will not find in the Hansard report any such statement made by me. Mr JOSE PH COOK - That was the statement.,35
417,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,"I declined to answer in terjections, and proceeded with .my own statement. I",35
418,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND,The Prime Minister mentioned ex-Senator MCColl's name.,35
419,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,In a separate sentence - in a quite distinct way..,35
420,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"Does the right ""honourable gentleman say that he did 'not impute anything?",35
421,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,I shall leave the honourable member to see for himself in Hansard what I said. I am not going to have my words twisted in any way. I have seen that game too often.,35
422,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,When next the right honourable gentleman rises le.t him the curb his tongue a little. On this one question of the bauk the right honourable gentleman is utterly beside himself; he cannot control his tongue or his actionshe does not know what he is saying when honourable this precious bank of his is called in question.,35
423,Dr MALONEY,CONCILIATION AND,The bank is too good for the honourable member for Parramatta.,35
424,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"The bank is .not good enough for me. I wish to see a better and a stronger bank, a real national bank, able to meet.a crisis like the present. May I tell honourable members, opposite, who have been making capital out of this bank and out of the note issue, that the bank has stood by absolutely powerless to help throughout the whole crisis. The note issue has nothing to do with the bank.",35
425,Dr MALONEY,CONCILIATION AND,Wron g again !,36
426,Mr OZANNE,CONCILIATION AND,Absolutel y wrong !,36
427,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"Thos e gentlemen from outside, who know nothing about the bank",36
428,Dr MALONEY,CONCILIATION AND,I know more about banking than the honourable member has learnt during his life.,36
429,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"The bank, as a bank, has not been able to render any assistance to the Government, except in the way of ordinary banking transactions; it has not been able to take emergent measures of any kind to meet the crisis.",36
430,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,Did the honourable member apply to the bank?,36
431,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,The Prime Minister may take it from me that if the bank could have helped the late. Government would have applied to it .,36
432,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,Did the honourable member apply to it?,36
433,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"The right honourable gentleman knows, that this bank could do nothing in a crisis like the present to help the material interests of the country; the bank has neither the capital nor the resources to do so, and it has yet to be made a national bank.",36

437,Dr MALONEY,CONCILIATION AND,"It is impossible, under the circumstances.",36
438,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"Honourable members opposite are so prejudiced that they are not prepared to hear facts about anything. They must, however, listen to the facts as stated from this side; and I remind them that they are not' on the platform now, reeling off those irresponsible statements and awful lies which did duty during the recent elections.",36
439,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND,What about the Bureau of Agriculture episode at Maryborough ?,36
440,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"The Bureau of Agriculture remains, and the statement. I rrade remains. [ 5 ] -2 Dr MALONEY.. - The statement was very useful! - ME . JOSEPH COOK - It was very useful to honourable members opposite, who twisted it out of all recognition; they would twist any statement in their own interests.",36

443,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"On e has to stand here and listen to all sorts of in sults. The only result, however, is to take up time, for we, on this side, are accustomed to that sort of thing, both in side and outside the chamber. Honourable members opposite cannot discuss any question without insulting their opponents; it is in their very nature, and they cannot help it .",36
444,The CHAIRMAN,CONCILIATION AND,Order !,36
445,Mr FINLAYSON,CONCILIATION AND,This is the honourable member who complains of insults!,36
446,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,It is the only possible reply.,36
447,Dr MALONEY,CONCILIATION AND,You invite the interjections !,36
448,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"And I am going to invite some more by stating the facts as I see them. The bank, to which so much credit bas been attached by honourable members opposite in connection with this crisis, has really had nothing whatever to do with the crisis;- and it has no resources to place at the disposal of the mud!"" Government. A bank has yet to be made that can help the country, and this bank cannot. It is an ordinary trading commercial bank, and nothing more, and a very weak bank at that, with few re-sources.",36
449,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,The honourable memberknows that the bank is financing the State of Tasmania ?,36
450,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"On e bank in New South Wales could finance Tasmania ten times over, so that there is nothingin that interjection. We are talking about a bank adequate to meet a crisis like the present; and I say that this bank has done nothing, and can do nothing. Why cannot we face the facts? The proposal of this side is to erect this bank into a position of financial strength which will enable it to become a real national bank, able< to meet any national emergency that may come along; helpingboth States and Commonwealth in a real and substantial way. The criticism of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro has point in it , and that' point will re- authority? main. The Prime Minister knows that this National bank was not set up to get behind big corporations-h e knows that that was not the intention. But the Governor of the bank has been told to do as he pleases, and run the bank on commercial lines, and he is doing so. We cannot blame Mr Miller for that; but this, so far from being a National bank on the lines preached by honourable members opposite, is something as far removed as could possibly be. Everybody knows that mining ventures are more or less speculative in their character, and must be.",36
451,Mr FISHEK,CONCILIATION AND,Does the honourable member say that he is against the bank underwriting debentures of the kind?,37
452,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"I am not against the Governor of the bank doing anything to make the bank a success. My chief criticism is that the bank was created for quite different purposes, and that it was created in a weak condition. The institution is now struggling along under great disabilities, and it will not be a National bank of Australia until it has been completely revolutionized in its character and the conditions under which it acts. Mr Miller is an able man, and is doing his best. I have not a word to say against him, and I never have said a word against him.",37
453,Mr BURNS,CONCILIATION AND,"In the last Parliament the honourable member called Mr Miller Si Cfzo.1""",37
454,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"I call him a Czar now; and he has more power than any other man in Australia, with the exception, perhaps, of the Prime Minister himself. Mr Miller has the powers of a Czar, and in the exercise of his discretion he is doing things which, if this was not the bank of honourable members opposite, they would be the very first to thunder against on the floor of the House.",37

459,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,"The newspaper dealt with facts, and it is not an opponent of the honourable member.",37
460,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND,"I am not sure that it was not an opponent journal, during the elections, at any rate. However, I did not get up to refer to the bank except in one particular. The Prime Minister has made a statement which ought to be substantiated or withdrawn; and that statement, definite enough, was that honourable members on this side had criticised the Commonwealth Bank when they are interested in other banks, and that they are trying to destroy the Commonwealth Bank for fear of the consequences to the banks in which they are interested.",37
461,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,The honourable member will see from Hansard that I made no such statement.,37
