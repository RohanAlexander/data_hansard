Only on Wednesday of last week a Bill was made an urgent measure before even three members of the House, including Ministers themselves, had seen it. Newspapers which are bitterly opposed to the Labour Party are complaining of the indecent haste, with which measures are beingrushed through this Parliament. For example, the Argus, to which no member of this party owes anything, .has pointed out ' that the haste exhibited by the Prime M in ister (. Mr Hughes) with this .measure was indecent. In another column of the journal on Saturday last, "" It h u r i e l ,"" a very brilliant writer, satirically refers to (Constitutions being made .here whilst one waits for them.

We know that in another place this measure was forced through, in one we were allowed only fourteen hours in which to consider the Bill , and that we are now .to be granted only one hour in which to debate the amendments of the Senate, it is manifestly ridiculous to regard this Parliament as a deliberative body. But for the section in our Constitution which provides that Bills seeking to amend that charter of government - This is must be passed at least two months before a .general election can be held, .an appeal would have been made .to the people much earlier .than is now proposed. The Prime Minister returned fro m Europe under the impression that his star was in the ascendant, and following the example of Mr Lloyd George he desired to precipitate a khaki election.

In this Bill .the Government are pretending - to :give . the electors something when we all know perfectly well that if Ministers are returned to office, armed with the powers which they now seek, those cowers will never be exercised. - Mr BOYD (Henty) [11.44] - I take strong exception to the curtailment of the debate upon this Bill in the manner that is now proposed. >The party with which I am associated fought these Bills bitterly and I have denounced them bitterly, and I would not support them now but for the limitation they contain. We had a definite promise that a Committee of legal experts would examine these measures, and that any amendments they suggested would be inserted in another place. They have examined the measures, and another place sat all night in order to in sert the amendments they suggested in the Bills, but . in this House, with the exception of a privileged few who have secured copies of the Bills as amended, none of us know what these amendments are. We are informed by the press that Professor Harrison Moore and Professor Jethro Brown, who are under no obligation to the Government, hold views which differ from those of the Solicitor-General, Sir Robert Garran. We should be in formed as to the amount of difference, and should be given time to consider such important questions. It is an outrage on constitutional government to deprive us of the opportunity of doing so. There is a great deal of truth in the statement of honourable members opposite that insufficient time is allowed to do the work of this Parliament effectively. If these Bills are rushed through, I shall advise the electors in my constituency to reject them. Though I am willing^ to trust my own Government to administer the powers given under, these measures, I realise that, after the forthcoming election, there may be every chance in the world of another Government sitting on these benches, which I would not trust to administer these powers.",27
66,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,So that is the reason for the limitation in the B i ll ?,28
67,Mr BOYD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"Of course. Without that limitation I would not vote for the measures. However, I do not propose to vote blindly. I do not know whether the compact between the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) and nished the State Premiers, under which the latter undertook to lie low and say nothing if the Prime Minister would guarantee to place a limitation upon th« powers he asked, has been kept; but twenty-five minutes is not sufficient to enable, honourable members to examine the contents of these measures.' When we left the House last night we were told that the first Bill to be discussed today would be the Land Tax Bill , yet here we are asked to consider the Senate's amendments to the Constitution A l t e tion Bills. What difference will one make in dealing with profiteering?",28
68,Mr FINLAYSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"All the difference in the world, because, unless these measures are disposed of to-dav, the election cannot be held on the 13th December.",28
69,Mr BOYD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,Then let them be held on the 20th December. Will one week make much difference?,28
70,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,Yes ; a mighty big difference to the farmers.,28
71,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N, The question is the time to be allotted for the consideration of the Senate's amendment.,28
72,Mr MAXWELL,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,What is to be gained by having a little more time for the consideration ?,28
73,Mr BOYD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"Surely we are here to act as intelligent beings, and not as oogs in a machine without anv idea of what we are doing.. Unless time is given to consider these amendments, I shall vote against them. It is not essential that cor the sake of Holding an election on thfl 13th December, we should agree to them without giving them proper consideration. .",28
74,Mr BRENNAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"Batman) [11.52] When a similar motion came before the House a few days ago I protested against it , as I protest against the carrying of this motion. My justification for opposing the motion put forward last week haa been amply demonstrated by what has taken place since then. The Constitution Alteration Bills were rushed through this House before the authority to which the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) looks for his justification in connection with these measures had decided what really was their scope or purpose. The Committee of experts which was appointed to inform the right honourable gentleman and the House as to the powers which are necessary' for dealing with profiteering, f u r a report, after the Bills left this Chamber, showing that there is very considerable room for doubt as to what the Prime Minister really wants-becaus e he does not make up his m in d; he looks to them to make up his mind for him . time However, I sympathize with him and his Government. They dare not have a - discussion on these amendments - Any one who saw the righ t honourable gentleman a week ago, ranting and raving' in this House as soon as some of his public utterances were held up for re-examination; r a - ranting and raving with an impatience day that could not find expression, because we threatened to bring him face to face - with his own arguments, utterances, and votes of former occasions, in connection with these Bills, could easily understand his frame of mind. To show the Hughes of the past in juxtaposition with the Hughes of today",28
75,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N," The honourable member is not in order. On this motion he is not per* mitted to discuss the actions and views of the Prime Minister. However in teresting they may be, they have nothing to do with this motion.",29
76,Mr BRENNAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"I was not about to put his views in juxtaposition. I was about to point o u t that the Prime Minister is determined that this Parliament shall not discuss these Bills, not only because he fears that we will publish the views he expressed when similar Bills were before us in former years in juxtaposition with the views which he is now bound to express",29
77,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,Order I,29
78,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,They will stand being placed in juxtaposition.,29
79,Mr BRENNAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"I have a confident belief that this proposed emasculation of the Constitution, - such as it is, will not be acceptable to the people, but apart from that aspect of the matter which we are not now in a position to discuss, it is perfectly obvious that the composite party on the Ministerial side of the Chamber do not understand the meaning of these amendments.",29
80,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,Who has the honourable member?,29
81,Mr BRENNAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"The honourable member for Henty (Mr Boyd), the honourable member for Hume (Mr Falkiner), who left the Chamber expressing in a few short words his opposition to these measures-, and the press claqueurs and supporters of the right honourable gentleman, have made it perfectly clear that they are merely giving a tentative support to the Bill , in order to save his face, and hecause of his positive assurance that these proposed amendments will not be in any way out of harmony with their position in 1915.",29
82,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,That is misstatement.,29
83,Mr BRENNAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,What is a deliberate misstatement ?,29
84,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"I ask the honourable member not to reply to interjections, 'and to discuss the question before the Chair. So far he has not done so.",29
85,Mr BRENNAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,I can understand the restiveness of certain honourable members because they occupy a very anomalous and painful position in regard to these Bills.,29
86,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,I must insist upon the honourable member observing the Standing Orders and obeying the directions of the Chair.,29
87,Mr BRENNAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"I .have confidence, sir, that you will insist on a - direct observance of the Standing Orders.",29

90,Mr BRENNAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"There was no reflection, but I withdraw it . It was a compliment; I withdraw it . . I was about to say that I felt perfectly certain that you, sir, would insist on a strict observance of the Standing Orders. I never rise to speak, but you follow m e ",29
91,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,Order ! I call upon the honourable member to discuss the question before the Chair.,29

93,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,The honourable member has not done so.,29
94,Mr BRENNAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"Then you, sir. should have called me to order.",29
95,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"I have called the honourable member to order several times. I shall ask him to resume his seat, unless he is prepared to obey the Standing told Orders and cease arguing with the Chair.",29
96,Mr BRENNAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"We may proceed quite leisurely in, discussing this p r e liminary matter, because we shall not have the opportunity of discussing the merits of this most important question. To any one who has followed the discussion here' and in another place, and has observed the opinions of public and p r i vate citizens expressed in the press on these questions, it is perfectly evident not only that these measures deal with gravely important matters, but that there is a considerable difference of opinion in the public mind as to what their import really is. a deliberate In these circumstances, to say that, without time for proper consideration, we should take this new step which is considered necessary to set right the mistaken procedure of the past is, in the language of the honourable member for Henty (Mr . Boyd), an outrage upon parliamentary procedure. My views with regard to the Bills are known, and my view as to what the public will do with them is also well known. At least, we should have an opportunity to hold the Government up to the criticism and contempt of the public which they deserve.",29
97,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"Kooyong) [12.3] - There are two features which justify the consideration of these amendments being treated as a matter of urgency. One is the simplicity of the amendments involved, and the other is the further limitation which they would impose upon the operation of .the Bills as passed by this House. I say frankly that in no circumstances would I support these Bills but for the limitation which appears in the measures themselves, and the additional reason' that a Convention, which has been generally demanded by the great mass of the people, after some twenty years' experience of the present Constitution, is to be held. My feeling is that the operation of the Bills should b& limited as far as possible, and I regard the further limitation now proposed as essential because of the complications which might follow legislation during their operation.",30
98,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N, The honourable gentleman is now discussing the Bills.,30
99,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"No ; I . am discussing the question of limitation, and my reason for supporting the claim .as to the urgency of the matter. Anything in-the direction of the limitation of the operation of these measures meets with my most cordial approval. '",30
100,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,Order ! I point out to the honourable gentleman that he is discussing the limitation contained within the Bill. The only question now before the Chair is the limitation of time within which discussion upon the amendments may take place. That is a different matter altogether.,30
101,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"As regards the limitation of time, it must be obvious to every honourable member that if tie measure is not put through today, and if , as I understand, there is to be an election, could not take .place on the 13th December as contemplated. It would be a calamity to postpone the election, if it is to take place, to .a later date. I do not hesitate to say that I believe that the proper thing to'do would ba to permit this Parliament to expire by.effluxion of time in May next. As it has been determined to bring it to a close earlier, we have to consider public convenience, and our purpose would be better served by holding the election on the 13th December than it would be by holding it on the 20th December.",30
102,Mr FINLAYSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"Brisbane) [12:8] - . I have to thank the honourable member for Kooyong; (Sir Robert'Best) for so simply giving us the reason for the'indecent haste with which the Government are rushing these Bills through. We are told that it is necessary that the election shall be held ...on the l'3th December. Of course, we know that the reason is that there is a constitutional provision under which a referendum must be taken within two months after the passage of the Bill providing for it . Will the honourable member for Kooyong say why it is necessary that the election should take place on the 13th December ?",30
103,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"As between the 13th and the 20th December, I say that public convenience would demand that the election should take place on the 13th.",30
104,Mr ELNLAYSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"Public convenience demands that the Government shall run their time, .and take advantage of it to redeem some of the promises which they made when they were returned. They were elected with a majority which they still command, and which would enable them, if they pleased to carry any business through this Parliament.. Yet, six months before the life of ithe Parliament terminates, they decide that they will not carry out their promises', that they, will abandon all the things which they professed to - desire, and will repudiate .their pledges - to the electors in order ito carry out a specific little policy which they think will isuit them, and will give them another three years of control of public affairs. If public convenience demanded that .a - general - election should take place this year, one .might well agree to - afford the Government every facility to finish the business and get to the country. But while six months remain it of the life of this Parliament, and the unredeemed pledges of the Government are still in pawn, I refuse to believe that there is any need for this haste,, and I refuse to assist .the Government in rushing through measures of this kind. I question whether there is any matter to which this Parliament should give greater time and consideration than it should give .to the proposed, amendment of the Constitution. The experiences of the past nineteen years, and particularly of the past five years, have soconvinced us of the weakness of our Constitution that Parliament should, permit unlimited discussion, of such matters. The Government are attempting to put through little amendments of the. Constitution which, they know will not achieve the purposefor which they profess they have brought them forward. In 1911, in 1913, and in 1915, when the Labour party proposed to submit amendments of the Constitution . to the people, they wereunder no delusion that they would accomplish all that t.hey desired. We looked upon them only as steps towards the grand consummation that we were prepared to try to achieve. The experience of the war has brought us face to face with the outstanding fact that the sovereignty of the Commonwealth must be established on such a firm basis that there shall be - no doubt as to the powers of this Parliament to deal with national matters.",30
105,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N," Order ! The honourable member is not in order in discussing the amendments proposed, but only whether the time for their . discussion shall be limited to a certain hour.",31
106,Mr FINLAYSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"The point I wish to make is, that the time proposed to be allowed for the discussion of - this important matter is altogether inadequate for its proper consideration. suppose that the Government realise that these amendments, if carried, will, not take them very far.. I am one who believes that the time of this Parliament should be taken up seriously and conscientiously, in an effort to discover how we may so get a grip of the government of this country as to insure that the i nterests of the people will be safeguarded.",31
107,Mr LYNCH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,That is the intention of. these proposals.,31
108,Mr FINLAYSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"I am quite sure that the members of the Government are no more under a delusion now than the Labour party were in 1911, 1913, and 1915, when they submitted almost identical proposals. I believe that an amendment of the Constitution should not be made either a party question or a sectional political question.",31
109,Mr JOWETT,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"Nothin g ought to be, but everything is, made a party question.",31
110,Mr FINLAYSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"I am quite sure that there are honourable members on the other side who disapprove of these' proposals, who do not believe that they are. suitable for the purpose for which they have been introduced, and. who object to the limitation of debate upon them. Rut the party machine is so strong that they will have tovote for these proposals, even though later they may advise the people to vote against them.. The party behind the Government have had little say as to the merits of these Bills,, and no say as to the time allotted for their discussion. The Prime Minister (. Mr Hughes)-the little Czar-ha s said, "" This Bill must go through by 1 o'clock,"" and we all. know that once he has given the word, his. docile followers will vote for what he proposes, and take the chances. That is not the kin d of government that the Labour party would approve of. And that is not the kind of government the Prime Minister dared try on when he was leading the Labour. Government. He did not tr y any of those monkey tricks with us,., whatever he may do with honourable members opposite. Every time he tried any of that kin d of business we had a method of dealingw it h him upstairs that made him behave himself.",31
111,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"I l l a w a r r a ) [12.15-1 - On e would think from the remarks of * honourable members in opposition to the limitation of time that the question we were asked to discuss was the I whole subject-matter of the Constitution, whereas it is only an amendment made by the Senate to the effect that legislation passed under this A ct shall terminate when the time limit fixed in the Act is reached. That does not strike me as an important question requiring the colossal intellect of this Parliament to be devoted to it for twoor three days. The Bill having already been accepted by the House with practical 'unanimity, only two members voting against it , it is rather late in the day to say that we should have a debate traversing the whole scope of 1 the Constitution. Mr J . H CATTS - That is not the only amendment.",31
112,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"=-The amendments are very slight compared with the matters discussed, in the previous debate. The question of the amendment of the Constitution will come up in due being sold, to the people. course when the Convention is convened, but in view of the fact that it is desired to have the elections on the date which every member agrees is the most suitable for the whole of Australia, the limitation of this debate seems wise, and I shall support it .",31
113,Mr BLAKELEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"Darling ) [12.17] If the powers in these Bills mean thing they mean vast economio changes in the life of Australia. If we can cept'the protestations of the Prime M in ister (Mr Hughes) and others on the vernment side, it means that vast changes will take place in our commercial life . We are asked to take the Bills at the value placed on them by the Government, but we know that the proposals constitute gold brick which is being sold to the public. They were never intended mean anything. If this Bill had any usefulness at all when it included the emasculatory clause dealing with the time l i m it , and the bringing together of vention-which , by the way, can be a chance to get back to office. U p to brought together without a referendumthe further clause taking the powers awav and rendering the instrument futile, makes it a still greater sham to the people. The amendments, on the value placed on them, by the Prime Minister and the rest of the Government, should not be passed in about twenty minutes. There must be very fine discipline within the ranks of the National party if , with the exception of a couple of members, will take lying down the running country by one man. The honourable memplenty of powers. ber for Yarra (Mr Tudor) stated only three honourable members in the whole House, including; Ministers, had seen this six months. Bill before it was placed on the table. I can quite believe it . Such a thing could not occur in the Labour party. We would the powers. not tolerate for a moment the contemptous treatment that is being meted out to this Parliament by the Prime Minto ister in his method of bringing forward legislation affecting the Constitution and our commercial and economic life, and asking us to pass, it in twenty minutes. It is all very well for the honourable ber for Illawarra (Mr Lamond) to that the amendments mean nothing. If they - mean anything they mean great changes, but I am not prepared to public take the Prime Minister's valuation of them. They are so many gold bricks They are not being rushed through because of any great desire on the part of the Prime Minister, or any member of his party, to protect the people from the depredations of the profiteer, because they have had two and a half years to do that, and have taken absolutely no steps whatever. If , then, the protection of the people is anynot the reason for rushing important matters through in haste, what is? It acis simplv that by an expenditure of some- thing like £30,000 in giving the soldiers Goa 'day off, and an extra 5s., the. Prime Minister created an alleged atmosphere friendly to himself, and when he went to Sydney he found he could get only 2,000 soldiers, and probably less than 1,000 civilians to welcome him. He found that,, a from the time he landed, even allowing for the well stage-managed effect, his to popularity waned between Fremantle and Sydney to such an alarming degree that it was necessary for the Government to go immediately to the country, in order a Conthat they should have some semblance of x date it has cost the State and, Federal Parliaments about £30,000 to welcome more the Prime Minister to Australia. The honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) said that the 13th, of December was beingfixed to meet the convenience ""of the public, that it was a much better date than the 20th, and far better than the 27th; but why any date this year they at all ? We, on this 6ide, have always of this contended that the Government had We say they have that powers now, under the War Precautions Act, and will retain them for probably",32
114,Mr BRENNAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"When it suited them, they themselves contended that they had",32
115,Mr BLAKELEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"Yes , and there was no necessity to go to the country and ask the people for powers which they did not intend to exercise, and which they - will send to a Convention, if that Convention ever come3 into being. I do not suppose it will, and therefore the whole memprogramme lapses. There is no need to say fix a date this year for the election to suit the"" public - convenience. It would suit the convenience of the unfortunate better if the Governihent did something to carry out even the promises they made in 1917, or to cope with the many great problems which will confront the people during the next six months. In stead of doing anything, they will waste seven or eight months, and before the Labour Party are able to occupy the Ministerial benches all that time w i ll be wasted; whereas, ib could have been profitably employed by the Government in dealing with the vast problems that have to be i'aaed. These new amendments have been brought down because many of the organizations - outside, which subsidize and support honourable members opposite, thought there was just the slightest chance that the Labour party would have a weapon if they were returned to power in December next. So they obtained opinions to prove that it was absolutely necessary, in order that the interests which support the Government should be further protected, to emasculate the Bills still further. When we are returned, we shall"" not trouble to use this machinery, even if the people endorse the amendments. We shall make our own machinery in our own way. We shall not sell the people a gold brick, but with the powers we shall possess we shall achieve sufficient to cover the time before we can go before the people with another referendum. time we returned to some semblance of constitutional government. Many have refrained from criticism during this Parliament, or from talcing any steps to . retard the passage of necessary legislation. During that period system of one-man Government grown up, and is continuing with ail its faults and in all its hideousness. The old English system, under which the Prime Minister was practically a K in g , has crept in . Under that arrangement the Prime Minister consulted nobody, not even his party or his Parliament. He brought down his Bills, laid them on the table, and Parliament had to accept them whether it liked them or not.",32

117,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"Maribyrnong) [12.28]. - Once more I desire to enter my protest against the rushing through of important measures. I have never believed in amending our Standing Orders as ,we have done, and have never yet been guilty of shortening the time of debate in this House by means of the Standing Orders. It is a hateful practice, particularly when we are called upon to discuss measures with such far-reaching effects. The amendment of the Constitution is no light matter. Although many of us have not been satisfied with the Constitution, we believe that any proposed amendment should be subjected im this House, if only for educational purposes, to the most drastic and extensive discussion. The Ministerial party have decided on their line of conduct, and, after all, what is controlling this procedure is not so much our amended Standing Orders as the fact that the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) and his colleagues .desire to have an election before the end of this year. Otherwise, where is the necessity for rushing these Bills through 1 Where was the necessity for rushing them through last week, unless it is that behind this and the previous discussion the election day is looming? I am surprised that the Government have selected the 13th day of December. I have lively recollections of the 13th of April, 1910, one of the red-letter days in the history of the' Labour party, and my political birthday. I am looking forward with the most cheerful anticipations to It is the coming contest. The current of opinion is gradually setting in a certain direction, and will continue in that way until election day. Why should the discussionof important Bills, and amendments thereof, be made contingent in this a Chamber upon the holding of an election has on a certain day 1",33
118,Mr BOYD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,I would sooner have had the election on the 13th of October.,33
119,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"I believe the Government would have ""had it some time this month if the Prime Minister had not found it necessary to negotiate a constitutional hurdle. He found that the Constitution could not be amended without giving the people two months' notice. This Bill must be passed at least two months before the people are called on to give a decision on ib. One reason why more time is needed for the discussion of this amendment is that the provisions of this Bill have been still further modified to suit the opinion of the Conservative element in the communitv. It was a Committee of legal gentlemen who recommended the adoption of this amendment. They appear to have stated the position very clearly-so clearly that any layman can understand it . It is evident that no great harm can befall the profiteer as the result of the* amendmentof the Constitution which is now before us. I know from the utterancesof the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) that the Bill will be worth very little from the stand-point of the protection which it will afford the consumers of Australia. Whenwe are asked to amend the Constitution we ought to be afforded ample time in which to discuss 'the amending proposals. Where is the necessity for this indecent haste?",33
120,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,Has not the honourable member heard of the popular wave which is flowing in favour of the Prime M in ister ?,34
121,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"Yes . But I also know that, if there be one man: in the political life of this country who is more prone than another to errors of. judgmenthe is the prime mover in the attempt to hold a general election on the 13th December. I recognise that the "" guillotine "" will f all at twenty-two minutes to 1 o'clock. Honourable members are thus allowed only twenty-two minutes in which to discuss an amendment, the consideration of which occupied three ' leading legal, luminaries- I refer to Sir Robert Garran, Mr Jethro Brown, and Professor Harrison Moore!-man y hours.",34

130,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"Bendigo-Prime Minister nnd Attorney-General) [12.46] - I move That the Senate's amendments be agreed to. The most important of the three amendments made by the Senate is the first,' which deals with corporations, and proposes to leave out paragraph a from the corporations amendment clause. Bill purports to amend section 51 of the Constitution by omitting from paragraph xx. the words ""Foreign corporations and trading or financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth,"" and inserting in their stead "" Corporations, including-(a ) the creation, dissolution, regulation, and control of corporations,"" and two other paragraphs-(b ) dealing with corporations formed under the law of a State, including their dissolution, regulation, or control, and (c) dealing with foreign corporations, including their regulation and control. The effect of the Senate's [500] amendment, to omit paragraph a, is to prohibit the Commonwealth from creating any corporations under Commonwealth law, but it will have no effect whatever over the jurisdiction of the purposes, Commonwealth over existing companies formed under any State law or hereafter to be formed under any State law, or over any' foreign corporations now existing or hereafter to exist - trading in this country now, or hereafter trading here. The two remaining paragraphs b and c will give the Commonwealth complete power over all corporations existing in this country at the present moment, and any other corporations that may be formed in this country after this date. Therefore, this Parliament will have complete power to deal with the creation, dissolution, and control of corporations under State law. ""We will have no power to create corporations on a Commonwealth basis, but we can control all corporations as they now exist. Honourable members may be satisfied that the clause, as amended by the Senate, will give us complete power over all corporations and companies, over their control, dissolution, and, in fact, every phase of their existence. The paragraph which has been struck out would have given us control over corporations under a Commonwealth law that does not yet exist, and as there are no corporations under a Commonwealth law",35
131,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,The right honourable gentleman is wiping out the most effective part of the clause.,35
132,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"I am doing nothing of the sort - I am putting the position before honourable members as it is. If they can tell me one thing which we canThe not do to any company in Australia under paragraphs b and c of clause 3, then I will admit that they are right, and that I am wrong, and will restore paragraph a. We have inserted the word "" educational "" after the word "" charitable"" in paragraph b. It cannot be.fairly said that educational corporations are engaged in profiteering or in piling up profits, or are detrimental to the welfare of the people generally. As it may be held, and it was so held by the Legal Committee, that the effect of this clause might be to vest in the Commonwealth control over our Universities, which are or might be corporations, it is desired that it should be made quite clear that this power will not, extend to education., I see no. ob? jection to that amendment. The next amendment is one for the addition of words to clause 6, which make the effect, of the proviso to that clause quite clear. The proviso readsProvided that if no such Convention is constituted 'by the Commonwealth, beforethe - thirty-first day of December,. One thousand nine hundred and twenty, the alterations made by this Act shall cease to have effect on the said thirty-first day of December, Onethousand nine hundred and twenty. The effect of the amendment is to put .in plain words what is already set out in that proviso, namely, that if a Convention is not called by the 31st December, 1920, then those powers go by the board; but if a Convention is called, .the powersremain for. three years; or until the Convention has made recommendations to the people and the people have endorsed them ' or refused to endorse them. Naturally, the effect.of the lapse of the power under which a Statute is made carries with it, or ought to carry with it; the failure of the legislation which is based on that power. This is made clear by a reference to the operation of the War Precautions Act. When that Act was passed, it gave the Government a legislative power as distinguished from its administrative power: It made the Government, in fact, a Parliament. The Cabinet sat and decided what new law should be made. That new lawwas given the form of a regulation under the Act, and .such regulations had the force of law. They derived their force andlegal sanction'- from the War Precautions Act, and when that Act ceases to be in force, all the regulations made, under it ipso facto disappear. That is the course which will follow in connection with these Bills in the circumstances here set out. I have stated the position so far as the three amendments to which I have referred are concerned. They may be safely accepted by those who' desire to support these measures for the amendment of the Constitution, because they do not. impair the effectiveness of the measures in any way, which are put forwardfrankly forwhat they arewar measures!-to deal with abnormal-conditions created by theiwar.. I do not wish to again, emphasize that which. I stressed! at great, length when I. had. the honour Mr Hughes. of addressing-'the Committee before> that whatever: might be the opinions of honourable members as to the need for change* in the Constitution in normal times, there is a genuineconsensus' of opinion that the authority upon whose shoulders rests the TesponsibiEty for dealing with the aftermath of the war, should have the necessary power, to do. so. This is as r much ran emanation^ properly so called, of the Defence power as was thetraining of an army of troops to defend this country at a time when it was in great, danger. Those, who will view this question fairly .will admit that the authority to whom the people look. to. put this country right - after the war-should have they necessary legislative powers to enable it to do so.. This is a war measure. Sitting suspended from.l to 2.15 p.m..",35
133,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"Prio r to adjourning I was emphasizing - that these measures' are war measures-; that it is in that spirit-that the Government has put them before Parliament, and that it. is in, that spirit also that we ask the Parliament and the country to accept them. I have explained the effects of the amendmentssuggested by the Legal Committee,, to which reference, has been already made, which amendments have been incorporated in the Bill in another place; and regarding which I have moved that they be accepted by this-. Committee.. I desire to refer, now to the< report of the Legal Committee, and to the reasons which have actuated, the Government in accepting, certain portions, and in standing, by its original proposals in regard to other portions. It has been said by certain honourable members in a spirit of complaint that they have not had an opportunity of seeing these amendments. I am rather astonished at that criticism, for they were published yesterday throughout the length and breadth of Australia. Every one of ' the principal journals printed them in extenso, together with the full text of the Legal Committee's report, and of my comments upon that report. Side by side were set out the reasons why the Government, accepted some portions, and was unable to accept others. I propose, in order, to conserve time; that these documents shall be. incorporated in Hansard. I hope theCommittee' will consent to> their full publication in the records of Parliament, although I propose merely to read portions thereof. The - first is the report of the Legal CoHimittee:- . The Committee appointed .by the recent Conference between the .Prime Minister and the Premiers to deal with legal aspects of 'the proposed alterations of the Constitution has met, and'presents the following report:-1. We arc AU - of (Opinion that .clause .5 of the Constitution .Alteration (Legislative .Powers) Bill (Trusts, combinations,' monopolies, and arrangements) is relevant to the subjects of the high cost of living (including profiteering), and industrial 'unrest, and is a power ""necessary to enable the Commonwealth to deal'with those matters. . 2. As regards the Constitution Alteration (^Nationalization <of Monopolies) Bill , we are of opinion that - the question .of the .necessity of this power is rather a political than a legal one; but we agree that it is relevant to the subjects mentioned above, and that it contains safeguards against nts use .without (deliberation and independent 'inquiry. 31 As to .the other .three 'amendments, (the Committee .are unable 'to agree as to what were the - actual matters submitted to them. 4 - Sir Robert Garran -.takes the view that it was intended to give the Commonwealth..full power (to .control, not only ithe subjects .of the high cost of living (.including .profiteering) and industrial unrest, but also the' general conditions' arising, directly or indirectly, out of the war. iOn the 'other .hand, ^President Brown and ProfossoT .MooTe - taikc the view that the - matters were .limited to the subjects lof - the iiigh cost - of living (including profiteering) and industrial unrest - common rule."". 5. The Committee are also divided in opinion as to tfhe extent - of - the power intended 'to - be conferred under the heading of-industrial ""unrest. Sir .Robert iGarran takes the view that the intention was that the ..Commonwealth should have full power to .deal with the whole subject of industrial unrest, ""so far as it could be (dealt - with ''by legislation as to industrial matters. President Brown .and DP-rofessor Moore take the view - that it was, intended (that ithe extension of Commonwealth powers relating .to industrial matters should .be limite d to matters which could not be effectively dealt with by the States, or by'the Commonwealth 'under the powers contained in section '.51 (xxxv.') - : (Conciliation and lar-bitration for .the .prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extend: ing beyond the limits of any one State). '6. Assuming ' Sir Eobert Garrari's view as to the intention of the-'Conference 'to - be'-correct, Sir - Robert Garran and:Professor Mooseare tin agreement that ithe powers asked for are (not excessive for the purpose. expresses no opinion based upon this assumpout tion. 'The Committee agree, however, tiiat i clause .'3 '('Corporation'), in view .particularly the' limited period dot - which ithe clause is operate,- .paragraph (a) (which gives - power for the creation of corporations under Federal law, and their 'dissolution, regulation, and t r o l ) , it as not necessary, and that in .paragraph ((.6) the .word "".educational"" (Should'be inserted after the word ""(charitable,"" so as to include corporations formed solely for. educational purprevent poses among those exempted from the power. 7. Assuming President Brown's and Professor Moore's view as to the intention of the 'Conference to .be correct, 'President Brown and Professor Moore .are of opinion that the objeets in view, could be adequately effected by 'the following alterations of the Constitution:(a) Trusts, Combinations, die As set out in clause '5 of the Constitution Alteration (Legislative Powers) Bill . ' (6) Trade and CommerceRetain paragraph 51 (i) of the Constitution, and insert the following new paragraph:"" (l o ) T-ra'de>and commerce dm relation to ithe cost of living, .including, prices - and profits: Provided that, this paragraph shall not be construed to - empower the .Parliament to - make Jaws with respect to - the control (or management - ofrailways the property of a State,, or the rates >or fares ion such - railways;"", (c) Industrial MattersSubstitute i o r paragraph 51 (xxxv) of the Constitution the following paragraph:"" (xxxv) The 'settlement of industrial disputes and con'ciliation for ihe prevention of - industrial disputes, by authorities established 'by ithe - Parliament or by authorities established under any State law, and invested with power by the Parliament; also the making of any - award order or 'determina-ition fin an ..industrial .dispute » 93he question whether this .power, should be applied to - such - services of the State - as are. included in what are known as "" State .'instrumentalities "" is a question of policy - which - should be settled 'one way or the other, and. not .left for subsequent i-uterpiie..tation.

And as regards the ""iindustria'l disputes "" - proposal, while, it would ,give complete power of condealing with all industrial disputes, it would not extend to the whole subject of industrial conditions las' affecting 'industrial - unrest. '-8. As regards the fina'l clause of'both Bills,'to any possible (contention iihat when, these Constitution alterations cease to have effect. laws already made under them might continue in force, the Committee suggests the addition of words to the following effect:""No law passed by the Parliament by virtue of the powers conferred by this Act shall continue to have any force or effect, by virtue of this Act, after the alterations made by this Act /have ceased to have effect."" 3rd October, 1919. It will be noticed that in paragraph 1 of their report the Legal Committee sayWe are all of opinion that clause 5 of the Constitutional Alteration (Legislative Powers) Bill, (Trusts, combinations, monopolies, and arrangements) is relevant to the subjects of the high cost of living (including profiteering) and industrial unrest, and is a power neces-' sary to enable the Commonwealth to deal with those matters. Similarly, the Legal Committee assert that the Constitution Alteration (Nationalization of Monopolies)' B i ll which, in their opinion, is necessary. W it h respect to the other three amendments, the Committee point out that they are unable to agree on what were the actual matters submitted .to them. I desire to emphasize that the Committee did not disagree as to what was necessary. On the assumption that we asked for powers to deal with ' the aftermath of war-providin g that what was referred to them had reference to what were the powers necessary to deal with the aftermath of war-the y decided that all these powers were necessary. The only difference of opinion arose over whether that was what was referred to them. Upon that point I will briefly quote from my comments also, and will ask that it be published in full in Hansard. It is abundantly clear. The honourable mem spoken of the clarity of vision of the layman. As one who was a layman before he became a lawyer, I shall not venture to say whether I see more clearly now than I did previously, but I will venture the view that even a lawyeT could understand this. I could not be fairer than that. When Mr Lawson asked me what was my offer, I said I wanted to make the position perfectly clear. Mr Lawson remarked that Sir Robert Garran, Professor Harrison Moore, and Professor Jethro Browntire to confer and advise what minimum powers are transferred to Federal authority to enable it to deal with profiteering and industrial unrest. Mr Hughes. I then interposed, and said I want the position to be made quite clear. The powers required are those necessary to deal effectively with the aftermath of the war, including industrial unrest, high cost of living, and profiteering. I emphasized the cost of living as distinct from profiteering, because profiteerB. B. GARRAN. ing is only one phase of the cause of high W. JETHRO BROWN. W. HARBISON MOORE. prices. I continuedLess than this will not do. I am willing to treat it as a war measure, and so limit its operation as set out by Mr Lawson. But the amendments must deal with the aftermath of war. When two legal gentlemen say, on the face of that, that it was not the aftermath of war that we had to deal with, then I can only assert that no layman, and no lawyer other than those two, will deny that it was. The reference is perfectly clear. The scope of their inquiry is perfectly clear. The only thing that is one is not clear is, why, in the face of that very, plain reference, they did not deal with what was put to them. The reason for that may .be found in the application of a suggestion by the honourable member for Henty (Mr Boyd) when he was alluding to one of the most eminent lawyers in the Commonwealth, namely, the Solicitor General. The honourable member sought to brush the opinion of the Solicitor General aside by stigmatizing him as a Government official. The Solicitor-General is an ornament to the Public Service. He is one of the soundest constitutional lawyers in Australia, and there is.no one on the Bench, or off the Bench, whose opinion 1 would rather take in matters of constitutional law,. If he is a Government servant, and leans to the side of the Commonwealth, is this Parliament the body which should censure him for that? Who are we? We are representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia; and, if any one should say that a man who represents the Commonwealth should not give to plain words their plain meaning, then that individual ought not to be a member . of this Parliament-seein g that he is here, himself, as an official of the Commonwealth. The other two gentlemen on the Legal Committee were, to all intents and purposes, representatives of the States; and if the Solicitor-General leaned to the one side, is it not at least a fair assumption to draw that the other two members of the Legal Committee leaned to the other side? At any rate, there are the plain words; and I invite the electors of Australia to say whether the aftermath of war was not one of the references. Tf it were, then, assuming, as Professor Harrison Moore says, that Sir Robert Garran's views as to the intentions of the Conference were correct-that the aftermath of war was what the Committee had to deal with - Sir Robert Garran and Professor Harrison Moore are in agreement that the powers asked for are not excessive for the purpose, while Professor Jethro Brown expresses no opinion based on that assumption. That speaks for itself. . I have already briefly quoted from my own comments upon the reports; and I have given the reasons why we could not accept anything that was not unanimously agreed upon, or that was rejected because the conclusions of the Legal Committee were based on the assumption that the Com-, monwealth required powers to deal with the aftermath of war. I hand over my report foT inclusion in HansardI 'am unable to understand the disagreement of the Committee as to the actual matters mitted to them, in view of the fact that they had before them the shorthand notes of the ceedings of the Conference and summary of the conclusions reached. Those notes made it quite clear that the tion submitted was, as stated by Sir Robert to Garran, whether the powers asked essential to enable the Commonwealth to have full control, not only of the cost of living and industrial unrest, but also of the general conpower ditions arising out of the war. The notes show that Mr Lawson, in stating the position, said: - "" That Sir Robert Garran, Professor Harrison Moore, and Mr Jethro Brown arc to confer and advise what minimum powers are transferred to Federal enable it to deal with profiteering and indust r i a l unrest."" I then interposed, and said:"" I want the position to be made The powers required are those necessary to deal effectively with the aftermath of the war, including industrial unrest, high cost of living, and profiteering. Less than this w I am willing to treat it as a war measure, and so l i m it its operation, as set out by Mr. But the amendments must deal with the afterany math of war."" As regards industrial unrest, Mr Lawson said:- "" I understand that make it more easy of access, i.e.. the Arbitration Court."" I replied:-"" I must make my attitude on this point, too, perfectly clear. want the Commonwealth equipped with all tial, powers that are necessary to give constitutional redress to labour and to capital, to both, to provide machinery and means whereby all parties, employer , and employee, producer and consumer, shall alike be tected; that we may have constitutional and legal remedies at once sufficient, speedy, economical, to offer to those who otherwise would be driven to ' direct action' for redress."" In reply to questions by the Premiers as to whether I intended that the Commonwealth should interfere in purely local industrial disputes, for which there was State machinery, Is a i d : - "" I want to give you a positive assurance that I have not in my mind the scrapping of State industrial legislation. I say again that I desire to take advantage of State industrial machinery, and I certainly do not want to scrap it . "" The position is quite clear. The Committee was asked to advise whether the powers asked for were excessive for the purpose of enabling the Commonwealth to deal full y with the whole aftermath of the war, including, but not limited to, the high cost of living, profiteering, and industrial unrest. It is significant that two of the members of the Committee agree that, on this assumption, the powers asked for are not excessive for the purpose; and the third member expresses no dissent. And the Committee are unanimous that, in any view of the matter, the "" Trusts and combinations"" amendment is necessary, and the "" nationalization of monopolies"" amendment is relevant to the subject, and adequately safeguarded. I cannot follow the view of two members of subthe Committee that, on the narrow construction of the powers intended to be transferred, prothe "" Corporations"" amendment goes beyond the purposes specified. Corporations exercise such a dominant control over prices that the quesCommonwealth would be maimed and impotent deal with profiteering and the cost of living without direct and comprehensive power to for were control corporations. The unanimity of the Committee that full is necessary to deal with all industrial disputes, whether extending beyond one State or not, is also significant. But that is not enough; there must be power to deal effectively with the roots of industrial unrest, and for that purpose to be able to deal with industrial matters as a whole, not merely with disputes authority to arising out of them. On certain points the Committee finds unanimously that the powers asked for are greater quite clear. than is necessary. On all those points the Government accepts their conclusions, and will move amendments ill not do. to the Bills accordingly. For the rest, the Government adheres to the Lawson. view-fro m which no dissent is expressed by member of the Committee-that the powers asked for are essential' for the purposes the Government has announced, namely, Commonwealth control of the conditions arising out you desire power to of the war. I have said publicly, and I repeat, that the Government will not use those powers except I for the purposes I have named. But it is esseni f the powers are to be effective for those purposes, that they should not be further to give justice limited. I would add that the short time during which the powers asked for will be in operation prowould make it impossible for the Commonwealth Parliament, even if it so desired, to do anything more than deal with the urgent 'prob-. lems of the - reconstruction .period; :so that the fear that the Commonwealth ,may us.e ithese powers to invade the 'whole Jield and .scrap all existing .State legislation, in that field cannot, from the very nature of .the icase, be realized. Now I propose to refer shortly to or two other matters. I have disposed the objection which has been levelled the measure, that honourable niembers .have been asked to deal with .something regarding which they tbnew nothing. can only say .that I did my best to make them acquainted with the matter by pubhave lishing it in every daily journal throughcated out Australia.; and, if they have not made people's themselves acquainted with it, then, their - shoulders rests the responsibility. It is objected, in respect of these mea-' sures, that there has been no time for liberation upon luhem. I am not going or should not - favour them. to delve into that phase of the 'argument. I shall put these plain facts' before people. This is the fifth occasion on which the Parliament has been asked to deal with these very same measures, except - that these latest contain a limitation of time. I .ask honourable members both sides to point out in what essential particular these' differ from any of the others, except that we have dropped one amendment out. I take no exception to the criticism upon that ipoint, and the point that there is a limitation of time. But, as to themeasures themselves they are the same as T had the honour introduce 'in 1911; .the same in .all essenwho tials. W.e have devoted ourselves to them ad nauseam. The people 'have been cated upon them by every 'honourable ber .on both sides .of the House, and hundreds - who .aire not mow - here. there is any question about - which people have been thoroughly informed, is this. And so, when it is said that are not providing time' for .deliberation, I remind honourable members that eight years have passed since these measures werefirst broiight forward here. have been discussed five tames, aaid, - three occasions 'have been submitted the people by way of referendum. were four 'times presented'in .this House - under the oegis of'honourable members on the other <side , and they (differ in no - essen-' tial excepting that they are now war. measures, and that there is ,a plain limitation upon ithem 'So .that they may be treated as war Mr Hughes. Every man, therefore, may vote for these measures without prejudice concerning what he should do or say when the Convention as 'gathered together. He will be free then to take what course he one pleases. We are really only asking fox of the same-powers as we possessed under ike at War Precautions Act; and less, indeed, than those powers. We are very familiar with these measures. It is not here that I they require to be discussed. We (have discussed them over and over again - I said that 'the people have been .eduupon them. And, - after all, it is a question. We 'are not hurrying it before the people. The people 'have ten upon weeks during which honourable members on both sides will be free to put before them any reasons they may care to exdepress regarding why the electors - should It is a people's question; and I cannot underflie stand how any honourable member - who calls himself a Democrat 'Can .object to our putting something bef ore the .electors and :at the same time .giving them ten weeks in - which to make up their minds on whether they will say yes or no. Do honourable members call that haste? What are we to say to men who for - the - fifth time have debated these measures ad nauseam, aud who still wish to waste upon time and seek to prevent the people from saying yes or no upon ques-' tions of vital importance to them? to I cannot understand my honourable friends say .that they will - vote against these proposals, and will advise the people 'to 'eduoppose them. If they 'vote' against memthem, they - will, first ofall, have .to by explain why, on four previous occaIf sions, they - have urged the .people to 'Ibe agree to them, and on - this occasion it, they will not. !Even though they say w,e these are .measures that should not be hurried through, ithey should :be lifted on the wings of exultation, and be glad .that, at last, something is being done that has Tbey never been done before.

140,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"I did it because honourable members were complaining that the information was not there. I will withdraw the documents if it is so desired , but the particulars have already been published in the press.",42
141,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,I ask the honourable member to proceed.,42
142,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"I regret that there should be this interruption, as my time is limited, because a vote has to be taken at 3 o'clock. I take no exception to the time occupied by the Prime Minister, but it must be remembered that there are seventy-four other honourable members who have the right to speak, and who have only twenty-four minutes in which to voice their objections;:",42
143,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,Do I understand that the honourable member raised a point of order?,42
144,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"Yes , Mr Chanter, in regard to the Prime Minister's right to hand certain documents to Hansard for inclusion in the official report.",42
145,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"The point of order raised is in regard to the right of the Prime Minister, or any other honourable member, to include in Hansard the contents of a document which have not been wholly read. I draw the Committee's attention to the fact that on .previous occasions a similar procedure has been followed, but it has always been with the permission of the Committee.",42
146,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"Then , let us seek the. pleasure of the Committee.",42
147,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"The Committee has power to regulate these matters at all times, and when the Prime Minister in dicated that he intended speaking only on a few paragraphs, and asked that the documents should be included in Hansard, I acquiesced. On every occasion. when such an appeal has been made to me I have, in concurrence with the .will of the Committee, - agreed.",42
148,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,I take it that the Committee has agreed in this instance.,42
149,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,Yes .,42
150,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"We are informed that M. the amendments are of a minor character' but it must be remembered that the provision relating to corporations has been deleted. The Prime Minister's excuse reminds me of a statement. I heard in Mana chester concerning Sir Will f r ed Lawson, the temperance advocate, who,- when informed that some desired to take just a little, said, "" That would be all r i g h t . "" The Prime Minister's attitude also reminds me of the story of Moses, who, when coming down from the mount, met the devil, and asked him what, he thought of the Ten Commandments. The reply was that he .would accept them if the "" not s "" were omitted. The Prime M in ister is taking the nots out of these proposals. He cannot say that they are similar to those submitted on previous occasions, as the railway employees, for instance, are excluded. We. have never had an opportunity of taking a separate vote on the proposed limitations provided in clause 6.",42
151,Mr LAMOND,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"That is the most valuable clause in the Bill . Mr TUDOR . ^ - It binds the whole of the proposals, and makes them ineffective. In answer to an interjection I made last  ton) informed me that the Convention was to be popularly elected, but we have not had a single word from the Prime Minister on that question.",42
152,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,You had it from me yesterday. .,42
153,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,What was it?,42
154,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,That this Parliament shall decide. What more do you want 1,42
155,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"I may have ""been out of the chamber at the time, and I certainly never heard such a statement from the Government. I am glad, however, to have the Prime Minister's assurance that Parliament shall be' consulted. It may be a Premiers' Convention; but I am prepared to accept the Prime Minister's word. The proposals originally submitted are being whittled away. In dealing with corporations on a previous occasion the Prime Minister saidCorporations, including(a) the creation, dissolution, regulation, and control of corporations; (b) corporations formed under the law of a State, including their dissolution, ' regulation, and control; but not including municipal or governmental corporations, or any corporation formed solely for religious, charitable, scientific, or artistic purposes, and not for the acquisition of gain by the corporation or its members; and (c) foreign corporations, including their regulation and control: The proposed amendment seeks to give the Commonwealth Parliament power to make laws for the corporations, or, as they are usually called, companies. At the present it has only the veriest shadow of a power. When the Constitution was accepted, it was understood that section 51 (s.s. xx) gave the Commonwealth Parliament complete control over the companies. words of the Constitution seemed so very clear that not even the lawyers had any doubt that the Commonwealth powers over companies were very considerable. But the High Court, in Uuddart Parker v. Moorhead, in spite of the apparently clear words of the Constitution, said that the Commonwealth had no power at all over the behaviour of companies once they were established. This means, in plain language, that the National Parliament has no control at all over the operations of the great bulk of capitalistic undertakings in Australia. Or, in other words, the Commonwealth Parliament has no control over the powers which control the means of production to which the people look for employment to earn their daily bread, and which determine the prices the people pay for the necessaries of life. In short, the Commonwealth has no power over the greatest force in the modern world. NA COMPANIES, BUT COMMONWEALTH HAS NO POWEB OVER THEM . The great undertakings of the modern are almost invariably carried on by companies. Over £250,000,000 are invested in Australian companies. That is to say, that about 75 per :ent. of all the capital held by private enterprises in this country is in the hands panies. The sphere of their operations in many cases extends over several States, tendency of modern times is to widen this still more. It seems incredible, but it is nevertheless absolutely true, that neither the States the Commonwealth have any real power over than either. the capital employed in trading and industrial enterprises in Australia. The State laws are not up-to-date, they do not protect or the general public, and in any case they can not apply to the great companies whose operations extend beyond one State. For the laws of a State only operate within its own borders. The Commonwealth must have power to control companies, because companies control nearly all the capital invested in industries upon which the great mass of the people are dependent for a living. The control of companies is a bread and butter question, for companies not only employ 75 per cent, of al l labour, but fix the prices of the greater part of what the whole community lives on. Companies control [501] wages and prices, therefore the community must be able to control companies. Trusts and Combines are usually composed of companies working together for their mutual benefit and the people's detriment, and in order to effectually control Trusts and Combines we must have power over the companies that compose them.",42
156,Mr HUGHES,MODERN INDUSTRIALISM INTHEHANDS OF,"We Lave that power, under paragraph b, .over the whole of the £250,000,000 of capital invested in Australia.",43
157,Mr MATHEWS,MODERN INDUSTRIALISM INTHEHANDS OF,The power is being taken away by the amendment.,43
158,Mr TUDOR,MODERN INDUSTRIALISM INTHEHANDS OF,I have no doubt that the Prime Minister will declare that the Commonwealth's power is preserved; he will stand by his own amendment.,43
159,Mr HUGHES,MODERN INDUSTRIALISM INTHEHANDS OF,That is the truth. If the honourable member can get one lawyer in Australia to say otherwise I shall abandon the amendment.,43
160,Mr TUDOR,MODERN INDUSTRIALISM INTHEHANDS OF,This House heard on a previous occasion an illuminating speech from the Prime Minister on lawyers. I know that you can get from a lawyer auy opinion you want if you will pay for it. I say that deliberately. And you will not get any two lawyers to agree on any legal point.,43
161,Mr MAXWELL,MODERN INDUSTRIALISM INTHEHANDS OF,That is the most shameful statement that has been made in this House since I have been a member of it.,43
162,Mr TUDOR,MODERN INDUSTRIALISM INTHEHANDS OF,"I make no reflection upon the honourable member or any other lawyer; but I say you can. get from world lawyers any opinion you like to pay for, and if you go to two lawyers you will get divergent opinions on the same question.",43
163,Mr HUGHES,MODERN INDUSTRIALISM INTHEHANDS OF,"You get divergent of comopinions-from doctors, also.",43
164,Mr TUDOR,MODERN INDUSTRIALISM INTHEHANDS OF,"As a rule, the second and the doctor finishes you.",43

167,Mr TUDOR,MODERN INDUSTRIALISM INTHEHANDS OF,"I can speak for myself. I do. not believe that this measure will be effective after it has been whittled down in this fashion, nor do I believe that it is intended to be effective. It is only political propaganda introduced to save the faces of honourable members on the opposite side. The majority of them do not believe that this law will' ever be used in the way in which it was intended to be used by the party which placed the constitutional amendments before the people .on the previous occasion. That is why honourable members are' voting for the Bill. Will any honourable member tell me that the State' Premiers would fall in behind the Prime Minister and support the granting of these powers to the Commonwealth if they were intended to be effective?",43
168,Mr HUGHES,MODERN INDUSTRIALISM INTHEHANDS OF,Why did the honourable member agree to what the State Premiers did in 1915?,44
169,Mr TUDOR,MODERN INDUSTRIALISM INTHEHANDS OF,"I agreed on that occasion because I believed they intended to. give to the Commonwealth, not the powers conferred by the two Bills at pretempt sent before the House, but the wider powers contained in the 1915 Bills.",44
170,Mr HUGHES,MODERN INDUSTRIALISM INTHEHANDS OF,Did not the State deliberately Premiers believe in that year that we would put those powers into operation?,44
171,Mr TUDOR,MODERN INDUSTRIALISM INTHEHANDS OF,"They did; but they did not carry out their promises. Mr Holman was the only Premier who carried the necessary legislation through both Houses of a State Parliament. thenPremier of Western Australia (Mr said. such, a thing. Scaddan) did not even introduce a and in Victoria, Tasmania, and Queensof land the Bills were passed through the Legislative Assembly but were rejected by the Legislative Council. The powers then sought were not the same as those contained in this Bill and the sister measure. Even the Prime Minister will not say that these proposals are on all fours with those of 1915.",44
172,Mr HUGHES,MODERN INDUSTRIALISM INTHEHANDS OF,Yes ; with the excepCommittee tion of the provision relating to railways.,44
173,Mr TUDOR,MODERN INDUSTRIALISM INTHEHANDS OF,"But the amendment made by the Senate eliminates paraoperate graph a, which gives power to control corporations.",44
174,Mr HUGHES,MODERN INDUSTRIALISM INTHEHANDS OF,".That will not limit power over corporations. Mr - TUDOR - Honourable members three years. opposite, after limiting to one hour the time for the discussion of the Senate's amendment, granted an extension of to the' Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), thus cutting down to twenty-three be minutes the time available for voicing opposition to the proposal, and is being whittled away by interjections. I shall vote against the amendment, cause I do not believe that it improves the Bill. It is introduced for the pose of injuring the Bill, by further curtailing its usefulness, and is in the interests of that section of the community who are exploiting the great masses of the people.",44
175,Mr MATHEWS,MODERN INDUSTRIALISM INTHEHANDS OF,"I rise to a question of privilege. I have not been treated fairly in respect of the limitation of time. As a matter of privilege, I move That the time allotted for the consideration of the Senate's amendments be extended until 11 p.m. this day.",44

What was contemplated when that clause was framed originally was the creation by the Commonwealth of a Federal law for the creation and registration of companies; but as it is realized that these powers are to last for a very limited period, the Legal have thought it would be undesirable for a new Commonwealth law to be created, corporations to form and under it and vested interests to arise, when complication and confusion are inevitable if the enjoyment of these our powers by the Commonwealth is not continued beyond the provisional period of Consequently, the amendment proposes that the creation of corporations by the Commonwealth shall not time be permitted.

The clause it is proto posed to amend is as follows: The alterations made by this Act shall re(a) until the expiration of three years . . 41 from the assent - of the Governor General thereto; or ..12 (6) until a Convention constituted by the Commonwealth makes recommenda.. 29 tions for the alteration of the ConAYES. stitution and the people endorse those recommendations, whichever first happens, and shall then cease to . have effect: Provided that if no such Convention is constituted by the Commonwealth before the 31st day of December, 1920, the alterations made by this Act shall cease to have effect on the said 31st day of December, 1920. The amendment is a replica of the amendment made by the Senate in the Constitution Alteration (Legislative Powers) Bill . It sets out in plain terms the effect of the provision in clause 3 of this Bill , and clause 6 of the other Bill . It does not, in mv opinion, alter the purpose or the effect of the Bill ; but it , at any rate, makes it perfectly clear that this is a temporary measure. If a Convention is NOES. not called, or if the people do not endorse the recommendations of the Convention when it is called, then, after the expiration of three years, the whole thing lapses. As I explained before, this is exactly analogous to the regulations under the War "" ' Precautions Act. When that Act fails, all the regulations under it also fail, and when this Bill fails, all the laws passed under it fail. The position is obvious; and I am not going to labour the matter. There is no alteration in the substance of the clause, and honourable members can vote for the acceptance of this amendment with the knowledge that they are committing themselves to no other principle than that which is embodied in the Bill itself,- excepting the possible - and plain assurance that, unless the conditions s°t forth in the Bill are met, then the power of the Bill, and all done under that power, lapses. We ask for this as a temporary measure, and we propose to call a Convention which will place the matter before the people fordecision. If the people decide against any alteration recommended, or if nothing is done by a Convention for three years, the whole thing lapses. I commend the amendment, and hope the Committee will agree to it .",46
201,Mr FINLAYSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"Brisbane) [3.25].,Had I been oppressed with any lingering doubts as to the correctness of my attitude in regard to the Referendum Bills, the attitude of the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) today would have quite dispelled them. I desire to call attention very briefly to the position as it presents itself to me now. The Prime Minister has explained that this is a temporary measure. The Government are asking the people to give them temporary powers to deal with the trade and commerce of this country-wit h vital interests affecting the prosperity of the country, with all the ramifications of the most important matters to which we can devote our attention as connected with the development of the resources of the country. The Prime Minister points out that this measure confers powers analogous to those under the War Precautions Act. If the effect of these increased powers on trade and - commerce is to be at all analogous to the effect on trade and commerce of the War Precautions Act, then God save Australia from any more interference by the Government in the commercial affairs of the community! Nothing more destructive of trade and business, nothing more obstructive of the development of the interests of Australia, nothing more damaging to the resources of the country has [502] happened during our life time, or during the period of Federation, than the operations of the War Precautions Act. Honourable members opposite have not ceased to denounce the obnoxious, irritating, and stupid interferences under the powers of the War Precautions Act regulations with the commercial interests of this country. The honourable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory), for instance, has not failed to denounce the interference under the War Precautions Act with the metal industry, and the honourable member for Henty (Mr Boyd) knows how that Act has affected adversely the shipping interests of the community. There is not an interest connected with trading, producing, or manufacturing that has not suffered, and suffered keenly, under the War Precautions regulations. Yet, we have it clearly and .explicitly stated by the Prime Minister today that all the powers which are sought under the referendum proposals are to continue the War Precautions regulation powers. I hope the business people of Australia understand this; at any rate, I shall do my best to tell them that all the interferences, obstacles, and stupidannoyances they have had to suffer under the War Precautions Act and regulations are to be perpetrated if they vote "" Yes"" for the powers now sought. I am more sure today than I was last' week as to the futility of these powers to advance Australian interests; and my view is confirmed absolutely by what the Prime Minister has told us today. He has said what is absolutely incorrect, namely, that these powers are identical with the powers we sought under the referenda of 1911 and 1913, and the referendum proposals of 1915, which were . accepted by the Premiers of the States. The Prime Minister cannot produce a testimony from any Premier in Australia today that will identify the powers under this Bill with those sought under the 1915 proposals. The Prime Minister need not attempt to convince me, and I think he will fail also to convince a large majority of the thinking section of the community, that what he proposes now is on the same lines with what he proposed previously. He has admitted today, in so many words, that he has had to pay a price to get these proposals through, and the price in regard to the monopoly proposals is that a time limit is set to them, and a circumlocutory method is to be adopted before ""we can arrive at what is a monopoly. I ask honourable members opposite to remember that three years is the extreme limit of the life of these powers. I cannot but think of the interference during three years with the commercial interests of the community; of a continuation of the annoyance that the commercial community has suffered under the War Precautions Act; of a continuation of the same strangling, obstructive influences' - against the establishment of new businesses and the opening up of this country in so many different directions which is necessary if we are to meet our obligations. Instead of inducements to the establishment of new industries; instead of encouragement to open up the country by means of development so as to provide employment and increase our production, so that we may be able to meet our increased ""financial obligations caused through the war, we have proposals to continue this unwise interference for three years. One wonders really if it sible to get honourable members to look at this matter from an Australian point of view, instead of a party political point of view. There is not an honourable member here who understands anything at all about business, who understands how destructive any interference by Government officials can be in the course of business, who does not realise that no man or body of men would deliberately invest money in enterprises in this country if he or they were to be subject to the exercise of powers under this measure. Instead of there being any encouragement offered under this Bill, it . wall have exactly the opposite effect. We have only to advertise to the world that any person who desires to establish a business in this country will be subject to the continuance of the War Precautions regulations-whic h the Prime Minister says is the object of this Bill-and the door will be closed to all fresh commercial enterprises.",47
202,Mr BOYD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,But what would have happened if your proposals had been given effect to?,48
203,Mr FINLAYSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATIO N,"In 1915, we proposed to establish the right of the Commonwealth to have a companies law. Mr. Hughes had sadd that State laws were ineffective, because they could only deal with companies operating, within the borders of those-States. He' had pointed out that the Commonwealth possessed no power under the Constitution to enact a companies law. That was clear from a decision of the High Court. We proposed that the Commonwealth should secure the right to have a companies law of its own, and that, under that law, the Commonwealth should be able to deal, not only with the operations, but with the creation of any company. My objection to the Constitution Alteration (Legislative Powers) Bill at this juncture is due to the elimination of the power whereby we sought to control the creation of companies in Australia. Here we are facing .an entirely different aspect of the matter under the Constitution Alteration (Nationalization of Monopolies)' Bill; and the Prime Minister says he recommends Parliament to accept this limitation, namely, that for three years the control shall continue, whereupon all the arrangements then in operation are automatically to go by the is posboard. What encouragement is there now for any one to launch into commercial enterprises 'under these powers? Here is the certainty that their operations will be continually obstructed. Those of us 'who . have had a little experience in business know that, under such powers as are proposed in this Bill, if they are to be operated along the same channels as during the past four yearsthe period of operation of the War Precautions Act-n o expansion of our commercial life could be possible. We could not hope to see freshcapital introduced to this country ; indeed, there would be a tightening of established developmental work in Australia. Australians, and intending Australians, will not enter upon operations if they know that powers have - been granted which may have the effect at the end of three years of compelling all those operations to 'cease, according to the decision of the Convention - I shall advise my constituents to refuse these powers to the Government, and to accept the alternative proposals of the Labour party-proposal s which will give some guarantee that, not temporarily, but permanently, we' shall control the most vital interests of the Commonwealth. What twaddle it is to hear the Government talking of t'he urgent necessity for developing the country! How can they expect to see any considerable development when their vision cart carry them forward for only three years? Their ideasof setting. Australia upon an era of enhanced progress .are bounded by a period of three years. They can see no further. The Labour party have a wider vision.
