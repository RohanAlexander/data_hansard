Mr EDWARDS ' presented a petition from certain arrowroot growers and manufacturers, and certain corn-flour manufacturers, in the Albert district, Queensland, praying the House to take into favourable consideration, when revising the Tariff, their request for an increased duty on arrowroot and com flour. Petition received and read. PAPERS. Mr Mauger laid upon the table the following' papers:'Papers relating to the Establishment of the Central Meteorological - Bureau in 'Melbourne. Return showing the names of all persons temporarily employed in trie Public Service during the year 1906-7, their periods of employment, and the remuneration paid to them. INTRODUCTION OF THE TARIFF Ms. KNOX - In view of the large withdrawals from bond which are now taking place, I wish to know from the Treasurer if he can inform the House of the approximate date on which the Tariff proposals will be brought forward?",14
1,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"If I were to answer that question, it would cause more withdrawals. Some of those who are now withdrawing are ""barking up the wrong tree,"" their action being altogether a speculative one. I cannot give any indication as to when I intend to bring forward the new Tariff; I do not think that ray colleagues know when it will be brought forward. PERSONAL EXPLANATION.",14
2,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Swan) [2.37] I desire to make a - personal explanation. In a leading article in this morning's issue of the Age newspaper appear these words, in reference to myselfIn some of his recent utterances he has ridiculed the need of Tariff reform as aid to any Australian industries. That statement is absolutely incorrect. The ' words attributed to me are foreign to my political thought, contradicting my whole political life, and I have never used them: I hope that this great organ of public use-, fulness will take an"", early opportunity to admit its mistake. In Western Australia. I supported protection to local productions and industries for many years, in opposition to tens of thousands of persons who, coming from Victoria and the other States, were in many cases protectionists, but changed .their views, and became free traders, when they found the changed conditions existing on the gold-fields. If I were to leave this statement unchallenged, it might convey a wrong impression to the people in the other States of the Commonwealth as to my way of thinking on fiscal matters. The statement is absolutely without foundation, and is not based upon any utterance, recent or otherwise, of mine. COMMONWEALTH MAIL BOATS. STATE IMPORTS.",14
3,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"the Acting Prime Minister, upon notice Whether he will communicate with the Governments of the States, and inquire whether, if the Commonwealth Government should decide to run a Federal line of mail boats, they will give the fleet the first call in the matter of State importations, as Queensland does today to the Orient Steam-ship Navigation Company and New Zealand does to the company that it subsidizes for mail purposes?",15
4,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as followsIn view of tenders having been invited for a mail service, it is not considered desirable to take the action suggested. STATE EXPORT SUBSIDIES.",15
5,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"the Attorney General, upon noticeIs it contrary to the Commonwealth Constitution for a State to subsidize vessels in order to encourage the carrying of that State's products to ports outside the Commonwealth?",15
6,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The question is not, I think, of a kind which is usually answered by Ministers. It is a question of my personal opinion on a matter of constitutional law, and not as to any official knowledge ot official intentions which it is desired to have communicated to the House. Under the circumstances, therefore, I think it would be opposed to well-established parliamentary practice to offer my personal views .on the question submitted by the honourable member. I would refer the honourable member to May's Parliamentary Practice, ioth edition, page 237 ; and to Bourinot's Parliamentary Procedure, 3rd edition, page 435, where it is said, "" Nor are questions usually put on ""matters which are at the time the subject of proceedings in the Courts or which involve a question of law."" I refer him also to an answer by Mr. Attorney-General Isaacs, Parliamentary Debates, Vol. xxv., page 469. POSTAL VOTES.",15
7,Mr JOHN THOMSON,Unknown,"the Minister of Home Affairs, upon notice Whether, in view of distance, and the time required by many electors to communicate with divisional returning officer, he will amend the regulations governing the issue of postal votes so as to provide that postal votes may also be obtained on application to electoral registrars?",15
8,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows :The difficulties referred to have been recognised, and the remedying of the same is under the consideration of this Department. It is hoped that a clause will be inserted in the Amending Bill making provision to meet the case NA TELEGRAPH MESSENGERS.",15
9,Mr TUDOR,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"the Postmaster General, upon notice I. Whether the Department has found out that telegraph messengers and other boys were delivering letters instead of letter-carriers in many places in Victoria? 2. If soj in how many places has this practice been found to be in existence?",15
10,Mr MAUGER,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"The following answer has been supplied to me:1 and 2. Only one case has been found in Victoria where a messenger had been employed inadvertently to relieve a letter-carrier, but, in some instances, both in Victoria and throughout the Commonwealth, messengers deliver a few letters and other articles at places where the employment of letter-carriers for this purpose would not be warranted, and, as far as possible, this duty is confined to senior messengers, who are thus trained for promotion to letter-carriers. BOUNTIES BILL. In Committee (Consideration resumed from 30th July, vide page 1129): First schedule (vide page 1062): ItemPalm fruit, 15 years, 15 per cent, on market value, £3,000.",15
11,Mr WILSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Corangamite) [2.43]' The sum involved in this proposal aggregates £45,000; but so far as I can see, the prospect of palm growing to supply material for the manufacture of oil becoming an industry of value to Australia is very remote, and does not justifv the proposed encouragement. I therefore move That Uie item be left out.",15
12,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Darling Downs^-Attorney-General) [2.45] - I hope that the honourable member will not press his amendment. Palm oil is another of those commodities which can be produced with advantage in the northern parts of Australia, and in a scheme of bounties of this descrip- expended. tion, our desire is to encourage as much as possible the cultivation of products which will tend to the closer settlement of the northern portions of our continent with a white population. It has been pointed out by the honourable member for Parramatta, amongst others, that if we are justified authorizing the payment of a bounty upon any products, it is upon those products that will tend to the development of the Northern Territory.",16
13,Mr WILSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,What are the prospects of the palm fruit?,16
14,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"They seem to be good. If the honourable member will look at the report of the State agricultural experts, be will see that palm oil is a valuable commodity. The palm itself will flourish in the Northern Territory, as well as. in Queensland and the northern parts of Western Australia. It would, be valuable, not only in our own markets, but for export purposes.",16
15,Mr WILSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Coul d we possibly compete for export purposes with the palm oil which is manufactured in black-labour countries ?,16
16,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"I think so, because the oil palm does not require very much cultivation.",16
17,Mr BATCHELOR,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Is such a heavy bounty as is proposed required-?,16
18,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"I ask honourable members to retain the bounty proposed. If the oil is not produced in sufficient quantity, the money will be available for other purposes, or else it will not be expended.",16
19,Mr WILSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,What is the quantity of palm oil importedinto the Commonwealth annually ?,16
20,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,I do not think I can suppy that information. The returns have not been separately kept.,16
21,Mr MCWILLIAMS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,It is very small.,16
22,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"At the same time there is a possibility of our producing palm oil for export purposes-. We must also recollect that this commodity is used in our soapmaking establishments, an industry in which we hope to witness a considerable expansion in the near future.",16
23,Mr WILSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,It is not to be compared with copra.,16
24,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"But it is. a valuable commodity in. itself. If the industry, is not carried on. to the extent, that we anticipate the money voted for the bounty will not be",16
25,Mr WILSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Pal m oil is principally used in the manufacture of margarine as a substitute for butter.,16
26,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,It is also used extensively in the manufacture of soap. I am satisfied that the bounty will confer a great in benefit upon the northern parts of Australia.,16
27,Mr WILSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,We do not want any sham butter manufactured here.,16
28,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Certainl y not. I believe that the Butter Bill which was recently introduced into the Imperial Parliament is intended to prevent the adulteration of that article.,16
29,Mr WILSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"We do not want to manufacture, palm oil with which to adulterate products abroad.",16
30,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,The fact that an article may be used for improper purposes is not a sufficient reason (why we should abstain fiom encouraging its production.,16
31,Mr WILSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Othe r oils are infinitely superior for soap-manufacturing purposes.,16
32,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,I ask honourable members to retain the item on account of the prospective value of the bounty to the northern portions of Australia.,16
33,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Parramatta) [2.50] - I have listened very attentively to the Attorney-General in the hope that I. might hear some justification for the retention of this item. But he has said practically nothing. He has merely expressed the hope that the Committee will agree to it upon the off-chance that the money so voted may be expended upon the encouragement of other commodities. Personally, I hope that the item will be eliminated in the interests of the Bill itself. Any honourable member who wishes well to an earnest effort to establish our tropical industries, whether for the purpose of peopling the far north or for the sake of the industries themselves, will promptly assist in deleting from the schedule all such items as this. We know absolutely nothing about palm oil. Even the State agricultural experts tell us nothing about it. The experts whom we have called into guide us in these matters do not even know what is the price of the article. I will undertake to say that if a stranger were to enter this Chamber without knowing the antecedents of this measure, and listen to the reasons advanced by honourable members for voting away the taxpayers' money in this wholesale fashion, he would think that we were madmen. No reason has been adduced for the retention of the item, either by the Attorney-General or the experts. They merely express the pious hope that we shall afford palm oil the encouragement proposed for fifteen years.",16
34,Mr WILSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"We are asked to sanction the payment of a bounty of £3,000 annually for fifteen years- a total of £45,000.",17
35,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"I suppose the Government argue that the amount is not large, and 'that it is not our money. ""Why,"" they ask', ""should we not .throw a little of it away ?"" Hundreds of thousands of pounds have been thrown away by this Parliament. Why not get rid of a little more? That seems to be the argument which is applied to many of these proposals. I trust that the Committee will eliminate the item under consideration. ' Mr KELLY (Wentworth) [2.53] - I ask the Attorney-General to agree to postpone the consideration of this item till after the Tariff has been disposed of. Upon looking at the existing Tariff, I find that palm oil is already protected to an enormous extent. Prom the report of the State agricultural experts, I learn that the value of Lagos oil, which is, I understand, the best palm oil, at Marseilles, is 2s. per gallon. Under the existing Tariff a duty of is. 4d. per gallon is levied upon that commodity, so that it is already protected to the extent of 66 per cent. If a protective duty of 66 per cent, will not start the industry in Australia, how can the paltry expenditure of £3,000 per annum be expected to establish it? MT. WILSON - Paltr y expenditure?",17
36,Mr KELLY,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"I admit that it is too large an amount to waste, but it is, nevertheless, too little to successfully start an industry.",17
37,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,It will not be wasted 'if it is not expended - It is readily,17
38,Mr KELLY,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"If it is expended at all it will be in the manufacture of margarine. In these days, when we pay so much attention to pure foods, why should ive offer a bounty for the production' of an article which will afterwards be used in the manufacture of margarine? I find that the State agricultural experts advise that a bounty of 15 per cent, be granted to encourage the production of palm oil for a period of ten years. But the Government proposal is that the bounty shall be operative for fifteen years.",17
39,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"In the earlier part of the report by the experts there, is a general recommendation that the bounty should operate for fifteen years.",17
40,Mr KELLY,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"There is a side-note "" Bonus '- upon page 21 of their report",17
41,Mr BATCHELOR,LETTER DELIVERY BY,There is a paragraph following that.,17
42,Mr KELLY,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"I have noticed that paragraph. But 1 would ask the honourable member what is the meaning of the following sentenceIt is, therefore, recommended that a bonus of 15 per cent, be given for ten years upon the production of fruit for palm oil.",17
43,Mr HUTCHISON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,That was the old recommendation.,17
44,Mr KELLY,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Does the honourable member suggest that there are two sentences of the report which are entirely contradictory ot each other? - Mr HUTCHISON - Yes .,17
45,Mr KELLY,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Then what is the use of this Committee acting upon a report the recommendations of which are so opposed toeach other?,17
46,Mr BATCHELOR,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"On e is in the natureof a recommendation, and the other is merely advisory.",17
47,Mr KELLY,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"I have already quoted the "" recommendation "" of the experts 1 It seems to me that we have about reached the summit of Gilbertian humour if we accept areport of this character in all seriousness. We might well save £3,000 annually of the taxpayers' money by omitting the item it that the chief object of the Government,, in submitting this Bill, is to encourage the establishment of industries which will have a reasonable chance of proving profitable undertakings in the future. I learn from the report of the State experts that the oil palm requires five or six years to mature,, and thatcultivated in the tropics of. the Commonwealth, and, like the cocoanut palm, prefers coastal regions. The returns per acreare difficult to ascertain, as also the value of the o i l , with any degree of authority. It is-, quoted, however, 'as producing 1S0 to 200 lbs. of oil per acre, worth about £ 2 5 per ton. I would point out that, upon that basis, from £ 2 ios. to £ 3 per acre would represent the maximum return to be derivecT from this commodity. Let honourable members reflect' upon' the inducement that it is proposed to offer to men to undertake the workof planting. They would have to wait five or six years to get a return of £ 3 per acre. Surely there are plenty of more profitable productions to which we can direct our attention. If we are going to sanction the payment of bounties, let us confine them to industries which have a reasonable prospect of success. We can secure a larger return than £ 3 per acre from scores of commodities. If the Government have no better proposal than this to put forward ",17
48,Mr WILSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"They propose to grant a bounty for the production of peanuts next.  to obtain a worse return from the production of peanuts the outlook would be a sorry one. In my opinion, the proposal which we discussed yesterday was preferable to this one. Certainly we should derive better returns from the breeding of Angora goats than we should from the production of palm oil. I merely wish to draw the Attorney-General's attention to the character of the industry which it is proposed to establish.",18
49,Mr ARCHER,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Capricornia) [2.57I Upon this item I take up the attitude which I indicated in my second-reading speech upon the Bill. Speaiking as one who wishes well to the principle to which the measure is intended to give effect, I say that it would be entirely in the interests of the Bill itself to eliminate not only this item, but several others specified ini the schedule, and to devote the money which it is proposed to expend upon them to the encouragement of industries which Have a reasonable chance of succeeding. We ought to offer a bounty only upon commodities the production of which will eventually have some chance of attaining the dimensions of a great industry. I need scarcely point out that the land, the cultivation of which the bounty upon palm oil is intended to stimulate, could be far more profitably put under a crop of some other kind. In my opinion, it would be better to eliminate this item, and to utilize in developing the cotton industry the money proposed to be expended in respect of it.",18
50,Mr BATCHELOR,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Boothby) [3.0] I do not think that the Ministry should complain if honourable members refuse to support this bounty, since the information submitted with regard to it is exceedingly scanty. The report of the experts does not indicate whether there is 'a reasonable prospect of a profitable industry being established as the result of the bounty. Assuming that the high prices now ruling continue, the return will be only £ 3 per acre, and an industry that will yield so poor a return is an insignificant one.",18
51,Mr REID,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Thos e who planted these palms would have to wait five years before securing any return.,18
52,Mr BATCHELOR,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"That is so. It is improbable that anything like an expenditure of £3,000 per annum for a period of fifteen years is necessary in connection with such an industry. If there were any possibility of a profitable industry being established as the result of the passing of the item, I should be prepared to support it, but we have no satisfactory information to guide us. A bounty for the encouragement of wattle-growing would be a more reasonable proposal. If wattle seed be scattered broadcast, and the areas so treated fenced off from sheep, at the end of five years an annual return far greater than could be obtained from this industry is secured. . The prospects of success in this case are too. remote to justify the passing of the item.",18
53,Mr WILSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Corangamite) [3.3] - I wish to emphasize the point that this item has an important bearing upon the producing interests of Australia. Palm oil, if produced in Australia, would be exported, but under the Pure Foods Act recently passed by the Imperial Parliament it could not be used as heretofore in the production of margarine, and consequently the prices obtainable would be seriously reduced. In these circumstances the oil would be shipped to the Continent, where it would be used in the manufacture of margarine to poison the poorest classes of the community.",18
54,Mr THOMAS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,It would also compete with our own exports of butter.,18
55,Mr WILSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"That is so. I hope that the item will be rejected. ' Amendment agreed to; item negatived. ItemPeanuts^ 5 years, 15 per cent, on market value, £5,000.",18
56,Mr WILSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Corangamite) [3.4]-- I hope that the Minister will allow this item to share the fate of that relating to palm fruit. I am inclined to think that its inclusion in the schedule was due to a desire on the part of the Minister of Defence that peanuts should be used as bullets in connection with the future defence o\f"" Australia. All the evidence we. have as to the growth of peanuts shows that the industry is of very little value, arid that their cultivation is somewhat of a nuisance. Peanuts were grown some years ago in New South Wales.",18
57,Mr ARCHER,LETTER DELIVERY BY,They are still grown in Queensland.,19
58,Mr WILSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"I believe that they are. Peanuts, which are crushed and used in the production of China oil, are produced largely in China, where the labour is cheap, and there is no. justification for the proposal that we should expend £5,000 per annum for a period of five years to establish such an. industry in the Commonwealth. China oil is used to only a limited extent in Australia, and in the circumstances I move That the item be left out.",19
59,Mr HUTCHISON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Hindmarsh) [3.5]. - This item should be struck out for precisely the same reason that led honourable members to reject the proposed bounty on olives, namely, that the industry is already established. The report of the experts shows that a considerable area in Australia is now being devoted to the cultivation of peanuts, and that being so the industry must be well established. cording to the report-and my own personal knowledge confirms .the statement-pea nuts are readily cultivated, andIn the Northern Territory one acre of ground produced 26 cwt. of peanuts. Valuing the crop at £20 a ton-whic h is not a high averagethis return shows a cash value of £ 2 6 per An industry that yields such a magnificent return should require no assistance at the hands of the State. As a matter of fact, peanuts can be grown almost anywhere. Their cultivation is easy,* and the process of harvesting is very simple. therefore, that we shall not waste any more time in discussing this item.",19
60,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Darling Downs-Attorney General) [3.7] - I appeal fo the Committee not to reject this item. China oil which is produced from peanuts is largely used in the Commonwealth, the imports for 1906 totalling no less than 144,196 gallons. Australia is admirably suited to the production of peanuts.",19
61,Mr HUTCHISON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Is not a return of £ 2 6 per acre a very handsome one?,19
62,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,It is.,19
63,Mr ARCHER,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Peanut s are being grown at the present time in Australia.,19
64,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,But not for industrial purposes.,19
65,Mr ARCHER,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"They would be if their cultivation, were payable.",19
66,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"As the honourable member pointed out in his valuable contribution to the debate on the motion for the second reading of the Bill, these bounties are intended in some cases to tide new industries over their experimental stages. The intention is that peanuts shall be grown for the manufacture of China o i l ; but at present they are not devoted to that purpose in Australia.'",19
67,Mr ARCHER,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Why not?,19
68,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Because there has been on the part of our producers a want of knowledge of the industry, and a want of appreciation of the market for China oil within our own Continent. Many industries are not flourishing simply because the people of Australia as a whole do not recognise their value ",19
69,Mr MCWILLIAMS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Because our producers find other crops more payable.,19
70,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"They may be growing that which for the time being is more profitable, but there are many industries to which they might turn with advantage.",19
71,Mr ARCHER,LETTER DELIVERY BY,That is why we need a Ac- Federal Bureau of Agriculture.,19
72,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"The honourable membeF is quite right. The States Departments of Agriculture have been endeavouring to show the people the value of many new industries, and our desire is to let it be known all over Australia that the cultivaacre. tion of peanuts is a profitable undertaking, and that the by-product is exceedingly valuable-as fodder.",19
73,Mr MCWILLIAMS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,What does the report say on that point?,19
74,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"We have in the report I hope, of the experts, the statement thatIn addition to its value as a source of oil, the peanut is probably the - most concentrated vegetable food in existence. I hope, therefore, that honourable members will recognise that the industry is worthy of encouragement. A country which depends so largely upon its live stock ought certainly to endeavour to encourage the' growth of foods for stock. I am sure that if honourable members studyl this report they will arrive at the conclusion that the production of peanuts will be of great advantage to the northern parts of Australia, and that they will agree to the item.",19
75,Mr HEDGES,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Fremantle) [3.12] The time of the Committee should not be occupied in debating such a trivial question as this. The remarks made by the Attorney-General in support of the retention of the item remind me of the story of a great American humorist who, yielding' to a request that he should conduct an agricultural newspaper, published as one of the chief items in his first issue the statement that those who .planted pumpkins should be careful not to put more than one in each hole, and also advised that when gathering turnips care should be taken not to shake the trees. It seems to me that we are being called upon to submit to a lot of advice which comes within this category. I would ask honourable members not to agree to the granting of a bounty for the encouragement of such a trivial industry as the production of peanuts.  cording to the report of the experts, the value of the importations of China oil into Australia, in 1906, was £19,513The bounty payable in respect of peanuts would amount in five years to £25,000, or more than the total value of the China oil consumed in the Commonwealth in one year. In these circumstances, I do not think, that we should hesitate to reject this item.",19
76,Mr REID,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"East Sydney) [3.15] - I ""would ask the Attorney-General to give way to the request of honourable members, and to take a stand on the next item, "" Sunflower seed."" Amendment agreed to; item negatived. ItemSunflower seed, 5 years, 16 per cent, on market value, £2,000.",20
77,Mr WILSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Corangamite) [3.15] The same arguments which have been applied to palm oil apply to this item, and I therefore beg to move That the item be left out. In the present state of ourfinanceswe have no money to waste in this way. flowers have been grown for many years, and I believe that on one occasion in Victoria their production was encouraged by a bounty, with the net result of showing that sunflowers for seed are not worth growing. They are, I believe, good to feed chickens on, but even chickens will not always eat them, though my experience is that other birds are swift to pick the seeds before, the latter can be put to any use. The Ministry would seem to have been very hard up for products on which to. give bounties when they included some of these items. - Mr GROOM (Darling Downs-Attorney General) [3.17] - On these items I really thought, that I could have relied on the support of protectionist members, though, at the same time, I admit that these are matters on which honourable members have a right to express their individual opinions, looking at the matter from a business standpoint. My own opinion is that many of these items ought to be retained; but I - realise that the sense of the Committee is against me, and I shall not therefore press this item to a division.",20
78,Mr REID,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"East Sydney) [3.18] - I cannot understand the action of the Attorney General in retreating immediately he gets a knock or two, considering that he regards these as a series of great national industries. I had not the advantage of hearing the Attorney-General when - he moved the second reading of the Bill, and I cannot truthfully say that I read a. report of his speech in Hansard. I am. sure, however, that the honourable and. learned member, in introducing these items, which represent over, half a million sterling, pointed out that by adopting them, we: should establish in Australia, specially in its tropical and sub-tropical parts, a series of great national industries. But,, one after another, he is surrendering the items to an. opposition which seems to strike him with astonishment.. He asked, in. effect, "" Where, are the protectionists of Australia""? Here are magnificent industries which, it is said, can be planted by the expenditure of. a few thousands a year, and which would give employment to thousands and hundreds of thousands of settlers in the Northern Territory, where we particularly desire to organize for the purposes of defence. What does the surrender by the Attorney-General mean? 'The only virile element of the Cabinet has left it. When we had the late Treasurer in office we had a gentleman Sun- who could put up a fight when occasion required ; but now that' he has resigned we find, on the very next day, that in spite of extraordinary provocation, there is not the least suspicion of complaint in the vertebrate organization of the Government. In the report of the experts relating to this item, we find, it stated- . . Sunflower oil is obtained from the seed of the annual Helianthus annus and another species of the same family. Mr David Jones, of the Queensland Agricultural Department, in the course of an interview at Roma, reported in the Western Star, of 20th February, ^07, spoke favourably of two plots of sunflower wjiich he saw at Bell and Pickauflunie (five acres and ' twelve acres respectively), and said that the oilproducing seed, when more experience is to hand regarding cultivation and harvesting the crop, will, in all probability, be another valuable addition to the products of the district. Sunflowers may be grown in all climates able for maize, and with greater success on comparatively poor 'soil. . . . It is a crop very well adapted to the conditions of pioneer settlement in forest country. A clearing, however small, may be at once utilized .for growing sunflowers. Let us look at the problems which face a man who is cutting down forests. Here in the sunflower is promised an immediate return-h e can almost immediately convert the forest into growths of these flowers; and I think that such a man ought to have such an inducement as the 'Bill offers. The report goes onAnother advantage is that in out of the way places the crop does not suffer when nearly ripe from the depredations of sparrows and other birds, which constitutes one of the chief factors of loss in the old settled districts. It is the giant Russian sunflower that is more specially recommended. The cost of cultivation, harvesting, threshing and marketing is JQI 7s. per ton, and the average yield per acre is 50 bushels, producing 40 to 50 per cent, of oil. The price per ton is, £14, and the. gross return per acre £ 1 4 , leaving a net return per acre of £ 1 2 13s. Is that not a magnificent return?"" The sunflower does not require twenty years to mature, but can be grown easily, and yields an enormous and almost immediate return, with a profit of £ 1 2 13s. per ton. There is an element of great disappointment in this proposal. There are people now engaged in cultivating the sunflower; at any rate, in various gardens I have seen beautiful plots of the flowers. In my opinion, there is danger here, because I understand that the sunflowers have to be sent to a factory before the bounty can be earned. What will the grower of the sunflower do if he raises his crop and there is no factory to which to send it?",20
79,Mr WILSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,What chance has the man in a forest clearing of supplying a factory ?,21
80,Mr REID,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Peopl e might clear all the forests of Australia and plant sunflowers; but what would be the good if there were no factories? I hope that the leader of the Labour Party will come to the rescue of the Government. Is the honourable member going to allow this sort of thing to go on? He is generally the chief insurance of the Government; and is he going to allow Ministers to be trampled on in this way ? Is he going to allow this great industry of the sunflower to be trampled upon by a number of gentlemen who have forsuit- gotten their protectionist creed, and by a Minister who has not the pluck to stand up for a flower which might shed beauty over the whole surface of .the Australian desert, and make even the transcontinental railway an assured success. Why should we allow this spineless conduct on the part of the Ministry ? I shall insist on a division.",21
81,Mr WILKS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Dalley) [3.25] - When speaking oh the second reading I prophesied that when we reached the schedule, industries which had friends would be de-fended while industries which had no friends would be allowed to "" go by the board "" ; and apparently the latter is to be the fate of many of the items. When the leader of the Opposition expressed the hope that the Attorney-General would make a stand on this item, that, of course, was an invitation to him not to make a stand ; and although the honourable gentleman called upon, his protectionist friends to assist him, he is now prepared to abandon the item. Of course, I am glad that by the action, of the Attorney-General a sum of £10,000 will be saved; but I am surprised that such an aesthetic young, gentleman as he is, and so much resemblingi as he does, Bunthorne, of Patience celebrity, should have deserted the sunflower. It is remarkable that the Government should endeavour to whip up their protectionist supporters on an item of this character. Only the colour of the sunflower might furnish a reason for my voting for the item, but even that colour is not sufficiently attractive to earn my support. There is not a single industry represented in the schedule which could be advocated very strongly on the public platform; and I am glad that the Ministry are awakening to some sense of responsibility, and are prepared to surrender this 'and other items. At the same time, I am sorry for the protectionistsupporters of the Government who have had such a whipping from the Attorney General in connection with the sunflower.",21

On the other hand, there are one or two items which protectionists would desire to see passed; but if the Ministry do not abandon the sunflower gracefully and quickly, I am afraid it may be thought that the whole of the items are "" going by the board."" For instance, the item of wool tops is a most valuable one, and I hope that it will not be swept away. I fancy some aesthetic member of the Ministry must have inserted this item, which is well-known to be the emblem of the sesthetic cult. I feel sure that attention has only to be called to the item to cause the Attorney-General to withdraw it. Amendment agreed to; item negatived. ItemUice, uncleaned, 5 years, 20s. per ton, £1,000.",21
83,Mr JOHNSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Lang) [3.29] move That the item be left out. This is a ridiculous item. The cultivation of rice is a black man's industry, and even the experts' reports offer no great encouragement to its production. statesThe best varieties of rice are grown in swamps or level irrigated ground, and the initial stages of its cultivation are carried out while the land is entirely under water. Where are we to find white men particularly anxious to work for half their lifetime up to their waists in water? The report also statesRice is also grown largely in the swamps of the southern United States. In Australia we are not much troubled with swampy country, and where swamps exist they are limited in area, and so situated not to offer much attraction to white settlement. The report is not encouraging. It continuesComing nearer home, in the Northern tory, near Port Darwin, Messrs. Kloppenburg and Erickson, with the help of aboriginals, 25 years ago, harvested 8 tons of uncleaned rice-swam p variety-fro m 5 acres of land, which represents a gross return of about per acre.

The need of providing work white persons has been specially sized, and that point has been relied on more than any other to secure support these bounty proposals. The last paragraph of the report states that it is open to doubt if the industry can be successfully exploited under Australian conditions-that is to say, under white labour conditions.

I am not prepared to make a suggestion in regard to the rate of bounty per ton, as I do not know much about the industry, but it would be wise to give consideration to the suggestion of the right honourable member for East Sydney, and not only increase the aggregate amount payable, but spread the expenditure over a longer period. It seems to me that more than five years should be allowed for the establishment of this industry, and that a greater sum should be given for its encouragement. Of course, we must remember, as the right honourable member admitted, that it already is protected by a duty, and while that fact mighc well.be allowed to govern the rate of bounty per ton, it should not affect the total grant, or the period during which the bounty would be payable.",23
101,Mr MCWILLIAMS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Franklin) [3.42]. - It is difficult to know the grounds upon which a bounty of this kind is proposed. According to the experts whose opinions we have been asked to consider of value, it is open to doubt if rice can be successfully exploited under Australian conditions.",23
102,Mr REID,LETTER DELIVERY BY,That is an ideal condition for a bounty.,23

A good quantity of rice is also produced by white labour in Northern Italy. The States of America in which rice is grown are:-Nort h and South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, turn than that. and Texas, all within the black belt. The rice produced in Texas is grown in districts wholly within that portion of the country which is largely settled by negroes. Anybody who will take the trouble to study the question will find that the production of rice in the United States is almost exclusively confined to black labour. It is true that a certain quantity is cultivated there by the small farmers, but where its production has attained the dimensions of an industry it is almost entiiely a black labour industry. Further, this commodity is grown there under - the most unhealthy conditions. It is cultivated under similar conditions in Manchuria. The upland rice in Manchuria is grown by the cheapest labour in the world. The State agricultural experts have themselves condemned the proposal to grant a bounty to encourage the production of rice. At the present time a duty of 3s. 4d. per central is levied upon that commodity, and will any honourable member seriously contend that the conditions surrounding Australian labour today are such as to induce the people of the Commonwealth to embarkupon the production of rice as a national industry ? Of course there may be isolated cases in which it may be profitably grown. But what is the return which may be expected from its cultivation? I find that the average yield per acre from the whole of the rice-growing country of the United States is 20 dols., .or approximately £4. I am quoting from the Year-Book of the United States Bureau of Agriculture.",23
106,Mr WATSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,That does not prove that rice cannot be grown successfully by white labour. It merely demonstrates that where cheap labour is available it is produced by means of that labour.,23
107,Mr MCWILLIAMS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,I have given the honourable member the average yield per acre for the whole of the rice-growing country of the United States. That yield indicates what we might hope to obtain in Australia. The swamp country of Louisiana is eminently adapted to the production of rice. It is regarded as the best rice-producing tract in the world. There the average yield per acre is only 20 dols.,23

We know that where we have to employ labour to any extent we cannot produce wheat for anything like that return. Wheat can be profitably grown for such a return only in large open plains and with the aid of the most up-to-date machinery. Taking the yields obtained from rice in the United States, I say that there is not the slightest chance of the industry becoming successful under Australian conditions.",24
112,Mr SAMPSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Would it not be possible to harvest the crop by machinery, and to reduce the cost of cultivation ?",24

121,Mr MCWILLIAMS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"The bounty is necessary in the opinion of the honourable member to establish an industry not be successfully - exploited - without it. It is the same old story of the bounty tem over again. If we retain this item claim that we shall be simply throwing away money in an attempt to establish an industry which is doomed to failure. shall vote against the proposal. - Mr MATHEWS (Melbourne Ports) [3.52] - The honourable member for Franklin has said that the rice industry is entirely a black man's industry. I should like to ask him if the cultivation of - maize, in India and other countries, is not, on the same showing, entirely a black man's industry. Similarly, the market-gardening industry in this country is supposed to be a Chinaman's industry. But we know very well that a white man can produce vegetables profitably without resort Jo the methods which are adopted by the CKinese. As a matter of fact, anybody who has seen what are called the "".paddy, fields "" of Ceylon must have noticed the thus primitive methods of irrigation employed there-method s upon which the white man can improve. Ceylon is undoubtedly a rice where country. The honourable member for Franklin has said that in America this commodity will yield a return of only £ 4 per and he affirmed that while it pay to produce wheat for that price, it would not pay to grow rice. I fail to why it would not'. To my mind, there is no reason why the production of rice should not be encouraged in Australia. We have heard a good deal recently in connection with the starch trade and the imreportation of rice. To encourage the manufacture of starch, after providing for the payment of a decent wage to the employees, irriwe should certainly foster the pioductiou of the raw material. Much has been said about an inferior quality of rice, but I would point out that such rice might very well be used in the starch trade. It seems to me that all industries which a progressive people desire to encourage are alleged which to have some drawback associated with We them by those who are opposed to their If a commodity is proby black labour under certain conditions they refuse to believe that it can be doubt successfully produced by white labour,, as was the case in the sugar industry. But, just as sugar has been produced by white labour in Australia, so will rice be similarly produced. I intend to support the; item, because I believe that die industry can be made a profitable one, even if it which canreturns only £ 4 per acre.",24
122,Mr WILKS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Dalley) [3.55] - The honsysorable . member for Franklin has emphaI sized certain facts which no doubt will induce honourable members to vote against this item. I do not intend to repeat the arguI ments which he has advanced. It is admitted that it would be only.the poorest - class of labour which would be employed in the production of rice. It has been said by some of the supporters of the Government proposal that its adoption would lead 'to the employment of the aborigines. That in itself is an admission that the industry would not be carried on under standard - conditions. With regard to the production >of rice, I would point out that that commodity is consumed by all classes. It is, perhaps, the most healthy article of diet that we can obtain. If I thought that the - operation of the bounty proposed would result in the production of ai better quality - of rice, or in a cheaper article, I would be inclined to support it. But nobody can - seriously contend that the sum of £ 1 , 0 0 0 annually-whic h will cover an output of - only 1,000 tons of rice-is likely to stimulate the production of that commodity. What is a thousand tons compared with the total consumption of rice in Australia? It is infinitesimal. I ask the Attorney-General whether the sum of £ 1 , 0 0 0 is not a' scanty allowance in this - case? Both the leader of the Opposition and the leader of the Labour Party have admitted that it is. That being the case, it will be only five years before those who have been induced by the promise of a bounty to embark upon the industry will be pleading for an extension of the term during which it shall operate. Then, others who have engaged in other enterprises will also come forward and urge Parliament to grant them a similar extension. That is an evil which we have to guard against. Consequently, I ask whether the operation of the bounty is positively to be limited to five years. The Attorney-General was very cute in appealing to the leader of the Opposition to support the item. He spoke of that honourable gentleman's work in Queensland. There is no doubt that the right honourable member for East Sydney accomplished good work there. Only one representative of that State occupied a seat upon this side of the Chamber during the last Parliament, whereas four of its representatives now sit in opposition to the Government. I can understand that the rice industry, if established - in Australia, would particularly benefit Queensland.",24
123,Mr EDWARDS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Not altogether.,25
124,Mr WILKS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"I recognise that the honbe called upon to bear. orable member is a broad minded marr, that as such he is prepared to support item.

125,Mr EDWARDS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,I would support the honourable member.,25
126,Mr WILKS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"We find that every honourable member, whether he is a free-trader or a protectionist, is prepared to fight for that which is of advantage to his own electorate or to the State of which he is a representative. . Industries that have no friends in the House cam secure no encouragement.

127,Mr MCWILLIAMS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"We can grow sunflowers, but not rice.",25
128,Mr WILKS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"I know nothing about that, but I would remind honourable members that the importations of rice into Aus^ tralia constitute a considerable source of revenue. I do not think that any commodity of general consumption - should be heavily taxed.",25

138,Mr WILKS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"I am aware of that, and I dare say that when the new Tariff resolutions are submitted, we shall find the Government asking for miuch higher duties than they hope to secure. The duty on rice is a little more than the people should The honourable and member for Melbourne Ports made a good this point when he referred to the question of The evidence given before Mr . Justice Hood in regard to the wages paid in the starch, industry-a n industry which is associated with rice production-doe s not give us much encouragement to support such a proposal as this. The amount proposed to be.paid by way of bounty on the production of rice could be devoted with greater advantage to the up-building of the iron industry, and I trust that this item will be rejected.",25
139,Mr BAMFORD,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Herbert) [4.5] - In reply to the honourable member for Dalley, who has just stated that every representative of Queensland will support this item, I . desire to say that, although I am a representative of that State, and rice has been grown in my electorate, I do not see my way to support this bounty. Like the honourable member for Bland and the leader of the Opposition, I think that the amount proposed to be appropriated for this purpose is so paltry as to be unworthy of consideration. It is. ridiculous to suggest that so small a bounty would encourage the production of thousands of tons of rice. The honourable member for Lang has referred to the statement in the report that 8 tons of uncleaned rice were produced in the Northern Territory some years ago. Although I have not the statistics at hand, I am able to say that prior to Federation we produced a fairly large quantity of . rice in Queensland. Shortly before the establishmentof the Commonwealth, however, the production of rice there fell away considerably. was due, not to the Federal Tariff, but to other causes'.",26
140,Colonel FOXTON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,What were causes ?,26
141,Mr BAMFORD,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"I believe that it was found in the first place that it was not a profitable crop, and that some of the land that had been devoted to its cultivation could be used to greater advantage in the production of other crops. Although some rice was grown in swampy land, some, I believe, was produced on hill country, and at a place called Strathford, 5 miles from Cairns, a mill for the hulling and cleaning of rice was established. The rice treated there met with a good reception on the market, and realized satisfactory prices, but, nevertheless, as I have stated, its production fell away considerably.",26
142,Mr MCWILLIAMS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Was any grown by Europeans?,26
143,Mr BAMFORD,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Not to my knowledge, and I do not think that this bounty would induce Europeans to take up its cultivation. The proposal is so paltry that I do not think it would induce any one to devote to rice cultivation land that is capable of growing more profitable products. There is not a very large area of swamp land available in' the semi-tropical regions. Mr ' WATSON - There is plenty in the Northern Territory.",26
144,Mr BAMFORD,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"There may be, but even assuming that rice can be profitably grown there, I do not think this bounty would lead to the establishment of the industry in the Northern Territory.",26
145,Mr WATSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,It is not large enough.,26
146,Mr BAMFORD,LETTER DELIVERY BY,That is so. I do not know who was responsible for the amount of the proposed bounty.,26
147,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,It was recommended by the experts.,26
148,Mr REID,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Surely the Ministry would not be guided solely by the experts in determining the amount of a bounty.,26
149,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Not altogether.,26
150,Mr BAMFORD,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"At . all events, the amount proposed to be set apart for this purpose is so paltry that I cannot support the item. If the Government were prepared to propose that at least £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 should be devoted to the encouragement of the industry, I should be inclined to consider such a proposition, but I shall vote This against that now before us.",26
151,Mr HANS IRVINE,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Grampians) [4.9]. - The proposal to encourage the local those production of rice is a good one, but the Minister should be prepared to agree to at least £ 5 , 0 0 0 per annum being devoted to this object for a period of ten years. It is absurd to suggest that a bounty of£ 1 , 0 0 0 per annum for five years is sufficient. The proposals in regard to bounties on the production of palm fruit, sun-flower seed, and other materials used for the production of oil, were ridiculous, and' when the Minister said that he expected the protectionists in the Opposition corner to support him in his efforts to establish these industries, he seemed to lose sight of the fact that our primary duty is to' protect the public purse. In moving that the Bil l be read a second time, the At torney-General practically said that we should have to agree to the Bil l as it of it stood, or reject it .",26
152,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,No .,26
153,Mr HANS IRVINE,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"When the honourable and learned gentleman was speaking, I pointed out to him that that was practically the effect of one of his statements.",27
154,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,I said that I wished to carry the Bill.,27
155,Mr HANS IRVINE,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"The Government could not have given any consideration to this proposal. The establishment of the industry is a matter of national concern, for rice cultivation in Australia should in time become as important as is the production of wheat. From the remarks made by the honourable member for Franklin, who appeared to pose as an expert",27
156,Mr MCWILLIAMS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,No .,27
157,Mr HANS IRVINE,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"The remarks of the honourable member led me to believe that, like members of the Conference of experts, he. was an expert only in theory. I have had the pleasure of coming in contact with two or three gentlemen who are thoroughly familiar with rice cultivation, and I have also seen rice growing in northern Italy, as well as in America. Whilst I do not pretend to be an expert, I know something of what I am talking, and have no hesitation in saying that the industry is one _ that, under existing conditions, and carried on by white labour, would yield returns twice as large as those obtained from the cultivation of wheat. that in Queensland they have had yields of rice equal to 60 bushels per acre, and that two crops instead of one can be obtained every year. That being so, honourable members ought to recognise that the industry is worthy of special consideration. We should not lose sight of the fact that it would give employment to a large number of persons. The proposals made by the Government in regard to a bounty on peanuts, &c, and several other items in the schedule are a disgrace to Ministers, and should not have been introduced. We are here not to waste public money, but to protect the taxpayers, and it cannot be denied that some of the items in this schedule would involve an absolute - waste of public money. While the Government might well give special attention to the growth of fibrous plants, bounties on the production of oils are unnecessary, for in nearly every case the oils mentioned in this schedule are simply by-products, and protective duties already apply to them. If we cannot grow the fibre we cannot produce the oil, and if we cannot give a bounty sufficient to encourage [4i] the production of rice on a commercial scale we should not give any at all. Experts have told me that one of the most important considerations in connection with rice cultivation is the temperature of the soil in which it is produced. The temperature of the soil in Riverina, Victoria, on the Murray, and Queensland has been declared by experts to be suited for the cultivation of rice, and they have even gone so far as to urge me, with others, to support the establishment of rice farms on the Murray, the Darling, or the Murrumbidgee, where the conditions are admirably suited to rice production. I should like to know whether the Minister can see his way to amend this item by proposing that the bounty shall be increased from £1,000 to £5,000 per annum, and spread over ten, instead of five, years? We need an increased population, but we cannot hope to secure it by granting such a small bounty as that now under consideration. The amount proposed to be set apart for this purpose.would be swallowed up in administrative expenses, and nothing would be left for those engaging in the industry. I would ask the Minister to consider my suggestion and submit such a proposal as would be calculated to lead to the establishment of a great industry. The imports of rice into Australia are valued at something like £250,000 We find per annum, and the industry is therefore worthy of - our special attention. It is evident that this matter has never been considered by the Government from a commercial point of view. We are supposed as commercial men to see that public money is wisely expended, and not frittered away as it would be under this proposal. I ask the Attorney-General to reconsider the item, and to give the Committee an assurance that he will prolong the period and increase the bounty. This is an industry worthy of the support of this Parliament and of the people, because it can be established with white labour, as in America and in Northern Italy, and will prove of great benefit to the country generally.",27
158,Mr HUGHES,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"West Sydney) [4.16]. - In my opinion this item ought not to be supported, because it does not conform to either of the two requirements which are essential before the State expends money in the way proposed. It does not appear that rice is more profitable than any other crop; on the other hand, there are many crops now grown in Australia winch are much more profitable, such as wheat barley, and oats. All these latter are produced under normal conditions without a bounty or aid of any kind, and are fast becoming, if they are not already, the staple products ot die country. We cannot start a new industry like that of rice-growing under a bounty without deflecting capital from other industries already established. There may be industries, which, in their early stages, present enormous initial difficulties; but there does not appear any reason to believe that when the difficulties were overcome in the case of rice, any advantage would be gained. There is a great deal to be said in support of the argument that this is an industry which, though not always, is, generally speaking, carried on by black labour; and this is a fact which it is of no use our ing. A bounty on the production of that kind of wheat which can be grown with a jo-inch or a 12-inch rainfall would be infinitely more beneficial to the country than a bounty on the production of rice. There is no doubt that it is most desirable to encourage the growth of a species of wheat which would partially defy drought, and wholly defy smut and rust. Rice does not appear to offer any particular advantage to the grower; and while I do not deny that it can be grown in fairly temperate climates, yet, if any argument may be adduced in its favour, it must be that it would tend to utilize the waste lands in the northern and north-western parts of Australia. I shall vote against the item, because it represents, in my opinion, an industry' not particularly desirable in this country. It would be much more profitable to send our wheat to China and Japan and receive rice in return, than to grow rice in Australia. There is reason to believe that the Chinese and Japanese may be induced to become wheat eaters instead of rice eaters; and, to an extent, our wheat is making headway in their markets. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [4.20] There is one patent fact which differentiates this item from those which the Comimittee, in their wisdom, have seen, fit to eliminate from the schedule. In the items which have been deleted, the amounts involved were trifling, and might easily be called paltry from an Australian point of view. It was shown in regard to those items that even when the whole of the Australian consumption had been overtaken, only comparatively small industries would be encouraged and brought into existence. In the case of rice, however, we have to face the fact that the product, to the value of nearly £250,000, is annually imported into Australia; so that there is a huge margin of production which the most sanguine of us, probably, would scarcely expect to be overtaken in the next generation. I do, not agree with the honourable and learned member for West Sydney in the comparison he has drawn between the production of wheat and the production of rice. The Commonwealth, in its wisdom, has properly decided that the northern portions of this great country shall, if possible, be peopled by white men. On my recent visit to the Northern Territory I became aware of the fact that, although blink- there are enormous areas which, from my point of view, are waste, barren lands, and the poorest description of pastoral country one could imagine, there are along the flats of the Adelaide River and other rivers, which flow north and north-west, large swamps extending back from one to five miles, which could only be utilized, apart from an enormous expenditure on draining and irrigation, in the production of rice. It is said that those black soil swamps are eminently suited for the cultivation of rice. The swamps are inundated to a considerable extent every year, and the rivers on which they abut are, for the most part, in the upper reaches' of fresh water very suitable for the purposes of irrigation. It is extremely desirable that we should do a.11 we can to induce white settlement in those parts of Australia; and for the reasons I have indicated I shall support the item. Reference has been made to the fact that rice was grown in Queensland; but the cultivation was carried on under peculiar circumstances. At that time a duty of £ 9 per ton was imposed on rice, not for the purpose of protecting the industry, but for the purpose of causing the Chinese population on the Palmer gold-field, who at that time numbered something like 20,000, and who contributed very little towards the revenue, to pay their fair proportion of taxation. This was deemed the simplest way to reach them in this connection, seeing that they were the largest rice consumers in the community. The duty, however, had the effect of largely encouraging the production of rice in the northern coastal districts, but, so far as my knowledge goes, the rice there cultivated was invariably in the hands of the Chinese. It is worth a trial to ascertain whether the river flats in the Northern Territorywhich, so far as I could see, were the only agricultural lands in the coastal districtscan be utilized by white men for the cultivation of rice? I join the honourable member for Grampians in the regret that the bounty is not considerably in excess of the sum named, because if the industry is to be a success, it is worthy of much greater en1 couragement.",27
159,Mr EDWARD S,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Oxley) [4.25] - I shall not occupy much time, because I take it for granted that honourable members have made up their minds how they intend to vote. This item of rice is not to be compared with the items of sunflower, peanut, palm, olive, and linseed oil, which have been deleted from the schedule. It is very difficult to understandwhy the Government, if they are . in earnest in their desire to establish the rice industry on a sound footing, should recommend or propose such a small amount as £ 5 , 0 0 0 , or £ 1 , 0 0 0 per annum. As the honourable member for Grampians said, the bounty ought to be something like £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 , because this is an industry which nearly every honourable member will admit is possible of being established on a prosperous basis. Last year the rice imported into Australia was worth £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 ; and we all know that rice is used as food by every man, woman and child in the community. It has been said that this is a black man's industry, and that may be so; but the same might have been said of the sugar industry until recently. There is no doubt that the rice industry could be established throughout the Commonwealth-no t only in Queensland, but in all the States. honourable member for Grampians has told us that rice can be grown on the Murray and the Murrumbidgee, and doubtless there are many parts of Australia in which, with slight encouragement, it could be cultivated successfully. Another advantage of this industry is that there are two crops annually. The report of the experts states that the period before there is any return is six months at the outside, and, in favourable districts, five months; and this in itself would be a great inducement to those inclined to engage in the industry. I shall be only too pleased to support the item, but I urge that the amount is not sufficiently large to achieve the object in view.  this as an ideal item in the schedule, because it presents those conditions which make it one of the most justifiable of the [41]- 2 proposals before us. In the first place, the value of the imported rice approximates to £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 per annum, and, in the second place, this is a new industry which has not been exploited, and of which we may have reasonable anticipations that, if encouraged, it will be entered into with profit to the Commonwealth. The item of rice possesses possibilities which suggest themselves to my mind, and which are likely to commend this bounty to the whole of the Commonwealth. It has been pointed out that the experts have contradicted themselves to some extent by expressing a doubt as to whether the growing of rice is an industry which can lie successfully exploited under Australian conditions. Before committing themselves to a recommendation, they should have tried to satisfy themselves on this point. Their report is unsatisfactory for another reason. The success of the rice industry in Australia must depend largely on the extent to which machinery can be brought into use in connection with its cultivation and harvesting, and the experts suggest that both varieties of rice may be harvested by the stripper as wheat and oats are harvested. They should have ascertained conclusively whether such harvesting is possible. If strippers could be used, there is very little doubt that the industry would prove a profitable one.",29
160,Mr STORRER,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"How could they come to a definite conclusion ?  has been done in other parts of the world where strippers may have been tried. The report says that rice can be grown not only The in Queensland, but in the other States. The temperate southern climate, as well as the torrid northern, have been equally favourable to the production of heavy rice crops. In the South, a rainfall of 40 inches, and in the North, of 100 inches and more, have also produced no appreciable effect upon the yield. It is contemplated that in the immediate future a system of locking will be carried out in connection with the Murray and Murrumbidgee Rivers. If this work is undertaken, the irrigation of large areas adjoining those rivers will be possible, just as it is now possible in the Goulburn River district of Victoria. As the climate and the soil are both suitable, if we can apply water to the land at a comparatively cheap rate, the growing of rice will probably be entered upon largely, and will prove profitable to producers and to the community.",29
161,Mr TILLEY BROWN,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"The use Murray water for this purpose is a long way off. It will not happen in our generation.  ley irrigation is possible now. It has been urged that the amount set down for the proposed bounty is too small to allow of the accomplishment of satisfactory results. I agree with that view. We have been told that, in dealing with the schedule, we cannot increase it ; but we must recollect that we have a strong Government in power, and if the Committee is in f avour of making a larger grant-sa y £5,000 a year instead of £1,000-n o doubt Ministers will provide means for carrying its views into effect.",30
162,Mr LIDDELL,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Hunter) [4.35] - I have listened carefully to the debate, and have been appalled by the ignorance of many honourable members on both sides of the Chamber in _ regard to the cultivation of rice. It is lamentable that proposals should be based upon a report like that before us, which contains so little information. really wonder if the Minister is in earnest in regard to these proposals. The leader of the Opposition, who is known as the arch-priest of free-trade ini Australia, has said that he will support the item, his only reason for doing so apparently being that in Queensland he promised certain protectionists that he would support the giving of bounties. I cannot follow him in this matter, because I do not believe at all in the bounty system, and I think that the pioposed bounty would altogether fail. According to the reportThe best varieties of rice are grown in swamps or level irrigated ground, and the initial stages of its cultivation are carried out while the land is entirely under water. As a matter of fact, rice is indigenous to Australia, but for its profitable cultivation there is needed, not only a good strong alluvial soil, but also a regular rainfall.",30
163,Colonel FOXTON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Bot h conditions are obtainable in the Northern Territory.,30
164,Mr LIDDELL,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"I know that there is a rainy season in India, Japan, and Carolina; but I have not heard of any part of Australia which possesses a regular rainfall.",30
165,Mr WATSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"The honourable member says that he is appalled at the ignorance of others, but he himself is now displaying his own ignorance. There are parts of Australia which have a regular rainfall.",30
166,Mr LIDDELL,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"I do not know of any place where there is a rainfall so regular that periodical inundations of rice-fields of the would be possible. Furthermore, rice is now produced almost solely in countries where labour is cheap. In Japan, the husbandman is ground down by his overlord, who takes every penny that he can pay, and even in Carolina black labour is employed, so that I think that Australia cannot compete with other parts of the world in the production of rice, because, though we may have the soil, we have neither the regular rainfall nor the cheap labour which are needed. I have seen rice growing in China in little terraces ascending the hills, which are irrigated very cheaply ;- but in Australia any system of irrigation must be very expensive. It is to be remembered that rice is used, not only as an article of food, but also for the manufacture of alcohol and starch, for which it must be available at a very cheap rate to make the process profitable. Even the experts admit that it is open to doubt if the rice industry can be successfully exploited under Australian conditions, and I think that I have I shown that it is ridiculous to expect success. I hope, therefore, that the Committee, with the exception of the leader of the Opposition and the Minister, will vote against the proposal.",30
167,Mr KNOX,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Kooyong) [4.43] - I should like to be in a position to support this proposal, because rice is such an important article of commerce, being used not only as a food, but for the manufacture of starch and other productions which employ a considerable amount of labour. But no words can adequately express the foolishness of setting apart only £5,000 for the encouragement of rice growing. If the industry is to be fostered, we must offer a sum from which we may expect good results. Some rice is being grown at the present time; but to offer £5,000, to be given during a period of five years, to encourage more people to embark on the industry is, in view of the magnitude of our territory, simply ludicrous. I should like to know whether we cannot increase the amount set down by adding to it some part of the £122,000 which we have saved by our amendments in the schedule. If so, I shall be glad to vote for the bounty, but if we cannot, I must vote against it, because I consider the granting of so small a sum as £5,000 merely farcical. In view of the importance of this matter, I think we should have an authoritative opinion from the Minister, or from you, Mr Chairman, as to whether any part of the sum saved by our amendments in the schedule can be devoted to increasing the bounty for the production of rice.",30
168,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Darling Downs-At torney-General) [4.45] - The honourable member for Kooyong will recollect that he specially asked for the postponement of clause 2, upon the ground that some of the items specified in the schedule would probably be eliminated and that some of the amounts which it was proposed to appropriate for specific purposes might be reduced. I promised to recommit that clause if any reduction were made in the amounts proposed in the schedule. Now the honourable member proposes, not that the amount - which it is sought to appropriate for this particular item should be reduced, but that the sums saved by eliminating other items should be appropriated for quite another purpose.",31
169,Mr KNOX,LETTER DELIVERY BY,I did not refer to any items which have been eliminated.,31
170,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"The honourable member said that certain items had been excised as the result of which some £120,000 had been saved. He then asked whether it was not possible to devote, say, £45,000 which the Government proposed should be expended upon the production of palm oil, to the development of the rice industry.",31
171,Mr KNOX,LETTER DELIVERY BY,That is the position.,31
172,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Onl y the Chairman can give an authoritative ruling upon that point. My own view is that when an Appropriation Bill has been approved, embodying specific appropriations, we cannot devote those appropriations to another purpose. At the same time, I feel sure that the honourable member for Kooyong will not vote against this itemi merely because he regards the sum as insufficient to encourage the rice industry. I would point out that under the Bill the Government have power by regulation to vary the amounts appropriated in connection with the different items, either by increasing or decreasing them. In pleading specially for one or two commodities-whe n it was urged that they could not be grown in the Commonwealth- I said, *' Let the item stand, because if the money as not required for this specific purpose there are other items in the schedule, and by means of regulations which have to be laid upon the table of the House, we can increase the amounts appropriated."" Increases can be made in that way.",31
173,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LETTER DELIVERY BY,That cannot apply to those items which have been eliminated.,31
174,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"I am merely stating my own opinion, subject to the ruling of the Chairman.",31
175,Colonel FOXTON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,That would be a matter of administration.,31
176,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"I speak subject to the ruling of the Chairman. Let me take the case of rice as .an example. If the proposal of the Government in that connection be agreed to, it is quite possible that the £1,000 appropriated for the payment of the bounty will not be required during the first year of its operation. As a matter of fact, if ^£50,000 were appropriated, I do not think that £1,000 would be absorbed during the first year. In the second year, if only £500 were claimed, it would show that the industry was beginning to obtain a footing. But the Bill has been so framed that the amounts unexpended in any one year will be carried forward to the next year. Of course, we realise that some of our proposals are purely of an experimental character. When the scheme has been launched, if the experiments prove successful, the House will probably be afforded an opportunity to revise it. If it can then be shown that an industry has been started with _ fair prospects of success, but that it requires further assistance to establish it upon a permanent basis, I believe that Parliament will gladly grant that assistance. But I maintain'that the £5,000 which we propose to spend in an attempt to foster the production of. rice is sufficient to permit of experimental work being carried out, and to enable us to determine whether we shall be justified in granting further assistance to make the industry a success. I ask the honourable member for Kooyong not to attempt to make further reductions in this or any other item, because by so doing he will be limiting our power to vary the amounts specified in the schedule. When we have dealt with the schedule I will recommit clause 2 and ask the House to make a proportionate reduction in it so as to keep faith with honourable members in that respect.",31
177,Mr KNOX,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Kooyong) [4.53] - The Attorney-General, I take it, does not argue that my first proposal was in any way inconsistent with my present position? If he suggests that, I wish to show him that he is absolutely wrong.",31
178,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,I do not suggest it.,31
179,Mr KNOX,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"I stated previously that it would be necessary to recommit clause 2, because I know that a number of honourable members would be strongly opposed to some of these items. That prediction has been fulfilled. The Attorney-General has alluded to the power which is vested in the Executive to vary the amounts appropriated in the schedule of the Bill . I have already expressed the opinion that that is a most dangerous power. I think that this Committee ought to know definitely what amount is to be allocated to each of these items. If the whole of the money voted for any particular purpose be not absorbed during the first or second year that the Bill is operative, I have no objection to it being expended in the third or fourth year, so long as the total sum appropriated is not exceeded.",31
180,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,That is fixed by the schedule.,32
181,Mr KNOX,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"But I do not believe in Executive having power to take money appropriated in connection with one item and to disburse it in connection with another. I repeat that the Committee should definitely know the obligations to which it is committed. The expenditure of £ 1 , 0 0 0 annually would, I believe, be regarded as a very trivial matter by any of the States. But it is folly for us to commit ourselves to any such expenditure in the hope that we shall assist in the establishment of a large national industry. I cannot avoid thinking that we are dealing with this matter in a retail, paltry, huxtering fashion. Let us endeavour to establish industries which will be worthy of support by the Commonwealth and which are likely to prove of benefit to the people as a whole. Do I understand, sir, that no amount appropriated in the schedule for a specific purpose can be used for the purpose of increasing other sums which have been agreed to by this Committee ? We have already reduced the total expenditure proposed by the Government by £ 1 2 2 , 0 0 0 , and I understand that whatever may be the amount of the expenditure agreed to in the schedule that sum must not be exceeded. Is that so?",32
182,The CHAIRMAN,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"I would point out to the honourable member that the items which have been excised from the schedule will entirely lapse. It is not in the power of the Government to appropriate the amounts proposed in respect of those items to any other item. Clause 2 of the Bill will require to be recommitted for the purpose of reducing the amount therein specified, and 'the second schedule must also be made to harmonize with the new conditions, seeing that certain items have been eliminated.",32
183,Mr HEDGES,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Fremantle) [4.58] - In my opinion this is one of the items most deserving of the support of honourable members. 1 complain, however, that the amount: which it is proposed to appropriate for the purpose of assisting the rice industry is altogether inadequate. No sound arguments have been adduced in opposition to the bounty. The fact that the commodity is chiefly grown by black labour proves nothing, because we know that in India a very large quantity of wheat is grown by black labour. Yet in Australia we compete against that production with very satisfactory results. The honourable member for Hunter has stated that rice will not grow unless rain falls at regular intervals soon after it has been planted. If that be so, why is it that so much rice is cultivated the upon the Nile, where very frequently rain does not f all for two or three years ? As a matter of fact, that rice is produced bymeans of irrigation, and I would point out that in South Australia there are huge areas of swampy land adjacent to the Murraytens of thousands of acres-whic h should be eminently suited to the production of commodities of this kind. I have seen these swampy lands, and I believe that if we could only establish the rice industry in Australia, we should be conferring a great benefit upon our people. But when we come to consider that a sum of £ 5 , 0 0 0 has been proposed to foster the production of peanuts, it does seem that the amount which it is proposed to spend upon the encouragement Of rice production is ridiculously small. I should like to see that amount increased to . £ 1 0 , 0 00 annuallv. An expenditure of £ 1 , 0 0 0 per annum is a very small bait with which to catch an industry which is worth £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 annually. Mr TILLEY BROW N (Indi) [5.0] I understand, Mr Chairman, that since we have struck out several of the items in the schedule, clause 2, which provides for the total appropriation under this Bill , will be recommitted with a view to its amendment. I wish now to obtain your ruling in regard to the effect of paragraph a of clause 9, which provides that the Governor General may make regulationsfor varying the amounts set out in the fourth column of the first schedule as the maximum amount of bounty payable in respect of any goods. I would not give this or any other Government the power to vary the sums specified as the maximum to be paid under the schedule, and I wish to place on record my opinion that the amount in each case should be fixed. I am advised that, by clause 9, Any of the .amounts fixed under the - schedule as the maximum to be paid in respect of an industry may be increased. . I wish to know whether that is correct. It should be impossible for the Government - to vary any bounty except by way of a re-duction. If the Minister responsible for the administration of this measure be empowered to increase the maximum, payable .as bounty on any goods, we may have a very large bounty granted in respect of some of these items. The fact that the regulations under which this would be possible must be laid upon the table of the House affords some protection, but such a method of procedure is sometimes abused.",32
184,The CHAIRMAN,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"The Committee have already passed paragraph a of clause -9, but I may say that my personal opinion is that the honourable member has been rightly advised that the Government will have power under that provision to vary the maximum amount set out in the fourth column of the schedule as the bounty payable in respect of any goods. Amendment negatived; item agreed to. ItemRubber, 15 years, 10 per cent."" on market value, £2,000. agreed to. Item- Coffee, raw, 8 years, i d . per lb., £1,500.",33
185,Mr BOWDEN,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Nepean) [5.3] - I do not like to allow this item to pass without entering my protest against it. The Attorney-General has put before us a report by gentlemen whom he described as experts. .When that report agrees with any of the proposals of the Government, he tells us that it is worthy of consideration; but when it does not, I presume that he asks us to ignore it. I find in the report of the experts the statement thatThe experience of the chief coffee producing - countries of the world-and these are countries where an abundant supply of cheap labour is - obtainable-doe s not afford much hope for the - extensive and successful exploitation of the industry under Australian conditions. In another part of the same report, we have the statement thatIt is an ominous fact that . . . the planters - of Brazil have not only destroyed large quantities of coffee berry because of the low prices prevailing, but have also pulled up the bushes growingon large areas of coffee plantation, and are using the land for other purposes. We know that coffee production in Ceylon has almost disappeared as an industry, and thatthose engaging in the industry in countries where the cheapest labour is available find it almost impossible to make a living. In South America, whence the bulk of coffee comes, a market cannot be found for all the berries at present being produced, and in the East Indies planters have had a similar experience. If the Commonwealth desires to undertake experiments in the production of coffee a start should be made in Papua, where the conditions essential to its successful cultivation prevail, and an abundance of cheap labour is obtainable. I am sure that the industry could not be conducted on the mainland under ordinary Australian labour conditions. I hope that the item will be rejected, and that honourable members will not consent to such proposals being carried on the voices. Such an appropriation as this would be absolutely useless.",33
186,Mr ATKINSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Wilmot) [5.8] - In connection with this, and nearly every other item with which we have dealt this after- noon, we have evidence that the Government have been seeking to attain too much. A fatal objection to the Bill is that, according to the report of the experts, many of the industries sought to be encouraged under it are not likely to be successfully established. That being so, we are simply asked to agree to a wasteful expenditure. The consumption; of coffee is declining, and the report of the experts by no means encourages us to support this item. The reason why the Government propose to appropriate only £5,000 for this purpose is apparently that the experts discovered that the prospects of success were so remote that it would be unreasonable to recommend a larger appropriation. I trust that this item, as well as others in the schedule, will not be allowed to pass without a division being taken:.",33
187,Mr CHANTER,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Riverina) [5.10] - I hope that the Committee will agree to this item. It has long since been demonstrated that the finest coffee can Be produced by white labour in Norfolk Island, which, until recently, was under the administration of New South Wales. In Lord Howe Island, excellent coffee can also be produced by white labour. One of these islands is already under the control of the Commonwealth, while the other may possibly be transferred to us at no distant date, and the fact that coffee of excellent quality can be produced by white labour on both of them should be sufficient to induce honourable members to agree to this bounty.",33
188,Mr LIDDELL,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Hunter) [5.12] - It is all very well for the honourable member for Riverina to assert that coffee can be produced on Norfolk Island, but the fact remains that in Brazil and other countries where coffee is extensively cultivated the supply is more thani equal to the demand. The report of the experts shows that large quantities of coffee berries have been destroyed by the planters in Brazil because of fhejow prices prevailing, and that the yields there have been almost sufficient to supply the world's demand. It would be of some interest to inquire into the history of coffee. I do not know whether Ministers appreciate the danger that might possibly attend the cultivation of coffee on a large scale in Australia. It is really a serious matter.",34
189,Mr STORRER,LETTER DELIVERY BY,For the doctors.,34
190,Mr LIDDELL,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"The question is one of concern, not only to medical men, but to the public generally. In the dark days long antecedent to those of which we have authentic records, coffee was grown in Abyssinia, and its cultivation spread gradually to Arabia, where it was used by the Mohammedans in connection with their religious exercises. The Mohammedans found that its effects enabled them to sustain their prolonged religious exercises without falling asleep; but even in those days the sectarian issue was raised, and some of the more orthodox of the Mohammedans objected very strongly to the drinking of coffee in connection with religious devotions. Its use, however, became more and more popular. Coffee was brought to England in 1641, and we are told that in 1652 Pasqua Rosee, the Greek, servant of an English merchant, - Mr Edwards, prepared it so palatably that many friends visited his master on Sunday afternoons to partake of the beverage; so much so that Rosee was at*last advised to establish a coffee-house of his own. He did so, and coffeedrinking became' so popular that many other coffee-houses were established in London. These coffee-houses were largely patronized by people who were opposed to the Government, and, so serious did the position become that Charles II . , in 1652, issued a proclamation, in which it was stated that the houses were the resort of "" disaffected persons, who devised and spread abroad divers false, malicious, and scandalous reports to the defamation of His Majesty's Government, and to the disturbance of the peace and quiet of the nation."" This is a serious aspect of the question which deserves consideration by His Majesty's Government of today. I suppose that in 1652 there was an Attorney-General just as there is today; and legal opinion was obtained as to the legality of the step taken by the Crown, whereupon the following oracular deliverance was madeThe retailing of coffee might be in itself an innocent trade, but, as it was used to nourish sedition and spread lies and scandalize great men, it might also be a common nuisance. Hence a heavy tax was placed on coffee, which, I believe, led to a considerable amount of smuggling. I draw the attention of the Government to these facts, so that they may be warned in time. It is stated in the report of the expertsI t is undeniable that coffee of good quality can be produced over large areas of the tropical and sub-tropical portions of the country. I have it on good authority that coffee cart be produced only in localities which are within 15 degrees north and 15 degrees south of the equator; and a glance at the map shows that only a small portion of Australia lies within that limit..  owned all that portion of Australia, he would be a very wealthy man.",34
191,Mr LIDDELL,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"If I grew coffee there, I am afraid I should be a very poor man. What is the use of our producing coffee in Australia when the world's consumption is only 15,000,000 sacks, while Brazil alone produces 15,490,000 sacks?  tions of Ceylon rooted up some years ago?",34
192,Mr LIDDELL,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"In Brazil, coffee plants are being uprooted because there is practically no market for a large portion of the coffee produced, and coffee bushes are giving way to other forms of cultivation. In Ceylon, the coffee plants were, I believe, rooted up because of serious pests, which may be introduced into Australia unless we very quickly pass the Quarantine Bill. Efforts are being made to encourage retired Indian officials to settle in Australia with their wives and families; and it is highly probable that some of the ladies may bring out as pets specimens of that rodent known as the golunda rat. This is an animal which plays great havoc with the coffee plants, living chiefly on the roots, but also climbing up and devouring the berry; and I believe it was the presence of this pest which caused a good many of the plants to be rooted up. In Ceylon there is also a pest known as the coffee bug, and there are certain fungoid pests, together with the coffee leaf disease, and coffee rot. In the report of the perts it is distinctly stated that four years must elapse before the coffee plant becomes productive. As a matter of fact, the plant is actually productive in the second year, and in the third year there is a profitable crop. Furthermore, the cultivation of coffee requires a large amount of cheap labour, which is employed in the countries where the industry is profitably carried on. There is no such cheap labour in Australia, nor, I am glad to say, is it very likely that there will be for a very long time to come. The cheap labour is required because there is a lot of weeding and pruning in connection with the cultivation; unless the plant is constantly attended to, It cannot possibly be successfully grown. I doubt whether there are many localities in Australia where the industry could be undertaken with any hope of profit. Coffee is said to grow well in well-drained, loamy soil,' at an elevation of about 2,000 feet, but there are very few such areas in Australia convenient to market. Most of the cultivated lands are in the coastal regions, because further back there is difficulty in reaching market. I hope honourable members realise that this is not an industry which ought to be encouraged at the present time with a bounty. In addition to the other reasons which I have given, I may point out that coffee is not so popular in England as it used to be.",34
193,Mr BAMFORD,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Herbert) [5.25] This item is somewhat in the same category as the item of rice. The experts, who, I think, are responsible in a large measure for the item now submitted to us, tell us that the coffee plant does not reach the bearing state for four years. As the bounty extends for only eight years, there will be only four years in which it will operate. However, the honourable member for Hunter says that the coffee plant bears profitably in three years, and if that be so, the operation of the bounty is extended. Parliament owes some consideration to the coffee-growers, because of the manner in which their product was treated when the Tariff was before Parliament a few years ago. The duty under the Queensland Tariff was 4d. per lb., but that was reduced to 3d. by the Commonwealth Parliament under the uniform Tariff. . In 1895 there was practically no coffee grown in Australia, beyond that produced by a few farmers for their own use. Five years later, in 1900, under a duty of 4d. exper lb., in Queensland, some 200,000 lbs. was placed on the market, and it proved of such quality as to meet with the approval of all who used it . Then there came the uniform Tariff, which so affected the industry that in 1903 the production had fallen to 83,000 lbs. If the item be passed, it will mean that only a very small amount will be paid until the new crops are gathered, because I doubt very much whether at the present time 83,000 lbs. is produced, seeing that the production has been diminishing ever since the decrease in the duty. I should like to refer honourable members to a letter written to the Geraldton Sentinel by Mr . Leonard M . Cutten, of Bicton, Clump Point, in reference to the coffee industry. Mr Cutten was the owner of the largest coffee plantation in Australia at the inception of Federation, and occupied that position, at any rate, for a year or two later. In the course of his letter, Mr Cutten says. . . It was largely due to the representations I made to the senators, and through the press, that the present inadequate duty was retained. That it did not suffice to save the coffee industry from extinction was not my fault. Without entering into wearisome figures it should suffice when I state that the Bicton coffee plantation, at that time the largest in Queensland (vide report Agricultural Journal) is at present being used as a horse paddock. De Moleyn's plantation (Cairns), the most complete, was, after ruining two proprietors, sold for one-fourth cost of machinery and sheds. These facts speak more strongly than words. That was the result in the Cairns district ; and it is only from Mackay northward that coffee is grown.",35
194,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Coffe e is also grown in the Maroochv district.,35
195,Mr BAMFORD,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"That only strengthens my argument. Owing to the action of this Parliament in reducing the duty from 4d. to 3d. per lb., the industry has been almost completely extinguished. Notwithstanding what has been said by the honourable member for Hunter, this industry has always been carried on in Queensland exclusively by white labour, and it has proved a paying industry under that condition. The industry was prospering very well until the imposition of the lower duty. I hope that the item will be carried, although I think that the sum set down, like that set down for the encouragement of rice-growing, is inadequate, and the time allowed too limited for the revival of the industry, which flourished so greatly a few years ago.",35
196,Mr BATCHELOR,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Boothby) [5-3 J-From the remarks of the honourable member for Herbert, I think that the best way to encourage the production of raw coffee is to make the duty 4d. per lb., which he says was the Queensland rate. The only information we have in regard to the prospects of coffee-growing in Australia is that with which he has supplied us, and a report of agricultural experts which has been furnished to us, than which nothing could be more condemnatory of the proposal we are considering. It saysWhile a very general feeling prevailed that coffee-planting was not likely-at any rate in the near future-to become an important Australian industry, Conference is of opinion that steps should be taken to encourage it. The reasons given for that opinion are theseIt is undeniable that coffee of a good quality can be produced over large areas of the tropical and sub-tropical portions of the' Continent - The returns, however, from the plantations, are not at all alluring, while the consumption of coffee by the people of the Commonwealth is on a very slender scale. The experience of the chief coffee producing countries of the world, and these are countries where an abundant supply of cheap labour is obtainable-doe s not afford much hope for the extensive and successful exploitation of the industry under Australian conditions. In Brazil, for instance, sufficient coffee is produced to meet the requirements of the whole world. . . . It is also an ominous fact that accoiding to the Trofenfflaneer- a recognised authority on all tropical matters-the planters of Brazil have not only destroyed large quantities of coffee berry because of the low prices prevailing, but have also pulled up the bushes growing on large areas of coffee plantations, and are using the land for other purposes. The records available of Australian experience in coffee growing are by no means encouraging. In the year 1903 there were 318 acres under coffee in Queensland, the total yield being 83,632 lbs. Valuing this at o.d. per lb - whic h is allowed to be a fair average price-the return would not be more than £10 per acre. Considering the labour involved in clearing and preparing the land, in picking and cleaning for market, and bearing in mind the fact that the plantation does not become productive until it is four years old, this return appears totally inadequate. Then, without adducing a particle of evidence to show that it is worthwhile trying to establish the coffee industry in Australia, the experts conclude with the statement thatCoffee of a good type can be produced over large portions of northern Australia. The question is not whether coffee can beproduced, but whether the establishment of"" the coffee industry is worth encouraging by means of a bounty. The experts do not. 2 show that it is. They simply sayAccordingly, a bonus of i d . per lb. for eight years is recommended. If there is anything to be said on the otherside, it should be put before us. On theinformation which has been supplied, I am. not prepared to tell my constituents that. I voted for this proposal.",36
197,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [5.38] - I am sorry that the honourable member for Boothby, who, I know, keenly desires to encourage agricultural industries, has made the remarkswhich have fallen from him. The fact that the coffee industry has flourished in Brazil is not a reason why we should not try to< establish it here. Would he contend that because industries are prospering in France, Germany, or England, we should take no steps to establish them here ? Thetesto be applied to this proposal is con1 tained in the question, "" Is there in Australia a market for coffee? "" Undoubtedly there is, our importations being valued at £58,000, and it is well known that we do not get genuine coffee, because adulterantsare largely used. It being granted that there is a market, we should ask ourselves, "" Can we grow coffee in Australia?"" It is not to be denied' that coffee can be grown successfully here. The reports show that it growswell in Queensland, from' Cairns right down _ to Maroochy, near Brisbane. Speaking from' memory, I believe that asample of coffee produced in the Brisbane ' dist rict obtained a gold medal at one of the continental exhibitions. The industry is one which pays white men's wages.",36
198,Mr LIDDELL,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Does it not provide employment chiefly for women and children?,36
199,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,I see np objection to women and children assisting in farm work under healthy conditions. It is during the picking season that their services are required.,36
200,Mr LIDDELL,LETTER DELIVERY BY,It is a pity that in a placelike Australia women should be sent intothe fields to work.,36
201,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,""" A place like Australia"" ! Is the implication that this wonderful land^ is not fit for white women to livein? Will the honourable member tell the wives of the farmers in his district that Australia is no place for them to live or work in?",36
202,Mr WILSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,The Minister is not fair to the honourable member.,37
203,Mr LIDDELL,LETTER DELIVERY BY,I object to women having to work in the fields of Northern Queensland.,37
204,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Coffe e has been grown under commercial conditions not far from Bi isbane, and the picking of berries is work that cannot injure women or children. There is in Australia a large market for coffee, and we have a big area of country on which it can be successfully cultivated under conditions which make the cultivation a white man's industry.",37
205,Mr BATCHELOR,LETTER DELIVERY BY,The returns obtained appear to be very low at the best.,37
206,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"The industry is a profitable one. Mr Howard Newport, the Queensland coffee expert, in the last repott presented to his responsible Minister, says that it has been proved beyond doubt that coffee culture pays well, even as an auxiliary product. The industry is undoubtedly well suited to Australian conditions, and I hope that honourable members will vote for the item.",37
207,Mr BOWDEN,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Nepean) [5.45] - When I was previously addressing the Committee I forgot to refer to the report of the Queensland expert with which the Attorney-General has so kindly presented us. The honourable and learned gentleman said just now-and his speech struck me as being a most feeble attempt to bolster up a preposterous claim-that the fact that the coffee industry was flourishing in Brazil was no reason why we should not seek to establish it in Australia. As I understood the remarks of the honourable member for Hunter, the point which he made was not that the industry was flourishing in Brazil, but that the demand of the whole world was already supplied, and that Brazil alone produced sumcient coffee to supply that demand. If there be no market for our produce, what is the use of endeavouring to bolster up this industry either by an expenditure of £1,000 or £12,000? The honourable member for Herbert has referred to the condition of the industry in Queens-' land. But I would point out that the report of the Queensland expert statesThis industry has been established here for some years, but does not give signs of expansion. This Department (Department of Agriculture and Stock, Queensland) for the past two years, to encourage the growers and to improve the quality placed on the market, has installed machinery and has cured, hulled, & c , the raw material, and sold it on account of the owners. The Government of that State have done all in their power to encourage the industry, but have been unable to impart to it any impetus whatever. The Queensland expert also statesAt the present the production of coffee in the world exceeds 1,000,000 tons, while the estimated consumption is set down at 915,000 tons. That means that there are 85,000 tons of coffee produced more than there is any de1 mand for-thu s bearing out the contention of the honourable member for Hunter. Concerning the profitableness or otherwise of the industry, the report shows that it will not return more than £ 1 0 per acre. And the Queensland report showsThe cost of production to the point when returns are obtainable is from ^5 to £ j per acre, according to local conditions, exclusive of the preparation for market, such as pulping washing, hulling, winnowing, & c , which amounts to about one-third of i d . per lb. on a crop, of about 1 lb. of clean coffee per tree, or from 4 cwt. to 12 cwt. per acre. These figures prove that the cost of producing this commodity would eat up almost the whole of the return which we might reasonably expect from it. It seems to me that if even we vote the £1,500 per annum proposed by the Government, although we may find a few persons who will produce coffee for the sake of earning the bounty, there is no hope of establishing the industry in Australia upon anything like a paying basis. - Mr JOHNSON (Lang) [5.48] - I intend to oppose this item, because, after studying the conditions under which coffee is grown, I have come to the conclusion thfit it is an industry in which women and children mainly are employed. In this country we do not wish to encourage industries which depend for their success upon the employment of women and children.",37
208,Mr BAMFORD,LETTER DELIVERY BY,What about the dairying industry ?,37
209,Mr JOHNSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"I am not in favour of the employment of women and children in any industry if it can be avoided. I want to see our male adults employed. I should be very sorry indeed if I were reduced to the position of asking my wife or daughter to engage in any industry while I was able to earn a livelihood for them. Here we are asked to vote a sum of money, not to enable our male adults to secure a livelihood, but toencourage the employment of women and children. My vote will not be given to encourage a policy of that kind. Seeing that the honourable member for Herbert is so anxious that women and children should be employed in this industry, I would specially direct his attention to the report of the experts. They say that it is essentially a tropical industry. Would the honourable member like to see his wife and daughter engaged in an industry of this character under a tropical sun for eight hours a day ? If he would, I certainly would not. It is bad enough when men of strong constitutions are forced to engage in occupations which require them to be exposed all day to the vertical rays of a tropical sun. I am not in favour of public money being expended for any such purpose. The report of the State agricultural experts saysI t is undeniable that coffee of a good quality can be produced over large areas of the tropical and sub-tropical portions of the Continent. The returns, however, from the plantations are not at all alluring, while the consumption of coffee by the people of the Commonwealth is on a very slender scale. If the consumption of coffee by our people is upon a slender scale, where is our home market for this commodity? What possibility have we of developing an export trade against the coffee which is produced by the cheap labour of the Brazilian plantations? The report proceedsThe experience of the chief coffee producing countries of the world, and these are countries where an abundant supply of cheap labour is available, does not afford much hope for the extensive and successful exploitation of the industry under Australian conditions. What has the Attorney-General to say in regard to that portion of the report? He quoted part of an appendix, but he was very careful not to quote any of the paragraphs contained in the actual report of the experts. There is nothing in their report to justify our belief that the industry can he profitably established in Australia, and certainly nothing to warrant us in offering a bounty for its encouragement. The re have port continuesIn Brazil, for instance, sufficient coffee is prowhich he has just delivered. duced to meet the requirements of the whole world, the figures being as under :Year 1901-2, world's consumption-15,500,00 sacks. Year 1901-2, Brazilian production-15,496,00 sacks. From these figures it is abundantly clear that Brazil already produces sufficient coffee to practically supply the requirements the world. Under such circumstances, - what is the use of attempting to establish the industry, even under tropical condibound tions? The women and children who will be employed will have their backs and Mr Johnson. tanned to the colour of negroes. How can we hope to successfully compete against Brazilian production? Another portion of the report says The records available of Australian experience in coffee growing are by no means encouraging. In the year 1903 there were 318 acres under coffee in Queensland, the total yield being 83,632 lbs. Valuing this at 9d. per lb - whic h is allowed to be a fair average price-the return would not be more than £ 1 0 per acre. Considering the labour involved in clearing and preparing the land, in picking and cleaning for market, and bearing in mind the fact that the plantation does not become productive until it is four years old, this return appears totally inadequate. With, all these disadvantages, the fact remains that coffee of a good type can be produced over large portions of northern Australia, and accordingly] a bonus of i d . per lb. for eight years is recommended. How these experts can make such a recommendation in the face of their own damning report passes my comprehension. It can only be done under the erroneous supposition that this Parliament has so much surplus funds at its command that it is anxious to avail itself of any excuse to expend public money without getting any equivalent either in services rendered or any other advantage to the general community. I do not know whether the members of the Conference received any intimation regarding the desire of the Government in this matter, but certainly from the way in which their reports conflict with their recommendations, one is led to suspect that some such hint was given. Upon the face of the report, itself, this proposal stands self-condemned. In addition, other honourable members have shown how absolutely untenable the proposition is on other grounds, and therefore I move That the item be left out.",37
210,Mr FISHER,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Wide Bay) [5.59] - I heard many speeches from the honourable member for Lang similar to that One of the arguments which he has advanced against 0 the proposal of the Government is that coffee is grown in a tropical climate, and 0 that the employment of women and children in coffee plantations, when the sun was; directly overhead, would be attended with more danger than if the sun were at another of angle, ^s a matter of fact, we all know that most danger is to be apprehended when the sun is low down. But some excuse is to be urged by those who know nothing about this subject, but who are arms consumed by an ignorant prejudice against the employment of white labour.in sub-tropical industries. They have a stupid, ignorant conceit that certain things cannot be done, simply because they are not done. What is the statement made by the honourable member for Lang? That Brazil produces sufficient coffee to meet the world's consumption of that commodity. Could it not be said, with equal force, that the world's supply of iron is produced outside Australia, and that we should not, therefore, expect the Commonwealth to produce it in competition with other countries? I could cite dozens of industries that are in exactly the same position.",38
211,Mr LIDDELL,LETTER DELIVERY BY,But this is a tropical production.,39
212,Mr FISHER,LETTER DELIVERY BY,It is neither a tropical nor a semi-tropical production.,39
213,Mr JOHNSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,The report of the perts states that the best situation for its cultivation is in the tropics.,39
214,Mr FISHER,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"The honourable member for Cook has just drawn my attention to the following paragraph in Mr Howard Newport's reportIn addition to the production in Queensland, mentioned above, in the Conference report, the Agricultural Department of New South Wales states that coffee has been cultivated in a small way for domestic purposes, and in two instances for commercial purposes. The north-eastern coastal districts of the State are well suited for the production of coffee. There is no tropical country in New South Wales.",39
215,Mr JOHNSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Does the honourable member suggest that the Tweed River country is suitable for coffee-raising?,39
216,Mr FISHER,LETTER DELIVERY BY,A m I to set my opinion against that of the experts of the Department of Agriculture in: New South Walesa State that is pre-eminent in all things- even in the conceit of its representatives?,39
217,Mr REID,LETTER DELIVERY BY,We can sometimes give the honourable member an easy first in that respect.,39
218,Mr FISHER,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"I have some experience of coffee-raising in Australia. I have seen it in the southern part of Queensland, where a man who grows the berry produces the manufactured article in quantities sufficient to supply the demands of the district. The reason why coffee is not more largely grown in the temperate parts cf Australia is that the public have a prejudice against the local article.",39
219,Mr REID,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"As compared with some other products, it is difficult to cultivate. It involves the employment of more labour than is necessary in connection with some crops.",39
220,Mr FISHER,LETTER DELIVERY BY,I know of a district where 10 tons of coffee beans are at present stored. The whole of those beans were grown on a local plantation.,39
221,Mr JOHNSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,The report of the experts shows that there is no market for coffee in Australia.,39
222,Mr FISHER,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"I have already pointed out that the reason for this is that the people, having acquired a taste for the imported article, are prejudiced against the local production.",39
223,Mr JOHNSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,The report states that the consumption of coffee by the people of the Commonwealth is on a very slender scale.,39
224,Mr FISHER,LETTER DELIVERY BY,As compared with the ex- total consumption of coffee in the world.,39
225,Mr JOHNSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,There is nothing about that in the report.,39
226,Mr FISHER,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Such an argument might be employed against the encouragement of any new industry. The suggestion that the work of gathering coffee beans in a tropical' or semi-tropical country is a dangerous one should be set aside.,39
227,Mr BAMFORD,LETTER DELIVERY BY,It is no more dangerous than is rose-picking.,39
228,Mr FISHER,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"That is so. Compared with the work that has co be performed by young people in various factories, the gathering of coffee berries during the time 0+ the year when their collection takes place is mere child's play. I trust that we shall approach che consideration of this item with unprejudiced minds. The industry in the Commonwealth can be expanded, but I do not know whether a bounty of i d . per lb. will be sufficient to cause its expansion.",39
229,Mr REID,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"A distribution of £1,500 per annum, spread over eight years, is ridiculous.",39
230,Mr FISHER,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"I cannoc say that it will be sumcient, but it will, at all events, afford some encouragement, and indicate that Parliament considers that coffee production is a desirable industry to establish in Auscralia.",39
231,Mr REID,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Every one admits that.,39
232,Mr FISHER,LETTER DELIVERY BY,No one will deny that the conditions prevailing in Australia are favourable to its cultivation.,39
233,Mr HUTCHISON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Accordin g to Mr. Howard Newport's report the industry is already established in Queensland. The proposed bounty on olives was rejected on the ground that the industry was already flourishing. Mr FiSHER - That is another point. At present I am endeavouring to reply to the argument advanced by the honourable member for Lang, that the industry could not be successfully established except by the employment of women and young children.",39
234,Mr JOHNSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,The report says that the picking of berries would give employment to women and children.,40
235,Mr FISHER,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Would the honourable member refuse to allow women and children to undertake such work?,40
236,Mr JOHNSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Certainly .,40
237,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Would it not be better for us to spend money in establishing a man's industry ?,40
238,Mr FISHER,LETTER DELIVERY BY,I presume that if a woman wished to engage in a light industry of this kind the. generous instincts of the honourable member would lead him to refuse her permission to do so.,40
239,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Are women excluded from the hop fields of Tasmania?,40
240,Mr FISHER,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Are not women allowed to pick hops in Tasmania?,40
241,Mr JOHNSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,I would stop women from engaging in all labour of that kind.,40
242,Mr FISHER,LETTER DELIVERY BY,The honourable member would prevent them from maintaining their independence by engaging in some light industry.,40
243,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Does not the honourable member know that it is an economic fact that where women labour wages come down?,40
244,Mr FISHER,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Speakin g generally that is the case in cities and large manufacturing centres, but I have yet to learn that in rural occupations, wages have been dragged down by the employment of women.",40
245,Mr REID,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"In the old country, women work in the fields for i j d . per hour.",40
246,Mr FISHER,LETTER DELIVERY BY,I have also seen women in the old country earning as much as a man could do.,40
247,Mr JOHNSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"The husband sitting on the fence smoking,his pipe, whilst the wife is working in the field !",40
248,Mr FISHER,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"I saw nothing of that kind in my native land. Those who displayed a tendency to do anything of the kind would be quickly taught their duty. I am not here to say that women are incompetent to perform light outdoor work. I have seen women engage in such work with profit to themselves and to their country, and I hope that honourable members will not be led away by the statement of th< honourable member for Lang. The honourable member for Hindmarsh has said that since the industry is already established in Queensland, we should not grant this bounty. If the industry is established, the argument is a good one.",40
249,Mr BATCHELOR,LETTER DELIVERY BY,There is nothing in the report to show that it is an established industry.,40
250,Mr REID,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"I would draw the honourable member's attention to a paragraph in the report from Queensland, which sets forth thatThis industry has been established for some years, but does not give signs of expansion.",40
251,Mr FISHER,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"That is true. I have seen small coffee plantations at various points between Cairns and Brisbane, and I repeat that their non-success has been due to the prejudice of the people against the local production, a prejudice due to the fact that a taste for the imported article has been acquired. In a small district to which I have already referred, a man is growing coffee, turning it into the manufactured article, and supplying two-thirds of the people in that district.",40
252,Mr REID,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Is the taste of that coffee different from that of the imported article ?,40
253,Mr FISHER,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"It has a slightly different taste. It is impossible to produce coffee tasting, exactly like the imported article.",40
254,Mr REID,LETTER DELIVERY BY,But a blend can be secured.,40
255,Mr FISHER,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"The slightest difference in flavour is noticeable. Local manufacturers can produce something tasting very like the imported article, but cannot send out anything so near to it as to be able to capture the market. The fact that in the district to which I have referred two-thirds of the people are using locally-produced coffee is, however, an evidence that the product can be successfully raised in Australia, and I trust that it will receive the proposed slight modicum of assistance, in the shape of a bounty.",40
256,Mr LIDDE LL,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Hunter) [6.13] - I wish to reply to a statement made by the Attorney-General as to the employment of women and children in out-door occupations. I certainly think it is very sad that we should be asked to legislate to encourage an industry which will lead to the out-door employment of the mothers of future Australians, and to (hat of the children themselves. The question of whether those engaging in the gathering of coffee berries will have to work under the vertical rays of a tropical sun is immaterial; the point is that a mother's place is in her own home. Will any one say that her place is beside the plough in the field with her husband? It may be said that the work of picking berries is mere child's play. It is nothing of the sort. No task that must be performed is play. Time spent in this way by children could be better devoted by them to",40
257,Mr STORRER,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Cookin g and sewing. Mir. LIDDELL - In learning to cook.,41
258,Mr REID,LETTER DELIVERY BY,I wish they all knew how to do so.,41
259,Mr LIDDELL,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"It would be better for Australia if all the wives knew how to cook. Fortunately, many of them do, but the time of our womenfolk would be much better spent in making themselves proficient in such occupations than in working in the fields. The other day I saw a number of lads who ought to have been playing in the cricket or football field, or, at all events, going to school, working at what was nothing more nor less than the hardest' labour that could be devised for them. They were doing their eight hours a day at this.",41
260,Mr HUTCHISON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Was this in the honourable member's constituency?,41
261,Mr LIDDELL,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"I do riot know whether the honourable member was with me at the time, but I am sure that he would have felt sorry had he seen these little lads, with their growing limbs, using heavy hammers, and engaged in laborious work when they ought really to have been going to school.",41
262,Mr JH CATTS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Where was that?,41
263,Mr LIDDELL,LETTER DELIVERY BY,I am not going to say any more than I have said. I cannot understand why the Attorney-General should express astonishment when I state that I do not believe in Australian women and children working in the fields.,41
264,Mr BATCHELOR,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Boothby) [6.16] Whence arises this new-born anxiety on the part of the honourable member for Hunter and others that women and children should not undertaike horticultural and agricultural work? Those honourable members bitterly opposed the inclusion of horticultural and agricultural industries within the operation of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill .,41
265,Mr THOMAS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,So did the present Government.,41
266,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LETTER DELIVERY BY,And Party agreed to the exemption.,41
267,Mr BATCHELOR,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"That is not so. As a matter of fact, the Labour Party have always upheld the view that, if possible, we ought to encourage the production of goods by men rather than by women and children, but that, if women' and children have to be employed, they should, at Teast, enjoy decent conditions. For honourable members who refused to extend to working women and children the only possible protection, to now object to their engaging in such occupations as that under discussion, is little short of hypocrisy-pur e humbug. When I previously addressed myself to this item, I spoke on the authority of the evidence placed before us in the report of the Conference of experts; and on that evidence we are not justified in voting for this item. It has been contended that it is no argument against the establishment of this industry in Australia to say that there is over-production in Brazil. That, of course, is quite true; but, according to the report, the experience of other countries is not encouraging, and, as to Australia, the report points to the impossibility of a payable industry being established here. I am anxious to support this item if a case can be made out for it , but no convincing case has as yet been placed before us, though the remarks of the honourable member for Herbert certainly showed some ground for an increase of the duty. All the work set forth in the conditions of the bounty has to be undertaken for a return, at the oucside, of £ 1 0 an acre. In order to meet the fact that the industry does not now pay, it is proposed to grant a bounty of i d per lb. for, practically, four years, seeing that it takes that time for the plant to come into bearing. The bounty might result, possibly, in more coffee being planted; but eight years from now, when the bounty would cease, there is no doubt that the industry would sink to its present level. There mighc be some prospect of the industry being permanently established if the duty were raised to the old rate of 4d. per lb.",41
268,Mr BAMFORD,LETTER DELIVERY BY,That argument would apply to all the items.,41
269,Mr BATCHELOR,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Not so directly as to this icem. There is the probability that the other industries contemplated might go on if established, but the coffee industry has been attempted, and was successful so the Labour long as the duty remained ac 4d. per lb. I can see no grounds for the bounty.",41
270,Mr HANS IRVINE,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Grampians) [6.21J - I agree very largely with both what the honourable member for Boothby and what the honourable member for Hunter have said, and the good sense of the Committee should be against this item. The report of the Conference of experts is distinctly against the probable success of the industry in Australia; and the bounty would be a waste of public money. Twenty-five or thirty years ago Ceylon produced coffee, but the plantations were swept away by disease. Coffeegrowing had to give place to tea cultivation; and Ceylon is now one of the largest tea-producing countries in the world. Whatever may be the fact as to this being a black man's industry, we do not desire to encourage any calling in which women and children are to be employed. However, I agree with the honourable member for Boothby that if women and children have to be employed in any industry, the conditions ought to be the best possible. It is evident to me that this item has not been carefully thought out by the Government. Certain conditions should have been imposed regarding planting, and so forth, because, otherwise, the planting would be carried on only for a few years in order to obtain the bounty. In Queensland, in 1903, there were 318 acres held under coffee cultivation, whereas in 1905 there were 167 acres; and, yet, in spite of the fair chance offered by the duty, the industry, instead of flourishing, has declined. This industry is similar to the rubber industry; and I am sorry to know that the item in connection with the latter has been adopted, because that is really a black man's work. I hope the Government will reconsider many items in the schedule, and that they will not persist in the proposal before us. If the item is not withdrawn, I suppose the Committee must divide, and, if so, I shall vote against it. There ought to be an agricultural bureau capable of giving the best expert advice, in order that success may be achieved in the various industries.",42
271,Mr HUTCHISON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Hindmarsh) [6.25L - I 'understand the purpose of the Bill is to grant bounties in order that it may be ascertained whether certain industries can be established on a paying basis in Australia. If I am right in that assumption, the coffee industry does not comply with the condition, because the report of the Conference of experts shows that coffee can be grown in this country. In 1903 there were 318 acres under coffee cultivation, yielding 83,630 lbs. per annum. Doubtless coffee can be grown in Australia, but, in the absence of a bounty, there is not sufficient encouragement, owing to the fact that Australian coffee, apparently, cannot compete with the cheap labour coffee of other countries. I am totally opposed to establishing any industry which depends on the labour of women and children.",42
272,Mr BAMFORD,LETTER DELIVERY BY,The coffee industry is not dependent upon women and children.,42
273,Mr HUTCHISON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,I am going by the report.,42

276,Mr THOMAS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Wh v should women be confined to home duties?,42
277,Mr HUTCHISON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"If women recognise their place in the world, they will see that it is to become the mothers of future generations. The position I have always taken up is that if women must do work that men are capable of doing they ought to be paid men's wages.",42

Like the honourable member for Boothby, I fail to see that we have given any good reason for supporting this proposal. Indeed, if anyching were needed to condemn it, it is furnished in the report of the Conference of experts. We should from Ceylon. consider very carefully any proposal to encourage, at the expense of the taxpayer, dustries in which chiefly women and children will find employment. able member for Boothby accused the Opposition of showing a new-born anxiety for the welfare of the women and the children of the Commonwealth; but surely cultural Bureau. that is better than anxiety to bring about their employment in tropical industries like coffee-growing? He was hardly just unanimously. when he inferred from our action in preventing certain agricultural industries being brought within the scope of the tration Act that we had no sympathy with the women and children employed in them. Our action was taiken for specific reasons, of the Continent. which were given at the time, and of which the House, in its wisdom, approved, and was disingenuous for him to try political capital out of it.

295,Mr JOHN THOMSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Cowper) [7-53]-- I did not intend to prolong the debate, but I feel compelled to do so, because a of the many erroneous statements which have been made concerning the possibilities of coffee-growing in Australia. Some honas orable members have doubted whether the industry is established, others whether it of can be established, and others whether it The House decided, without a division, that the giving of bounties for the encouragement of cerAustain forms of production is advisable. But and certain honourable members contend that can coffee-growing is not an industry which should be encouraged in this way. It has been stated that coffee has been grown successfullv only in the tropical parts of at Queensland; but, as a matter of fact, it has been grown very successfully in the electorate which I represent. No doubt many honourable members .have had the pleasure of visiting the Clarence River district, and know its soil and climatic conditions. Its climate is as healthy as that of any part of New South Wales, and we can be proud of the manner in which the farmers there live, and bring up their children. But the most successful men on our northern rivers do not carry all their eggs in one basket. They do not think it well to grow maize, or sugar-cane, or make butter only, because mixed farming is found to pay better. Coffee is sometimes grown as an auxiliary to a staple crop, and, as an instance of what is being done, I propose to quote from an article entitled, ""Coffee Growing on the Clarence,"" which appears on page 283 of the March number of the New South Wales Agricultural Gazette for 1903. There is no higher agricultural authority in Australia than that publication.",43
296,Mr MCWILLIAMS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,It is the best agricultural newspaper in the Commonwealth.,44
297,Mr JOHN THOMSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"The article is as follows :From accounts to hand, it would appear that coffee growing on the Clarence River has passed the experimental stage, and that the industry is on a fair road to commercial success. Mr John Dale some eight or ten years ago secured certain rights from the Government to found an experimental station at Wolbin Island. planted out several acres of young trees, which are now in full bearing. Already he has harvested 30,000 lbs. of berries, and has still another 10,000 to gather. This means that each tree's yield is from 50 lbs. to 60 lbs., or fifteen j - l b. tins of the prepared article. Retailed at js. per tin, the revenue represents a handsome income, as the trees are planted in rows about ao feet apart. At this rate, and providing that a market can be secured for the product, the industry, on the same basis of success, ought to give returns much more handsome than any of the sub-tropical crops raised on the north coast. The drawback to farmers used to returns ranging from monthly to yearly, is that there is no yield from the coffee trees til l they are four years old, and then they are not in full bearing. Mr Bale has for many years devoted much of his time to crop experimenting. He has demonstrated that many crops, other than those now raised, can be profitably cultivated on the fertile Clarence as commercial ventures. Besides raising the coffee in its raw state, he has also roasting appliances and modern grinding machines, and turns out the coffee in labelled tins ready for the market. In the latter end of 1896, Mr. Bale submitted samples of his locally-grown coffee to the Department of Agriculture. samples were brought under the notice of Mr. C. Skelton, who had been engaged for seventeen years as a coffee planter in Ceylon. He was greatly impressed with the quality of the berries, and some months afterwards, under arrangement, visited the Clarence and other northern, river districts,"" with the object of reporting on, the suitability of the soil and conditions generally for extension of the industry which wasproving so successful in the admirably adapted site selected by Mr Bale. In the Agricultural^ Gazette for October, 1897, page 744, Mr Skelton published his opinions concerning the capabilitiesof the districts mentioned. As many present readers of the Agricultural Gazette have, perhaps, not seen the report, some extracts from it are now reproduced :- "" In all three districtsClarence, Richmond, and Tweed- I saw largetracts of land, cleared and uncleared, well suited for coffee culture; soil and climate are all that could be wished for. I saw growing in thedifferent districts, strong, healthy, well-grown-, trees, in many instances laden with fruit. Withthe wonderful fertility of the soil, and thegeneral suitability of those parts of the Colony for the purpose, it is surprising that the industry has not progressed beyond the experimental' stage."" I need not discuss the matter at any further length. The industry has merely reached an experimental stage, and honourable members naturally desire to know why it has not progressed further. There are a number of reasons for that. One of them is that considerable difficulty is invariably experienced' in placing a new commodity upon the market. Initial obstacles in the shape of prejudice on the part of those engaged in the distributing trade, and of popular predilection for particular brands have to be surmounted. While these difficulThere he ties are being overcome the man who has embarked upon the industry has probably expended all his capital, and consequently has to close down. Unfortunately there is a prejudice against newgoods, and a strong prejudice against colonial goods. We must recollect that almost every brand of coffee, has a distinctive flavour. The same remark is applicable totea, which I might well take to illustrate my contention. There was a time in New South Wales when its people used nothing but China teas. When an effort was made to place Indian and Ceylon teas upon themarket it was unsuccessful for a considerable time. A good deal of money was expended before the attempt was successful, but today nearly all the tea used in Australia comes from Ceylon.",44
298,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,In British India a bounty is paid upon the export of tea.,44
299,Mr JOHN THOMSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"I repeat that The in placing new products upon the market prejudices have to be overcome, and the popular taste has to be educated. That is one of the reasons why Mr Bale has not been so successful with his coffee plantation upon the Clarence River as he would wish to be. As one who has been handling and selling coffee for the past thirty years, I claim to know as much about this article as a good many people. The sample of coffee which I had from Mr Bale's plantation was as good as any I have ever used. Where an industry of this description can be started under favourable conditions, and by employing white labour, I say that it richly deserves a bounty.",44
300,Mr JOHNSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,If the growers of coffee are making a profit out of it they do not require the aid of a bounty.,45
301,Mr JOHN THOMSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"I have already endeavoured to show that unless a man is possessed of a very large capital it is impossible for him: to successfully overcome the prejudices of the market, and to compete against vested interests. I think that we should come to the rescue of the coffee industry. It has been said that it would employ only women and children. I was reared in a farming district, and I have never met a woman who was any the worse for assisting her husband in the open field under proper conditions of labour. When women did more of that class of work they were quite as good as they are today.",45
302,Mr JOHNSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,They would be better employed there than they would be in f cictorics.,45
303,Mr JOHN THOMSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"The women whom I have known to assist their husbands in the open fields certainly did not suffer either in their health or in their womanly characteristics. I am sure that the coffee in- vernment. dustry can be carried on by white labour under conditions that need not excite a blush on the part of any honourable member. During the course of the debate upon this Bill we have heard a good deal regarding the desirableness of establishing a Federal Agricultural Bureau for the dissemination of knowledge amongst our producers. not think that practical farmers are prepared to accept as gospel, information which is derived from books. We have at Hawkesbury, in New South Wales, the finest agricultural college to be found in Australia. The gentleman in charge of it,  was reared on a farm.",45

305,Mr JOHN THOMSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"I am glad to know that we can receive some good things from Victoria. But it is obvious that New  better than did Victoria, otherwise he would not remain there. I repeat that farmers are not prepared to accept instruction at the hands of gentlemen who have merely the kudos belonging to an agricultural bureau. I admit that the Hawkesbury College has assisted the farmers of New South Wales very considerably. But such institutions can only inform the producers how a certain thing ought to be done. We now know how to cultivate the coffee-bush. But we want something more than that. Where is the justification for honourable members advising the Government to spend money in giving the farmers information upon subjects about which they know more than their would be tutors? I hope that honourable members will not urge the establishment of a Federal Bureau of Agriculture, with the effect of duplicating the work which is already being done by the States. I ask them to favourably consider the proposal of the Government to grant a bounty upon the production of coffee, because I am satisfied that on the northern rivers of New South Wales there is a splendid opportunity for establishing the industry if it only receives the necessary stimulus.",45
306,Sir JOHN QUICK,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Bendigo) [8,8] I intend to support the proposed bounty for the encouragement of the coffee industry in Queensland. At the same time. I think that the representatives of that State and the supporters of the bounty have every reason to complain of the inadequate and imperfect information which has so far been placed before the Committee by the GoHad they waited for the report of the Tariff Commission in reference to this and other matters I believe that a much stronger and more satisfactory case would have been made out. Certainly honourable members would not have been left in the dark to the extent that they have been, through the imperfect and incomplete I do manner in which the proposal has been presented. I 'wish to point out that the coffee requirements of the Commonwealth at the present time amount to about 1,000 tons per annum. Of that quantity, in 1903. about 50 tons were produced in Queensland- a very small contribution towards the vast possibilities of the industry. At the present time there are only 342 acres under coffee cultivation in that State. The information which influences me in coming to a conclusion upon this subject is fully set out in the evidence given before the Tariff Commission at Brisbane by Mr Scriven, Under-Secretary for Agriculture and Stock, Queensland. He appeared before the Commission upon the 21st June, 1905, and acting under instructions from the State Government, recommended the adoption of some measures for the encouragement of this very important industry. In his evidence he saidAt the Agricultural Conference held at Cairns last month (May), the question of the effect of the Commonwealth Tariff upon the coffee industry was discussed. The three leading propositions for the development of the industry were(1) An advance of i d . per lb. in the import duty, advocated by the representative from Buderim Mountain. (2) A bonus of i d . per lb. on the coffee duced, with the retention of the present duty of 3d. per lb. Proposed by the representative from Cairns. (3) An advance of 2d. per lb. in the import duty. Advocated by the representative from Mackay. Cairns, Mackay, and Buderim Mountain are the three chief coffee centres in the State. All the coffee men at the Conference contended strongly that any lowering of the duty would be absolutely fatal to the industry, in view of the competition experienced with other countries, as instanced by the 6s. 8d. per day paid for labour in Queensland, against the 4d. per day paid in other coffee countries. After a full discussion upon the above three propositions, it was finally unanimously resolved that the Conference was of opinion that the coffee industry required a penny per pound further protection to cause its development. Although there was a falling off in the amount of coffee produced in 1903, as compared with 1902, this was caused by a frost at the end of the 1902 season, which played such havoc with the trees as to seriously reduce the 1903 returns. In spite of this decrease in yield, the area under coffee in 1903 shows an increase on the 1902 figures. Expert evidence quoted at the Conference showed that Queensland coffee is at present better in point of flavour, aroma, and liquoring quality than the average coffees of Central America, Brazil, & c , which are the kinds mostly imported into Australia, and equal to the finest coffees of the East Indies, Ceylon, and Java in everything' except liquoring quality. I need not occupy the time of honourable members in traversing the whole of the report. Personally, I am not in favour of increasing the import duty upon coffee. To my mind, an impost of 3d. per lb. is quite sufficient. If we are to give any assistance to the industry, I believe that it should be through the medium of a bounty. ' Mr THOMAS - That is rather a peculiar statement for the Chairman of the Tariff Commission to make.",45
307,Sir JOHN QUICK,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"In view of the present high duty of 3d. per lb. upon coffee, I think that it is preferable to offer a bounty to encourage the production of that article, especially as tea, which is at present - upon the free list, is a strong competitor with coffee, and has to a large extent assisted to diminish its consumption. Therefore, I regard the payment of the bounty as the most reasonable proposition, and I think that honourable members ought to give fair consideration to proposals of this kind, which have been placed-before the Federal authorities in a business-lika way, and which have been backed up by the Government and the Agricultural Department of Queensland, and by evidence which entitles them to favourable attention.",46
308,Mr MCWILLIAMS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Franklin) [8.14]. pro- - I do not intend to support this item. At the present time the duty levied upon coffee is equal to about 50 per cent, of the Brazilian price of that article. The cultivation of coffee has been carried on in Australia for some years, and I fail to see what further claim for consideration the industry has upon us. A point worthy of special consideration is that coffee planters in Australia would have to compete with an enormous over-supply in the world's markets. In October last I heard Mr Staniforth Smich, who has, perhaps, a wider knowledge of the plantations in Java and the Malay States than has any member of the Federal Parliament, deliver a most interesting speech on this subject in the Senate. Mr Smith visited the Straits Settlements and Java when qualifying for a position to which he was subsequently appointed-that of Ministerial head of the Department of Agriculture in Papua-and , as the result of his own practical observation, he said, on the 'occasion in questionI cannot understand why the Government propose tr> spend ^4,000 annually for eight years upon the production of coffee. In my opinion the ^32,000 involved in the proposal will be absolutely, wasted. At the present time coffee is practically a drug in the market. It scarcely pays to grow it in Java and the Federated Malay States, where the best plantation labour-that is Tamil labour-ca n be procured for 6d. a day. The reason is that the enormous production of coffee in Brazil has rendered its cultivation elsewhere almost unprofitable.",46
309,Senator PEARCE,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"And in Brazil, the Government prevent new plantations from being established. The Government of Brazil some years ago issued a proclamation prohibiting the laying down of new coffee plantations, on the ground that the world's market was already over-supplied. Mr Staniforth Smirh went on to sayAt one time the cultivation of coffee was the most profitable industry carried on in the Malay States. To-day, howeverThis is the point to whicfi I desire to draw special attentionthousands of acres of magnificent coffee trees are passing out of cultivation, . simply because it does not pay to pick the berries. In Java there are 65,000 acres of coffee under cultivation. There, however, it is largely grown by forced labour, under a system which was initiated by General Van den - Bosch in 1832. . The natives living in the Preanger regencies are each forced by the Government to cultivate fifty trees, to pick the berries, and to hand'them over to the Government. It is equivalent to the hut tax imposed on the natives in South Africa, and I think that a similar regulation is in operation in F i j i . I wish honourable members to recognise thac we are attempting to establish a national industry in respect of a product which is already a drug in the world's market. The Government of Brazil, where 75 per cent, of the world's supply of coffee is grown, has issued a proclamation prohibiting the forming of new plantations, and in the' Malay States, which are: in our immediate neighbourhood, thousands of acres of coffee plants are being uprooted. Mr Staniforth Smith went on to say thatFor these beans they receive 2&d. per lb. . . I am inclined to think that the price which would be realized would be nearer 4d. or 5d. per lb. The two chief kinds of coffee are the Arabian and Liberian. He then proceeded to show chat, whilst the Arabian berry is an excellent one, the Liberian is very inferior, and that the Government were proposing to grant the same bounty in respect of both the valuable and the practically worthless commodity. Dr Willis, Director of Agriculture in Ceylon, who visited the Malay States for the purpose of inquiring into this industry, reported thatAlthough now depressed, this was formerly the chief agricultural industry of the country, as far as estate agriculture and export trade were concerned. Over production in Brazil, with consequent low prices, which affected the Liberian coffee grown in the Peninsula even more than the Arabian coffee of other countries, have rendered coffee cultivation almost unremunerative. With labour at 6d. per day, the industry in the Malay States is unremunerative. Dr Willis' report continuesA few well managed estates in good soil in the coastal districts can still make coffee pay its way, but practically all the older and the native coffee plantations are now represented by lalang wastes, while the younger ones, and most of the European plantations, are planted up with Para rubber, or at times with cocoanuts. It seems a pity to see such magnificent coffee bushes as may be found on many estates in the Klang district choked out by rubber, but of course it is inevitable under the circumstances. This report was quoted by Mr Staniforth Smith, who had had practical experience.",46
310,Mr JH CATTS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Did he have practical experience?,47
311,Mr MCWILLIAMS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"He saw for himself that magnificent plantations, extending over thousands of acres, were being allowed to go to waste.",47
312,Mr JH CATTS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Would the honourable member describe that' as practical experience ?,47
313,Mr MCWILLIAMS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Certainly .,47
314,Mr KELLY,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Mr Smith knows more about the industry than the Government experts do.,47
315,Mr MCWILLIAMS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"The Government of the Commonwealth considered him such an expert in these matters-and properly so-that they appointed him to a very important position in Papua. That appointment, I am sure, was made with the full approval of a considerable majority of the Parliament, and Mr Smith is now engaged in developing these industries in Papua. He has taken there large quantities of the coffee berry, and is engaged in planting them.",47
316,Mr JH CATTS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Althoug h he said last year that it was absurd to think of growing coffee here.,47
317,Mr MCWILLIAMS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,The point is that in Papua indented labour is available at a cost of £ 3 per annum per man. I think that Mr Staniforth Smith has taken up a very proper position. Surely the honourable member for Cook does not desire to have established in Australia industries in which it is impossible to pay reasonable wages.,47
318,Mr JH CATTS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,The Opposition do not want to establish any industry in Australia.,47
319,Mr MCWILLIAMS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"The honourable member is wrong. There are honourable members of the Opposition who have had to fight hostile constituencies on this very question of white labour. The position taken up by Mr Staniforth Smith is that the growth of these products in Australia would not be profitable, having regard to the rates of wages which the Federal Parliament, desire, and in some cases, require to be paid. Miners in Papua are indenting their black labour- I was going to say black slaves-and paying the magnificent sum of ios. per month per man. From that amount fines are deducted from time to time, and, in passing, I may say that I hope that during this session that question will be thoroughly inquired into. Evidence given before the Commission which recently inquired into the administration of Papua shows that one of the chief reasons why the cultivation of coffee there is advocated is that native labour is obtainable at £ 3 per annum per man. If the desire is merely to create an industry that will be able to supply local requirements, this item is unworthy of consideration. If , on the other hand, we are to build up a great national industry, we must be prepared to face competition in the markets of the world. Is it possible for us to employ men at 6s. or 7s. per dav in an industry of this kind, when in the Malay Archipelago the rates of pay are only 6d. per day ? How can we. hope to compete in such circumstances in the open markets of the world? These are facts which honourable members should, inquire into for themselves. I am satisfied that no honourable member would be prepared to put any of his own money into a business in connection with which such a report as that of the experts how before us was issued as a prospectus. as much interest in the agricultural industry of Australia as has any honourable member, but I do not believe that we shall be able to establish industries of this kind. I do not consider that this system of spoonfeeding is calculatedto create great national industries.",47
320,Mr JH CATTS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,That is the honourable member's real objection to this proposal. His other statements are mere padding.,48
321,Mr MCWILLIAMS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"That is a mere assertion. I am sure the honourable member would not be prepared to put a shilling of his own into the industry. Very few of those who support this item are prepared to back up their opinion with their own dollars. I quite agree with the honourable member who immediately preceded me that, generally speaking, the farmer can be allowed to proceed as he thinks best. He knows what pays him best. Coffee-raising has been tried for many years in Queensland, and I am sure we are all pleased to hear that the co'ffee produced there is excellent. Do honourable members believe that if there was a reasonable prospect of a profitable industry being established there, people would not be ready to embark upon it when we have a protective duty equal to 50 per cent, to encourage them ? I claim that the Federal Parliament has already given substantial assistance to the industry. In Brazil the price of raw coffee is not more than 6d. per lb. I think that the price of the ordinary coffee of commerce is about 4 f d . per lb. There is a duty of 3d. per lb. on raw coffee beans, and of sd. per lb. on roasted or ground coffee. The great argument in favour of duties such as these is not that they give revenue, but that they assist the producer, and give him an advantage as against the imported article, until the industry becomes established, and commands at least the local market. We are told that Australia is admirably suited for the cultivation of coffee, and I believe that the coffee produced here is exceedingly good. That being the case, surely duties ranging from 50 per cent, to 65 per cent, ought to be sufficient inducement to people to engage in the industry. But if we impose high protective duties on an article, which, if not a necessary of life, is, at least, an ordinary article of diet, we have a right to expect that the industry will be able to win its way without the assistance of a bountv. Are we to carry on a doubleI have barrelled system of first levying what is considered to be a sufficient duty, and then adding a bounty? In a few weeks hence, when the Tariff is before us, we may be asked to increase the duty. If a majority of honourable members are in favour of protection,, let. them impose what they regard as a fair and reasonable duty, so that we may know exactly where we stand.",48
322,Mr WILSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"I ' think the honourable member is wrong in saying that the duties range from 50 to 65 per cent., seeing that the price is od. per lb. wholesale.",48
323,Mr MCWILLIAMS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Surely the honourable member does not intend to take the price, plus the duty, and regard the total as the duty ?",48
324,Mr WILSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,I am speaking of the invoice price of coffee landed in Australia.,48
325,Mr MCWILLIAMS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"The price of coffee in Brazil is certainly not more-than sd. per lb., and, as the freight is not excessive, I think I am quite safe in calculating the duty as I have done. No doubt Arabian coffee is sold at a higher price, but the Brazilian coffee represents 75 per cent, of the world's production. Under all the circumstances, the industry ought to be able to exist without a bonus. Only some eight months ago, Mr Staniforth Smith, then a member of the Senate, who had just returned from the Islands, stated in his place in Parliament that, from his own personal observation, he knew that thousands acres of coffee plantations were going decay, and that the cultivation of more fitable products was being undertaken, though the current rate of labour was 6d. per day. Under the circumstances, I see no hope of establishing a national industry able to compete in the markets of the world against the product of cheap labour. . Mr THOMAS (Barrier) [8.35] - I difTariff fer greatly from some honourable who have spoken, in that I think we have a right to find employment for women as we have for men. While I hold that the best place for women is the home, that is not the only place for them. A woman has as much right, if she chooses, to earn living away from home, as a I should not refuse to grant a bounty merely because it found employment for women. If it is possible to produce coffee in Australia, it would doubtless be a good thing for the country; but I understand that, at the present time, there is a duty of 3d. per lb. I do not know whether sion, that duty was imposed for revenue or for protective purposes; but if merely for protective purposes, it would not appear to have done much good, 'because the overmay whelming bulk of the coffee we use is still imported. That fact shows either that it impossible to grow coffee in Australia, that the duty is not sufficiently high. am prepared to vote for a bounty of i d per lb. on coffee, or to go further, and a bounty of 6d. per lb., if the vernment, when it introduces the Tariff, will remove the duty of 3d. per lb.",48
326,Mr WILSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,The honourable member has no hope!,49
327,Mr THOMAS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"At any rate, if health and strength, I can always hope to be here to vote. I am not in favour of any shut ? taxation which is merely revenue-producing through the Customs. If it is possible produce coffee in Australia, it would be fair to make the burden fall only on people who drinik' coffee; all the people Australia ought to pay equally towards cost of establishing this industry. it that protectionists think that the will create a great national asset, ployment for ""the people by creating a and mighty industry-and a lot of things. _ If that be the end in view, all Australia should contribute, and, that view, I make the offer I have to the Government. I listened with great pleasure and interest to the speech of the honof orable and learned member for Bendigo. to That gentleman, not as the honourable and prolearned member for Bendigo merely, but as the Chairman, of the Tariff Commission, made what is certainly a very strong statement, when he said that he is not in favour of any further duty on coffee. We may now take it for granted that, so far as coffee is concerned, the Chairman of the Commission has reported against any members increase in the duty.",49
328,Sir JOHN QUICK,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Would the honourable exactly member have me tongue-tied?,49
329,Mr THOMAS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,The speech of the honourable and learned member is a strong argument for the contention that we ought toher have had the Tariff submitted before this; man has; and Bill was introduced.,49
330,Sir JOHN QUICK,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Did I not say that ?,49
331,Mr THOMAS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"If so, the honourable, and learned member said what was right.. I think it is very hard, not only for the honourable and learned member, but for every other member of the Tariff Commisto have to practically keep quiet whilst this Bounties Bill is being discussed, in case they may say anything which would' reveal the contents of their report. Wetake it for granted that if the highprotectionist Chairman of the Tariff Comis mission takes that stand, the free-tradeor members will not be in favour of any inI creased duty. I do not say that that con. clusion necessarily follows, but it is a fair give and legitimate inference; and it seems toGome that any one who deals in coffee in a wholesale way is in a position to concludethat the Tariff Commission will report against any increase in the duty. There isscarcely any one in the House better qualified to speak on Customs questions than theI have Chairman of the Tariff Commission.",49

333,Mr THOMAS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Why , indeed? But to the honourable and learned member's mouthunmust, in honour, be shut until the Tariff is the submitted. That remark applies, not only of to the honourable and learned member for the Bendigo, but also to the honourable and' I take learned member for Illawarra, and' duty the honourable member for Perth, whom find emhonorable members would be very glad' great to hear, especially on questions whichother they considered as members of thethen Tariff Commission. The Committee is alwith ways glad to listen to men who have madecertain subjects their special study, and the1216 Bounties Bill. [REPRESENTATIVES.] members of the Tariff Commission devoted nearly three years of hard and laborious work to ascertaining the effect of the Tariff upon our industries. But now that the Bounties Bill is before us, they are practically forced to be silent for fear of making public information in regard to suggested Tariff changes. I think that the Bill should not be further proceeded - with until the Tariff has been introduced; but the responsibility for what is being done lies with the-Government.",49
334,Mr HENRY WILLIS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Robertson) [8.47] - I shall vote for the proposed bounty on one condition, and that is that the Government will undertake to propose the removal of the duty of 3d. per lb. on imported coffee. Ministers have put the cart before the horse in bringing forward this Bill before they are ready to introduce their Tariff proposals. The coffee industry is certainly one which should receive attention. According to the report of the conference of agricultural experts, the cultivation of coffee gives a profit of £ 1 0 an acre, which, as those who know anything about agriculture are aware, is a good return. The man who grows vines does not make more than that. But the industry should be encouraged only on the terms referred to by the honourable member for Barrier, that is to say, in lieu of duty. The cultivation of coffee entails work similar to that entailed by the cultivation of tobacco. The tedious planting, transplanting, and weeding, which is necessary, is really Chinamen's work. Men cannot be paid to doit. and therefore it will be necessary to employ women and children, such as in the cities are employed in factories, where their sweating conditions create sympathy in the hearts of honourable members. This is one of the few industries which might well be encouraged by means of a bounty; but if a bounty is given there should not be a duty on imported coffee.",50
335,Mr FULLER,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Illawarra.) [8.50] - The honourable and learned member for Bendigo unintentionally misled the Committee by the quotations which he made from the evidence given by the, Queensland Under-Secretarv for Agriculture and Stock when examined by the Tariff Commission in Brisbane in June, 1905. I feel sure that his quotations created in the minds of honourable members the opinion that the Under-Secretary - favoured the giving of a bounty for the production of coffee. That he did-not do so is shown by his answer Bounties Bill. to question 29711. Ex-Senator Higgs asked himDo you favour the view put forward by Mr. Warren that there should be a bonus? ' To which he repliedNo. I do not like bonuses at all. The Under-Secretary was specially instructed to appear before the Commission as an authority on coffee-growing in Queensland, and is probably better acquainted with the subject than any other man in the Commonwealth.",50
336,Mr JH CATTS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Did he suggest that any encouragement should be given to the industry ?,50
337,Mr FULLER,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"He put before the Commission the proposals which had been advanced from chree agricultural centres in Queensland, in each case favouring a duty, and in one case suggesting a bounty of i d . per lb.  would not injure an industry because of one man's evidence?",50
338,Mr FULLER,LETTER DELIVERY BY,I quoted the Under Secretary's evidence because the quotations of the honourable member for Bendigo made it appear that he favoured the giving of a bounty.,50
339,Sir JOHN QUICK,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"I quoted the passage in the report in which the opinion is expressed that the industry needs further protection to the extent of i d . per lb., and I said that I am not in favour of granting such protection, though I am willing to vote for a bounty.",50
340,Mr FULLER,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"The honourable member for Barrier thereupon checked the honourable and learned member, because he was making public the views of the Tariff Commissioners. I shall not give away the position of the free-trade members of the Commission in regard to coffee. The honourable member for Cowper says that there are already so many State Departments of Agriculture that a Commonwealth Agricultural Bureau is not needed. I differ from him, because I firmly believe thac such an institution would greatly assist our primary producers. The Under-Secretary whose evidence I have quoted shows that the Queensland Government has alreadv done a good deal for the coffee industry. In an swer to a question by ex-Senator Higgs- question 29754-h e saidThe teaching of the Instructor in Tropical Agriculture has altered a good many things in connection with coffee-growing in Queensland. This is an answer to those who say that departmental experts merely sit in their offices, and are incapable of giving practical advice fo the farmers. Good work has been done by the State Deparcments of Agriculture, and the Commonwealth would still further assist our primary producers if it gave them expert instruction and information. It would be better to do that than to grant bounties. A strong objection to the present proposal is that any coffee we might produce would have to compete with the product of cheap labour in other parts of the world. The experts who considered this proposal in conference have pointed out that in Brazil the coffee-plantations have been torn up. Similar evidence was tendered to the Tariff Commission by the agricultural expert of Queensland. When we consider that the industry is one which lends itself chiefly to the employment of women and children, surely it is evident that we ought not to go out of our way to establish it in our midst. It has been further pointed out by the State experts that the prospects of coffee cultivation in Queensland are not encouraging. It is perfectly true that some farmers who are engaged in the industry there have been fairly successful. A few are doing fairly well, more particularly those who are settled upon small holdings. But there is nothing in the report of the State experts to warrant me in supporting the Government proposal. In any circumstances, the amount which it is proposed to appropriate for the development of the industry is altogether inadequate, and a similar remark is applicable to most of the items contained in the schedule. I trust that the item will be eliminated.",50
341,Mr FISHER,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Wide Bay) [9.3] - No body can take exception to the reasoning of the honourable and learned member for Illawarra. He has been consistent in his opposition, both to the imposition of protective duties, and to the payment of bounties for the encouragement of new industries. He Certainly dwelt more fairly upon the conditions which obtain in regard to coffee culture than did any other honourable member who has debated the question from that stand-point. While the coffee industry has been described as one in which women and children will be chiefly employed, it must not be forgotten that their employment will be limited to the picking of the coffee when it has matured. '",51
342,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Is the honourable member "" stone-walling "" this proposal?",51
343,Mr FISHER,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"I do not intend to discuss the general question of whether or not the employment of women and children in this industry should be encouraged. But if any logical objection can be urged to their employment in it, that objection may with equal force be applied to their employment in picking fruit .",51
344,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Is it the rule for women to pick frui t in Australia?,51
345,Mr FISHER,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"In many instances, they are employed for that purpose.",51

ItemTobacco leaf, high grade, of a quality prescribed, 5 years, 2d. per lb, .£4,000.",51
348,Mr JOHNSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Lang) [9.13] - Fro m the division which has just taken place it is evident that we cannot place too much reliance upon the declaration made by certain honourable members that when, the schedule of the Bill was under consideration, they would assist in excising several of the items, and confining the schedule to two or three special lines of production likely to become permanent. Therefore, it seems that in endeavouring to save the taxpayers' money, we are simply beating the air. Nevertheless,, it is the duty of honourable members on this side of the House to endeavour to safeguard the interests of the people, and to see that this money is not expended without justification or without an equivalent being obtained for it. None of the items already dealc with comply with either of these requirements. All involve an expenditure of public money .amounting to an absolute gift, that add only to the private gains of theindividuals concerned in these various lines of production. Notwithstanding the discourhe aging results of the last division, I intend to persist in my efforts to secure the sion of some of these indefensible items, and perhaps one of che least justifiable the schedule is that relating to tobacco. honourable members are aware, we already have a heavy duty on imported tobacco leaf as well as on manufactured tobacco. 4d. to 6d. per lb. We have an import duty of 3s. 3d. per lb. on the manufactured leaf entering Ausmember tralia, with an Excise duty of is. per lb., ment? whilst on imported leaf entered to be locally manufactured into tobacco there is an import duty of is. 6d. per four lb. These should have had the effect ference on tobacco. - if any encouragement of the kind would be effective-of inducing the production of the highest grade tobacco leaf in Australia. But notwithstanding the inducements offered by these heavy duties, we find that the production of tobacco, stead of progressing, has receded. Whereas in 1888 there was a production lbs., in 1.906-afte r heavy protective duties had prevailed for eighteen years-the prolearned PAIRS. duction had fallen to 1,387,500 lbs., a decrease of 6,480,612 lbs. I do not know the reason for this falling off, but we have the significant fact that, notwithstanding the existence of heavy duties, the industry, instead of being encouraged, has been unable to-thrive. There werefluctuationsduring two or three intervening years, but generally the to be tendency, since 1888 has been a declining one. In view of thesefigures,and the fact that these heavy duties should have given a great impetus to local production, I fail io see why we should be asked now to still further bolster up this industry by means of a bounty. It is well known that Australian tobacco is a low-grade production. Notwithstanding the heavy duties we are unable to grow a leaf anything like equal to theimported Cuban leaf. If the duties were double their present rate, I am perfectly satisfied that the Cuban leaf would still have to be imported. I was speaking the other day to a leading manufacturer of cigars, who told me that if he could secure an Australian-grown leaf of proper quality he would naturally prefer, as a protectionist,, to use it. He explained' that, as a matter of fact, we could not grow the best class of tobacco in Australia.",52
349,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Was he referring to towill bacco leaf for cigar-making?,52
350,Mr JOHNSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"He was. I was being shown over his factory at the time, and was explaining to me the various processes of manufacture. He informed me omisthat the Australian public demanded the imported leaf. It is evident that the Ausin tralian production must be inferior, since As Cuban tobacco realizes is. 9d. per lb. in the open markets of the world, whereas the Australian-grown article is worth only from",52
351,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Where does the honourable get his authority for that state,52
352,Mr JOHNSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,I would refer the honourable and learned gentleman to the first paragraphs of the report of the Con,52
353,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,The honourable member is referring to the lower grade leaf?,52
354,Mr JOHNSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"We cannot grow the higher grade leaf, at least so I am given into understand by men in the business.",52
355,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"I shall show the honourable of 7,868,112 member that we can.",52
356,Mr JOHNSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"The honourable and gentleman will, perhaps, be able to correct me, but I am putting before the Committee the information supplied to me by those particularly interested in the manufacture of tobacco. I do not pretend to be an authority, because I have long since given up indulging in the weed. At page 31 of the report of the experts we have the statement thatIndustrial conditions in the Commonwealth seem lo indicate the wisdom of encouraging the production of the various raw materials in their most valuable form. Some of the best qualities of leaf have a value as high as 5s. per lb., over twenty years ago some Northern Territory tobacco sold by auction at Hamburg at the rate of 2s. 1 id. per lb. Against this we have the fact that the tobacco at present being produced in the Commonwealth has a merchantable value of only about 4d. to 6d. per lb. In the absence of any explanation, honourable members will be puzzled to know why, if tobacco grown in the Northern Territory twenty years ago sold at 2s. n d . per lb. on the continental markets, no attempt has been made to persevere in the production. Surely it would pay' far better to cultivate a leaf that would realise 2's. n d . per lb. than to pioduce that for which only from 4d. to 6d. per lb. can be obtained. It seems, however, that for some unexplained reason the production of the higher grade tobacco was not proceeded with. This could not have been due to the need for a bounty, because the price obtained was much higher than that now ruling.",52
357,Mr HENRY WILLIS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Peihap s if that tobacco had been sold in Australia it would have brought only 4d. or 6d. per lb.,53
358,Mr JOHNSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"I do not think so, having regard to the fact that it realized 2s. 1 id. per lb. in the open market. Notwithstanding that there is a duty of 3s. 3d. per lb. on manufactured tobacco entering the Commonwealth, the imports of manufactured tobacco for 1905 were of the value of £175,000, whilst the imports of unmanufactured tobacco during the same year were of the value of £203,000. I am perfectly sure that prejudice against the local article is not the explanation for these large importations. They must be due to the fact that the imported tobacco is of better quality, and a far more'marketable commodity with the Australian public than is the locally-grown tobacco. The report of the experts proceedsAs tobacco can successfully be produced in order ? all the States, there should be no justification for these large importations, which are made the face of a heavy Customs impost. The following fact is o i interest :-I Cuba exported 29,800,000 lbs. of 12^ million dollars, or an average of is. 9d. per lb. This is the kind of tobacco Australia wants to grow. The Conference, therefore, recommends that a bonus of 2d. per lb. be given for the production of tobacco bringing iod. per lb. and upwards. Why is this grade of tobacco not produced at the present time? If we have the soil and climate necessary for the production of a high-grade tobacco, it is strange that after many years of State coddling by while means of heavy Customs imposts, we do not produce such an article at the present time. The answer apparently is that it cannot be produced, and I do not believe that it could be produced if the bounty were made ten times larger. From what I can gather from scientific experts, it is the absence of certain natural properties in the soil of Australia that is the cause of the trouble; but for this we should have had the highest grade tobacco produced here long before now. I move That the words "" Tobacco leaf, high grade,' r be left out.",53
359,Mr HENRY WILLIS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"I rise to a point of order. The proposition made by the honourable member for Lang is a direct negative j to negative the item would have the same effect as that desired by the honourable member. Do I understand, Mr. Chairman, that you accept such a motion ?",53
360,The ACTING CHAIRMAN,LETTER DELIVERY BY," The course adopted right through the discussion of the schedule, and allowed by the Chairman, has been to accept motions in precisely the same form as that of the motion submitted by the honourable member for Lang; and I do not propose now to make any alteration.",53
361,Mr HENRY WILLIS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Is it intended that the precedent should be established to be applied for all time that an honourable member may move a direct negative?,53
362,The ACTING CHAIRMAN,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"I am not concerned about a precedent for all time, but, so far as the discussion on this schedule is concerned, I propose to accept the motion in the form proposed.",53

366,Mr HENRY WILLIS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,I Have no intention to dissent from the ruling. I merely asked what the ruling was.,54
367,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Darling Downs-Attorney General) [9.35] - I ask the Committee to retain this item. The object of the Conference, in recommending the item, was to encourage the cultivation of higher grade tobaccos, and the report points out that in their opinion higher grade tobacco is that which bears a valuation of lod. and upwards per lb. in the market. Mr Nevill, the Queensland tobacco expert, who gave evidence before a Royal Commission in Queensland, and is admittedly an authority on tobacco culture, gave practically the same definition, namely, that pipe tobacco which reached 9d. per lb., and cigar tobacco which reached iod. per lb., should be considered higher grade tobaccos.",54

Mr Nevill says- « Cigar Leaf - There is now a demand for limited amount of cigar tobacco at satisfactory prices, and farmers in the coastal districts inclined to go in for growing this character tobacco, and some thirty or forty acres will vantage. probably be planted the coming year, divided between the Coomera and the Cardwell districts, with a small lot at Bowen. For the small perimental lots grown this year very satisfactory prices were obtained. The samples have elicited most favourable comments from the purchaser, with the opinion that an' export demand can be question. created. Should this be so, the demand for these tobaccos will become a large one. lieve it is true that some of the samples show considerable merit, which will be greatly imorable members. proved as the growers become more expert in the growing and handling. These tobaccos should available now. prove very profitable, as in the country north of Bowen two crops per year can be grown, and should yield a ton to the acre-say , 12 cwt. the first crop and S cwt. for the second At 7id. per lb. this would yield £70 This crop can thus be rr.ade a very profitable one to small farmers with growing families, as children of either sex, from 12 to 16 years of age, can be employed to great advantage. I consider the outlook for the future of the tobacco industry in this State as most promising, and if farmers can be induced to take the necessary care both in cultivation and handling, we will gradually displace much of the imported article. Thorough cultivation is very necessary in this crop. We have thus undoubted evidence that the higher grade tobaccos can be grown in Australia. And then Mr Howard Newport, Queensland Instructor in Tropical Agriculture, is thus reported in the Queensland official recordsTobacco - The culture of tobacco is beginning to receive some, though spasmodic, attention. The seasons in the north have been favourable, and it has been shown beyond doubt that a good and valuable quality of cigar leaf can be grown. The experiments at the Kamerunga State Nursery would indicate that with due care the trouble that decimated the crops when an effort was made to grow tobacco some fifteen years a g o blue mould-ma y be avoided, and that there are certain varieties of cigar-leaf tobaccos that would seem especially suited to this district. I think that the honourable member for after hearing these extracts, will admit that the very highest quality of cigarI know that tobacco is orrown in parts of Victoria and parts of New South Wales; what the extent of the cultivation of the higher exgrades, I am not prepared to state.",54

375,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"The information I have is that there is not much of the higher grade tobaccos produced at present; and the exa perts of Queensland are endeavouring to induce the growers to take up the cultivaare tion of the better classes, with the prospect, of if they do so, of reaping considerable adI t is with a view of encouraging the cultivation of cigar leaf that the bounty exis offered; it is not for tobacco generally, which may or may not be sufficiently pro-tected by the existing duty; that is another",54

378,Mr JOHNSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,No doubt the Queensland Department of Agriculture is a very fine institution.,55
379,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"It has done exceedingly good work, and the legislators concerned in its initiation have deserved well of the State; Queensland is particularly fortunate in her experts.",55
380,Mr JOHNSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,I wish we could have such a Department for the Commonwealth.,55
381,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"I hope the day is not far distant when we shall, though I think we shall never supersede the work which the States are doing. If the valuable information collected by the experts in Queensland or New South Wales could be spread abroad by means of a Federal bulletin, good educational work would be done; and I hope it may not be long before we see such a result. In view of the fact that the Queensland Department of Agriculture is making these efforts, I ask the House to stand by this itemi, and to exercise those powers which are exclusively those of the Commonwealth in regard to the granting of bounties.",55
382,Mr KELLY,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Wentworth) [9.40] - When the information before the Committee is analyzed, honourable members will not be so ready to take the step which the Attorney General asks them to take. In the first place, this is a proposal to encourage the cultivation of tobacco "" of a quality to be prescribed."" I am ready to accept the Ministerial assurance that the prescription of the Customs Department will mean something like lo^d. per lb. for a high grade tobacco.",55
383,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,That is the intention.,55
384,Mr KELLY,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"I am willing to accept that assurance, and to waste no more time On that particular point. Now in the evidence before us from the Conference of experts we find that the production of tobacco in Australia in 1904 was nearly 1,500,000 lbs.; that in 1905 it was over 2,000,000 lbs., while in 1906 it was again nearly 1,500,000 lbs. The average production of the last three years has been Something over 1,500,000 lbs. per annum, though the slight falling off in the last year may be owing to the seasons or some other cause of the kind. Bearing in view the production, and the fact that the proposed bounty is 2d. per lb., we find that no less than £12,500 per annum would be absorbed, while we propose to grant only £4,000 a year, or less than one-third required for the annual production, if all were of high grade. It is only for what the Attorney-General is pleased to call high-grade tobacco that we are asked to provide a bounty; but when I asked the Minister what was the proportion of the high-grade tobacco to the whole production of Australia, he could not tell me. The figures I have put before honourable members clearly show that if even only one-third of the tobacco annually grown in Australia at the present time were of high quality, every penny we are now providing as a bounty to encourage new industries, would be paid to people who are already established and conducting their business without any anticipation of Government assistance. That is a point the Minister must answer before he asks the Committee to pass the item. I take it that this is really a bounty to the Tobacco Trust-neithe r more nor less. There is a duty of is. 6d. per lb. on all tobacco entered to be manufactured in the Commonwealth, and the imports for 1905 of unmanufactured tobacco were, according to the report, of the value of £203,000. Is it not to be supposed that the Tobacco Trust will encourage the local production of leaf of the quality it requires, in order to avoid the payment of duty on imported leaf?",55
385,Mr JH CATTS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Does the honourable member object to the Tobacco Trust ?,55
386,Mr KELLY,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Not so long as it conducts its business pronerly and without detriment to trade. That is not the point. I am not here to defend the Trust, but I know that of late years it has imported two high-salaried experts from America to teach our farmers to grow high-grade tobacco. Hitherto they have grown a heavyweight tobacco instead of the stalkless kind that is in demand.",55
387,Mr WILKS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,There has been too much saltpetre in the Australian tobacco.,55
388,Mr KELLY,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Yes . It has been grown I.IJ the rich river flats, instead of on comparatively poor land. This bounty, if paid, will go only to the Trust. Moreover, we should not commit the education of our farmers entirely to interested parties such as the Trust is. Instead of giving a bounty, we could spend our money better by establishing a Commonwealth Agricultural bureau, which would assist the industry very much more than it will be assisted by a maximum payment of £4,000 a year for five years.",55
389,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LETTER DELIVERY BY,The States have already organized Agricultural Departments.,55
390,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,The State of Queensland has given to its farmers special instruction in the growing of tobacco.,56
391,Mr KELLY,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Tobacco is grown in New South Wales as well as in Queensland. Excellent leaf could be produced at Tumut, if the farmers there understood its cultivation. The 'Committee should vote against the item, unless more information in support of the proposal is forthcoming. The report tells us nothing except that three times the 'amount of the bounty could be mopped up by the present growers of tobacco.",56
392,Mr WILKS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Dalley) [9.53] - It seems to me that the measure should be in charge of a Minister such as the Minister of Trade and Customs, who might be supposed to have the necessary technical knowledge and the close acquaintance with Customs rates which is required for the guidance of the Committee. The Bill , however, in the hands of the Attorney-General, who seems to depend chiefly upon his ability a special pleader to induce the Committee to accept the proposals of the Government. To my mind, he knows as little about tobacco-growing as I do, and, although votary of "" My Lady Nicotine,"" I am absoof lutely ignorant in regard to the cultivation of the plant. The honourable member for Wentworth has pointed out that an import duty of is. 6d. per lb. has not hitherto total proved effective to encourage the local duction of tobacco, and therefore it is to be expected that a bounty of 2d. per lb. will do what is aimed at. During the elections the candidates belonging to a very imto vote for this item. portant party announced themselves to be opposed to the establishment of monopolies, and prepared to nationalize those that already exist. But these bounties, if successful, will breed monopolies, which, acment proposal. cording to the members of the Labour Party, must be put down by legislation. Thus they are assisting to create what they decry. But the Tobacco Trust is too powerprescribed. f u l to need assistance from any Legislature. The growing of tobacco has been spoken as a tropical industry; but four of the posals which were before the Committee this afternoon which were called tropical might now well be called ""dropical,"" cause the Attorney-General was soon forced to drop them. Then in a bland, quiet, and courteous manner he deplored the fact that the protectionists were not coming his assistance, with the result that ever since he has had almost robust following, and has carried every item. It is to try to show the weakness of these proposals when the Government can whip up its supporters in this way. The Attorney General is not armed with any technical information to support his special pleading on behalf of this proposal. Hitherto in Australia tobacco has been grown on soil which is too rich for the production of good leaf, and the saltpetre in the leaf has made it unmarketable. I deplore the fact that the Bill has been introduced before the bringing down of the Tariff proposals. This action on the part of the Government has had the effect of disfranchising the constituents of those members of the Committee who aTe. members of the Tariff Commission, because they are unable to speak on the proposals now before us, lest they should make public the conclusions arrived at by the Commission. Under the circumstances it would be is the right thing to move, as a protest against the action of the Government, that as progress be reported; but as Ministers have the numbers behind them, that course would be useless. The proposal before us, if agreed to, will result in the paying a away, within a period of five years, £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 of the taxpayers' money. I would like to see that amount added to the amount which has already been saved upon other items.

I ""do not wish to enprocourage persons to embark upon this enterprise, to incur a huge expenditure, and to produce a leaf which may be worth only be9d. per lb. I have seen splendid tobacco grown in South Australia and at Tumut. The very finest article has been produced in both places, but because the growers to are not acquainted with theproper method of curing the leaf, possibly it might not come up to the prescribed useless standard. As a result, they would have wasted both their time and their capital. 0 Upon the other hand, if we fix too low n standard we shall simply be making a present of the bounty to the Tobacco Combine. If honourable members will turn to the report they will seeSome of the best qualities of leaf have a value as high as 5s. per lb., while over twenty years .ago some Northern Territory tobacco sold by auction at Hamburg at the rate of 2s. n d . per lb. Against this we have the fact that the tobacco at present being produced in the Commonwealth has a merchantable value of only About 4d. to 6d. per lb. Surely some of the tobacco produced in the Commonwealth must have been worth more than from 4d. to 6d. per lb., but if we fix the standard at 9d. or i o d . per - lb., there is no hope of our growers reaping any benefit whatever from the proposed bounty. I understand that the idea underlying the proposal to restrict the payment of the bounty to high-grade tobacco, is the encouragement of the cigar trade in Australia, and I do recognise that outside the Combine there are many cigarmakers. At the same time, I want to be sure that we are going to afford the growers an opportunity to earn this bounty. Unless the Attorney-General can show that they will have that opportunity, if tobacco be grown in suitable localities, I shall vote against the Government proposal, and shall favour the imposition of a higher duty upon that commodity.",56

The Government proposal, if adopted, may the production - of about 1 cwt. of picked leaf of the quality necessary to earn the bounty, but that is all. In exactly the same way we frequently read in the newspapers that a particular individual has obtained from 2S. to 3s. per lb. for lamb's wool. But when we look at the list of sales we find that only one or two specially selected bales have realized those high prices. What we want to insure is the production of a tobacco leaf of good quality, which will command a ready sale. If the present duty of is. 6d. per lb. upon that article is not high enough, let us increase it , but do not let us offer a bounty for its production. One honourable member has said that our soil is unsuitable for tobacco culture because of the saltpetre which it contains. I would point out that in Manilla it is impossible to grow tobacco upon land which does not contain saltpetre. That is the difference between Manilla and Havanna tobaccos. There is no saltpetre in Havanna soils and consequently a purer leaf can be obtained there for cigar-making. But cigars can be produced in Manilla which are equal in quality to 75 per cent, of those imported from Havanna. I visited Manilla some two and a half years ago when the present Secretary for War in the United States was the Governor there. He assured me that the cigars produced in Manilla were better than 75 per cent, of those obtainable in America. The mere presence of saltpetre in the soil does not prevent tobacco of a good marketable value being produced. But if the bounty is to be of any use to growers, we shall require to fix thestandard price at 8d. per lb. Some honourable members have said that if we fix the standard too low we shall be making a present of the bounty to the combine. I need scarcely point out that, hitherto the combine has chiefly devoted its attention to imported tobaccos. I claim that we can grow tobacco in Australia equal to any that is imported. It is fit for smoking purposes, although I do not think it is suitable for cigar making.",57
401,Mr WATSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Are not cigars made out of a different variety of leaf?,57
402,Mr WYNNE,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Yes . The industry merely requires to be granted assistance. To my mind it would be better for us to be increase the duty upon tobacco than to offer a bounty to stimulate its production.,57

If we are to grant a bounty, let us care that it shall be given for the growth of the leaf itself. If a crop does realise more than 6d. per lb., it is the fortune of the grower, who has to contend with many difficulties. I am not prepared to say that the tobacco plant tropical one. As a matter of fact, it is grown all over Australia, and I have seen experimental plots of it in some of cities of the Commonwealth.

I deal with one or two points that have been raised by the honourable and learned member for Balaclava, and the honourable member have it inspected there. for Hindmarsh, as to the quality of the tobacco in respect of which the bounty is form. to be paid. Although the Conference of experts recommended that the bounty should be paid only on tobacco leaf realizevening, ing not less than a certain price, named the report, the Government recognised that prices frequently fluctuate; that they pend largely upon varying conditions, and may be affected by manipulations of the market. In these circumstances, we conRiverina, sidered it advisable to simply provide that the bounty ""should be paid on high-grade tobacco leaf of a quality to be prescribed. This will insure the production of a better class of tobacco leaf than is now being grown. The class of leaf that we wish encourage is that which is at present bringing about 9d. or iod. per lb. It would be impossible, however, to provide-in the Bill that the bounty shall be paid only in spect of such tobacco as is now bringing 9d. or iod. per lb. As was pointed out by the honourable and' learned member for Balaclava, as the result of operations the market, tobacco leaf now bringing iod. per lb. might later on realise only 8d.",59

419,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"We have left the quality to be determined by regulations to be prescribed on advice received.

It is a highly redesirable form in which to give a bounty; that is to say, to give it for the production of high-grade tobacco. The difficulties connected with the production of a fine quality on of leaf are infinitely greater than those which apply to the growing of the common or garden varieties, of which we have plenty in Australia. The production of high-class tobacco is largely a matter of experiment and suitability of soil. . Such experiments are exceedingly costly. I have in my possession certain figures, which are not at the moment available, but which I should like to bring before the Committee.

448,Mr HUTCHISON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"There is no standard rate of pay in regard to the cultivation of tobacco in the Commonwealth. I do not desire to encourage people to grow tobacco unless I am sure they will get the bounty, because it is an industry which requires a good deal of capital. I find that it is now determined not to fix a price, but the quality as the standard; and I desire to know what that quality is to be. Is the bounty to be paid only on leaf which is used for cigars of the better class, or is it to be on leaf such as is used by the Combine? If the latter be the case, the bounty will be a present to the Combine.",61
449,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,In fixing the standard of quality we must take expert advice.,61

455,Mr HUTCHISON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Exactly . If the ""better classes"" of leaf spoken of by the Minister are to include the leaf used by the Combine, then the latter will get the bounty- a result of which no one can approve. When I look at the difficulty which workers in the tobacco trade have at the present time to obtain anything like a decent wage and steady employment, I object tc; the Combine receiving £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 for nothing in return. The growers will be entirely in the hands of the Combine, and that is what I wish to avoid. If the Minister can show me that he can fix the grade so that the leaf grown up to the standard required will be used principally by the manufacturers of cigars, many of whom are outside the Combine, I shall be willing to vote for the item. But if the bounty is to be given to the growers of leaf for the Combine, I shall vote against it . [42]- 2 - ",61
456,Mr TUDOR,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Yarra) [10.46] - It is amusing to hear some honourable members on the other side cheer when it is stated by any one in this corner that the proposed bounty will go to the Combine. I have not the slightest doubt that they know more about the Combine than does any one on this side. Hitherto they have always been ready to denounce any hdnorable member for stating that there was a combine.,61

460,Mr TUDOR,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"When the honourable member for Kalgoorlie moved a motion for the nationalization of the tobacco industry, members of the party to which the honourable member belongs, both here and in another place, stated time after time that no combine was in existence. But in their anxiety to-night to omit an item, they are willing to cheer any honourable member who states that the bounty will go to the Combine. I am as much against this Combine as I am against any other trust or monopoly. I am not anxious to put £ 2 0 , 0 0 0, or any - less sum, into the pockets of the Tobacco Combine; but if the Ministry can give me an assurance that they will so frame the regulations that the tobacco leaf will be graded, and that the bounty will be paid to the growers, and not to the Combine, I shall be prepared to vote for the item.",61

I read from the report of Mr. Neville, showing the vast field that there is in Queensland for growing cigar leaf, and that certainly will be prescribed in the regulation. In reply to the honourable member for Yarra, I may say that the Bill provides that the bounty shall be paid to the growers, and the regulation will be so framed that it will be paid to them, iust as the sugar bounty is paid to the grower.",61
462,Mr WILSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,The Combine will fix the 1 price of the leaf.,61
463,Mr GROOM,LETTER DELIVERY BY,The honourable member is trying to raise a. false issue. I shall ask the Department to try to meet the objection of the honourable member for Yarra in framing the regulation.,61
464,Mr FRAZER,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Kalgoorlie) [10.50] - I certainly am not satisfied with the proposal as it stands. A few years ago, I moved a motion in favour of the nationalization of the tobacco industry; and, on looking over the data which I then gave to the House, I find that there is no reason to believe other than that in Australia there is almost a complete monopoly in regard to tobacco. I do not think that my honourable friends opposite will deny that statement. We have to face this position, that, no matter what bounty we may pay on the production of leaf here, it is very likely that the effort of Parliament to encourage the bringing of a substantial acreage under tobacco crop will be frustrated for the simple reason that there is only one buyer in the Commonwealth, and that that buyer .is part of a combine which is world wide. There have been times when the production of tobacco was a very considerable industry in the Commonwealth, particularly in Victoria. In 1880, 1,941,296 lbs. of leaf were grown in Australia, but about sixteen years later, the production had fallen to 802,000 lbs. reduction resulted from the. concentrated energies of those who were buying tobacco from Australian producers and the consequent reduction of the price which was' offered for Australian leaf. The reason for that state of things was very exhaustively explained by me when I submitted my motion. The combination which is interested in the Combine in Australia has its' interest in plantations in other parts of - the world, chiefly in .America, where they can produce tobacco leaf at a very much less cost than can be done in Australia, pay the border duties, and still place the article on our market at a lower cost than.that at which it could be produced here. If I thought that the granting of a bounty would encourage to any extent the production of tobacco leaf in Australia, I should be prepared to give this item very serious consideration. But because I believe that if we placed a percentage per lb. on the tobacco it would lead to the Combine offering a lower price, and leave the grower in the same position as he now occupies, I think-especiall y in view of the very limited data which the Minister has submitted-that it is advisable to give the item more serious consideration before we come to a decision. The Ministry have been very successful with the items in the schedule. They have.not been met with any factious opposition. In fact, no very serious opposition has been offered to any proposal when it has been shown that there was a reasonable prospect that the bounty would lead to the establishment of an industry which would be for the good of the Commonwealth. When, however, there is a consensus of opinion from all quarters of the Chamber that the proposed bounty will be a gift to a powerful financial institution in Australia, and that it will not be of any use to those for whom it is primarily designed, I think that the Attorney-General should not take too serious a view of the' suggestion to delete the item at the present time. On the information which has been presented, I am prepared to vote in favour of its omission.",62
465,Mr HUTCHISON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Hindmarsh) [10.54]. - I am not satisfied with the explanation given by the Minister, because while he has led us to understand that the high grade leaf will be used in the manufacture of cigars, he has merely said that the The cigar-leaf will be included, and consequently it will still be used in the manufacture of tobacco, and the bounty will go to the Combine. I believe that honourable members generally are of opinion that we should encourage the growing of high-class tobacco for cigar-making; but we* should certainly state our object plainly, and so frame the provision that there will be no fear of the bounty going into the hands of the Combine. I am not ready to leave this to the Minister, and consequently T wish to move an amendment, striking out the words ""of a quality to be prescribed"" in order to substitute the words "" for use in the manufacture of cigars.""",62
466,The CHAIRMAN,LETTER DELIVERY BY,There is an amendment now before the Committee.,62
467,Mr BRUCE SMITH,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Parkes) [10.57]. - The honourable member for Hindmarsh has pointed to a weak spot in this proposal, and the honourable member for Boothby has drawn attention to the same defect. The Minister in charge of the measure is endeavouring to persuade the Committee that .we should delegate to him our legislative powers, by permitting him to make regulation? governing this matter. But we have had experience of the result of such action. I recollect many successful attempts on the psrr of the Acting Prime Minister to satisfy supporters that their wishes would be duly met in the framing of regulations. We know the inconvenience which was occasioned to the industrial and commercial world by the regulations which we trusted the right honourable member for Adelaide and the honourable member for Hume, at - different times, to frame under the Customs and Commerce Acts. We are told - that the bounty .is to be given for the production of a certain class of tobacco, which, the Minister has repeatedly assured us, will be defined by regulation. ' Mr Frazer - The tobacco Combine will get the bounty.",62
468,Mr BRUCE SMITH,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"That is a danger which. I , as well as the honourable member, wish to avert. I should regard this proposal much more favourably if I were siire that the bounty would be paid to the growers themselves. The honourable membei has, apparently, made a close study of the trust, and if, as he states, the tobacco trade is wholly in the hands of this organization, it will be able to take the whole benefit of the bounty.' The Committee naturally asks that the class of tobacco for which the bounty is to be given shall be defined in the schedule. It is spoken r/f vaguely as ""high-grade."" The Minister has told us that a regulation will prescribe what is meant by those words. But, notwithstanding his repeated assurances in regard to this and many other matters which have been before us during the debate, the impression on my mind is that he knows' as little about this subject as I do, which is practically nothing at all. I ' ask honourable members whether they are prepared to hand over their legislative powers to the Minister, instead of insisting upon having a definition embodied in the schedule. Some intelligent amendment such as the honourable member for Hindmarsh wishes to move is required.",63

472,Mr BRUCE SMITH,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"I am ready to - collaborate with the honourable member for Hindmarsh tomorrow, or to-night if he - wishes.

473,Mr JOHNSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Lang) [11.5] - As I understand it is the desire of the honourable member for - Hindmarsh to move a prior amendment in this particular item, I ask leave to temporarily withdraw my amendment. Of course I reserve to myself the right to again submit it after the proposal of the honourable member for Hindmarsh has been disposed of.",63

My proposal, if adopted, will have the effect of confining the bounty to a leaf which is suitable for the manufacture of cigars, and consequently the difficulty which was pointed out by the honourable and learned member for Parkes will disappear. I propose to' still allow the leaf to be "" of a quality to be prescribed,"" because I ob'ject to fixing a price for the article.",63
479,Mr FRAZER,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Will the cigars be sold at ten for a shilling?,63
480,Mr HUTCHISON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,The honourable member could not have looked at the proposal. He must know that it is impossible to make cigars of a high-grade tobacco at a very low figure.,63
481,Mr KELLY,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Wentworth) [n.11] - I desire to ask the honourable member for Hindmarsh whether it is not a fact that certain cigarette tobaccos are also of a high grade, and that enormous quantities of these tobaccos are annually imported by the Trust. I have seen some of these tobaccos, and it has been pointed out to me why they excel the local product. I think that the amendment scarcely meets the situation, inasmuch as it deals with only half the product.",63
482,Mr HUTCHISON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"- I would not allow cigarettes to be manufactured at all, if I had my way.",64
483,Mr KELLY,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"But neither the honourable member's nor my own predilections in the matter of what we shall smoke concern the issue. If he wishes to meet the situation, he will be content to include cigarettes in his amendment.",64

CONTRACT IMMIGRANTS : IMMIGRATION Sir WILLIAM LYNE '(Hume-Trea surer) [11.25]-- I move That the House do now adjourn. I promised the honourable member for Newcastle, in answer to questions, to obtain information on two subjects. One was .with reference to labourers coming into Australia, of whom a number had gone to'Newcastle. I asked to be informed whether they were coming in under contract.. The reply I have received isAlmost all the immigrants now arriving are not under contract. Except in the case of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company's. 341 men, only a very few isolated individuals are under, contract. In these cases the terms of the agreement have been approved by the Minister. The other question had reference also to immigration. Advertisements were produced one night last week as having been circulated by the Immigration League of Australia. 1 caused a letter to be sent to Dr Arthur, addressed care of the Immigration League of Australia, Sydney. This is the replyTHE IMMIGRATION LEAGUE, OF'AUSTRALIA. The Secretary, Department of External Affairs, Melbourne, Victoria. Sir, I have to inform you that your letter of the 24th instant, No. 07/7114, was placed before a meeting of the Executive Committee of this league yesterday, and I am instructed to advise you as follows :-That this league is not aware of any sum of money being given to "" Dr Arthur's Immigration League, nor is the Committee cognizant of the existence of any such body. The Immigration League of Australia, .whose offices arc in Sydney, have, however, received sums of money from the. Federal Government. The committee of this league are not in any way responsible for the advertisement referred to in your letter under reply, appearing in the newspapers of the United Kingdom or - elsewhere. Further, the committee are unacquainted with Mr John Craigs. ' In fairness to this league, I trust you will give publicity to this letter - I have the honour to be, sir, your obedient servant, HERBERT E. EASTOK, Hon. Secretary.",64
499,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Is that the league of which Dr Arthur is president?,65
500,Mr WATSON,LETTER DELIVERY BY,I think it is.,65
501,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"The letter from the Secretary of the Department of External Affairs was addressed to .Dr Arthur, and this is the reply received to it. ' . Mr WATKINS (Newcastle) [11.27] It is singular that the responsibility for the advertisements appearing in newspapers published in most of the coal-mining centres LEAGUE. of England cannot be fixed. If my memory serves me rightly, some of these advertisements state that intending immigrants must ' Le approved by the Agent-General of New South Wales, and that £ 6 will be given towards the passage money of. each man selected. . We have an Immigration League seeking, by its own methods, to encourage immigration, yet no one appears to accept the responsibility for these advertisements. I trust that the vote passed for advertising Australia Will be used in a legitimate way, and will not he handed over to any irresponsible body for distribution.",65
502,Mr JH CATTS,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"Cook) [11.28] Complaints have been made on several occasions as to misleading advertisements appearing in the English newspapers,- and a (Sgd.) ATI.EE HUNT. number of attempts have been made to ascertain their' origin. We ought to have some means of learning who is responsible for these misrepresentations. The Ministry might well take the matter in hand and invite the Agents-General to endeavour to discover who is inserting these advertisements. We shall then be able to properly apportion' the blame, and know what steps to take to prevent the Commonwealth being misrepreSydney, 26th Julyi 1907. sented by advertisements published without ' the sanction of responsible bodies in Australia. The Acting Prime Minister might very well, in the interests of all parties, prosecute this inquiry, in order that we may ascertain who is responsible for advertisements ' not only misrepresenting Australia, but inviting coal miners and other labourers to come here to compete in an already overcrowded labour market. It would be most unsatisfactory to leave the matter at its present stage, and I hope that the Government will take steps to have the question definitely settled. Sir 'WILLIAM . LYNE (Hume Treasurer)'[11.29] - Like thehonorablemember for Cook, I feel that weought to know who is responsible, for these advertisements. I have seen one or two which, to my mind, are highly improper; but I do not know yet whether I can' take any further step, in the matter.",65
503,Mr KELLY,LETTER DELIVERY BY,Does not the Minister want miners to come to Australia?,65
504,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LETTER DELIVERY BY,"All I can say is that I have seen in English newspapers one or two advertisements that ought never to have been published. I am anxious to find out who is responsible for them, but I ' cannot make any definite promise to the honourable member for Cook as to what action will be taken. I shall, however, cause further inquiries to be made. Question resolvied in the affirmative. House adjourned at ix.31 p.m.",66
