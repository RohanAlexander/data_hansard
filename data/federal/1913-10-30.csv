3,Mr GROOM,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"I do not know who are the authorities referred to, but no such representations as are mentioned have reached the Department in Melbourne.

Last week some general statements appeared in a newspaper, but no name was attached to them. I brought them under Defence. the notice of the officers in Sydney, - a view to a report being made upon them, and I have received their report, but have not yet had an opportunity examine it in detail. Generally it shows that the allegations were not sustained. Accompanying the report is a statement by several patients, members the Public Service, expressing the fullest and most complete satisfaction with that was done on their behalf when were confined in the quarantine area.",13

I ask whether, under these circumstances, the Government will suspend the operation of the quarantine the for the week, to enable people to come the to a carnival here, and to test the efficacy of the quarantine in preventing the fit for other spread of small-pox?",13

12,Mr GLYNN,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"The matter of having Australia represented in connection with the Panama Exposition is under consideration. This Government has offered to contribute £20,000 towards the expense, and the States have twice been written to, asking if they will co-operate in any way. Replies have been received, and I hope that we shall have a representation worthy of our importance and of the occasion. '",13
13,Mr WATKINS,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"I desire to ask the Minister of External Affairs whetlier, before deciding to devote £20,000 to the representation of the Commonwealth at the Panama Exposition, he will take into consideration the action of the United States Government in giving preference to American shipping as against Australian shipping on the west coast of America, and more particularly in regard to the Panama Canal?",14
14,Mr GLYNN,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,I think that the question of the representation of the Commonwealth at the Exposition is quite independent of other relations with America.,14
15,Mr WATKINS,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,But this preference is holding up our coal trade.,14
16,Mr GLYNN,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"The question raised by the honourable member relates more directly to diplomatic relations between the I m perial Government and the Government of the United States of America. Apar t from that altogether, and from the in terest in American matters that we share with the other parts of the Empire, our relation with the Pacific, I think, as well as our friendship with the United States of America, justifies our taking a separate stand in regard to this matter. I have not ;illowed the question raised by the honourable member to interfere to any extent with what I may describe as my enthusiasm in legard to the representation of Australia at the Panama Exposition. I am afraid that I did not recognise the full scope of the question put to me by the honourable member for New England a few moments ago. I think that he asked whether steps had been taken to have the Commonwealth permanently represented in the United States of America. That matter is also under consideration, as well as the possibility of establishing some trade representatives in Canada. PAINTERSINTHE POSTA L or Andy ? DEPARTMENT.",14

One set of these employees, I understand, is receiving 8s. 5d. per day, while the union rate for painters is l is . per day.

21,Mr SPEAKER,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"The honourable member will not be in order in founding a question on a newspaper statement, and reading from the newspaper.  sonal explanation, Mr Speaker, I desire to state that the Prime Minister is reported in this morning's issue of the Age to have addressed a meeting held last night under the auspices of the Women's National League, and in that report we have the following statement: At this point a member of the audience shouted - "" You are not the man Andy Fisher is ! "" "" No,"" retorted Mr Cook : "" I am glad I am not, and today he played a dirty political trick."" Interjector - What , Andy ? Mr Cook - Yes , Andy. I say this same Andy played a dirty political trick. That is a strong statement to make, but I am going to prove it. We had "" paired"" men who wanted to go to Mr Knox's funeral, and the Opposition took advantage of their absence to force a division. The party would not honor the "" pairs.""",14
22,Mr MCDONALD,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,That was a deliberate lie.  Interjector - Was it the Labour party's whips,14
23,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"I rise to order. I call your attention, Mr Speaker, to the fact that the ex-Speaker is accusing me of deliberate lying.",14
24,Mr SPEAKER,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"I did not catch the interjection full y , but understood it to apply to something in a newspaper. I understood the honourable member for Maranoa to be reading a newspaper report, in regard to which he desired to make a personal explanation, since there was something in the report relating to himself.  myself.",15
25,Mr SPEAKER,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"An y t h in g contained in a' newspaper report is outside the cognisance of the House, and cannot be taken notice of. Unless the honourable member is prepared to accept responsibility for the accuracy of the statement, I do not know that he is quite in order in making a personal explanation in reference to it ; but I cannot decide that point until he has proceeded further.",15
26,Mr KELLY,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"The point of order submitted by the Prime Minister was that the honourable member for Kennedy was not in order in interjecting during the reading of a newspaper report of an utterance said to have beeu made by the Prime Minister that "" That is a deliberate l i e .

At the same time, I would point out that all interjections are disorderly, and that interjections when made the medium of some offensive reference are particularly disorderly. honourable member for Maranoa will proceed.  continues- Interjector - Was it the Labour party's whips or Andy? Mr Cook - Let us be frank. They were both in it. Mr Fisher played the trick of taking the business out of our hands, and the rest was done   and said he had promised to "" pair"" for Mr. Bruce Smith, who was at the funeral. 'He could not get him a pair, and when our whips said,  said, "" Yes, but I cannot drive my man out."" ""What do yuu think of conduct like that?"" asked the Prime Minister. Interjector - You cannot blame Andy Fisher for that. [98] Mr Cook - I say that if Andrew Fisher had behaved as he ought to have done he would have said, "" If nobody else will go out, I will honor my whip's promise and go out myself."" MINISTERI AL MEMBEBS - Hear , hear!  posite will not be applauding a moment or two hence. I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether this statement is correct ?",15

32,Mr SPEAKER,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"The honourable member, after reading a newspaper statement, asked the Prime Minister whether it was correct.

The honourable member for Parkes never asked me for a pair, and I never promised him a pair. The only two members to whom I promised pairs were the Treasurer and the honourable member for Kooyong; and If a it h full y kept my promise.

44,Mr SPEAKER,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"I have just heard a remark by the honourable member for Adelaide, implying that I am discriminating between one honourable member and another, and I must ask him to withdraw the reflection on the Chair. Further, I think that the honourable member for Maranoa is going beyond the bounds of a personal explanation.",16
45,Mr ROBERTS,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"I am afraid, Mr. Speaker, that you are somewhat tender today.",16
46,Mr SPEAKER,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,The honourable member is again reflecting on the Chair.,16

48,Mr SPEAKER,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,I must ask the Prime Minister to withdraw that word.,16
49,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,I withdraw the word; I am sorry.,16

I do not know any one, so far as pairs are concerned in this matter, except the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, another honourable member, whose name I forget, the Treasurer, and the member for Kooyong; and all these are accounted for quite easily. A f t e r the division was taken I found out that there were some of our members away, particularly the honourable member for Fremantle, to whom I had promised a pair, and I paired him with the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, while I Our party paired the honourable member for West Sydney with the honourable member for Werriwa.

"" So f ar as I am concerned, I did not know the names of any who went to the funeral, with the exception of those whom I have mentioned. Furthermore, no name was ever mentioned to me until a vote was taken, as that of a member whom I should pair.",17

56,Mr SPEAKER,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"Whil e it is perfectly true that I have no official cognisance of the pair-book,- still I have official cognisance of the fact that the Prime Minister, has cast a reflection on another honourable member in relation to something concerning his conduct, as a member of the House.",17
57,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"What I suggest is that my honourable friend went to the pair-book after the event, and proceeded to pair our live men with his own dead ones. My statement is perfectly correct. The honourable member for Maranoa has said too much about the pair-book today. [98]- 2",17
58,Mr MCDONALD,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,I rise to a point of order. I feel very sorry to interrupt the Prime Minister.,17
59,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,I am sure of that !,17
60,Mr MCDONALD,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"Whether the Prime Minister is sure or not, is of no moment. Is the honourable gentleman in order in making a personal explanation in a matter in which he is not personally in volved ? It is a question between the Whips, and not one for the Prime Minister. If the Prime Minister is allowed to proceed, shall I also be allowed to make a personal explanation in connection with the matter?",17
61,Mr SPEAKER,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"So far as the Prime Minister is concerned, his name was specifically mentioned in connection with something that was read out of a newspaper, and which formed the basis of the personal explanation by the honourable member for Maranoa. As the name of the Prime Minister was specifically mentioned in that, I took it that he desired to make some personal explanation, and as the question of pairs is so much involved in the matter, I do not see how I can rightly Every one separate the. one matter from the other.",17
62,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"I am making a personal explanation in reference to some Hon- statements of the Opposition Whip. The honourable member asked me if certain statements appearing in the newspaper were substantially correct. I say now that the report is correct, and that the facts are as set out in the press. The honourable member will recollect that in his personal explanation last night he referred by name to the honourable member for Parkes. ",17
63,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,I heard it . Several Honourable Members interjecting,17
64,Mr SPEAKER,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,The Prime Minister is entitled to make his statement without interruption. I ask honourable members to refrain from a chorus of interruptions.,17
65,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"The facts are on record in both of this morning's papers. The honourable member said that he tried to get pairs, but could not drive his men out of the Chamber. I ask him is that correct?",17
66,Mr ANSTEY,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,It is not correct.,17
67,Mr SPEAKER,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"Jus t a moment ago I asked honourable members not to persist in interrupting. I ask honourable members to observe my directions, otherwise I must reluctantly take another course. Conversations are disorderly when the Speaker is on his feet. I ask honourable members to allow the business to be carried on in accordance with decorum and decency.",17
68,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,The following passage that I have from the report of yesterday's proceedings is sufficient for my purpose: Mr John Thomson - You promised to see that pairs would be given.  bers go out of the Chamber if they will not do So.,18
69,Mr TUDOR,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,Did he mention the name of the honourable member for Parkes?.,18
70,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"Will the honourable member hold his tongue, if he can ? The statement of the honourable member for Maranoa today is that he told his opponents that nothing would be done. Something was done.",18
71,Mr TUDOR,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,B y you.,18
72,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"Honourable members know that there was a gross breach of f a i th somewhere, and the gross breach of faith took place on the initiative of a Prime Minister.",18

74,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,Of an ex-Prime Minister. Several Honourable Members interjecting,18

76,Mr SPEAKER,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,The honourable member for' Barrier is again out of order. I ask the honourable member to apologize for interrupting immediately after being called to order.,18
77,Mr THOMAS,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"I apologize to you for in any way coming in conflict with the Chair, but I thought an honourable member could say that another honourable member was telling the truth .",18
78,Mr SPEAKER,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"The honourable member must not misrepresent the position. He was interjecting two or three times when I called him to order, and then I had to call him specifically by the name of his electorate, upon which he immediately interjected again. It is not in order - for an honourable member i mmediately he is called to order and asked to apologize for disregarding the directions of the Chair, to apologize and then ask whether it is out of order to tell another honourable member that he is telling the truth . I . ask the honourable member to apologize unreservedly.",18
79,Mr THOMAS,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"I apologize with pleasure, but I thought It was strange to be called to order for saying that another honourable member was telling the truth .",18
80,Mr SPEAKER,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,The honourable member was hot asked to apologize because of that. It was because he again interjected after he was called to order for interjecting two or three times. Statements whether truth f u l or otherwise which are couched in offensive terms are not permissible.,18
81,Mr HIGGS,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"On a point of order, is the Prime Minister in order in making an attack on the Leader of the Opposition under cover of a personal explanation ?",18
82,Mr SPEAKER,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"In the course of making a personal explanation, the Prime Minister would not be in order in making an attack on another honourable member; but the Prime Minister has not proceeded to any greater length than the honourable member for Maranoa, to whom I allowed some latitude, was allowed to go in similar circumstances.",18
83,Mr HIGGS,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,Then this is a debate.,18
84,Mr SPEAKER,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"Order I I ask all honourable members who have occasion to make personal explanations, to confine themselves as much as possible to their explanations, and leave personalities out of the matter altogether.",18
85,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"I am unable to leave personalities out of this matter, 'because personalities are the gravamen of the charge of the honourable member. The honourable member for Maranoa said today, as well as yesterday, that he had promised our Whip that nothing would happen. ",18
86,Mr JOSEPH CODK,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,Then I say something did happen.  it.,18
87,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"Therefore , whoever caused it , there was a breach of faith, and I say that the immediate cause of that breach of f a i th was the Leader of the Opposition, and that breach of f a it h occurred most regrettably and unfortunately in connection with the burial of one of our late members.",18
88,Mr SPEAKER,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"Order ! This matter has got beyond the mere question of personal explanation, and has developed into an acrimonious debate; that cannot be permitted. Personal explanations should be confined merely to making clear somefuneral. thing that 'has not been made clear in connection with anything that has been did said, or to correcting any misrepresentaor tions in regard to anything that may have been said or done. Under cover of makI ing a personal explanation, an honourable member must not make charges or attacks upon another honourable member. Mr FISHEE, - B y way of personal explanation, I may say that there has been a correct statement made by the Prime Minister regarding myself since opened his mouth in the Chamber today. I knew nothing of the circumstances; had even escaped my mind that the funeral of the late Mr Knox was to take place yesterday afternoon. No communication passed between our Whip and myself. The reason why I spoke immesay diately following the Treasurer is given ister. in the opening sentences of my speech. The carefully prepared statement read by the Treasurer was of such a character that it would have misled a large number of innocent electors if it went out uncommatter of the pair-book. mented on in the same newspapers and probably in the same Hansard. fore, I attacked the subject immediately, but under grave difficulties, because my lack of exact information. I dealt with it in half my speech right off, and that were announced. then - I appealed to the only Minister present, the Minister of Trade and Cusing toms, to be allowed to continue the half of my speech at some future date. The Minister said he would like to sult the Prime Minister about it . I not have the slightest doubt that my quest would be readily granted, i cordance with the practice of this ment. I had no knowledge of any rangement with regard to pairs.

89,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,Did you not know why the Treasurer was away?,19
90,Mr FISHER,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"I did not know that a single honourable member was going to the I did not know of it until after the division. The Treasurer, in speaking, not mention it . I believe there were one two members to whom he told something, but what that was I do not know. f he did utter anything about it , I did not hear it . It was outside my knowledge. Honourable members can believe me or not. There is not a word of truth in what the Prime Minister has said connot cerning myself. I am not called upon to traverse the things he has said. It is he enough for the people of the Commonwealth, and I believe for my colleagues, it to hear me say that there was nothing premeditated in connection with yesterday's affair, and that it was accidental.",19
91,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"Oh , accidental?",19
92,Mr FISHER,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,There is temptation to something regarding the Prime M in The honourable gentleman thinks every one has a mind like his own.,19
93,Mr MASSYGREENE,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"I wish to make a personal explanation in regard to the I wish to relate the circumstances of what actually Therehappened. A f t e r the division was taken and the House adjourned, I approached of the honourable member for Maranoa and asked him to fix up the pairs I took the book and wrote the standing pair existbetween the honourable member for other Barker and the honourable member for Dalley, and . thenproceeded to the contwo pairs announced in the House by did the honourable member for Maranoa im remediately after the division, namely, n acthe honourable member for Maranoa Parliawith the Treasurer, and the honorarable member for Kalgoorlie with the These two pairs I put into the book. I said to the Opposition Whi p that I would not recognise any other pairs The honourable my member for Maranoa then proceeded to some write in the book a number of pairs, among which were two to which I took u t I particular objection. These were the pairs of the honourable member for W i m immera with the honourable member for the Cook, and the honourable member for East Sydney. I said that the honorablo members for Cook and East Sydney had not been here this week, and that I would not, in the circumstances, accept them as pairs for that particular division. An y one who has knowledge of this particular class of work would never, in the circumstances, dream of accepting those gentlemen as pairs.",19
94,Mr MATHEWS,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,That is a piece of pertinence.,20
95,Mr MASSYGREENE,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"The particular point where I am concerned is the latter one. I said to the honourable member for Maranoa, "" I will not accept those pairs."" He said, "" You can strike them out, or do what you like with them."" I struck them out. ",20
96,Mr MASSYGREENE,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"Subsequentl y I admitted that as the honourable member for East Sydney and the honourable member for Corio were both absent, so far as I was concerned, I was perfectly willing that those two should be paired.",20
97,Mr ROBERTS,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"I desire to make a personal explanation. I took part yesterday in an incident that resulted in the defeat of the Ministry, and the Prime Minister has been pleased to refer to that as a breach of faith .",20
98,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"I rise to order. I. do not think that in connection with whole of these proceedings I have menstarted tioned the honourable member's name. submit, therefore, that he has no right to make a personal explanation.",20

107,Mr ROBERTS,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"The incident to which I desire to refer took place yesterday, and has been characterized by the Prime M in ister as a gross breach of faith . So far as I am personally concerned, quite apart from any general statement made by the honourable member forMaranoa on this side relating to pairs, or what would or would not happen, there was no decision arrived at respecting pairs so far as the Government Whi p was concerned, because the immediately the Leader of the Opposition to speak yesterday, in reply to the I Treasurer, the Government Whip came to me, sat down between the honourable member for Yarra and myself, and informed to me that the honourable member for Maranoa, our Whip, could not be f o u n d ; that some Government members had gone away to a funeral ; and he asked if I would to undertake the duty of pairing on behalf of our Whip, and generally assume the late duties of W h i p on this side, because he desired pairs for those members of his side who had gone to the funeral. I dismemtinctly declined to undertake any such not duty. He asked me if anything would rehappen. I declined to say whether anysome thing would or would not happen. I did pronot know of anything that was about to is happen, neither was I aware that the Prime Minister would refuse our leader leave to continue his speech on anotiier n one day. These facts are borne out by what took place at the time. The Government Whip was so anxious to get pairs for members on his side who had gone away that actually started to argue with me, and had to go to his own side of the House order that the Leader of the Opposiadtion might be allowed to speak. In those circumstances I had the clearest possible intimation from the Government Whip, firstly, that our Whi p was out of the House, and could not he found ; and, secondly, that members of his own side had gone away to attend the funeral of one of their late colleagues; thirdly, that he had not paired his members; fourthly, that he wanted pairs for them becausei they were absent; fifthly, that our members were here to be paired if they so desired; and, sixthly, that I declined to do what he wanted.

109,Mr MASSYGREENE,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"That is so. I had forgotten it for the moment, as I admitted to the honourable member afterwards. The statement of facts by the honourable member for Adelaide is materially correct. It was the fact that I knew there was a general arrangement as to pairs with the Opposition Whip, aud that I could not find him to adjust the pairs, that led me to go to the honourable member for Adelaide, and ask him for assistance i u fixing matters up.

Statutory .Rules 1913, No. 261 INSPECTI ON OF PRODUCE. Debate resumed from 2nd October (vide page 1767), on motion by Mr ATKIN SONThat, in the opinion of this House, the Commonwealth should forthwith take over the inspection and effective control of produce passing, from State to State.",21
123,Mr ATKINSON,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"Wilmot) [3.29] When I moved the motion, I pointed out that, although its adoption would necessitate slight changes in the machinery now used for the inspection of producepassing from State to State, the consequences would be of great value to the trading community. If what I propose were adopted, there would be in the inspection of produce passing from State to State, and a more Federal feeling would exist than is occasionally found. At the present time, when some disease affecting produce breaks out, unfederal' feeling is occasionally aroused by the uncertainty of the action likely to be taken by the authorities of the States other than that in which the disease has appeared. No one connected with the produce business knows exactly what will be done. When the produce of one State is rejected by another, the consigning State feels that it has been treated. But if the work of inspection were done by Federal officers, the consignors of produce would know that were being dealt with by impartial rities, and the ill-feeling which is now created would be unknown. This subject has often been discussed here during the past six or seven years, and attention has been drawn to the confusion that is frequently created under the present arrangements. For instance, last year, or the year before, some potatoes were shipped from Melbourne to Queensland. Before leaving Melbourne they had been passed by the Victorian inspectors, on arriving in Queensland they were condemned by the inspectors of that They were brought back to Melbourne, and after they had been lying on the wharf for some time, the Victorian spectors again looked through them, and declared them to be still sound. still earlier occasion some potatoes which had been _ rejected at Sydney were returned fo the port of shipment, put into different bags, sent back to Sydney, and on the second occasion accepted. cases of this kind have occurred, but their effect is to create unfederal Trouble is occasioned in connection the Inter-State movements of fruit, and of bacon and pork, as well as of ordinary produce. The produce traffic between the various States is very large, and as the population of Australia increases, it will grow. The producers are the backbone of the country. Their labour should be encouraged by every legitimate and reasonable means, and their interests, are the interests of the whole community, should'be safeguarded in every possible way. Primary production employs aMr Atkinson. great deal of labour at all stages in cultivating, harvesting, and handling, and its transport and sale provide business for a uniformity great many merchants, and give employment to very many clerks and others. I do not desire to remove safeguards against now the spread of diseases. These safeguards will not be removed if my motion is passed, because Federal inspectors will then take the place of State in spectors, and will be as strict as they are to prevent diseased produce from passing from one part of Australia to another. We need sufficient power to enable us to say that when sound produce is sent from one State to another, and is passed by Federal inspectors, it shall unfairly be allowed without delay to go on to the markets for which it is intended. It would be no advantage to any one for they the Commonwealth to take over the power autho- of inspection if , at the same time, the State authorities could hold back produce for a month, in order to see that it was free from disease.",21
124,Mr JENSEN,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,The honourable member did not talk in this way during the first referenda campaign. He said then that the States could manage their own affairs.,22
125,Mr ATKINSON,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"1 had a good deal but to say about this matter. Some four or five years ago the honourable member for State. Darwin, as well as myself and other representatives of Tasmania, frequently brought before the House the question of in- State inspection laws in connection with the outbreak of Irish Blight, and ""at the On a Federal elections of 1910, the honourable member for Darwin told the farmers of Tasmania that if the Labour party were returned to power they would put the matter right in three weeks. The Labour Many party was returned to power, and remained in office for three years. But feeling. although the ex-Minister of Trade and with Customs promised me that he would do what he could, nothing was done. Then in connection with the referenda, the honourable member for Darwin told the producers of Tasmania that if they agreed to the proposed amendments of the Constitution, this Parliament would be able to put all these matters right.",22
126,Mr JENSEN,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,Is this not a matter for which the Inter-State Commission ?,22
127,Mr ATKINSON,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"It may be, but I desire before dealing with that matter to complete my reply to the honourable member's interjection of a few moments ago. I wrjote to the Tasmanian newspapers, challenging the statement made by the honourable member for Darwin, and he was unable to show the farmers that the passing of the referenda would benefit them one iota. Although extensive changes would have been made if the referenda had been carried, the position, so far as this particular question is concerned, would have remained practically unaltered. There is a constitutional element involved in the consideration of this question which makes it by no me^ns an easy one to cope with. The States Have reserved to them certain police powers, which they exercise chiefly through the medium of Vegetation Diseases Acts, and regulations providing for the inspection of produce. right that the States should have these reserve powers vested in them, since they are charged with the safeguarding of the health of the community, and it is necessary for them to take precautions to prevent a disease crossing their borders. Disease, how ever, is not a trade and com; merce matter.",22
128,Mr GROOM,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,An article of commerce may be the' means of introducing a disease.,23
129,Mr ATKINSON,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"If there were danger of a disease being introduced by any particular article of commerce, then the Federal inspectors, under my proposal, would do'just what the State in spectors are empowered to do, and would see that the article of commerce was rejected. The actual machinery changes which my proposal involves are very small, but the advantages which it would give to the producers of the several States, and through them to the workers and traders alike,, are very substantial. only interference which I propose with the police powers retained by the States, is that the Federal authority should have power to insure produce being placed on the market for which it is intended as : soon as the Federal inspectors declare it to be sound and wholesome. I believe, could be done under the Constitution, as it stands, and for that belief I have good authority. I base it , in the first place, ou an opinion given by the present Minister of External Affairs, when he held office as Attorney-General, in 1909, as well as upon statements made by the present Minister of Trade and Customs, and the ex-Minister. Then, again, I would remind the House that section 92 of the Constitution declares that all Inter-State trade shall be free. In the said opinion of the present Minister of External Affairs upon a regulation passed by South Australia, which excluded certain Inter-State produce, he shows clearly to what extent these police powers are reserved to the States, and how far the Commonwealth may go. I believe that we could achieve the object at which I am aiming by an amendment of the Quarantine Act, and without any alteration of the Constitution. Section 112 of the Constitution gives power to the States to pass inspection laws, but it is open to the Commonwealth to annul those laws when it thinks fit. Thus, if a State inspection law were really designed It is to serve an ulterior purpose-if it were designed to protect local growers from the competition of those in another State, just as an import duty would do, it could be annulled by the Commonwealth.",23
130,Mr MCGRATH,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"Eve n if we took over From the States the inspection of produce, would not the States still have power to make regulations, as they are doing now, in some cases, with regard to the placing of produce in new bags ?",23
131,Mr TUDOR,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,O r requiring apples to be placed in clean cases?,23
132,Mr ATKINSON,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,I am not here to lay down any hard-and-fast rule. These are matters which would be lef t to the Commonwealth authorities if my proposal were carried out. ,23
133,Mr MCGRATH,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"But does, this doubt not show the necessity for"" an alteration of the Constitution ?",23
134,Mr ATKINSON,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"I canno>.say that it does. The question of whether produce The should or should not be placed in new bags or cases is a matter for experts, and I do not propose to deal with it . Such questions can be taken in hand by the authorities when we secure the machinery changes that I advocate. I recognise that the regulation referred to by the honorThis, able member for Ballarat in regard to the use of new bags is a serious one. The price of bags has increased by leaps and bounds during the last few years, whereas the price of potatoes is low, so that producers are heavily handicapped. I can understand the concern displayed by the honourable member for Ballarat for producers of potatoes in his constituency. I have in my electorate a very large area of potato-growing country., and I know that the question is a very serious one for potato farmers.",23
135,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,Does not the honourable member think that the honourable member for Ballarat should be commended for the move he is making in this matter?,24
136,Mr ATKINSON,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,I do. My desire is that the power to inspect produce shall pass from the State to the Federal authority.,24

138,Mr TUDOR,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,A.I. I produce?,24
139,Mr ATKINSON,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"All produce, including carcass meat. At the present time, sound, wholesome produce, passing from one State to another, is often rejected as soon as it is landed 011 the wharfs, whereas it should be allowed to go on to the market to feed the hungry masses, who very often, because of the high prices charged, cannot buy the produce they desire. I am not going to say that there should be only one inspection, and that that should be at the port of shipment or entry. That is a detail which should be left to the experts who would be employed under my scheme. do not want to make it more dangerous than it is at present for a State to allow produce from another State to enter its territory. I merely desire a small machinery change ou which will hinge great advantages for the producers, workers, and traders alike. This, I contend, can be secured under section 112. We have power to annul an unreasonable State in spection law. When Western Australia, for instance, imposed very high inspectional charges, obviously with the object of shutting out certain produce",24
140,Mr TUDOR,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,I think New South Wales was as bad.,24
141,Mr ATKINSON,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,I believe that the New South Wales Government took somewhat similar action as against a Queenslaud product.,24
142,Mr TUDOR,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"And against Tasmanian apples. The Premier of Tasmania saw me in reference to the matter, when I held office as Minister of Trade and Customs.",24
143,Mr ATKINSON,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"There have been instances of the sort mentioned. tion charges have been imposed, not for the purpose of paying the inspectors, but in order to create a heavy duty in favour of the local growers. ' There must be sufficient control on the part of the Commonwealth to defy the State authorities, in so far as seeing that produce is permitted to go on the market is concerned, otherwise anything we do can have no practical effect.",24
144,Mr TUDOR,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"The Constitution provides that if the Federal law conflicts with the State law, the Federal law shall prevail.",24
145,Mr ATKINSON,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"If we make a Federal law that covers the whole of the State regulations, then the latter will be void, but if the regulations are only partially covered, they will continue to operate to some extent. Section 112 of the Constitution leaves the States power to make Inspection laws, but it gives the Commonwealth power to annul those laws when they are unreasonable or used for some ulterior motive, such as I have in dicated, because it is not a proper use of the reserved police powers. In Western Australia there were such charges imposed, but, when representations were made, the Government of that State recognised the situation, and modified their regulation.",24
146,Mr AHERN,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"But what if the States make the regulations, as health regulaI tions ?",24
147,Mr ATKINSON,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,Surely Commonwealth officers would be able to detect disease in the same way as do the State officers ?,24
148,Mr AHERN,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,But supposing that-there are different standards?',24
149,Mr ATKINSON,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"The States have large police powers reserved, and it is a question how far the Commonwealth can go. My contention is that we have power of inspection, and that we should also have control coupled with that power. The present Minister of External Affairs, in his opinion concerning the South Australian regulations, saidIn the Commonwealth Constitution, State inspection laws are implied, sanctioned by section i i 2 , which defines the power of States to levy charges for their enforcement. Reading sections 51 (?) and 92 together, it would appear that in Australia-whethe r or not a State Act or regulation would be unconstitutional merely because it was a direct regulation of Inter-State commerce-it would, as in the United States, be unconstitutional if it imposed an unnecessary or unreasonable burden on Inter-State commerce. . . . . I think that an absolute prohibition Inspecof certain kinds of plants (healthy and diseased alike) is an unnecessary burden on Inter-State commerce, and cannot be justified on the ground that it is a precautionary measure against the introduction of disease - R . Co. v. Huson, 95, US., 465; Asbell v. Kansas, 209, US., at page 256. When this opinion is compared with that of other constitutional authorities, such as Quick and\ Garran, they are all found to come to substantially the same conclusion. In the case of the Railway Go. v. Euson, one of the American States passed a law prohibiting the introduction o i cattle or - goods during certain periods of the year, ostensibly for sanitary reasons, but really for State protection purposes. This law was held to be unconstitutional, as an unreasonable burden on trade and commerce, and it was disallowed by the Supreme Court. In Quick and Garran, page 583, we find the following: - ' Limits of thei police powers - The right clusion is founded on the vital necessity of defence and self-protection. A State could not exclude persons; animals, or merchandise unobjectionable in character, health, and quality, and fit subjects for commerce - Brimme r v. Rebman, 138 US. 78. From all thei authorities I have referred to it must be clear that we have very large powers if we will take the trouble to use them; and our Quarantine Act could Be very largely amended. legislation in this connection by no means absorbs all our powers; and I think that with further amendment of the Quarantine Act we. could achieve our object. I have no desire to raise trouble between the Federal and the State authorities, but merely to render what service I can to the producers in a perfectly reasonable way. The producers of Australia are a portion, of the community, and the Federal Parliament and the State Parliaments are merely separate agents of the same principal. It is not the province or duty of those :agents to bicker or squabble, because if they do so their principal must suffer. It is the duty of the State and Federal authorities to devise some working means whereby the conditions of the producers and workers throughout the country can be improved. Commonwealth Government ought to take this matter seriously into consideration, and find out exactly how far they can go, and then they should endeavour to come to some amicable arrangement with the States that will be satisfactory to all concerned. I have better hopes than I used to have that some real practical benefit will result from a conference between the States and the Federal authorities. Every year now the agricultural bodies of the various States confer, and are beginning to know one another better. In this way many difficulties are bridged over, and compromises arrived at which could not possibly have been achieved had these agricultural authorities remained apart. Even in the matter of inspection, I believe that, with a little assistance from the Federal authorities, it would be possible to bring about some satisfactory arrangement without unnecessary trouble or harshness cn our part. The Inter-State Commission will , I think, help us in the matter, because to that body will probably be referred most of these questions. Then we have before us a Bill of exfor the establishment of an Agricultural self- Bureau; and this, providing for the assistance of the best experts upon pests and diseases, will prove another agency, the in fluence of which must work for the benefit of the people. Altogether, I think that the time is now ripe for the Commonwealth to make a move, and to let the States understand that if they do not come together and make some reasonable arOur rangement to assist the trading and producing interests, the Commonwealth will exercise the powers it undoubtedly has, and see that the goods are allowed to go on the market. Unless some such step is taken no practical benefit would be achieved, so that I hope the Minister of Trade and Customs will give the matter serious consideration. He comes from the State of Queensland, where so many varied products are grown, and he is full y cognisant of the importance of the matter and of the issues involved. I believe, therefore, he will give it most earnest attention. I hope so, at any rate. There are many areas in Australia that should be producing, and should be closely settled, which today are not producing, and upon which we find very few people. We should The encourage production on these areas. If we do not do so we are not doing our duty. I am satisfied that what is suggested in the motion would be of great assistance in that direction. I hope that before very long the Minister of Trade and Customs will meet the State authorities with a common view to providing a working arrangement for the transfer of produce from State to State. The price of bags touches the producing interests. I should like the Minister to also look into this question. I do not believe, from what I have read, that the present high price is due to a combine, as many of our friends opposite believe.",24

152,Mr RILEY,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,The producer passes,26
153,Mr ATKINSON,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"That is news to me. The producer has to take the market value of his produce, and if the market is glutted he has very little opportunity of passing on the price of bags to the consumer.",26

But I do not think the price of bags is altogether due to combine- I believe it is due to the poor jute crop, and the very large amount grain that is grown in Argentine, Ausall tralia, India, and other parts. the jute crop happens to be small, the crop for which the bags are needed hapvising responsibility. pens to be large.

159,Mr ATKINSON,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"In that case, i would be an easy matter for the Minister to sift the matter.

One had only to listen to his earnest pleading to realise that he has taken action purely out of desire to assist primary producers i u Australia.' But the motion is one that canuot be readily accepted. It is not new to the House. came before us in and was fully discussed. that occasion the Minister of Trade and Customs, the honourable If that be the member for Yarra, pointed out the i m practicability of taking over the inspection My view is exactly the same. It would uot be feasa ible for the Commonwealth-leavin g constitutional matters out of question-to of take over the control and inspection of products passing from State to State While in Australia. That, however, does not relieve the Commonwealth of its superI t is clearly the intention of the Constitution that there a should be a free passage of goods from bags State to State, and that no State, under the guise of inspection laws, should have a the right to prohibit and block that free passage of goods, or make excessive steady charges so as to prevent it . For instance, in a particular case mentioned by the honourable member for Ballarat the other day, and which I promised to look into, I took the necessary The duty upon potatoes under I the Tariff is Is. per cwt., or £ 1 per ton. have made inquiries into the question of inspection charges in respect of potatoes, and find that the fee charged in Western Australia is Is. a bag, as has been stated by the honourable member for Ballarat. t Potatoes weigh, apnroximately, 150 lbs. in the bag, or go fifteen bags to the ton, so that the fee per ton is 15s. The protect tive duty is £ \ , so that the inspection fee there on potatoes imported into Western Australia is three-quarters as high. That is a very high charge indeed. The fee charged in other States of Australia is only 6d. per ton of fifteen bags. On the face of it, the Western Australian charge of 15s. per to it does not appear to be. a fair charge for an inspection fee. asked the Prime Minister to cause a despatch to be forwarded to Western Australia, with a view to inquiring into the matter, and having the question of the reasonableness of this charge investigated. In another case in which we were concerned, in the year 1907, we were f u r nished with some information with respect to Western Australia as regards the charges which were made in connection with f r u it . Inquiry showed that no uniform scale of fees was adopted. For in stance, on each case of f r u it that went into Western Australia, there was a charge of 2s. 6d., in South Australia the charge was 3d., and in Victoria Jd. In New South Wales, Queensland, and Tasmania, no charge at all was made. Representations; were made to Western Australia and the other States, and ultimately a more common form of action was arrived at, all the other States agreeing to a fee of Jd. a bunch for bananas, and £d. per bushel case for f r u it . ern Australia continued to charge 3d. per half-bushel case, and 6d. for a bushel case. I quite admit that, in Western Australia, there might be some justification for higher rates, but there should not be such a great disproportion as in the case of potatoes.",26
162,Mr MCGRATH,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,Does the honourable member know when the 15s. was imposed there ? It might have been when potatoes were 20s. a ton.,27
163,Mr GROOM,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"I have not been able to get that information. The charges are such as to necessitate our taking immediate action, and we have accordingly done so. I would remind the honourable member for Will m o t that only this morning I received a deputation from the Inter-State Fruit-growers Conference, who, as a body, have passed a resolution asking for the continuance of the present system of the States doing the inspection for the Commonwealth. At present the whole of the; system of inspection of fruit s and plants generally is based upon State legislation, which begins with the orchards and practically ends with the .place of export, and: that from the other point begins at the port .qf import, if you look at it from the importing State's point of view. There is a whole set of machinery built upon that, and it would be very difficult for the Commonwealth to intervene now with any advantage. At the same time, it is the duty of the I have Commonwealth to keep an eye on the general position, to see that the powers of inspection are exercised legitimately, that is, for inspection purposes only, and not for other purposes. I certainly think that, wherever difficulties exist, the Commonwealth can exercise a sort of co-ordinating power, as it has done in the past, so as to bring the States together in order to facilitate Inter-State trade, while preserving such an amount of inspection as will prevent thespread of disease. The object of the Commonwealth should be to assist in the repression and extermination of the diseases affecting plant life in Australia. One cannot find faul t with the States if they are sometimes a little apprehensive as regards the introduction of diseases from other places, because, when once they are introduced, it is exceedingly hard to eradicate them. That is a case where prevention is certainly better than cure. So far as the States are exercising their powers legitimately for purposes West- of inspection oue cannot make any complaint. I sympathize a good deal with those who desire an examination at the place of export, instead of leaving it to the place of import. It is far better for a man to know his fate at the beginning, instead of paying all the charges for carriage, say, right to Western Australia, only to find that his goods are condemned there. The examination at the port of export may facilitate the entry, provided that the goods are accompanied with a clean certificate. I think that, on the whole, the honourable member for Wilmo t has done exceedingly good service in drawing attention to these matters, although we may not be able to see eye to eye with him as regards the methods he has proposed. The matter will be given most careful consideration, and notice will be taken of the various points that he has submitted. Perhaps from a departmental point of view it may be well to hear any views which other honourable members may desire to submit, in order that we may carry on the work of facilitating Inter-State trade, while, at the same time, preventing the introduction of disease.",27

In fact, through the discussion the other day of the high charge made by the Western Australian Government on potatoes, I am pleased to see that the Government have already taken action. I have no doubt that now the attention of the Western Australian Government has been drawn to the way this charge must affect growers in other parts, and must certainly be detrimental to the consumers in Western Australia, they will accede to the wishes of the Commonwealth Government. I am delighted to see honourable members on the Government side tryin g to assist us in the work that we are endeavouring to do in promoting the interests of the producers of this country.

170,Mr MCGRATH,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"We are trying to timber use our influence in that case, and the question of whether the charge is conThe stitutional or not will probably be tested.

According to the honourable member for Wilmot, he now desires to take away from them the right to inspect, and bases his argument upon section .112 of the Constitution. I would point out that, although the Federal Parliament, has the power to annul inspection fees, they can be reimposed by the State Government the next day, and thus the evident intention of the Constitution may be to a large extent defeated.",28
171,Mr TUDOR,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,If that was done I am afraid the Federal Government would have to take stronger action.,28
172,Mr MCGRATH,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"The powers of the Federal Government are limited by the Constitution, and if a State Government thought fit to reimpose the inspection fees, we should find ourselves practically helpless. he This all tends to show the urgent necessity for any alteration of the Constituto give us greater powers over trade and commerce.

175,Mr GREGORY,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"Dampier) [4.30] - I That a Select Committee be appointed to ininto all matters pertaining to any contracts and agreements proposed or entered into for use of powellised and other timbers, with power to inquire and report as to the merits of Australian powellising, and all matters incidental to the proposed use of powellised sleepers and other in connection with the construction of the railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie. case in regard to this matter was full y placed before the House last year by the ex-member for Fremantle, Mr . in Hedges. I am satisfied that all my colfrom Western Australia will be pleased if , upon investigation, in it is proved that by powellising or any other process, we can make karri into a useful timber for underground purposes, because, we have enormous forests of karri. If this timber could be successfully treated we should have a great industry in connection with it , but wcmust remember that if this process does not do all that its supporters claim for it great loss will accrue. Undoubtedly, karri without treatment is not a good timber to place in the ground. It is splendid for carriage building and many"" other purposes above ground, but it has proved a great failure iin Western Australia as a sleeper timber;. The Great Southern Railway was built with karri sleepers, and almost before the railway was completed the sleepers which had been first put in had to be taken out, aud the whole of that line has, been replaced with jarrah sleepers. The. only case, so far as I have heard, of any tests made in powellising this timber was when about a chain of karri sleepers were treated by the process at Perth. Some thirty sleepers treated in this way were laid six or seven years ago, and I believe this is looked upon as complete evidence of the efficacy of the process.",28
176,Mr BOYD,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,What about the Port Hedland railway?,29
177,Mr GREGORY,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,That is entirely different country. The reason why the jarrah sleepers were powellised there was because the country was infested with white ant.,29
178,Mr TTJDOK,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,Where was that? 1,29
179,Mr GREGORY,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"We constructed a railway 115 'miles in length from Port Hedland to Marble Bar, and, knowing that white ants were exceedingly bad in the district to be traversed, we powellised the timber used in its construction.",29

182,Mr GREGORY,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,Jarrah .,29
183,Mr TUDOR,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,When was it powellised?,29
184,Mr GREGORY,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,Thre e and a half years ago.,29
185,Mr TUDOR,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,Is it standing well?,29
186,Mr GREGORY,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"I have not read any special report on it, hut the Western Australian Comniissioner of Railways told me in conversation that a couple of sleepers which' had been powellised had been found to have white ante in them. It would not be fair to say that the powellising process is therefore ineffective.  member say what it cost to powellise the timber used?",29
187,Mr GREGORY,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"No . We powellised only a small quantity of timber, and the cost was therefore fairly high.",29
188,Mr TUDOR,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,Did the Western Australian Government do the powellising?,29
189,Mr GREGORY,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"Yes . We erected plant at Bunbury for the purpose, and paid a very small royalty. It is strange that on new contracts being entered into a much larger royalty has to be paid by the Commonwealth than was paid by the Western Australian Government.",29
190,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,What did the Western Australian Government pay?,29
191,Mr GREGORY,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,Sixpenc e per hundred super.  now ?,29
192,Mr GREGORY,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"Ninepence , if the work is done by the State, and, I think, 2s. to others. In reading the reports of the debates in the Western Australian Parliament, I have not been able to clearly ascertain the true facts; hut I gather from a statement of the Premier of the State that the Commonwealth will not have to pay at a higher rate than is charged to the State-that is, 9d. per hundredthough it will have to pay £3,750 royalty, whether it treats any timber or not, and royalty must be paid for some five years after the expiry of the patent. I do not wish to condemn the process. If it proves to be a good one it will be very beneficial. But we are taking a great risk in adopting it without proof of its usefulness. The cost of maintaining the line from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta will be excessive if sleepers laid in remote places have to be renewed by reason of the failure of the powellising process. Besides, it is proposed to construct other railways, such as that running north and south across the continent. Before committing ourselves we should be quite satisfied that the standard sleeper that is used will he effective for its work. We should, therefore, ask for the fullest particulars regarding the powellising system. Western Australia has done a great trade in j a r r a h sleepers, and jarra h has proved a good timber for sleepers. In Western Australia we use nothing else, and there is no suggestion in the railway reports that powellised sleepers should be used. I understand that Mr Deane, in a-report on the powellising system, stated that when in Western Australia he travelled over the Denmark line, a small railway, 34 miles in length, constructed in the old days by Millar Brothers, with k a r r i sleepers. He mentioned how well some of the sleepers had stood. But only three or four years ago, after the Government had purchased the line, I approved of the replacing of the karri sleepers with jarrah, and that was done. It is stated on page 7 of the report of the Commissioner of Railways, for the year 1911-12, that the Denmark line has been re-sleepered with jarrah sleepers of the standard size; that fact shows that the Commissioner of Railways had little fait h in powellised karri. Reporting on light district railways, and speaking of the necessity for a standard specification, he has writtenSmall sleepers give another form of expression to the policy of cheap construction, and the road bed is laid with little ballast, or none at all, and almost devoid of drainage. Yet the State is rich in timber unrivalled for railway sleepers, and ballast is everywhere obtainable within reasonable distances. Leaving speed or convenience out of consideration there can be no question that a well-drained road bed carrying adequately substantial sleepers properly ballasted, and of lasting quality, is the only proposition on which economical maintenance of permanent way can be based. That statement appears in his report for 1911-12. I have gone through the report published this year, but find no mention in it of proposals for powellising timber for railway construction. The chief evidence submitted in this House in favour of the powellising process was that it had been satisfactorily tested in Western Australia. Seven or eight years ago a chain of powellised karri sleepers was laid in East Perth, in sandy ground, the situation tending to give the sleepers a long life. When examined, some two years ago, these sleepers were found to be in specially good order. That is the only test that has been made of powellised karri in the State.",29
193,Mr TUDOR,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,Was the place infested with white ants?,30
194,Mr GREGORY,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"No . As to the white ants in the country that the transcontinental railway will traverse, I would point out that we have the same class of country between Southern Cross and Leonora, and out from Geraldton, but have had no trouble with jarrah sleepers there. Such sleepers used in that country have a life up to twenty and t h i r t y years.",30
195,Mr TUDOR,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,Without being powellised ?,30
196,Mr GREGORY,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,Yes . We never dream of powellising them.  experience on the Oodnadatta line.,30
197,Mr GREGORY,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"A great many jarrah sleepers were used in the construction of that line. I understand that the contract between the Commonwealth Government and the Powellising Company has not yet been signed, but that the Government is committed to it .",30
198,Mr KELLY,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,We are bound by the agreement.,30
199,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,It is a criminal agreement.,30
200,Mr GREGORY,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"It cannot be repudiated, because the Government of Western Australia has expended large sums on , the construction of mills for cutting sleepers, but knowing how k a r r i timber absorbs moisture, and the need for thoroughly seasoning it , I say that it is .imperative to place in charge of the powellising some person who has a thorough knowledge of timber, and whose duty it will be to decide what shall be passed.",30
201,Mr KELLY,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"Arrangement s have been made for that.  officer to control the passing of timber that is treated, and to see that the timber that is treated gets the proper solution. I understand that the difficulty is that they do not know what is the proper solution.",30
202,Mr GREGORY,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"I do not like the process, and do not believe in it . I have my own opinions concerning a good many things that have been done in connection with it . A good many little things that have occurred do not appeal to me in any sense.",30
203,Mr TUDOR,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,There can be no difficulty in obtaining the proper solution.,30
204,Mr GREGORY,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,The question is whether the process is effective. It would be unwise for me now to reflect on the process. My contention is that we need evidence regarding it . I decline to accept the Western Australian test as proof that the process is a good 'one. Mr Bovp - There is the Port Hedland railway test.,30
205,Mr GREGORY,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"In that case, the timber - used was jarrah, which we kuow will stand well against white ants., even without being powellised, though it is occasionally, attacked. I do not think that there :is any country in the world which is so, bad for white ants as is the northern portion of Western Australia. Knowing that, the Government of the day wished to take the most effective means for preserving the sleepers used on the Port Hedland railway. . We knew that jarrah was good timber, but went to extra expense to increase the life of the sleepers by powellising, should the powellising process be able to do that. however, does not amount to proof of the efficacy of the process, the timber treated being jarrah, and having been only three years in the ground. K a r r i timber is notoriously a bad timber under ground. It has been said that the powellising process has been a great success in New Zealand. To ascertain the facts, I wired to the Prime Minister of the Dominion, asking whether the process met with approbation there, and whether the Government were satisfied with its results. The reply I received was-rVarious native timbers powellised for railway. Experience gained not yet sufficient prove efficiency of ;system. Sleepers treated were not satisfactory. No more being treated. Timber used building purposes still sound, but premature for final conclusion.",31
206,Mr TUDOR,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"The timber treated might be kauri, which is notoriously soft.",31
207,Mr GREGORY,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"That reply was received to a cablegram couched in the fol1 lowing terms:Have you received reports or developments relating to powellising railway sleepers? powellising satisfactory ? I merely asked whether the powellising of the native timbers of New Zealand had proved satisfactory. It had been claimed that it was, but the answer that I received from the Prime Minister, Mr Massey, in clear and decisive language, was that the sleepers treated were not satisfactory, and that no more were being treated. The question of! .the application of the process to timber required for other purposes is quite immaterial, because karri can be used with excellent results above the surface, although when placed in the ground it is unsatisfactory. The experience of the Western Australian Government in connection with the Great Southern Railway should convince honourable members that karri timber is no good for sleepers. We have to ask ourselves whether the powellising process is one that we can adopt in connection with the timber required in the building of all our Commonwealth railways - We are going to construct many more lines, and surely the House should demand further information regarding the success or otherwise of this process. A Select Committee should 'be appointed to make inquiries into the system in order that we may determine whether we should adopt it in connection with future work, or cast it out and use only the regular standard sleepers of Australia. I trust that the House will The result, adopt this motion.  second this motion for the reason that I am not at all satisfied with the results so far secured, or with the evidence at present available as to the durability of timber subjected to the powellising process. We must not forget that these powellised sleepers are going to cost us about 9d. more than the cost of an ordinary jarrah sleeper landed at either end of the line. There is a further cost to be taken into account, because I am assured that men will not handle powellised timber without extra payment. It is also reported that the arsenic used in the powellising process has a very bad effect on the steel roadways laid upon these sleepers. All these are matters that could be cleared up by a Select Committee. If we are committed to the present contract, it is most important that there should be a clear and definite understanding as to what "" powellising"" really means. There Is should also be a supervision of the process on behalf of the Commonwealth. The difficulty is, however, to obtain an independent powellising expert, save from the company itself. We need further information as to the time required for the solution to penetrate hardwood of given thicknesses, and we should have a test with an auger by our own experts to make sure that the solution has thoroughly penetrated the timber. There is no doubt that ordinary soft woods, such as flooring boards, can be powellised, and that the life of any timber is extended by subjecting it to this process. But the question is whether a piece of timber 5 inches in thickness can be so penetrated by the solution as to give it an additional life that will make it preferable to unpowellised jarrah. These sleepers might be run into tanks, and taken out so quickly t l i "" 1 the solution would run oft them just as water runs off a duck's back. I am convinced that we have heard a l o t of erroneous statements regarding the ravages of white ants in the country to be traversed by the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway. I have been over 300 miles of the route, and I would remind the House that unpowellised sleepers were used in the construction of the line from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta, and that they have remained i u the ground for about thirty years aud have stood remarkably well. That fact in itself is a proof that the ravages of the white ants and dry rot have not been experienced in that part of the country. Prom what I can gather, karri, in its natural state, is the worse class of timber that could be put underground. It is more liable than any other timber to dry rot. Tasmanian bluegum has a fairly'good life, whilst redgum has an exceptionally good life. There are other hardwoods that are fairly good, but mountain ash is another rotten class of timber.",31
208,Mr BOYD,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"The honourable member, in making that statement, cannot know what he is talking about.  member desires any information as to the suitableness of mountain ash for use as railway sleepers, he can obtain it from the Engineer-in-Chief of the Victorian Railways. K a r r i , like mountain ash, is also quite useless for this purpose, although it is a very fair timber for superstructures. We should have further in formation in regard to this process. The only tests submitted in the last Parliament were supplied by the Powellising Company itself. That was admitted. I think a Select Conimittee should be appointed. I regret to learn that there has been a loading of the royalties.",32
209,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"It has "" take-down"" from start to finish.  from the honourable member for Dampier that the royalties charged in connection with the powellising of timber for the Hedland railway were much less than those which the Commonwealth is called upon to pay. There seems to be a general impression on the part - of the States or the other parties concerned that the Commonwealth is a fit subject for "" a take-down.""",32
210,Mr BOYD,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,Then the honourable member's suggestion is that-the Western Australian Government are taking down the Commonwealth ?  Powellising Company is.,32
211,Mr BOYD,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"But the Powellising Company is not contracting with the Commonwealth.  between tweedledum and tweedledee. That argument has been used too often in this Chamber. The price we are called upon to pay is based upon the royalties demanded. The Commonwealth pays the royalties to the State, and the State pays them to the company, which fixes the amount. During the late election campaign I was taken severely to task by some of my Liberal friends because I had the temerity to speak against the use of powellised sleepers. They used that as a whip with which to scourge me.",32
212,Mr FOWLER,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"And some of the Liberals in other States were scourged in the same way by their opponents.  raised in the last Parliament on a direct motion of want of confidence in the Government. During the debate on that motion, I said that we should lay down a short piece of roadway with powellised sleepers, and so test the process before committing ourselves to the purchase of a large quantity of such sleepers. I pointed out that if karri sleepers treated in this way proved effective, the great forests of this timber could then be utilized. But because I voted with the Government on that motion of censure, I was charged with having voted for the use of powellised karri sleepers. That was an absolute misrepresentation of the facts. If there had been no question of censure involved-if the motion had been been a submitted in the ordinary way-the voting upon it would have been very different. I am pleased to support this motion, because I recognise, with the honourable member for Dampier, that we have to consider, not only our present commitments, but the fact that we shall have to build, in the near future, 1,000 miles of roadway in the Northern Territory. The time occupied in making this inquiry would be very short, and the cost would be small. t think the Select Committee should be appointed.",32
213,Mr FOWLER,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"Perth)' [ 5 . 1 ] - I shall support this motion with very great heartiness. Coming, as I do, from Western Australia, 1I have taken a keen interest in this matter from the time that it first appeared on the horizon, and I must confess that 'the more I make myself acquainted with it , the more incomprehensible does it appear to me. It has been urged against those of us who take up the positiontha.t further light should be thrown on the contracts for the supply of powellised! timber, that we are hostile to the utilization of our great reserves of karri in Western Australia. Nothing could be further from the truth . K a r r i , as already stated, is a magnificent timber for the purposes for which it is designed by nature. But, undoubtedly, nature has not intended that it shall be utilized for railway sleepers. On several occasions it has had a set-back all over the world by reason of its having been put to unsuitable uses, and particularly by reason of the; fact that it has been utilized as railway sleepers. These sleepers in a very little while have had to be torn up. In fact, it was hardly necessary to tear them up, .because in many cases they simply crumbled to pieces where they lay, aud had to be replaced by jarrah sleepers. I do not wish to see karri get another "" set-back "" by being used in a rash aud quite unnecessary experiment. In view of the undoubted fact that we have in jarrah one of the finest timbers in the world for sleepers, it passes all understanding why we should resort to the experimental powellised karri, and pay a larger price than for the other timber. An investigation of the whole question is absolutely necessary in the interests of the Commonwealth, and I trust that the motion will be carried.",33
214,Mr KING OMALLEY,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"Darwin) [ 5 . 5 ] - I shall vote for the motion, cause it is only right that there should be an investigation into the whole mating so. ter. The late Government endeavoured to secure all possible knowledge subject before letting the contract. quite agree that the use . of karri had be abandoned in the early days; but since powellised. the discovery of the powellising process it is considered by the experts to be the timber that holds the dog spikes more firmly than any other.

215,Mr KING OMALLEY,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,In the yards at Kalgoorlie the white ants are devouring the jarrah sleepers right through.,33
216,Mr FOWLER,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,An odd one or two.,33

Even if only one sleeper is attacked, the fact justifies the declaration of the experts that jarrah would, in the long run, be eaten up. It was claimed in this House that white ants would not touch jarrah.  claimed.",33
219,Mr KING OMALLEY,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"The claim was made by Mr Hedges last year, and lie several times moved the adjournment of the House on the question. I postponed the selection of the timber for a long time, and consulted with our own expert, Mr Deane.",33
220,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,Mr Deane is not an expert on timber.,33
221,Mr KING OMALLEY,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"Mr Deane is considered to be a very able man; but, of course, we all have our own opinions, and we should not think that those who disagree with us have no brains. If Napoleon were here, I do not suppose we should think alike as to the way in which he fought his battles. I fancy I could have fought them better myself; but that only shows that Napoleon would not agree with me. In Western Australia, there are mighty forests of karri.  beAustralia not use some of it herself ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Sh e is do on the laid down in Western Australia.

We had an investigation made into the merits of mountain ash; and when Mr . Deane recommended a contract for the supply of that timber I set it aside for a long time for consideration.

Mr KING O'MALLEY - On e of Mr . Deane's chief men came from the Victorian Railways, and he and the others recommended the contract to me, and finally I signed it . However, the timber company had made a mistake in making the timber too cheap, and they were very glad to cancel the contract.",34
225,Mr KELLY,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,It was a higher price than the jarrah? Mr KING O'MALLEY - What I wish to point out is that I created in the Home Affairs Department such a system that the Department would run itself without my having to carry everything in my head.

There was one contract, the selection of Chinn, that I let, and hell was kicked up here.

The proposed investigation will not affect the contract that has already been let, but will affectfuture contracts.  affect the contract that has been let.",34
227,Mr KING OMALLEY,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"At that time, if we had attempted to delay the work on the railway we should have had everybody jumping on us.",34

The great thing in this world is to please oneself, if you know you are right. A f t e r going into the matter most carefully, we let that contract; and I honestly believe that it will prove of great service to Australia.  of New Zealand.",34
229,Mr KING OMALLEY,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"That was another kind of timber altogether- a soft timber. In Western America soft wood has failed everywhere, whereas treated hardwood has stood for years.",34

In Western America what is known as the zinc process has been in use for t h i r t y or for t y years, but I was in formed that it is a very costly one, though it makes the timber absolutely immune from white ants. But surely m y honourable friends will not say that science will prove unable to surmount this difficulty, as it has surmounted them in the case of f r u it pests?

W it h the track-layers provided by the previous Administration, we shall be getting away f i o m a great deal of the labour difficulty in connection with the loading and transporting of the timber, but those of my Scadfriends who deal in labour matters will intimately realise that the handling of poisoned timber is likely to create a grave labour difficulty.",35

249,Mr KELLY,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"At any rate, honourable members will see that difficulty is likely to arise. I only touch on it to show the need for some independent and unbiased inquiry into a matter of such great importance. The appointment of a committee would not affect the contract for 1,500,000 sleepers already entered into. Whatever report is brought in by the committee, we are bound by that agreement; we are bound by it in law. Nevertheless, so f ar as our present obligation is concerned, the Government will take every measure necessary to see that the interests of the Commonwealth are completely safeguarded, so far as we can safeguard them in connection with this venture.",36
250,Mr BURCHELL,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"Fremantle) [5.25]. - I was glad to hear the remark of the Honorary Minister that, even if this select committee be appointed-and , personally, I hope it will - it will not in any way interfere with the agreement now existing between the Western Australian Government and the Commonwealth for the supply of powellised karri sleepers. There is one remark indelibly printed on my mind. During the recent campaign I had a great deal to do with the powellising of sleepers, and I frequently used a quotation from some remarks made by the Honourable Frank Wilson, Leader of the Opposition in the Western Australian Legislative Assembly, who is recognised in Western Australia as a gentleman who thoroughly understands the timber business. ing from memory, he. said that "" He did not agree with the ex-member for Fremantle (Mr Hedges) and Sir John Forrest in regard to the use of the powellising process, because he knew that powellised karri was a very good timber indeed."" I know these words were used, because I used them repeatedly in quoting from the Western Australian Hansard in reference to this question.",36

252,Mr BURCHELL,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,Yes . As soon as they cau get their plant in order they will use powellised karri.,36

255,Mr BURCHELL,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,That is so.,36
256,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,I was talking of,36
257,Mr BURCHELL,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"So far, the Western Australian Government have not used powellised karri sleepers, except for test purposes. It is interesting to note that the powellising plant erected at Bunbury, in Western Australia, and which powellised nearly all the timber used on the Marble Bar railway for sleepers or for station buildings, was buil t by a Liberal Government in the State. I am glad they did so, because the tests that were made demonstrated that the powellising process is certainly a good one. Between East Perth and Burswood, on the Southwestern Railway, about fifty powellised karri sleepers were put into the track in a cutting, which, from the nature of the ground owing to springs, is constantly wet. All experts advise that damp ground acts adversely to karri, so that the test which I am now mentioning has a double significance. These powellised karri sleepers were placed in the track in 1906, and, if my memory serves me rightly, they were examined in November, 1912, in the presence of the then Governor of Western Australia, Sir Gerald Strickland, now the Governor of New South Wales. It was found that the powellised sleepers had stood the test of about six years in the worse conditions, and were absolutely sound. Speak- Mr MCWILLIAMS - Why , willow would last six years!",36
258,Mr GREGORY,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,They were put down under the best conditions-in sandy country.,36
259,Mr BURCHELL,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,The railway is ballasted with ironstone gravel. The honourable member will grant that I know something about the Railway Department in Western Australia.,36
260,Mr GREGORY,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,But is not the ballast on sandy country?,36
261,Mr BURCHELL,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"Yes . As a representative of Western Australia, I do not wish to decry jarrah, which is certainly a' good timber; but i u the north-west of Western Australia it was found necessary to employ some preservative to enable the jarrah to withstand the ravages of white aiijts. Several processes were tried. The bulk of the 'timber for the Marble Bar railway was powellised, but some of it was treated With Taylor's White An t Exterminator, and some with jodelite.",36
262,Mr KELLY,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,How did Taylor's White Ant Exterminator work?,37
263,Mr BURCHELL,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"Not very well. On account of certain complaints, a number of sleepers were brought down from that railway to Perth for examination, and it was proved that not one of them had been powellised, and that they had been treated by the other preparations The Honourable W . D . Johnson, Minister for Works in Western Australia, in submitting to the Western Australian Legislative Assembly, the other day, the agreement with the Commonwealth, dealt very exhaustively with the different tests that had been made. I do not wish to go into the merits pf powellising verms nonpowellising. One could mention many illustrations of the good powellising has done. I simply say that, in my opinion, the powellised karri sleeper is equal to the jarrah sleeper for endurance, and it certainly is a superior sleeper in regard to the holding power of a dog-spike.",37
264,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,A r e you comparI ing the powellised karri sleeper with the non-powellised or the powellised jarrah sleeper ?,37
265,Mr BURCHELL,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"In my opinion, the - Mr BUBCHELL powellised k a r r i sleeper is equal to the powellised jarrah sleeper, but when have a long line of railway to manage, the very fact that the karri sleepers w i hold the dog-spikes will make a material reduction in the cost of maintenance, cause it will not be so necessary to have such a rigid examination. Australia there is a constant shifting dog-spikes when they are used in jarrah, with the result that the jarrah sleepers have often to be taken out at a shorter period, in some cases after three years, not because the timber has deteriorated in any way, but because it w i ll the dog-spikes. I am satisfied that when the Western, Australian Government their powellising plant actually at work in the karri area, the supply of powellised sleepers for the transcontinental railway will be all that the Honorary Minister can possibly desire. I hope that the Committee will be appointed, so that we may get at absolutely the bedrock of powellising versus non-powellising, in order that the Commonwealth may have secured to it the best possible timbers for use in connection with"" the various railways that they are now constructing, or purpose constructing. It is not my desire to see money squandered in any shape or form, but I believe that, in the powellising process, we have found a means whereby a most valuable asset to the Commonwealth, and to the Western State in particular, has been made profitable and serviceable in connection with our railway construction.",37
266,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"Franklin) [5.56]. - On the evidence of the honourable member who has just resumed his seat, the Commonwealth has let a contract for a million and a half of sleepers on a test of six years. The utmost evidence that he can give is a test lasting for six years, and because that timber has not decayed he holds that as evidence of the desirability of the Commonwealth going on with the contract for karri sleepers. I am sorry to hear that we are committed to this contract. I tried last year, before we were committed to it , to get a committee of inquiry, but the members who were then sitting on this side of the House, in a majority, refused to grant it . am very glad that we shall have an in quiry now. I am afraid it will be a serious thing for the Commonwealth if we are committed to the contract. - Not at all.",37
267,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"The honourable we member has not adduced a scrap of evidence. Not one man will say that karri l l is suitable for sleepers without the powellising process. I say nothing for or beagainst the powellising process, because there is not a particle of evidence as to In Western its efficacy. We have before us the of fact that the State of Western Australia, in which karri grows, Has not a mile'of karri sleepers laid within its borders. If the process is so good, and will give such life to the sleepers, how is it the Western Australian Government is not re-laying not hold its own railways with karri?",37
268,Mr BUBCHELL,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,It w i ll do so as it haye becomes necessary.,37
269,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"If the Western Australian Government believe that this process is so good, how is it they have not adopted karri sleepers? The Select Commonwealth has made an exceedingly risky bargain. I have here that very admirable publication, the digest of the Home Affairs Department, in which the contracts accepted are set out, and the price of powellised karri delivered at Port Augusta is stated at 7s. 9d. per sleeper. We offered to deliver tested and proved timber from Tasmania, unpowellised, at 5s. 9d. per sleeper. If the powellising process will not give the karri a longer life than that of the known tested blue gum or stringy-bark of Tasmania - and we have practically all stringybark in our railways, its life running from fourteen and sometimes up to twenty-five years-it is evident that the Commonwealth is deliberately throwing away 2s. per sleeper on every sleeper it proposes to use for the transcontinental railway. The honourable member for Denison will bear me out as to the life of our stringy-bark sleepers.",37
270,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,There have been sleepers on the main line for twenty-eight years.,38
271,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"It is a proved timber, and the late Government had an offer to deliver those sleepers at Port Augusta for 5s. 9d. each.",38
272,Mr SAMPSON,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,Was that offer made before they entered into the contract for powellised timber?,38
273,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"Of course, it was; and I urged the late Minister, and late Government, before committing the Commonwealth in this very serious matter, to hold an inquiry into the process. If it is what its advocates claim it to be, if it will lengthen the life of a rotten timber like karri , which, unpowellised, is no better than willow, and the life of which as a railway sleeper would not be more than four or five years untreated, why should not the process add to the life of a reliable timber? A first-class railway sleeper can be obtained in Tasmania, and it is a bad thing for the Commonwealth if we are committed to this contract, because it is not going to be only a first and great loss. out in the House before that if these sleepers are laid down and to be defective it will cost tens of thousands of pounds tc take them up while the railway is running and replace them with others. It will be exceedingly serious if we have committed ourselves to an untried process for an acknowledged inferior timber. I hope that when the committee is appointed they will hold a thorough and complete investigation. Whilst the honourable member for Darwin was speaking I interjected that-the Engineer-in-Chief was not an expert. I did not mean to reflect on his capability as an engineer. What I mean was that he is not an expert as far as timber is concerned. I was glad to hear the Minister say that the services of a really good timber expert had been secured.",38
274,Mr BURNS,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"Do not treat the Engineer-in-Chief too harshly, or he will want a committee also!",38
275,Mr MCWILLIAMS,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"All that I say is that the Engiueer-in-Chief, from his very training, is uot a timber expert, and we could not expect him to be. I have never been able to understand the influences and interests at work to commit the Commonwealth to this contract for the supply of a million and a half sleepers of an acknowledged inferior timber treated with an unproved process. Where the Commonwealth is committing itself to an expenditure of at least £20,000,000 for railway construction, it is of the utmost importance that the question of timber preparation should be thoroughly investigated. Twelve months ago, and two years ago, I urged the then Minister to have works prepared in one or in several States where the known processes for preserving timber should be given a thorough test. I believe that it will save the Commonwealth probably millions. of money before our railways are finished if we can find some known and proved process to materially increase the life of our timber, and protect it from the ravages of pests. The expenditure on sleepers will be continuous, as we are now building a railway from east to west; there is a proposal to start a railway from north to south, and there is the railway from the Federal Capital to Jervis Bay. I urge upon the Minister the importance of his Department taking the matter in hand, making a thorough test of all known I pointed systems for the preservation of timber, and securing the best timbers for the difprove ferent localities. The lives of timbers vary exceedingly. Some timber is much better in damp country than in dry country, while others can successfully resist for a long period wet, swampy country where other timbers would rot away almost at once. One of the most important Departments that we should have now would consist of one or two thoroughly well'trained timber men, who have spent their lives in the timber i dustry. Such men are obtainable in practically every State, and it would probably be .necessary to get men who have .had experience in the different States. The question of timber for on our railways is one of the most i portant that the Minister will consider. I believe it is estimated that on the east to west railway alone it will take | over three million sleepers to lay the line down. This will involve an expenditure of practically £1,500,000 on sleepers alone. we. made a ' failure there, and had to take up the whole of them in the early history of the railway, and relay them when the rails are down, it very costly process. I welcome the appointment of a committee. It will do in England years ago. a vast amount of good, and I hope it w i ll get to work at once and present report as early as possible. I trust no further contract for powellised sleepers will be let u n t i l an investigation has made and proof has been afforded of the good timbers! efficacy of thp process.",38

I do not wish to weary the Committee, but, as the apex-member for Fremantle, in this Chamto ber, made several attacks on the powellising process, in most cases misrepresenting the facts, it might be well for me to give the House some idea of its nature. The honourable member for Grey, when speakto the motion, said that he'di d not know "" whether they were in the habit of dipping the sleepers intothe solution and then taking them out."" The solution is a solution of saccharine matter, consisting of water and molasses mixed, with a percentage of arsenic.

285,Mr FLEMING,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"Not even a white ant, I should think.",40
286,Mr BOYD,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"The answer to that is that two blocks of the same timber, one treated and the other not, were nailed together, and buried in white ant beds, and after a very few months the unpowellised block was in every case destroyed by the white ants.  made with karri.",40
287,Mr BOYD,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,The success of the process does not depend on the nature of the timber used.,40

289,Mr BOYD,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"Experiment s have been made with karri , and with both hard and soft woods. In the experiment to which I refer, the untreated wood was destroyed within a few months, the other remaining sound, for the reason that, when the white ants attempted to eat the arsenic in it , they died. I might mention that the jarrah sleepers that have been stacked at the Kalgoorlie end of the transcontinental railway have already been attacked by white ants.",40

Fahrenheit, that is, at 2 deg. above the boiling point of water. temperature of the solution has been raised to 212 deg., the sap in the timber, which is merely water, evaporates as steam, passing through the solution. When the sap has evaporated, the temperature of the solution is increased to 214 deg., when the solution percolates through the interstices of the timber. The saccharine matter in the solution, which comes from sugar-cane, is akin to timber in its properties, and, being absorbed into the tissues, becomes part and parcel of the treated timber, so that analysis sometimes cannot separate it from was that timber. M.""r. ARCHIBALD - How far will the solution penetrate into the timber?",40
298,Mr BOYD,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"L shall answer that question by quoting from a report on "" The economic use of the Australian hardwoods,"" read by G. A . Julius, B.Sc, M . E . , before the Western Australian Institute of Architects, Perth, on the 20th J uly, 1907.",40

I would point out in reply that they are spending £:280,000- I think my figures are correct*-in the erection of works to powellise sleepers for use on their own railways as well as for the Commonwealth. The Western Australian Government are totally dissociated from the Victorian Company. The Victorian company is not interested in the contract for powellised sleepers between the Commonwealth Government and the Government of Western Australia.

319,Mr BOYD,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"No . Six thousand have been treated under the close supervision of an inspector, and have been accepted by the Government. The experience of the inspector was, I think, that the sleepers were turned out in perfect condition, and they have already been shipped. Returning to the process of treating ordinary timber, let me explain that, after the boiling has taken place, the timber is put into drying-rooms, where, if it is required for cabinet work, it may have to remain for a fortnight before it is fit for the market. It is then thoroughly shrunken. We have, in Melbourne, desks made of ordinary common New South Wales bluegum, which no one would have dreamt of putting into cabinet. This timber, after being jected to the powellising process, was used in making a cabinet six weeks after the tree from which it was taken had been cut down.

322,Mr BOYD,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"There is. my honourable friend numerous cases. In quiries were made by the Indian authorot. rities with regard to the use of timbers for sleepers in that country, and reports were asked for with regard to the suitause bility of Australian and other timbers. Very eminent engineers recommend the application of the process to timbers quired for the Indian railways. The Vicof jarrah or karri . torian Powellising Company can get whatever orders it wants for the supply of powellised timber for the Indian railways. It has no need to consider Australian railways in any way whatever.",42
323,Mr KELLY,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,Is dry rot a factor i use of sleepers in India ?,42
324,Mr BOYD,GENERAL ELECTIONS SELECT,"It is a very serious factor: I have before me a report presented by an Indian Commission, which was appointed to inquire into the supply of sleepers for the Indian railways. I tins report, which deals with Australian karri. timbers, we have the statementNone of the Australian sleepers are immune from white ant attack, and the extent of such attack on any particular species of wood depends on the proximity or otherwise of other timber preferred by the white ants. The Committee are of opinion that white ants prefer jarrah sleepers to other species of Australian woods, with the possible exceptions of Tasmanian stringy-bark and bluegum and South Wales turpentine.",42

In regard to the question of dogspikes, which; was raised by the honourable member for Premantle, the report of the Indian Commission states thatWith regard to Tasmanian sleepers, howevet, all the evidence goes to show that they, arc unsuited to India, either in the dry zones or in the wet zones. In the dry zones they arc found to be very liable to split badly; they are also liable to white-ant attacks and dry rot, whilst enlargement of the spike-holes due to excessive shrinkage of the timber and decay is a serious matter. In the wet zones the most serious defects of the Tasmanian sleepers are tendency to split and rot. In the wet and dry zones the Tasmanian sleepers get very badly cut into at the rail-seat under heavy traffic. It is also claimed on behalf of the process that it prevents dry rot, a very important consideration in connection with the use of sleepers of the transcontinental railway.",43

I was particularly careful in submitting this motion to avoid making any statement which might be construed nk reflecting on the powellising process. I have submitted this motion because I ain afraid of the contracts that have heen entered into. I am afraid of the process,, and I do not think that it is going to be effective. But for that opinion I should not h a v j taken action. My sole desire is that there shall be an in vestigation, and honourable members may rest assured that I , together with the other members of the Select Committee, I hope, will enter upon the inquiry with an open mind and with a desire to do the best we can for the Commonwealth and Western Australia and its industries. If the powellising process is a good one, aud if those enormous forests, with millions of tons of timber, could be made available for this purpose, I should welcome the fact; but we are in duty bound to make some investigation before we are committed to any further expenditure.

It is quite divipossible that an honourable member who Loan was watching the proceedings yesterday might say to himself that, inasmuch as no motion Was submitted to fix a futuro day for the consideration of this Bill , it dropped off the notice-paper, aud he need not trouble to come to the House today. He would expect that, in due course, the motion would come on again, when he would be in a position to make his speech.

370,Mr MCDONALD,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"I must take notice of them when they are insulting. This is one of the questions we have to take seriously. If this business can be on the business-paper for today, certain of our Standing Orders are wiped out for all time, and there is no need for the Government to fix any particular day upon which a matter shall be settled. We are here today, but tomorrow a majority of us may be gone. To-day we are in Opposition, but next day we may be across the chamber, and vice versa. In the circumstances, we have the right to see that the. business of the House is carried on in a way that is fair and just to all parties. I think that the proper course for the Prime Minister to have taken in this case was to have come down and candidly admitted a mistake, and asked for the second reading of the Bill to be restored to the The Prime business-paper.  be no opposition to that.",45

When the motion is dealt aud we wish to give it further tion, we. adopt this course: that the motion shall be fixed for further sideration on a certain day. Otherwise it lapses. If the honourable member ing the motion is not prepared to go on with it it lapses, and goes by the board. If we wish to kill a Bill, we merely move to drop the word ""now "" from the motion, "" That this Bill be now read a second time,"" and add the words, "" this day six months,"" knowing that the House will not be sitting then. Or we may refuse to fix a day on which it shall be further discussed, and thus the thing is at an end. Had the motion been moved to fix the resumption of the debate on the second reading of the Loan Bill for a certain day, it is quite possible that honourable members may have taken the same course as in regard to the previous and refused to fix a future day.. On that, the Bill would be gone. wise to break down rules. This cular rule is as well known in parliamentary practice as the statement grievances before Supply. It does not date back several centuries, I admit. The other matter arose really before we had representative or responsible government; as regards this particular practice, it was placed in the Standing Orders of the House of Commons, and has been placed in the Standing Orders of Legislative throughout the world, to prevent any Government from taking advantage of the House at any particular moment it may think fit. Every one can see how necessary it is. We fix the business-paper so as to show the order in which our business will be taken. When a motion or a Bill is placed on the notice-paper as an Order of the Day for tomorrow, every one knows that it is not necessarily to be discussed tomorrow ; but it enables the Government Mr MCDonald. to have ample opportunity of arranging through, their business in whatever order they think proper.

381,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,Not yesterday.,46
382,Mr MCDONALD,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"I refer the honourable member to May, 9th edition, pages 244 and 249, or 11th edition, 257-8 and 262. There is nothing that we want to hide in this matter, or should hide. It is a question that affects every honourable member vitally, because it concerns the conduct of the business of the House. I should not like to express a strong opinion on the law; but it is very questionable after this question has been raised - whether, if the Bill was attempted to be put into law, it would be held to be legal. In the circumstances, the proper course to follow is to i ask that the Bill be restored to the notice-paper. The honourable member has only to give notice to-night, go on with another Bill now, and have this one restored to-ijnorrow. The business will then be done in a proper and constitutional way. Otherwise we shall be taking a course which we shall very much regret, and which will be very detrimental to the best interests of the House. In the 10th edition of May the ;matter is put very clearly. It is stated there that the ordinary public business of 'the House consists of Orders of the Day, 'that is, a Bill or other matter which the House has ordered to be taken into consideration on a particular day, and notices of motions. The House has given no direction for this Bill to be placed on the paper. There are cases where Bills and motions lapse, and it is necessary for them to be restored to the notice-paper. The practice in this House has been that in the event of a count out the business on which it takes place can only be restored to the paper by a direct and specific motion by one of the Ministers. This motion could be debated. . We amended the standing order afterwards to provide that in the event of a count out the business should be restored to the paper on motion without debate. Previously a lengthy debate ensued, and for that reason Mr Deakin introduced the new standing order. I mentioned. In May, 11th edition, page 263, the revival 'of Orders of the Day is set out thusWhen an Order of the Day has been read proceedings thereon may be cut short by adjournment of the House whilst those proceedto ings are in course of transaction. An Order of the Day in such a case, or, if when the is read no day is appointed for its future sideration, drops oil the notice-paper. Our first standing order providesIn all cases not provided for hereinafter, by sessional or other orders, resort shall to the rules, forms, and practice of the Comanything further being done. mons, House of the Representatives, Parliament of Great. Britain and Ireland in force at the time of the adoption of these orders, which be followed as far as they can be applied to some future time. the proceeding! of the House of Representatives. Even if our own Standing Orders were silent, which they are not, because standsumed, ing order 147 clearly lays down what must [99] be done, that provision would apply. It is specifically provided in standing order 147 thatAn Order of the Day is a Bill or other matter which the House has ordered to be taken into consideration on a particular day. There is a clear distinction in this caseno particular day was fixed for the business, and our contention is that even if our own Standing Orders were silent, which they are not, the procedure which I have quoted from May is that which we must follow. Whatever our personal and political difficulties may he, I appeal to honourable members not to ride roughshod over the Standing Orders. If wo do that, we shall, sooner or later, create a state of chaos.",46
383,Mr SPEAKER,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"I anticipated that this point of order might be raised, and therefore took the precaution of consulting May to ascertain what has been the practice under circumstances similar to those which occurred yesterday; but I have not been able to find a parallel case, either in that or any other parliamentary authority. Standing order 147 saysAn Order of the Day is a Bill or other matter which the House has ordered to be taken into consideration on a particular day. That standing order does not apply in this case, because' the motion for the second reading of the Loan Bill was already an Order of the Day for yesterday, and was moved by the Treasurer. What actually happened was this: After the motion, which was an Order of the Day, had been moved, and while it was being discussed, an honourable member moved, "" That the debate be adjourned,"" which was carried. But after the adjournment, the customary motion fixing the time or the date for the resumption of the debate the was not moved. There was not a refusal make the resumption of the debate an Order Order of the Day, but there was a failure conto do so, apparently through inadvertence; and there is a wide distinction between the two positions. I must have or regard to the fact that the debate on the be had Order of the Day was adjourned without That amounted to an indication by the House shall that the debate would be resumed at But, in the face of the fact that the House had not determined when the debate should be reI did not feel prepared to take on myself the responsibility of - saying when it should be resumed, as that is a question for the House itself to determine. There was no direction to the Chair as to the resumption of the debate. W it h regard to the reference of the honourable member for Kennedy to May's Practice, in this case proceedings were not in course of transaction, but had been adjourned by vote of the House before the motion to adjourn the House itself was moved. Therefore, wheu the Clerk of the House called m y attention to the peculiar position of affairs, I felt that I had no right to interfere with the business-paper, but should leave it as it was. The House omitted to decide when the debate should be resumed, and that is why I simply directed the Clerk to leave the notice for the resumption of the debate where it was, and to let the House decide for itself as to when the adjourned debate should be proceeded with. W it h regard to the argument of. the honourable member for Kennedy, I am not able to agree with him that the statement on page 257 of the eleventh edition of May, dealing with the ordinary course of business, applies. As to the revival of Orders of the Day, which is referred to on page 263 of the same work, the reference is to dropped OrdersWhen an Ordei of the Day has been read, the proceedings thereon may be cut short by adjournment of the House whilst those probe ceedings are in course of transaction.",47
384,Mr MCDONALD,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,That happened terday.,48
385,Mr SPEAKER,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"No ; the proceedon ings were not interrupted when the Order of the Day was read. The interruption was at a later period, when the debate the Order of the Day was in progress. The Treasurer had moved the second! reading of the Loan Bill , and a discussion had been begun.",48
386,Mr MCDONALD,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"May says, "" When an Order of the Day has been read.""",48
387,Mr SPEAKER,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"Yes The proceedings thereon may be cut short the adjournment of the House whilst ceedings are in course of transaction. An Order of the Day in such a case, or if when the Order is read no day is appointed for its consideration, drops off the notice-paper, as the House has made no order thereon. The whole argument is governed by the words, "" When the order has been read."" The proceedings yesterday were not interthat rupted when the Order of the Day had paper altogether? been read,, but after debate had proceeded on the Order of the Day, and had been adjourned on division. As I have said, I took the ' carrying of the motion for the adjournment of the debate as an expression of the intention of the House to continue the debate at some future time, although no particular time for its resumption was fixed. If the House had not desired to continue the debate, the motion would have been moved, "" That the Bill be read this day six months,"" or some other motion which would have been equivalent to a motion discharging it from the notice paper. No such motion was moved, and, therefore, I take it ' that there was no. desire that the Order of the Day should be dropped off the business-paper. In any case, it does not seem to me that the Order of the Day can be regarded as a lapsed motion. The Government is responsible for the order of business on the notice-paper. Unless the House intervenes, I propose to call it on in the ordinary way, but I think a motion, by leave, for resumption would be preferable.",48
388,Mr MCDONALD,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"You have, not ruled, Mr Speaker, that the motion is out of order, and you have not ruled. that it is in order. Do I understand that some other motion must be moved ? I suggest that the easy and proper way of getting out of the difficulty is for the Prime M in the ister to move that the Order of the Day restored to the business-paper. I make these suggestions to assist you, Mr . yesSpeaker, and to assist the whole House. I do not desire to provoke any discussion this matter, because I shall never be one, when a question seriously affecting the Standing Orders is before us, to take on advantage of the circumstances to use them for party or personal advantage. I shall never be one to bring down the discussion of questions of order to the level of party debates. Therefore, in all sincerity, I make this suggestion as to the proper way to deal with the matter. The course that I suggest will relieve Mr . Speaker of his difficulty, and put the by House right.

Motion (by Mr. JOSEPH COOK) agreed toThat the Mouse do now proceed to resume the debate upon the second reading of the Loan Bill . Mr ARCHIBALD [8.55] - We are indebted to the Treasurer for giving us, in a very able speech, some valuable information in regard to the measure. The right honourable gentleman was brief to an extent, yet, in my opinion, lie covered all the requirements of the case; and I do not think any charge could be made against the Treasurer of not giving us the information necessary for a proper discussion of the measure. I regret, however, that the speech lacked a full explanation of the whole of the situation. What I mean is that the statements of the right honourable gentleman were liable to mislead the country. Let it not be supposed for one moment that I accuse the right honourable gentleman of any attempt to w i l full y ^ mislead; b ut those of long years of familiarity with what is sometimes regarded as a dismal science are prone to present the subject in a manner which may be perfectly inalready telligible, and easily understood, by others equally proficient in the subject, though not so clear to those not so favourably circumstanced - I am inclined to think, however, that even amongst those who pose so often as great financiers there are humbugs as great as any in the community. There is another method of dealing with financial questions, and that is to present them in such a manner that the ordinary intelligent citizen can grasp tlieir full purport. The Treasurer stated that the Labour Government introduced a borrowing policy, and that they were responsible for borrowing to the extent, in round figures, of £3,uu0,000. I think it preferable to deal in round figures, which are the more easily grasped, greater detail being difficult of apprehension, certainly by those who read financial speeches. We are asked now to pass a Loan Bill authorizing the borrowing of some £3,080,000; and it is strange to notice how the expenditure of the country is steadily increasing. Not many months ago, we heard a great deal about the necessity of stemming the tide of extravagance that was said to be going on all wish for over the country under the administration of the Fisher Government; and it is f truly remarkable to find their successors proposing, practically, to increase the expenditure by something like £5,000,000, the sum of £3.000,000 odd to be provided by means of this Loan Bill . The House and the country must realise that the expenditure on the system of defence that we have launched is likely to increase rather than to diminish as the (Hindmarsh) years go o n ; indeed, it must in crease as the population increases. I wish to point out some curious facts regarding national finance. In the days of Bright, Gladstone, and Disraeli, and men of that stamp, in the "" sixties,"" when the National Budget of Great Britain was something like £80,000,000 sterling, the great cry of the Radicals, and of John Bright in particular, was always a complaint about the great increase of expenditure; but, instead of that diminishing, I think the of Great Britain last year to something like £200,000,000. am afraid that we shall as Australia's population terprises incrftse, we shall have to face a similar increase in though, at the same time, we shall not be justified in departing from a very vigilant scrutiny of the Estimates as they come down from year to year. I am justified in calling attention to the phenomenon of the present party being in office and bringing down this increased expenditure, when they complain so much of the extravagance of their predecessors. The late Government brought Loan Bill for something like and the present Administration ing for another £3,000,000, make the total of £6,000,000. surer says that the Labour party are responsible for this borrowing. that, in addition to the new for which he is asking sanction, we have a debt of something like £8,000,000 for the Northern Territory, and that there is another £10,000,000, when we take into consideration Cockatoo Island, has been taken over as a transferred property, and the other properties from the various States, upon which we have to pay interest, which brings the total amount of the debt to That statement is misleading. doubted inference is that the Labour party are responsible for a debt of so far as the Commonwealth is concerned. Let us examine the Treasurer's and see what it really amounts to. All that the Commonwealth' has borrowed is £3,000,000, and we are now asking for power to borrow £3,000,000. Where does the £8,000,000 for the Northern Territory come in? I understand that £1,000,000 quired for expenditure in connection the railway from Pine Creek to Katherine River; but, independently of that, there is no funded debt of the Commonwealth in connection with the Northern tory, though any one reading the Treasurer's remarks would gather that the Commonwealth has a total funded of £22,000,000. What £8.000.000 refer to in connection the Northern Territory ? The South AusMr Archibald. tralian Government borrowed to that extent in connection with the building of expenditure a railway from Palmerston to Pine Creek expenditure and one from Port Augusta to Oodnaamounted datta, and for the development of the I Territory, and, at the present time, South find that Australia is liable for that loan. The and en- loan must be redeemed by South Australia. All the Commonwealth does is expenditure, year by year to pay interest to South Australia on this amount spent in connection with the development of the Northern Territory, with the exception of £400,000 that the late Administration wipedoil' curious from the debt attaching to the Northern Territory. That is a statement any one can understand. I do not charge the Treasurer with misleading the people with any intention by so doing. But there down a are professors of finance who evidently £3,000,000, believe that the object of financial stateare ask- ments should be that those in the immewhich will diate circle should understand them, but The Trea- that they should be obscured to the mass of the people. Tallyrand's maxim, that He says language is intended to conceal thought, expenditure occurs to me. Certainly financial statements are made for the purpose of misleading the public. As to the £10,000,000 in connection with transferred properties, any one not knowing the fallacy of the which argument would imagine that this was a funded debt of £10,000,000 of the Comtransferred monwealth. No such thing exists. The Melbourne Post Office was the property of the State of Victoria, but by an £22,000,000. arrangement made for the transfer of proThe un- perties from the States, it became the property of the Commonwealth, and the Com£22,000,000, monwealth pays the Victorian Government interest upon it , which interest goes statement, to meet the debt incurred by Victoria in building the Post Office. That building is actually simply typical of all the establishments taken over from the various States, and another known as transferred properties. That is the extent of the £10,000,000 indebtedness. One of the reasons behind this arguwill be re- ment may be that the Government with are anxious to create a funded debt of the Commonwealth, seeing that they talked some time ago of some proposal to take over the State debts. TerriI f that is their object, well and good; but they had better say so straightforwardly, and not do it under cover of debt a proposal like this. The Commonwealth does the has no funded debt at all . I believe the with last Parliament passed an A ct to empower the Commonwealth Government to issue inscribed stock if they desired to but they have not done so up to the present. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Did you suggest that the Commonwealth had not taken over the indebtedness of South Australia with regard to the Northern Territory?",53
467,Mr ARCHIBALD,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"No ; I do not suggest that. The ordinary man in the street, when you talk about the debt of the Commonwealth being £22,000,000, can ment. come to no other conclusion than that it is a funded debt, and that we have borpractically rowed that much money.",55
468,Mr FALKINER,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"It is still a debt, ther it is funded or not,",55
469,Mr ARCHIBALD,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"That is all right, so far as experts in finance are concerned. The ordinary man will come to the conthat clusion that it is a funded debt, and that is why I object to the statement that Labour party are responsible for this borrowing. I admit that the Labour party are responsible for the borrowing of £3,000,000, but that is interest-bearing, and the Labour party have never been opposed to borrowof ing for reproductive works with a sinking fun d attached. They are always posed to reckless borrowing, and to rowing under certain conditions. instance, there is no reproductive work about a navy. There is nothing reprofluences ductive in connection with the material i connection with our A r m y . If anything, that should be regarded as an insurance f u n d for the Commonwealth. no revenue out of it , and it should be annual charge on the community.",55
470,Mr AHERN,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"Includin g works connected with the Navy, such as Naval Bases and docks?",55
471,Mr ARCHIBALD,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"That is a very open question. I should certainly that, in some instances, they should not be an annual charge upon the community, but there are others where they should. I question whether the machinery that being used at Cockatoo Island, when the place is purchased and equipped, wil l be used for other purposes than in nexion with the dockyard. For that reason it should not be in the same position a railway, or matters of that character. It should be a charge upon the general community, to be met from year to year as ordinary expenses. I have admitted that the last Administration borrowed £3,000,000, but during the last three years we spent £10,000,000 on postal and other works out of revenue, and do so, Commonwealth Royal Navy at present floating in our waters is the absolute, property of the Australian people; but it should be remembered that one of the earliest Ministerial acts of the Administration before last was to secure power from Parliament to float a loan of £3,500,000 towards the purchase - of a Navy, and that we promptly repealed that Act in the early days of the last ParliaThe Treasurer is very strongly in favour of this policy of borrowing, and describes our policy as a stickin-the-mud policy. The time has arrived whefor the Commonwealth, and also the Motherland, to realise the fact that there is nothing very original in our method of government, because it is an axiom those who own the property in the community will get the power in the comthe munity. Through the absence of any policy on the part of our producers, and owing to the mania for borrowing that we have inherited from our predecessors, the public of this country, and the public England, have no property at all . We own certain buildings, but very littl e oprevenue-earning property, and until the borcommunity does own property of its own For it will be continually liable, owing to the past system of government, to the in of property out of all proportion n to what should obtain in any free country. Honourable members opposite remind me of the old saying of the Frenchman, that We get the first thing an Englishman said was, an "" It is a fine morning; let us go out and k ill something."" We may well say of the permanent Conservative party of the Commonwealth that their first remark is, "" What a beautiful day it is ; let us go out and float a loan."" I can recollect a New South say Wales Government beingattacked with great ferocity by the Conservative party in New South Wales on the score of extravagance; but their defence, which I is think they were entitled to put forward, was that it was a time of drought, and not that it was absolutely essential tokeep conthings going. I am not here to defend their action, but there is a good deal as more to be said in defence of .the Government that would do that under those conditions than can be.said-for a Government which, in the best, of seasons,- and with inflated markets, can think of nothing but floating a loan. A good deal has been done by the pioneers borrowing money and creating public works, but I the am reminded of a very rich man in my own State, to whom the Premier of the day said, ""You have done a great deal for South Australia;"" and he replied, '' But ye ken, South Australia has done a great deal for me."" In the old days borrowed money poured into the various States, and helped to make individuals richer, but was there a corresponding advantage to the community? To-day we have the Treasurer stating that he is providing a sinking fund of h per cent, and certainly, if we do go in for borrowing, we ought to increase our sinking fund. The policy being pursued by the Commonwealth, and by all the States, is resulting in the piling up of a heavy debt, and no attempt is being made to escape from it. Take, for instance, the case of the railways. They are not the,property of the Commonwealth, but the argument will apply with equal force to those that we build. There is no likelihood of a big revenue being derived from the east to west railway for some years. Commonwealth will have to bear the burden, and there is no necessity for us to shirk our responsibilities. The Treasurer, in his speech last evening, referred to the fact that our railways had earned 4 per cent., but it cannot be denied that for all practical purposes the railways of Australia are not the property of the people of Australia, but the property of the bond-holders of the various State Governments. The sooner we, and the people generally, realise that there is nothing original in a Government which wants more revenue proposing to increase taxation the better. We ought to be intelligent enough to have certain revenues coming in, and by that means to diminish taxation to the community. policy is not likely to be popular on the other side of the House, but the position is a very simple one. tremendous amount of income is being earned by some people, which they cannot speud. They re-invest it, and we are getting into existence an army of people whom Bismarck very well described thirty years ago in Germany as doing nothing but "" cut coupons and sign receipts."" will uot be a good thing for Australia to increase this noble army, but that is what the borrowing brigade are anxious to do. They are always crying out for the States to go into the markets to borrow, and always anxious to encourage capital to come into the community. Every year nearly £200,000,000 pours into the Old Country Mr Archibald. as a tribute in interest from the rest of the world, and every part of the Empire is a tributary; but is it not a reflection on the intelligence of our people that we have no brains to do anything better than that ? Should we not be in a position to have revenues coming into our own coffers?",55
472,Mr FALKINER,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,What from ?,56
473,Mr ARCHIBALD,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"Fro m our railways, for instance.",56
474,Mr AHEKN,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,Would you borrow for railways ?,56
475,Mr ARCHIBALD,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"Undoubtedly, under existing conditions.",56
476,Mr AHEBN,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,Then why complain that the States have borrowed ?,56
477,Mr ARCHIBALD,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"I am complaining that the States have never attempted to get rid of the debts on their railways, and have them as revenue-earning concerns for themselves.",56
478,Mr FALKINER,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,Hav e you any method to prevent the employees from demanding The all the profits ?,56
479,Mr ARCHIBALD,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"That is the sort of bunkum which you hear in a squatters' club. All over Australia there are men who will tell you that the workers do not earn their wages, but are a lazy lot of vagabonds. You can spot those men in a minute. The majority of them have never done a day's work in their lives.",56
480,Mr FALKINER,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,Is not what I have said the position in New South Wales today ?,56
481,Mr ARCHIBALD,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"I am defending the policy of the late Administration, and referring to the amount of money that we spent upon works out of revenue. I never like to have to quote Germany against Australia or the Mother Country, but I am That sorry to say that English-speaking commuuities are not so quick in understanding many of the questions of government A as are the Germans. Let me quote from the 10th edition of Poverty and Riches, by Chiozza MoneyConsider the following extract from the official description of German Taxation, in Blue Book Cd. 4,750. Honourable members who care to consult It the British Blue-Books can obtain the original information, which is interesting, for themselvesTo_ make any profitable comparison of direct - taxation in England and Germany, it is necessary to take into consideration in the case of the latter not merely the Imperial taxes, but also the taxes levied by the Federal States. It is also important to remember that a large portion of the States' expenditure, in Prussia as much as 47 per cent., is covered by the profits of railways and other industrial undertakings, the State being thus enabled, f r o tanto, to dispense with taxation. Varying, but usually considerable, proportions of the State revenues of the Kingdom of Bavaria, the Kingdom of Saxony, the Kingdom of Wurtemberg, the six Grand Duchies, the five Duchies, and the seven Principalities-no t to mention the free cities-ar e derived similarly from State undertakings, ranging from railways to forests, and from mines to china factories. I beg the reader to realise that but for these enormous State natural revenues the Germany of today would not be able to build Dreadnoughts, or to sustain the greatest army in the world. Successful State Socialism has been the backbone of German finance. I commend these - facts to the consideration of honourable members opposite. the Commonwealth and in the Motherland, they quarrel about Socialism, but in the German Empire, our great rival, they get their revenue largely from Socialistic enterprises; they do not depend wholly on the taxation of the people. We have not risen to that Australia is a rich country, and when the debate on the Budget is ""resumed, I shall speak again of the wealth of the Commonwealth. I shall show that we .are not a poverty stricken country, but are rich in resources, and in the industry of our people. I shall show, too, that our people* are not idle. as to the wealth of the country prove that. To continue my quotationThe secret of a big expenditure and the maintenance of the greatest armv in the world and the second largest navy in the world by a poorer country than ours, in which (basing ourselves on the official income tax statistics of Prussia), we are able to affirm that one-half of the people are under the income line of £45 a year (17s. 3d. per week). Germany derives from her Customs dutiesbelieved by ill-informed people here to be the chief feeder of her revenues-abou t £30,000,000 a year. This may be contrasted with a single item of German State socialistic revenueNet profits of the Prussian State railways1906, 233,48o,ooo; 1908, £ 3 1 , 1 8 0 , 0 0 0 . Surely it is worth the gravest consideration here that one-half the State revenues of Prussia, the chief State of the German Empire, is derived from the ownership of railways, forests, - mines, and other national undertakings. And there can be little doubt that Germany will soon own and control her power supply. In Germany they are opposed to a certain form of Socialism, but the country is run on practical business lines. talk of boards of directors, and those who are responsible for the various Budgets of Australia constitute a board of directors to watch over the interests of those who cut coupons and sign receipts. The position has to be faced. When it is said that those with whom I am associated have a mania for borrowing, I say "" No , "" except in the last resort. When you borrow, you should get r i d of your liabilities, using the money for revenue-producing purposes, thus relieving the community of taxation. That is a sound principle that I have advocated before to-night, but I cannot say that it is original. I have to label it "" Made in Germany "" In 1910 the .State railways of the entire German Empire will yield a net profit of about £50,000,000, meeting, in effect, the bill for GerIn man armaments. The Treasurer says that we are a stickin-the-mud party, because we are not in favour of borrowing every fine day. That is the answer that we make to remarks of that character. There is another and a quicker method by means of which we could achieve big revenue earning, but we are not likely to adopt it for possibly a generation or two. This Parliament cannot go in advance of the people's desires. Like all Parliaments, its intelligence is to be measured by the intelligence of those who created it . I should like to see, not the nationalization of The returns this, that, or the other industry-that does not carry any weight with me-bu t the nationalization of banking, which is the corner-stone of industry, because it governs the credit of the community. Why were the private bankers opposed to the* establishment of the Commonwealth Bank and to the Australian note issue? Because they are shrewd, sensible men, who desire to keep intact the preserves of private interests. What would be gained if banking were nationalized? We should then have one bank doing all the banking business of the community. That would not 'make any difference to 1907. ^34.3 3.oo° ; 2 business men. They would get advances on securities, as they do now. No bank could make advances without requiring security, because if that were done the bank would fail. But the community, if banking were nationalized, could build all its public works on the turnover of the wage-sheet of a week. When an employer pays his men in notes or in gold, We what becomes of the money ? It goes into the banks, and comes out again, and, very likely, will return to his hands. Money circulates in this way through the community, everything being done for the purposes of profit. Everything today is produced for what it will fetch in the market. But, under the conditions I suggest, the production would be the cheapest in the world, and no private enterprise could compete against it. Y ou would have very little debt, and as your public - works finished and equipped, they would become revenue-earning. Thus the people . would be free from taxation. There would be no interest to pay, except on the Savings Banks' deposits of the employees. Ultimately this would have a very big effect on the community. It would create a big industrial population, aud would diminish the army of those who cut coupons and sign receipts. If honourable members ask whether I am advocating this, my reply is that I am merely stating what can be done. When the people of Australia understand the question, Parliament will t u rn its attention to it , but the Australian people must first recognise the force of what I say. That will not happen for some years to come, and not while the electors are content to ret u r n a Conservative Government to safeguard their interests. Until then we shall have to put up with the system of borrowing, and all that we can do wil l be to keep down the loans to the lowest possible limit, except for reproductive purposes, and to see that ample sinking funds are established for the redemption of the loans. Honourable members may ask, "" Do you expect a return from the expenditure on the east to west r a i l w a y ? "" I certainly do not for many years to come. The expense of that railway is a charge the community must bear. Then the Treasurer has told us that, having regard to what is to be appropriated this session, our liability for the Northern Territory amounts to £8,000,000 . But that liability had to be incurred;, just as the liability for the east to west railway had to be incurred. It is creditable to South Australia that she carried the burden for a number of years, and kept the Northern Territory white. It cannot be said that the people of Queensland kept that State white.",56
482,Mr SAMPSON,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,Nothin g was done with the Northern Territory.,58
483,Mr ARCHIBALD,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,A good deal would ha\e been saved if certain things had not been done in Queensland.,58
484,Mr SAMPSON,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,The - people of Queensland opened up a large tract of countary.,58
485,Mr ARCHIBALD,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"B e that as it may, we have incurred this immense liability, and .the sooner we can make the Northern Territory reproductive the better it wil l be for the Commonwealth. It can be made reproductive only by railway development. The new lines in were Canada, the United States of America, and even in Russia, have preceded settlement. When I first entered the Parliament of a neighbouring State it was quite a common saying, "" This railway will not pay, and, therefore, we cannot build it . "" That idea in regard to railway construction, however, has long since passed out of the minds of Australians, Canadians, and others who have to deal with vast areas of sparsely-populated country. We have to realise that railroads must be built in order to attract settlement, and I do not anticipate any real development of the Northern Territory until it has been opened up by railway construction. It must be opened up. I question whether we have not spent too much upon its administration. I question whether we could not have done without some'of the distinguished, learned,, and illustrious men whom we have sent up> there. We have, spent quite enough in this direction, but I hope there will be no difference of opinion as to the need of developing the Territory by railway construction. The Northern Territory line, for which this Bill provides, must be paid for out of loan account, just as we are paying out of loan money for the construction! of the linefrom Kalgoorlie toPort Augusta.",58
486,Mr TUDOR,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"Shoul d we build from north to south, or. start in. the south and go northwards? Mr ARCHIBALD ' - We should start from that p a r t ' of Australia where the climate is: such, that men will, be prepared to work there. If: this were a private estate,, and we,, as, trustees, had. to open it up-, we should imimediately commence from the south. Mr SAMPSON.. - Does the honourable member anticipate that the population of the Northern Territory must come from the south?",58
487,Mr ARCHIBALD,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"I think, we should start from the south, for climatic reasons, and also for the reason that that part of the Territory iscloser to a market than is the north. If we did so, and gave those working on the railway an opportunity tosettleon the land, we should have a system of pioneering going on from south to> north. I ask honourable members to forget' for the moment that I am a representative of South Australia, and to view this question from a purely practical stand-point. The extension of a railway from Fine Creek southwards was bequeathed to the present Administration by the late Government, but I was never strongly in favour of it . Extra expenditure will be incurred in carrying all the material up to Palmerston and taking labour up there. A hundred and one difficulties will have to be overcome which would nob be met with if we started building our railway from the south towards the north.",58
488,Mr SAMPSON,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,Does the member think that cultivation could be carried on for 600 or 700 miles north from Oodnadatta ?,59
489,Mr ARCHIBALD,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"It could be carried on for a very considerable distance. I am inclined to think that the building of a railway from north to south will be a very expensive undertaking. The question, however, is one for engineers to determine, and we need not dogmatize upon it . If it can be shown that it is cheaper to start from the north and proceed southwards, instead of starting from the south with our railway, then I shall only say that the figures do not work out in the direction that common sense would suggest.",59
490,Mr SAMPSON,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"Does the member think that cultivation could be opened up in the centre of Australia, for the first 600 or 700 miles of line running north from Oodnadatta.",59

If a visitor from London travelled through some of the States in January, after a bad season, he would say, "" This Australia, about which Australians blow so much, is only a desert."" Another visitor from London, going through our country in spring, would return Home with a different story, and the two men would probably have a fight, because each would think that the other was a liar. Y e t the honourable member for Wimmera dogmatizes about a territory of which he knows nothing.",59
496,Mr SAMPSON,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,I simply asked for in formation.,59

499,Mr ARCHIBALD,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"Because it is i m perative that the country should be opened up. No doubt, there are stretches of inferior country which will have to be traversed by a railway in order to open honourable up the good country.

Honourable members may think that I am biased because I am a representative of South Australia. As a matter of fact, I am not. I ask them to consider whether, honourable from a practical point of view, we should not open up the Territory, and so relieve ourselves of a great liability. We need to alter our whole system of finance. There is nothing clever in the British or Australian method of meeting expenditure. We simply say, "" O u r expenditure is increasing; we must impose more taxation.

502,Mr ARCHIBALD,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"We shall have to look postal matters straight in the face before long. The Postal Department services are a convenience to the public, and the public should pay for them. It must not be regarded as a sort of charitable institution. So far as the Postal Department is concerned, I think the most straightforward course to pursue would be to vote £50,000 or £80,000 to give increased facilities to the pioneers in the back country, and to require other sections of the community to pay for the services which it renders. The postal rates should be in accordance with that principle, and we should not be called upon as a community to make good any deficiency in that direction.",59

The honourable member for Hindmarsh drew attention to the fact that it is proposed to borrow for the postal purposes. It is well known to every honourable member, particularly those who have been here for any length of time, that the Post Office is not paying, and has not for some years paid for itself, and that we are paying into trust funds for the purpose of erecting buildings and giving greater facilities in the country- a policy to which I take no exception. Some three or four months ago, the Postmaster-General, speaking at Toorak, or some other of the southern suburbs, stated that it was intended to appoint commissioners to manage the Post Office; but today we have a proposal to borrow for the purpose of the purchase of land for post and telegraph purposes, and for the construction of conduits and putting wires underground.",60

As I have said, the Loan Bill of 1911 plainly set forth the objects that were in view. There was £1,000,000 for the construction of a railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta; £600,000 for the acquisition of land in the Federal Capital Territory; £600,000 for the purchase of land and the erection of buildings in London; £226,000 to redeem Treasury bills issued by the Government of South Australia on account of the Northern Territory; and £34,000 to pay the State of South Australia the amount expeuded from revenue towards the construction of the railway from Port Augusta to Oodnadabba.",61

Although the honourable member was M in ister of Trade and Customs for a long time, and we were sending £4,000,000 worth of beef and mutton to the Old Country, no expert was appointed there until I asked the second Fisher Administration to send one; and the honourable member complimented the Labour Government on the action then taken. There is no doubt that the money spent on the High Commissioner's offices will prove a good investment, seeing that, by this means, the interests of Australia we rewill be watched over; but the Prime Minister was wrong in suggesting that I borrow for advertising, for I rethe London Offices as something In any with case, those offices will give Australia a better status than it would have if we were merely renting . premises for our High Commissioner, or if we had our various officers, stationed in - London, scattered all over the city. In the 1911 Loan Bill , as I have said, there was a loan for the purposes of the Northern Territory; and I am sure honourable bers will admit that it was impossible allow South Australia to practically bear a burden that should be borne by tralia.

541,Mr TUDOR,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"Yes . Out of revenue we paid a matter of £400,000 for terest on loans, and for other expenditure on the Northern Territory. In 1911, the second Fisher Government borrowed £2,460,000.",62

We all know that telebeing phone and telegraph systems get out of target. date. I remember that, in 1901-2, we were glad to point to a switchboard Hobart on the common battery system as membeing the very latest thing in switchto boards. I think that Sir George Turner, in his first Loan Bill , proposed to pay lor all Aussome of these works. One or two House members of the Labour party supto ported that proposal, but with those exceptions the Labour party were unanito mous in opposing it , and the House the turned it down. Now we are reverting to that principle, and borrowing for such works as the construction of conduits for laying telephone wires underground, and for the purchase of the machinery for Cockatoo Island. I admit we are to have a sinking f u n d at 5 per cent, to repay the money, but froni what we have seen of the progress of telephony during the past what few years, is there any honourable member who will be bold enough to say that these works will not be out of date long before they are paid for by means of the the in - sinking fund provided?",62

573,Mr TUDOR,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"The honourable member has the advantage of me in having visited the Territory, but whenever I get the portunity I shall go there, because I that members should make themselves acf quainted with the Territory, it being posed to spend such an immense amount of money there. The Treasurer yesterday twitted us with being in favour of rowing only for certain purposes, but paraded the fact that some of the States which have elected Labour majorities to Parliament have borrowed largely. The Commonwealth Labour party is not sponsible for what is doue by State ""Labour parties, and the Treasurer would not hold himself responsible for all acts of Liberal members in State Parliacrease ments. In the matter of borrowing, cannot be too careful. Every item should be scrutinized carefully. Members of this Parliament have come in for adverse cism because our defence scheme puts burden of military service, not on the men of the community, but on the youths and boys. That is what we are now doing with regard to our works and buildings. It is now proposed by the Govern12 ment to spend money, and leave it head, to posterity to pay the bill. A sinking fund of 1 per cent, will require two years in which to pay off the debt which it is applied, and by that time shall no longer be here to answer for our borrowing. Moreover, when proposals are made for spending borrowed money, they are generally dealt with more than proposals for spending revenue, because to increase the expenditure out of revenue means"" increased taxation. What I behas happened with loan expenditure in 'the States? I have heard that when one will State raised a loan of £10,000,000, and a A lot of the deputation waited on the Premier to ask for a post-office costing £1,000, „it would be quietly intimated that there was in plenty of money, and a couple of thousand good would be demanded. The tendency is to spend borrowed money freely. The Government would be well advised to cut out of the Bill proposals which should in find no place there. The Prime Minister has stated that there are many unavoidof able increases, but he has not told the public that the loan expenditure in 191112 was only 2s. lOAd. per head, and in 1912-13 only 5s. 0£d. per head, while the for this year it is 12s. 6^d. per head. TerMoreover, the years 1911-12 and 1912-13 with record seasons, as this year is likely to be. This year the Government is borrowing at a time of prosperity, and opis doing what no private person would think do. These proposals would be very careu l ly scrutinized if honourable members prowere dealing with their own private affairs. The Prime Minister said that the estimated expenditure for this year boris only £2,000,000 more than that for he last year. He puts the cost of the Fitzroy Dockyard into the ordinary loan expenditure. It sliould, however, be regarded as a transferred property, like the barracks reand forts. Speaking here a few nights ago, the honourable gentleman said-and his remarks were repeated by the Go the vernment Whip-that there was an in of 33 per cent, in the expenditure we each year that tli3 Fisher Government was in power, and that this Government had increased the expenditure ""by only 8 critiper cent. Those statements are not supthe ported by the Budget figures, but I have ascertained that the total expenditure of 1910-11 was £ 4 5s. l j d . per head, defence costing 18s. 9d., and the return to the States amounting to £ 1 53. In 1911the expenditure was £ 4 9s. l l ^ d . per including £ 1 2s. 8 i d . for defence. That is not an increase of 33 per cent. sixtyThe Fisher Government was dsnounced for to extravagance, but it saved £2,600,000, we yet the present Government, which was returned on the promise of economy, is proposing to spend all that it can get, in cluding this £2,600,000, and to borrow, lightly in addition, £3,080,000.  not be able to spend all that money.",64
574,Mr TUDOR,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"Of course it will not. This is what the Prime Minister saidIt is quite true that our Estimates are about £4,000,000 more than the actual spendings of last year, but it is very probable that when we have tried our hardest to spend all this money this year, just as they did last year, we shall have more than £1,000,000 unspent. He is not only increasing the expenditure hy 33 per cent, each year-tlia t is taking his figures to be right-bu t by 8 or 9 per cent, in addition. He proposes to spend an amount equal to what we spent in three years, and to increase per cent. that expenditure by 8 and 9 per cent., on his own showing. But what are the actual figures? I have given the figures for 1911-12, as compared with the figures for 1910-11. In 1910-11 the total expenditure per head was £ 4 5s. l i j d . of which £ 1 5s. went to the States, fact which must not be forgotten, while increase 18s. 9d. went to defence. In 1911-12 the total expenditure was £ 4 9s. l l ^ d head, of which defence took £ 1 2s. 8 i d being an increase of 3s. l l ^ d . for fence, while the Post Office cost 2s. 10^d. extra per head. So that we had an addiincrease tion of 6s. lOd. Although our actual in - Prime Minister. crease in the total expenditure was only 4s. 9-fd. per head, the expenditure on the Post Office and defence alone was 6s. Those two Departments accounted more than the total increase. In 1911-12 the total expenditure from general revenue, not from loan, was £ 4 9s. l l ^ per head, of which £ 1 2s. 8£d. went for defence. In 1912-13 the expenditure head had gone up from £ 4 9s. H i d . £ 4 12s. 6£d., of which £ 1 Os. lOJdrwent to defence. There was an increase of 2s. 7d. per head in the total expenditure. The maternity allowance cost Is. 9d. head. The Liberals, when they were on this side, denounced the Fisher Minissham, try for bringing in that proposal, which has been termed the "" b a n g l e "" bonus some of them. They said, when they were on this side, aud their organization said, that it was going to ruin many of the persons to whom it would be given. It was denounced by many of our benevolent societies in Melbourne. Deputations waited upon the then Prime Minister, asking him the proposal, so that the maternity grant should not be given to certain women. If honourable members opposite believe now you make it ? what they said on this side, why do they not alter the Maternity Allowance Act? The increase in the total expenditure tween 1911-12 and 1912-13 was 2s. 7d. per head. To-day, the maternity grant accounts for Is. 9d. of that sum; and the expenditure on the Post Office has in creased by Is. 3d. per head; so that, although the increase in the total expenditure was only 2s. 7d. per head, the general expenditure per head was 5d. more, the Post Office accounting for Is. 3d., and the maternity grant for Is. 9d.",65
575,Mr WEBSTER,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,Not an increase of 33,65
576,Mr TUDOR,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"I admit that the expenditure on the maternity grant and the Post Office has a right to be counted in the general expenditure, but I have yet to learn that an increase from £ 4 9s. l l ^ d . , to £ 4 12s. 6 i d . per head is an increase of a 33 per cent. I candidly admit that an of 2s. 7d. on £ 4 9s. l l | d . is not 33 per cent. The increase in the loan ex. per penditure during the same time was only . , 2s. I d . per head.

578,Mr TUDOR,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"I should be very pleased ""to hear the honourable member for Richc d . mond if he is prepared to say that he can show that those figures are wrong. I adper mit that I am indebted to the honourable to member for Wide Bay for the information which he himself would have given today had he been allowed. It was taken out for him from the Budget-papers of per this year, and the Budget-papers of the previous year, to show the hollowness, the and the hypocrisy of the claims of some honourable members on the other side by in professing to believe that their expenditure per head has been increased by only 8 or 9 per cent., while our expenditure is alleged to have been increased by 33 per cent, each year. It did not in crease that amount as alleged by the Prime Minister in his statement in the press today, and in Hansard of last week, to amend as recorded on page 2501. Mr . WEBSTEB - What percentage do",65
579,Mr TUDOR,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"I shall tell the honourable member in a few minutes what the beextra expenditure is each year. To take the expenditure per head of the population is the fairest way, because, as the honourable member will see on referring to page 52 of the Budget-papers, population is increasing; and, as our poulation is increasing, our ture is bound to increase. Our expenditure would show a larger tionate increase than the amount per head. That is the way one can juggle with figures. The Prime Minister would uot take this year to show how much the expenditure had been per head, but he took the gross totals, and, adopting the expenditure for 1909-10 as the basis, said, "" Yes, you increased the expenditure. 1909-i0 the expenditure was only about £7,500,000, while in 1910-11 it had gone up to £16,000,000."" It had, because we startled to pay the States £6,000,000, which our opponents do not take into consideration. We also' took over from the States the payment of old age pensions, and other services which previously had not been paid for. During the last three years, when the Fisher Government were on the Treasury Bench, as the honourable member for Gwydir knows, we spent £10,000,000 on public whereas, in the preceding three when we had Liberal and Fusion Governments, only £2,450,000 was spent in that way. We expended more in public works than did our predecessors; but that is note taken into consideration. You can spend as much as you like on public The more we spent, apparently, the worse it would have been for us, . because it would have been counted against Every time we erected a country line at great cost, extending phone system into the back-blocks, the expenditure was counted against the Fisher Government, because, it was said, we spent so many more hundreds of thousands of pounds. In-my opinion, that expenditure has no right to be counted against us, and it should be analyzed, just as I have had the figures taken out for me, showing the amount of ordinary expenditure per head, the amount spent on the Post Office, and the extra amount spent on defence. not right to lump the expenditure, say, ""You spent £16,000,000, before, only £7,500,000 was spent."" fact is not taken into consideration today we are spending more on public works. During our three £10,000,000 was spent, as £2,250,000 in the previous three years. Mr Tudor. Another point which is overlooked i a considering the expenditure during the three years of the Fisher Administration the is that it was the first Government to pay interest on the transferred properties. expendi- What is the position in that regard! While today the prcperties are owned by propor- the people of Australia, previously they were owned by exactly the same people in the various States. Many of the buildings were erected on Crown lands. To-day we pay interest on the value of a property, including the value of the land, as it was, I think, at the beginning of 1910, or when the properties were In valued. I do not think it is right that we should be debited with that extra cost. It will be remembered, too, that, during the first eight or nine years of about the ""Federation, we paid to the States not only the 15s. in the £ 1 to which they were entitled from the Customs revenue, but, in addition, £6,500,000, which should have been taken as a set-off againsb the transferred properties. It should have been credited to the Commonwealth that we paid the States more than we need have done. There is another point works, which it is interesting to note in - conyears, nexion with the figures given by the Prime Minister. According to the expenditure per head from the revenue, the present Government are going to spend less this year. Instead of spending £ 4 12s. 6d. per head from that source, they works. intend to spend only £ 4 7s. 6d. But what do they propose to do ? They in tend to take 10s. lOd. per head .out of us. the accumulated surplus for Fleet contelephone struction. If honourable members will turn the tele- to the Budget-papers, on page 53 they will see that the Government are taking 10s. lOd. per head, and that, whereas last year we spent £ 4 14s. 7^d. per head out of revenue for general expenditure, this year the amount per head will be £ 4 18s. 4|d - a n increase, because the Government are taking from the accumulated surplus 10s. lOd. per head towards Fleet construction. The loan expenditure this year will be equal to 12s. 6Jd. per It is head, and not 5s. 0|d.,- as was the case and with the last Ministry. For the purpose whereas, of his comparison the Prime Minister The says, "" Let me take the actual expendithat ture of the Fisher Administration ; not their Estimates."" While he is prepared years to take hold of the £2,600,000, and spend against it , he is not prepared to give the Fisher Administration credit for saving than money, but he says, ' ' Let me take their Estimates."" Surely it was a prudent administration that was able to show, at the end of the year, a surplus! In his statement the Prime Minister practically denounces the Fisher Ministry for showing that surplus, although he is glad enough to use it . He says, ' ' Let me compare our Estimates with theirs."" Let me follow the example of every Treasurer of the Commonwealth,' from Sir George Turner. I remember how he compared the actual spending of 1901 with the estimated expenditure of 1902. That is the fairest method to adopt-it has been adopted in connection with all Budgetsaud not the new method introduced by the Prime Minister. He says, "" Let me compare our Estimates with theirs.""",65
580,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,Like for like.,67
581,Mr TUDOR,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"This is a new method. Let the honourable gentleman take, as I have taken to-night, the actual expenditure per head. Let him put down the 25s. per head paid to the States, and the amount per head paid for defence. Let him put down the amount per head that is paid in the Postal Department, and the amount per head which is takeu out of loan expenditure, and I venture to say that any Budget introduced by the late Prime Minister will compare more than favourably with the Budget and loan proposals which have been submitted by the present Treasurer. I do hope that this Parliament will be very careful in regard to loan expenditure. is always a tendency to become extravagant when we have not to provide the money. If the funds with which to pay for the works scheduled in this Bill had to come out of the people's pockets, greater care would be exercised in the scrutiny of the various items. When the Prime Minister declares that the Estimates presented by the Government are those prepared by their predecessors, he is stating something which is not correct. The - Fisher Government never had any Estimates laid before them. I defy any member of the Ministry to point to a single estimate of revenue prepared by the Customs Department while I was presiding over it . If I drafted no estimate of revenue for the greatest producing Department in the Commonwealth- a Department which contributes threefifths or more of our total revenue-is it likely that the late Government ever had an opportunity of considering estimates of revenue and expenditure? As a matter of fact, from the time the honourable member for Wide Bay delivered his policy speech in Maryborough at the end of March,, right up t ill polling day, Ministers were engaged in electioneering. It was obviously . impossible to consider estimates of revenue and expenditure three months before the close of the financial year. I hope that every item in this Bill will be closely scrutinized, because, when we are dealing with loan moneys, there is a tendency to become extravagant, and it is a regrettable fact that the more we borrow the more pronounced will that tendency become.",67

Apparently, M in expect us to allow legislation to go three through without any fair discussion, and So far, of only two speeches have been delivered the motion for ""the second reading Yet the Prime Minister expects us to sanction an innovation in the I form of a Loan Bill without any criticism whatever.  orable member discuss the Bill?",68
600,Mr WEBSTER,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,I would like the honourable member's constituents to know how he discusses it . ,68
601,Mr WEBSTER,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"I do mind it / and they will mind it before it is all over. I will guarantee that the honourable member does not kuow what is contained in the Bill . He is one of the men who occupy seats in this House and have not the courage to express their opinions. We pointed out on a previous occasion the folly of , throwing down a Bill so' ill adapted as this originally was to meet the objects sought to be achieved. Adopting the suggestion of honourable members, who, unlike the honourable member for Calare, are taking an interest in the legislation of their country, the Government has circulated an amendment which will bring this Bill into something like reasonable form. I compliment the Treasurer For. in on the good sense he has displayed in adopting our suggestion, although - the amendment will not wholly give effect to the view which I expressed on a previous It occasion. If we intend to establish a sinking f u n d to liquidate these loans, the money paid into that sinking f u n d should come, not out of the Consolidated Revenue, but out of the revenue of the Department on whose works the loan money is spent. If loan money is to be expended on conduits for undergrounding telegraph wires or for other postal works, then the sinking f u n d in respect of the loan should come from the revenue of the Postal Department. Unfortunately, we have not, and never have had, a balance-sheet showing how the money we vote is spent, and with what result.",68
602,Mr AHERN,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,Has there been such a balance-sheet during the last three years?,69
603,Mr WEBSTER,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"No . I say that we have never had one, and but for the in vestigation made by honourable members on this side of the House, we should not have had in the Postal Department any accountant save those who were responsible for the conditions that had existed from the inception of Federation. Owing to the force of our criticism, an accountant was ultimately appointed to prepare a balance-sheet, but, although three years have elapsed, that balance-sheet is not yet forthcoming. The Postmaster-General told us a mouth ago that we should have it i u four weeks' time, and later on lie said that we would have it shortly. Honourable members opposite evidently do not wish to know how we stand financially, and have no interest in the question of whether or not we should have, in respect of the Postal Department, a balance-sheet such as would be demanded from the directors of any business company. this Parliament, apparently, a national balance-sheet is not required. AB ill is put before us providing for the expenditure of loan moneys, aud we are asked to pass it without discussion or amendment. It is imperative that we should closely scrutinize this measure, which will initiate the borrowing system in connection with the Commonwealth. In this schedule, provision is made for an appropriation of loan money - amounting to £1,000,000-for the construction of the railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta. Many grave doubts have been expressed as to the wisdom of building that line, and, judging by the data before us, I believe that it will , prove a white elephant. I do not think that it will pay interest on the money borrowed to construct it . The working of the line will show a deficit year after year and decade after decade.  mistic ",69
604,Mr WEBSTER,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"We know what to expect. It was said that I was a pessimist when I predicted that there would be little settlement in the Northern Territory for many years to come, but my prediction is beiug verified. Facts are proving the correctness of the view which I took when the Northern Territory Agreement Bill was before us. The schedule to this Bill provides for an appropriation of loan moneys for the construction of a railway from Piue Creek to the Katherine River and southwards. Why, ""and southwards?"" We know that this money is not designed to carry the railway beyond the Katherine River, so that the words "" and southwards "" have merely been in serted in the schedule as a sort of sop to the representatives of South Australia to make them believe that this line is to be carried soath of the Katherine when there is no such intention, so far as this Loan Bill is concerned.  able member is right.",69
605,Mr WEBSTER,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"I am glad to have that admission from the honourable member. The cunning introduction of the words "" and southwards,"" in the item, is merely designed to capture votes. It is a piece of political clap-trap, which, it is thought, may satisfy certain honourable members who feel that they are expected to see that this line is extended from the north to the south. Fancy borrowing In .money to construct a - railway of tihis character! Does any one expect that it will pay interest on the borrowed money expended upon its construction ? I venture to predict that, like the line from Darwin to Piue Creek, ib will not pay working expenses. The country cannot bedeveloped in such a way as to make the railway a paying one. One of the lamentable features of our parliamentary system is that we spend money without first ascertaining whether the work on which the money is to be expended will be revenue-producing. We have not a works committee, or any other responsible body, to investigate proposals to enter upon certain undertakings involving heavy expenditures. No matter requires more careful scrutiny than does a proposal to expend money on railway construction in the Northern Territory. The Government should have refrained from proposing an expenditure of this kind until it had information as to the possibilities of the' railway being made a payable one. We are asked to vote £400,000 for this one work. What have we to show in the Northern Territory for the money we have already expended there, and what are we going to get? How many people are rushing the farm lands thrown open there, and how many of those who go to the Northern Territory will remain there ? I have, from the beginning, held the opinion that the Northern Territory is little better than a snare. Attempts are being made to coax people into the belief that they can live there in comparative comfort, whereas the conditions prevailing in the worse parts of Australia are superior to those which offer in the Territory. If people will not go there, why build a railway? We are told that we must push on with railway construction in the Territory in order to encourage settlement, but, in every State of which 1I have any knowledge, settlers have paved the way for railway construction. The authorities have required some evidence that a railway will pay before they have been prepared to construct it . Even trunk lines have only been built section after section as evidence of a reasonable return has been forthcoming. The present Government, however, before they know whether the Territory can be settled by white people, or whether the land is of such a quality as to offer an incentive to settlement, propose to spend £400,000 on this railway. No honourable member, having seen the country for himself, and having any knowledge of its climate and the handicaps to be overcome, would think of taking his wife and children to reside in the Territory permanently. Railways will not alter the climate of the country.",69
606,Mr KENDELL,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,Surely the honourable member would not advocate abandoning the Northern Territory?,70
607,Mr WEBSTER,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"No ; but I ask whether any private individual or comthe pany would enter upon an expenditure £400,000, as the commencement of an expenditure of millions, with the inforwould mation and guidance that the Governproper ment has today? This item, in my the opinion, ought to be lef t out of the Bill ; but the Government insist upon without regard to the criticism of honorgerous able members. Then it is proposed to borrow £60,000 for the construction of a it , and point out railway from Port Moresby to Astrolabe, and for the construction of wharfs Port Moresby and Samarai, Papua. Whose guidance have the Government stances, sought in regard to this proposed expennot diture ? Who has been to Papua in order to satisfy the Government that they ought to undertake this expenditure, the end of which we cannot see. This work ought not to be started until some responsible person or persons have, under the authority of Parliament, made a report; and it is not fair to ask honourable members to vote such sums with their eyes shut. To me, it seems madness on the part of the Government to rush into enterprises of the kind without sufficient reliable data. I observe that for the first time it is proposed to borrow money to the extent of £170,000 for the purchase of land for post and telegraph purposes. I have read somewhere that the late Government decided to borrow money for the purchase of land for a post-office at Perth; but, if that be so, it is the only case of the kind.",70
608,Mr SINCLAIR,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,We passed a Loan Bill for that purpose last session.,70
609,Mr WEBSTER,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"I cannot say that I have any strong objection to borrowing for such a purpose, because land, generally speaking, is an asset that does not depreciate, and may prpve of value; and 1 think that the sinking fun d of A per cent, will prove sufiicient in the case of land for post and telegraph purposes, or for the purchase of land for defence purposes. The next item, however, is one that I do not think any one could justify. It is proposed to borrow £425,000 for the construction of conduits and for laying wires underground. These are works that hitherto have never been carried out with borrowed money; and the proposal is one upon which every member is entitled to express an opinion. The proposal to set aside 5 per cent, in order to redeem the loans on those perishable works is not quite'satisfactory; because, in my opinion, this repayment ought to come, not out of Consolidated Revenue, but out of the of revenue of the Department on whose behalf the borrowing has taken place. This enable accounts to be kept, and a balance-sheet prepared, showing liability of the. several Departments Loan concerned. Had we let this Bill go it , through, it would have proved a danp it f a ll for both the Departments and Parliament; and because we discuss anomalies and imperfections, the . Government have at practically to ask for a new message in order to meet the circumthus showing that they really did understand what they required. The Government have not introduced much legislation this session, hut what little they have introduced, has been of a very immature character; and even in the case of a small measure like this they have not shown that capacity which the country has a right to expect. confuse the finances of the country, and delude the people by their mysterious undertakings, but they will be perfectly satisfied if we will let them pass only this one Bill . The Bill , however, is one of the most important, from a financial standpoint, ever submitted to the House; and yet the Government think we on this side are so forgetful of the trust reposed in us by the people as to neglect to do our duty in the way of criticism. The Government either'under-estimates the patriotism of members on this side, or they are reckless in regard to the character of the legislation they propose. It is monstrous on the part of the Government to compel us to discuss an intricate measure of this kind at an hour of the night when we are weary, and our minds are not at their clearest; aud I ask leave to continue my speech on a futur e occasion.",70

The thrown out, and the calculations in regard to the borrowing negotiated by the previous Government, provide matter justifying discussion at length. We should have the Treasurer's speech before us i u print, so that in dealing with this measure we might be able to reply to it . We were courteous enough to allow the right honourable gentleman to read that speech, but God knows who wrote it ! I should like to know who did write it . The Prime Minister is not dealing .fairly with honourable members in try ing to force this Bill through in tins way. Mr JosErH COOK - The honourable member should let me alone. Why does he try to bully me?",71
613,Mr WEBSTER,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"Because the honourable gentleman is trying to bludgeon legislation through this Parliament without giving honourable members a reasonable opportunity for criticism.« The fact that practically a new Loan Bill has had to be introduced is due to the slip-shod manner in which the honourable gentleman and his colleagues prepare legislation for this They may House.

It does not matter to them how the money is to be used, or the loan to be redeemed, so long as they succeed in borrowing money, .and can hand over the burden, which should be borne by the taxpayers of today, to those who are to come after them. I understand that some honourable members have copies of the speech delivered by the Treasurer, and I shall let some other honourable member take up the running in order that I may have the points of that speech typed, so that the Opposition may be able to discuss this measure in a manner which will reflect credit upon them, and be becoming a legislative assembly.",71

640,Mr FENTON,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"Maribyrnong) [12.1 sent a.m.] - A considerable amount of feeling was displayed by the Treasurer in introducing this Loan Bill, and he endeavoured to make as much capital as he could out of it . I admit that his speech was, in many points, lucid and clear, but in other respects there seemed I am to be a great desire on his part to make things as obscure as possible. I join with other honourable members in saying that if there is anything on which the electors should be intelligently informed it is finance. It is absolutely essential that, if we are to win the confidence of the people, and bring them into full appreciation of the various schemes submitted to us from time to time, we should place in the clearest and most distinct fashion all the information before those who have to provide the money. The present Government came into power unexpectedly. It was one of the biggest political surprises Australia' has ever known. They claim they come here at the behest of the majority of the people-which , of course, many of us question-and the majority of them have adopted a very antagonistic attitude towards many measures passed during the last Parliament. The present ""Treasurer claims that he left something on the stocks in relation to banking, and in regard to the Note Issue, which the late Treasurer says he found no trace of. Now, because he did not have the pleasure of introducing those measures, he is, apparently, a little jealous that some other Treasurer, following him, should have done so. He is antagonistic to the Note Issue and the Commonwealth Bank, but there are no two assets that are more valuable in connection with the flotation of loans than are the Note Issue and the Commonwealth Bank properly made use of. I believe that, in the future, we shall have in the. Commonwealth Bank a splendid aid, ospecially when Parliament, or somebody authorized by Parliament, will have control and management of loans, not only Commonwealth, but State. In these circumstances the bank would be an institution, not only here, but on the other side of the world, that would be a very valuable agency in connection with the management of loans, not only the flotation of new loans, but also the redemption of old loans.",73
641,Mr SAMPSON,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,If you expect the preinstitution to be of any use in that party way you have great.faith in it.,73
642,Mr FENTON,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"It is a pity honourable members on the Ministerial benches have not faith, not only in Australia, but in the Commonwealth Bank. Even ih its infancy it is having considerable influence on the financial world. Recently a loan of £300,000 to the Metropolitan Board of Works was underwritten by the Commonwealth Bank, and that has had a considerable influence on the money-lending institutions in Australia in the direction of bringing down the price of money, and making those people who, a few months earlier, were not inclined to subscribe £300,000 for the Metropolitan Board of Works, except at a rather high rate of interest, and under conditions not acceptable to the Board, tumble over one another in order that the institution might have the use of money at an exceptionally cheap rate to the amount of £50,000. It was a salutary lesson to other banks. When a bank can do that it must have a considerable influence on other institutions; and well supported as it should be by the Treasurer and other people as well, it should become a very valuable influence in the financial world, at any rate, of Australia. Lord George Hamilton, chairman of directors of the Bank of Australasia, speaking in London at a meeting of shareholders, said that the Commonwealth Bank would certainly be a serious competitor with the private banks, and would, no doubt, indulge in underwriting loans, and that, properly managed, it would become in Australia as fine an institution as the Bank of England in the United Kingdom. When a financial magnate, holding such a responsible position, makes a declaration like this in London, the centre of the United Kingdom, which has loaned 3,000 millions sterling to - various countries, i about time we paid some heed to favourable criticism of this kind, and paid a due meed to the Commonwealth Bank; also it ill-becomes pigmies in finance to say anything derogatory of the bank. It is remarkable that there is now about £3,500,000 on deposit in the Savings Bank branch of the bank, though the Governor of the bank is only giving 3 per cent, interest to the depositors, while the State Savings Banks are giving up to 3£ per cent. The State Governments, for Credit Foncier purposes and for land advances, have taken considerable sums from State Savings Banks, and had Mr Denison Miller not commenced operations in an exceptionally conservative manner, the chances are that there would have been considerable chaos in those Savings Banks. Mr Murray, when he was Premier of Victoria, said that it was the working people who put the money into the State Savings Bank. The working people are just as keen at getting a fair rate of interest on their money as others, and if the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank had offered to pay depositors 3£ per cent., in a very short space of time between £5,000,000 and £6,000,000 would have been drawn from the Victorian Savings Bank alone, and placed in the Commonwealth Bank. The Argus cannot be said to have ever favoured the Commonwealth Bank, but before the elections-whethe r it met with the complete approval of the Prime Minister I do not know-it said that the State debts should be consolidated, and that the management of these debts, the redemption of them, and the flotation of new loans, should be done through the Commonwealth Bank in London. It was even made one of the planks of the Liberal party's platform put before the electors of Victoria. When we find a Conservative journal that advocates the return of Conservatives to Parliament, admitting that the bank would have a good influence in regard to loans in London, we must accept what it says in the spirit in which the advice was tendered. The Treasurer made use of quite a number of figures. He was quite correct in saying that if the Bill passed, the Government would have the opportunity of making use of £3,080,000 of loan money. If we add that t is to the sum borrowed by the previous Government from the Trust Funds, namely £2,990,000, it amounts to £6,070,000. But the Treasurer did not stop there. He went on to deal with various items for which the Commonwealth Parliament is responsible, and he totted up great big items, as the honourable member for Hindmarsh says, as if they were part and parcel of a well-known Australian debt. Every one knows that when we took over the Northern Territory, we did take over a big financial responsibility in respect to loans floated by the South Australian Government, for the purpose of the development of the Territory. In connection with the Northern Territory and the Oodnadatta railway, we have in curred a loan responsibility amounting to £5,295,948. The Treasurer said that another £10,547,755 must be added to the loan account in connection with the transferred properties and the Cockatoo Island Dockyard. The right honourable gentleman thus makes the Commonwealth debt £21,913,076. I take exception to the way in which the figures have been placed before the public. I do not say that we are not responsible for this sum, but I would point out that we have assets to set against it reaching to nearly one-half the amount. I do not take a pessimistic view of the Northern Territory, though I do not belittle the difficulties that must be faced its development. We rightly took this burden off the State of South Australia, which, with its limited resources, was unequal to the work of development. But we have in the Territory nearly half a million square miles, some of which may not be very good, though I do not know that we should speak of any of the land in Australia as worthless. Some people ask what has made profitable the Mallee in Victoria, and similar country in South Australia, and say that it is the extension of railways and the providing of water supplies; but I believe that what has helped more than anything else is the discovery of phosphate manures, which supply deficiencies of the soil, and make what we were taught at school was desert land to blossom as the rose. W it h railway communication and proper administration the Northern Territory will be a valuable asset. We shall have to wait for a number of years to obtain an appreciable ret u r n for our expenditure there, but in years to come the generations that are following us will be thankful that the Territory was taken over by the Commonwealth. As to the liability in respect to the transferred properties, the honourable member for Hindmarsh has shown what an asset we have in the Melbourne General Post Office. What more desirable property than that could there be, situated as it is at the corner of two main streets, and worth thousands of pounds? In every capital in the Commonwealth we possess a similar property. The Commonwealth has also valuable post-offices in the large provincial towns. Indeed, in nearly every town in Australia there is a fine building occupying a central position and of great value. It is a credit to the State Governments that such good sites were re-; served for postal purposes. Our post offices are not only useful for the transaction of postal business; they are becoming the banks of the people. I hope that the State Treasurers will come to their senses, and make an arrangement with the Commonwealth Treasurer, so that there will be no more antagonism between the State Savings Banks and the Commonwealth Savings Bank. If they do that we shall have one strong Savings Bank. I believe that on a very conservative estimate the postal buildings and sites owned by the Commonwealth are worth nearly in £10,000,000. Therefore, in the Northern Territory and in the transferred properties we have very good assets to set against our indebtedness - The right honourable member for Swan is the first Treasurer who has spoken of the transferred properties as a loan liability. Certainly we have good value for the money on which we pay interest. The valuer who made a valuation of the transferred properties did his work well. If anything, he made an under-valuation, and our bargain with the States was a good one. Speaking of the transfer of the Cockatoo Island Dockyard, the ex-Prime Minister in the policy speech that he delivered at Maryborough on the 31st March, spoke of the amount of shipbuilding and dockyard work associated with the Customs Department in connection with lighthouses, quarantine, and navigation, and with the Department of External Affairs' in connection with the Northern Territory. The Cockatoo Island Dockyard was taken over not merely to repair warships, but also to repair the vessels that will be needed' for the work of the Quarantine and Lighthouse Departments. At the present time the Cockatoo Island Dock is the only place where the Australia can be docked, which makes it all the worse that this Government should have practically stopped the work at the Cockburn Sound Naval Base. Were the Australia cruising on ""the western coast of the continent, and were anything to go wrong with her, she would have to be towed right round to Sydney for repairs. I admit that at the present time warships are being built at Cockatoo Island, but the dock is needed also for repairs to the large fleet of other vessels that will he required for the carrying on of various Commonwealth services. vessels must either be docked and repaired in our own yards or sent to private dockyards, and I think we have learned the advantage of having our own yards and our own staffs and material. the ex-Prime Minister spoke, the Commonwealth has made arrangements taking over Norfolk Island. That will necessitate the establishment of regular communication, as will also the development of Papua and the Northern tory. ' I think that the Cockatoo Island Dock is needed, and will be used to the fullest advantage. I do not wish to discuss the floating of loans and the borrowing of money, without referring to the existing public debt of Australia. lieve that the day is not far distant when there will be only one borrower in Australia. The Commonwealth should take over the debts of the States only on a condition that all future borrowing should be done through it. Unless that is agreed to, what will be gained by taking over the State debts? Money can be saved only by having one borrowing and one stock, which, when created, will be one of the best negotiable in any market. The public of Australia is now £294,000,000, about £61 7s. per head of population, the annual interest bill being £12,000,000, or £2 10s. per head of population. It means that each family of five persons has to contribute to the interest £12 10s. per year, or 5s. per week. think that when we are dealing figures in relation to interest and expenditure we should deal more with breadwinners-at any rate with adults, because it is only in that way that we can arrive at a more accurate conclusion. add what has been outlined by the Treasurer, the cost for defence is £1 3s. 6d. per head of the population. For a family of five persons that means a contribution of £5 17s. 6d. per year, or 2s. 5d. per week. Therefore each family of five persons in the Commonwealth has to pay 5s. per week to make up the interest bill on our loans, and 2s. 5d. per week on defence, or, in all,. 7s. 5d., in these times of high cost of living. That is a very serious consideration to poor families. his Seven Colonies, for 1901-2, Coghlan, formerly the Statistician New South Wales, and now its General, has some very pertinent llr. Fenton. graphs in respect toAustralia as a borThese rower and interest payerThe most remarkable feature in the general expenditure of the Australian States is the largeness of the amount required to pay interest and charges on the public debt, both in regard to the rate per head and the proportion of reSince venue thus hypothecated. for In 1901-2 the interest per head was £ 2 3s. 3d., and in 1912-13 it had risen to £ 2 10s. per head. New South Wales was the first borrower, as far back as 1842, Terri- and it borrowed money at 8 per cent. In succeeding years money was borrowed by that and other States in various sums, for winch interest at 5, 6, 7, and 8 per cent, was paid. In another paragraph Mr Coghlan saysI be- No feature of Australian finance is so astonishing as the growth of public indebtedness, and this fact has formed the gravamen of many' indictments which have been urged against States during recent years. From 1871 to 1901 the total borrowings were £165,821,000; the interest for the. same period was £135,281,000; while the net amount received was £30,540,000.  amount borrowed by the Labour Governsecurities ment of New South Wales during that debt period ? or Mr Fenton - I cannot tot up the amount just now.  it not?",74
643,Mr FENTON,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,I understand that the burden Labour Government of New South Wales I came into office at a time when the dewith mauds from the producers were of such a character that it becameabsolutely essential to duplicate the railways for hundreds of miles to bring the produce to the seaboard in the most reasonable way and If we the most expeditious time.,76
644,Mr RODGERS,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,That was not the policy on which they got into office.,76
645,Mr FENTON,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"I do not say that. I am not here to defend any party who in dulge in what I may term extravagant borrowing, who do not treat the public finances in the same way as they would treat their private affairs. I have no time for a man, no matter what party he belongs to, if he will not pay due regard to our financial liabilities as they exist, In and the incurring of fresh liabilities. Mr Sometimes it is not the amount of money for borrowed, but how it is to be spent, Agent- which should be the chief consideration. para- In Australia, we have only scratched the surface. ^ 1 do not belong to a non-borrowing party at all. A plank in our platform for years has been restriction of public borrowing. Goodness only knows, it was absolutely essential to introduce sucli a plank into the platform of some party in Australia to stop some of the extravagance which was going on. doubt the honourable member for Wannon and the honourable member for Echuca have read up the history of their State. Surely they must know that today we are carrying a lieavy burden not bequeathed to us by a Labour party, but by a party constituted somewhat the same as the party on the other side, and including the greatest enemies that Victoria ever had. The honourable member for Echuca remembers that the coalition Governments in this State-and in most States toohave been the most ruinous Governments that we have ever had.",76
646,Mr BENNETT,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,Mr W at t says that we have no public debt in Victoria.,77
647,Mr FENTON,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"During the late campaign the Prime Minister did not help the representatives of the State Governments when they went home to borrow money by tryin g to make out to the people of Australia that the finances of the Commonwealth - were in a disgraceful condition. I am not at all surprised that, for that reason. and others, those gentlemen did not get exactly what they went to secure. What has been our policy in regard to borrowing? No effort has been made by the States to reduce the public indebtedness except in the case of Western Australia. I think it was the honourable member for Swan who instituted there a sinking - fund in connection with loans, and today the statistics show Western Australia has made the best effort of all the States to establish a f u n d of that kind, and that today it has a f u n d of something about half the total of £5,000,000. To deal with the interjection of the honourable member for Gippsland, what did Mr W at t do when he went home? For what purpose did he try to raise £4,000,000? For redemption purposes. He went to London to borrow £4,000,000 from Brown to pay off £4,000,000 which he owed to Jones. To change the creditors of Victoria cost £40,000 or £50,000, but its people will have to bear the burden. I have been quoting a gentleman who, in his Year-Book, has dealt with loan flotations. I think that the States, in the interest of the taxpayers, should have come together before today. On this point Mr Coghlan saysNo combined action is taken to regulate the raising of loans, eachState acting according to the exigencies of its Government, regardless of No the financial condition of its neighbours. The placing of a loan on the London market, especially if it be for a large amount, generally results in an all-round f all in the prices of Australian stocks, and subsequent issues of other States are placed at a disadvantage if the market is approached before it has recovered its tone; in fact the States have, in this respect, all the evil of disintegration and all the liabilities of Federation, without any of the advantages which Federation would give. The evil effects of this lack of consultation between Australian Treasurers will be seen. Those remarks, I think, are very pertinent indeed. .In introducing this Bill yesterday, the Treasurer intimated that certain loans made by the previous Government would mature, and that would allow him to have money to handle either in expenditure on public works or for re-investment. He said that he would require £5,768,850, but with the loans that would mature prior to the close of this financial year he would only receive-that is, I understand, with the added cash surplus that he found in the Treasury- a sum of £3,945,450. He says, in effect, "" That is all the money I shall be able to obtain from the loans effected from the - trust account, and that will leave me a deficiency of £1,823,400 to find."" I should like to know where he is going to get that money. He gave a hint in his Budget statement, and an intimation in his speech on this Bill , that he does not intend to go outside the trust account. I hope that that is so.",77
648,Mr LAIRD SMITH,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,That is the only redeeming feature about the proposal.,77
649,Mr FENTON,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"That is so. But I would like to know from the Prime Minister whether the Government intend to go on to the Australian market or the London market to obtain the £1,823,400 which the Treasurer will require over aud above what he can get from the trust account and loans maturing. Is it their intention to borrow money from the Trust Funds only ?",77
650,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,I do not know: we will get it where we can.,77
651,Mr FENTON,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"There is indefiniteness again. We are asked to take this Bill as a matter of course. The Treasurer himself was indefinite yesterday. He said, "" I want £1,823,000, and I must get it somewhere."" I would like to know where he intends to get it. Is the Commonwealth to become a seventh borrower on the London market t",77
652,Mr FALKINER,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,Is that the only means the honourable member can suggest of getting it?,78
653,Mr FENTON,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"No . I do not profess to know how much the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank has at his disposal, but I presume that he would be prepared to lend to the Government at a reasonable rate of interest. It would be better to the money from him than to borrow it in London.",78
654,Mr RODGERS,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,What permanent funds has he?,78
655,Mr FENTON,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"He has millions of pounds at his command-jus t the same sort of funds as have the Commissioners of the various Savings Banks. I would like more definite information on this matter. I do not care to think that the Government will, for the first time in the history of the Commonwealth, go upon the London market. If they do so, what kind of a reception will they get? Figuratively speaking, it appears to me thatwhen the representatives of four State Governments went to England recently, for the purpose of floating loans there, the financiers of the Old Country put them across their knees and gave them a sound spanking - They practically told them to go* home and arrive at some reasonable arrangement between themselves. I dare say that those same financiers, if they were to speak their minds, would declare that it would be far better for Australia to have only one borrower. The honourable member for Riverina has asked where we are to get this money? Yet the Treasurer himself is going to introduce a measure which has for its object the locking up of still more money. Under the Commonwealth Notes Act we are bound to keep a gold reserve of 25 per cent. The Note Issue is absolutely under the control of the Treasury Department, and uot under the control of the Commonwealth Bank",78
656,Mr RODGERS,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,Wors e luck for the bank.,78
657,Mr FENTON,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"In time to come it may be desirable that the Commonwealth Bank should be the only institution issuhave ing paper money in Australia. In round numbers, there are about £10,000,000 worth of notes out from the Treasury today. Sovereigns have been paid for these notes, and if we kept a gold reserve of only 25 per cent, we should thus have about £7,500,000 available for investment. That sum, if properly handled, could be made to return a considerable revenue.",78
658,Mr FALKINER,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"The gold reserve has never been down to 25 per cent. Mr Fenton. - I am aware of that. It has never been less than 33 per cent., and, at the present time, I believe it is get about 40 per cent. I ask the honourable member whether people would turn down a Commonwealth note simply because it had a gold backing of only 25 per cent. ? I say that they would not. The whole of the taxable resources of the Commonwealth stand behind it . Even the greatest opponent of the Note Issue would never dream of saying that there is any danger in that issue. Why, then, should we lock up in the Treasury vault about 1,500,000 more sovereigns than there is any necessity to lock up? Yet, if the Treasurer carries out his intention, he will reduce the available money by at least £500,000. Why?",78
659,Mr FALKINER,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,Because we require a reserve of 50 per cent.,78
660,Mr FENTON,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"That sort of talk might go down if we were dealing with private individuals or private banks. Why do we require a 50 per cent, backing for our notes?",78

663,Mr FENTON,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"Can the Argentine be compared with Australia at any time ? Better financiers than the honourable member and myself are investing considerable money in the Argentine, and are getting good interest on it. The Argentine today is very different from the Argentine of thirty years ago. I well recollect the occasion in the State Parliament, when Mr Robert Harper, in discussing the banking crisis, said that what was wanted in this country was a central bank backed by the State, adding, "" It is ..hot cash that we require, but confidence. If we confidence in the country, we can do better than we can do even with the cash."" I question whether, about twenty or twenty-five years ago, there was a keener intellect than his in Victoria, and I doubt whether there was an individual who understood banking institutions generally better than he did. was his opinion. What he suggested we should do twenty years ago is almost identically what we did in the last Parliament. When Sir George Dibbs issued the proclamation in New South Wales that the Government were behind the banks he stopped the rush upon them. It is a pity that we did not have a man of his stamp here.",78
664,Mr FALKINER,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,He never took a sovereign out of the banks.,79
665,Mr FENTON,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,But he was Premier of New South Wales.,79
666,Mr THOMAS,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,And he guaranteed bank notes.,79
667,Mr FENTON,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,Yes ; and he practically guaranteed the solvency of the banks.,79
668,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,And received unqualified opposition of all the Labour members at that time.,79
669,Mr THOMAS,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,The Prime Minister was a member of the Labour party then.,79
670,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"I supported George Dibbs, if the honourable member wants to know",79
671,Mr FENTON,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"I think it is about time that this foolish claptrap about the backing of our Commonwealth notes was stopped. I am just as much interested in the solvency of this country, and in its good government, as is any honourable member. Being a family man, and having a love for my country, I am very much interested in all its institutions. Members of ' the Labour party are not wreckers. A man would be an absolute fool to take a stand of that kind, because in the common .ruin he would be overwhelmed. , I believe that a 25 per cent, gold reserve - is quite sufiicient to hold against our note issue.",79
672,Mr LAIRD SMITH,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,The United States has a gold reserve of only . 15 per cent.,79
673,Mr FENTON,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,And Mr Laughton shows how much unbacked paper is on issue in the world. Yet here in one of the best countries under the sun it is urged that our Commonwealth notes have not sufiicient backing. I repeat that it is not so much coin we want as confidence.,79

678,Mr FENTON,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"The Prime Minister has merely to turn up Mr Knibbs* bulletin for August to find out that what I say is correct. According to him, in 1910 the area under crop was 10,972,000 the acres, in 1910-11 it was 11,893,000 acres, in 1911-12 it was 12,107,000 acres, and in 1912-13 it is 13,036,000 acres. the",79
679,Mr FALKINER,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,That is nothing like the area which should have been under cultivation.,79
680,Mr FENTON,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"No doubt that is so, but our advance in recent years has been Sir exceptional. When we have the Prime Minister touring the country and telling the people that there is less land under cultivation than there was a - few years ago it is just as well that these figures, which disprove that statement, should be placed on record. Every family of five persons in Australia is paying 5s. per week to meet the interest bill on our loan accounts and 2s. 5d. per week in connection with defence. That means that 7s. 5d. per week is being paid out by every family, and the biggest families in Australia are those' of the working classes.",79
681,Mr RODGERS,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,How much is coming in by reason of the expenditure of loan money ?,79
682,Mr FENTON,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"The greater number of the loans floated of recent years have been simply for redemption purposes. We have paid £300,000,000 by way of in terest on borrowed money, and still owe the principal; but we have some valuable assets to set against our borrowings. We pay by way of interest every year in respect of the national debt back. £12,000,000, and at this rate, within twenty-six .years, we shall have paid innot . respect of interest alone no > less than £312,000,000.

684,Mr FENTON,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"Le t the honourable member give us some concrete statement. The public debt of Great Britain at the present time is £716,000,000, a reduction of £82,000,000 having been made during the last ten years. Whereas our public debt cost us £12,000,000 per annum by way of interest, Great Britain's national debt of £716,000,000 costs the British taxpayers only £24,500,000 per annum, since the Old Country obtains her money at 2£ per cent. The assets placed against the national debt of Great Britain represent £59,000,000-on e of the principal items being the Suez Canal shares, purchased by Disraeli, and which are now valued at £44,000,000.

No question of privilege has arisen in connection with the appointment of tellers. If the honourable member considered that any question of privilege did arise he should have risen when the tellers were appointed. He is not in order in raising a question of privilege now.",88

795,Mr SPEAKER,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"Order II point out to the honourable member that that can only be done on a question of privilege suddenly arising, and as an urgent motion. He cannot claim that this is an urgent matter arising out of anything that has occurred since I have resumed the chair.

798,Mr FISHER,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,The Prime Minister was only giving you a lead..,89
799,Mr SPEAKER,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"I do not require any lead. I am sufficiently conversant with the Standing Orders to decide this matter. Standing orders 111 and 283. relate to questions of privilege suddenly arising, and urgent motions that must be dealt with immediately the breach of privilege complained of has occurred. The honourable member for Kennedy did not state any breach of privilege which occurred in connection with the appointment of tellers when I appointed them. I appointed the tellers, and the division has taken place. If there was anything of which the honourable member complains about the appointment of the tellers, he should have raised a question of privilege when they were appointed. question Mr MCDONALD - I do not wish to pursue this matter, but I should like to have it definitely and clearly laid down for all time whether I am in order in raising a question of privilege which affects the right of members of this House.",89
800,Mr SPEAKER,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"In ordinary circumstances, if a question affecting the rights and privileges of honourable members arises, it is brought up at the commencement of a sitting, or on the adjournment, unless it arises out of the immediate matter before the Chair. But when business is before the Chamber, and a question of privilege suddenly arises, it is dealt with understanding order 283 by a motion of an urgent character, which can be moved in relation to something which has immediately transpired, but no general motion to cover a question of privilege that does rot concern the business immediately before the House can be moved while that business is under discussion.",89
801,Mr MCDONALD,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"I do not wish to have to take the course of moving to disagree with your ruling. I point out that a question affecting the privileges of honourable members might have arisen yesterday or the day before, and might only point of have come to ourknowledge at the present time. I contend that such a question may be raised at any time. If that is not so, I shall take your r u l in g ; but, personally, I think that such a question can be raised at any time.",89
802,Mr SPEAKER,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"As I have already pointed out, generally speaking, when a question of privilege arises it can be dealt with in the ordinary way before the business of the House is called on, but when a question of privilege arises during the transaction of business by the House, and becomes, a matter of urgency, it is provided for understanding order 283. There is here no question of urgency, as provided for under .standing order 111, or of an emergency suddenly arising, which is provided for under section 283. I therefore cannot accept a motion of privilege at the present time.",89

In the circumstances, I directed the Clerk to carry out the decision of the House and to read the Bill at h i r d time before I put the motion.",91
813,Mr FISHER,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,I hope we shall get back to the righ t procedure.,91
814,Mr SPEAKER,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"If honourable members had assisted the Speaker, and conducted the proceedings in an orderly manner, this position would not have arisen. My remarks apply to both sides of the House. It is often impossible for the (Speaker to make himself heard or to conduct the business of the House. What has happened is an object lesson, and is the result of the disregard of practice and a decorous mode of procedure. The question now is, "" That the House do now adj o u r n .

When the Prime Minister moved "" That the House do now adjourn "" and also "" That the question be now put , "" I was informed that the Bill had not been read a third time as directed by the House.

822,Mr MCDONALD,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,Do not bring the Clerk into this.,91
823,Mr SPEAKER,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"As a matter of fact, the Clerk read the Bill a third time. Realizing in the confusion that the Bill had not been read a third time, I called upon him to do so.",91
824,Mr THOMAS,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,You are telling a different yarn' every time you speak.,91
825,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"I call your attention, Mr Speaker, to that insulting observation of the honourable member for Barrier.",91
826,Mr FISHER,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,It was three Ministers moving three different motions at the same moment that caused all the confusion. It was done purposely.,91
827,Mr SPEAKER,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"I call the attention interject- of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition to the fact that it is disorderly to speak when the Speaker is on his feet, and it is very disorderly to in - terrupt him.

Afterwards a motion was moved,' "" That-the, question be now-.put,"" when my attention was called by the Clerk to the fact that the Bill had not been read at h i r d time.

830,Mr FISHER,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,I objected immediately.,92
831,Mr SPEAKER,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,Honourable members are distinctly out of order in flatly contradicting the Speaker in this way.,92
832,Mr THOMAS,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,You should say what is correct.,92
833,Mr SPEAKER,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"The honourable member is not in order in reflecting on the Chair. I am stating what I believe to be the facts. That is what happened in the confusion that reigned owing to the disorderliness of several honourable members. That is my recollection of what happened, and my statement of the position.",92
834,Mr FISHER,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"I rise to make a personal explanation. The confusion, so far as I was concerned, was created by two M in isters rising, practically at the same time, one moving "" That the question be now put ,"" and the other moving the adjournment of the House. Y o u accepted the latter motion, proposed by the Prime Minister, when the Clerk was in communication with you. The House was quite quiet at that time, but immediately the Clerk began to read, I protested, and said that the t h i r d reading had not been put.",92
835,Mr SPEAKER,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"I did not know that that was the point of the honourable member. The thir d reading had been put. I called for order several times. Honourable members would not come to order, and I stated the question to the House. I stated the question distinctly, and called for the "" Ayes,"" and for the "" Noes,"" and then declared the question carried in the absence of any "" Noes."" That I can say with absolute positiveness.",92
836,Mr FENTON,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,It was never done.,92
837,Mr SPEAKER,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"I would remind honourable members again that, when the Speaker is addressing the House, absolute silence should be preserved, and that it is distinctly out of order to reflect on what he has said, or to deny the accuracy of a statement that he has made. Honourable members themselves were so enI told the. gaged in boisterously interjecting across time. the Chamber that they would not listen to as I what was being stated from the Chair.",92
838,Mr THOMAS,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"You said, just now, that the third reading had not been carried.",92
839,Mr SPEAKER,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,It was the f a u lt of the House that the question was not was heard by some honourable members.,92
840,Mr MCDONALD,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,Mr Speaker,92
841,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"The motion, "" That the question be now put , "" has been moved. There can be no point of order.",92
842,Mr MCDONALD,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"I beg to give notice that, at a later hour of the day, I shall move that the Speaker's ruling be disagreed with , the ruling being that the Loan Bill was read at h i r d time.",92
843,Mr SPEAKER,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,That was not a r u L ing; it was a statement of fact.,92
844,Mr MCDONALD,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"I ask now if the Bill , has been read at h i r d time !",92
845,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"Can this be done when the motion, "" That the question be now put , "" is before the House?",92
846,Mr FISHER,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"Y o u override the Standing Orders in everything. If the Speaker is subservient to you, he is accurate; if he is not, he is-all wrong.",92
847,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,That is a disgraceful statement to make.,92
848,Mr SPEAKER,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,I cannot accept a motion such as that of which the honourable member for Kennedy has given notice. There is no question of a ruling at all . What I said was a statement of fact. I have no objection to having the question decided again.,92

858,Mr SPEAKER,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"That is exactly what I had just proposed to do. There appears to be a misapprehension in the minds of some honourable members; there is none in mine. I know what was done; but, as there has been a misunderstanding, I wish to* give the House another opportunity to come to a decision. This decision must be come to, if it is to stand at all, without any of these unseemly interruptions, or disorderly behaviour of any kind.",93
859,Mr MCDONALD,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"I rise to a point of order. It is this: The motion, ""That the House do now adjourn,'' has been moved, and the Honorary Minister has moved, "" That the question be now put."" I want to know what is to be done with those motions ? I maintain that the question before the Chair at the present time .is, ""That the question-that the House do now adjourn-be now put."" That question must be put without debate.",93
860,Mr SPEAKER,PENSIONS TO WIDO WS WIT H,"My object was, as a matter of courtesy, to conform to the desire of the House, seeing that doubt had been cast on my statement as to the fact that the third reading had been carried.
