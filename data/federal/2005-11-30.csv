5,The SPEAKER,NOES,"I will take this opportunity to remind all members that dress standards are expected to be upheld when members come into the chamber. NA NA AMENDMENT (WELFARE TO WORK AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2005 Cognate bill: NA NA AMENDMENT (WELFARE TO WORK) Second Reading Debate resumed from 9 November, on motion by Mr Andrews: That this bill be now read a second time.",22
6,Ms MACKLIN,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"Jagajaga) (9.18 am)Labor opposes the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005 because Australia needs real welfare reform. After nine long years of talking about welfare reform, all we have here today is the Howard government legislating to import the worse of the American social security system. All the Howard government is doing today is creating a new army of working poor, vulnerable Australians who have no choices and very few chances to share in our nation's wealth. This is the Americanisation of our social security system. It is not welfare reform. It is a fraud on the most vulnerable in our society. The extraordinary arrogance of the Howard government is demonstrated by their brazen decision to call this fraud ‘welfare to work'. All this bill will do is dump people from one welfare payment to a lower welfare payment. This is not the Australian way. Australians look out for each other when they are down on their luck. We give people a hand so that they can get back on their feet. That will not happen any more in Australia, as a result of these changes. There are a number of measures in the bill, and I want to go through the main ones. First of all, the bill will abolish the parenting payment for sole parents with the youngest child aged eight or more and for partnered parents with the youngest child aged six or more. The current cut-off age is 16. Existing recipients of the payment at 1 July 2006 will stay on parenting payment unless their relationship status changes or they leave the pension for 12 weeks or more. BILL 2005 Secondly, this bill abolishes the disability support pension for people with a partial capacity-that is, people who could work 15 hours or more. Currently it is 30 hours. The new rule will be for people who can work 15 hours a week or more at award wages or who could be expected to be able to work at that level within two years, with or without rehabilitation, training or education. Existing recipients at 11 May 2005 remain qualified. Arrangements granted between 11 May 2005 and 30 June 2006 will be reviewed. Thirdly, the bill modifies Newstart so that people affected by these changes can be required to seek and accept work of 15 hours or more or undertake other activities as directed by Centrelink, such as an approved program of work, Work for the Dole or any other activity. The bill also applies a Newstart style activity test to parenting payments for sole parents with the youngest child aged six or seven and to existing recipients staying on at 1 July 2006 with a child aged six or over. The bill removes a number of safeguards from the Newstart legislation and replaces them with greater discretion for Centrelink in determining the obligations of recipients of this new benefit. It weakens what is called the suitable work requirement. The definition of unsuitable work currently includes work below award wages. That is changed in this bill to ‘below the minimum terms and conditions for the work under the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard'. I will have more to say about that later. The bill changes the breaching or penalty rules to provide, amongst other things, an eight-week non-payment period for failing the activity test or the activity agreement three times in 12 months, leaving a job voluntarily, being dismissed from a job for misconduct, failing to take up a suitable job offer, and failing to participate in an approved program of work. Finally, the bill increases the obligations of mature age unemployed people and the very long-term unemployed on Newstart. In effect, what we see in this bill is the Howard government just repeating a mantra. It is the Howard government in a public policy rain dance. It cannot just say that it is moving people from welfare to work. It cannot just repeat its mantra over and over again. It cannot just do a rain dance and expect employment opportunities to shower down on people. It certainly cannot expect people's job opportunities to improve when it is doing only one thing-and that is cutting people's income support. Australia cannot have a government plagiarising America's social failures. Australia needs real welfare reform. Nobody benefits from unemployment. Everyone benefits when more people are brought into participate in the social and economic mainstream. Labor does believe that people who can work should work, but for those who cannot work we should provide care and respect. That certainly is not what is demonstrated in this legislation. What Labor wants is real welfare reform that tackles the reasons why people are not working and delivers practical solutions. We support welfare reform that goes far beyond moving people from one welfare queue to another-the dole. That is what this bill will do. It will move people from one welfare queue to the dole. Real welfare reform would give people the chance to get the skills an employer needs and then get a job. Real welfare reform would make sure people get a fair reward for effort. When someone gets paid for working, their pay should not be eaten up by tax and the loss of welfare payments. Real welfare reform should encourage employers to give people with a disability the opportunity to demonstrate their ability. Real welfare reform understands that being a parent is an important job in itself and that work makes families more secure. Real welfare reform helps parents find the balance between supporting their family and raising their kids. Real welfare reform involves all of these commitments, alongside fair and reasonable requirements for job seekers. But instead of real welfare reform, these welfare changes will just shuffle people from one Centrelink database to another. These changes will cut income support for the most vulnerable Australians and reduce the rewards from work. That is the real result of the legislation we are debating today. This legislation will cut income support to vulnerable Australians and reduce the rewards from work. The government consistently ignores the impact of putting people on lower welfare payments. There is the immediate loss of money, but it also has a disastrous effect on people's ability to work their way out of poverty. Let us look at what this will mean for money in people's pockets. There is going to be a cut to the money going into people's household budgets. There will be a cut of around $20 a week for single parent families. That is what this legislation will do. I see the member for Pearce in here-I know she cares a lot about these issues. I hope she will support Labor on this issue. The bill will cut single parent family budgets by $20 a week. For people on a disability it will cut the money going into their pockets by about $40 a week. So I say to the member for Pearce: the essence of this bill is that it will cut money going into people's pockets. Vulnerable Australians are going to lose between $20 and $40 a week. These are people who already have very little to live on. From 1 July next year, many people who would have received the disability support pension or the single parenting payment will instead be dumped on to Newstart-what most people know as the dole. By 2008-09, according to the government's own figures, 60,000 people with a disability who would have received the DSP will instead be on the dole-60,000 people will have their money cut by around $40 a week because of this bill. The same goes for single parents77,000 single parents trying to bring up children will be at least $20 a week worse off because of this bill. What does this government do? It throws them on the dole and cuts the money they receive to help look after their children. This bill will have other disastrous effects, summed up as follows. The bill will see people on a new payment that has a lower tax-free area, higher withdrawal rates, harsher tax treatment than both the disability pension and the single parenting payment. This means in plain and ordinary language that when this government dumps these people on the dole, they will get to keep less of every dollar they earn. What sort of welfare reform is it that says to people, ‘We'll cut your payment and, when you get a job, you will keep less of what you are earning than you can keep now'? Mr Crean-It's a disgrace.",22
7,Ms MACKLIN,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"It is a disgrace. The National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling recently undertook research on these changes. I know the member for Pearce has seen this research and I hope as a result of this research she will continue to fight against this legislation within her party room to make more changes to these bills because they are so harsh. There is research that has been done, which the government has not been able to refute. I think it is incredibly important that people note the actual results that this legislation will have on people's capacity to take home a decent wage when they do get work. If a sole parent with one child does the right thing and works 15 hours a week, they will get to keep only $81 of their earnings, while John Howard and this government will claw back the other $114 in tax and the loss of social security payments. They will only be able to keep $81; $114 will go back to the government in tax and the loss of social security payments. That makes such a parentand this is the critical thing-$91 a week worse off by moving into work under these changes than if they moved into work under the current arrangements. The Howard government is effectively asking sole parents to work for a return of $3.88 an hour. For their 15 hours a week they are only $58 ahead of someone not working. That is before they pay, of course, for the costs of work-the travel, the clothing and the care for their children. The Senate inquiry heard a case study of how these changes would punish people for working more. I just want to go through this example. Sally and Claire are in identical situations. They share a house and both have seven-year-old daughters. They receive parenting payment single and work 15 hours a week in a minimum wage job at the local child-care centre, earning $200 a week in private income, with a total income of $390 a week from parenting payment single and work. In July 2006, Claire picks up additional hours at the child-care centre and as a result of the additional income her parenting payment single is cancelled. In November 2006 the child-care centre downsizes and Claire's hours are reduced back to 15 hours a week. Under this proposed legislation, the parenting payment will be abolished for new applicants whose children are over eight from 1 July next year and the lower Newstart allowance payment rate and harsher income test will apply. As a result Claire will only receive $322 a week. That is $68 a week less than Sally. So we have two sole parents in identical situations. They will receive different amounts of financial support to look after identical families. One will receive around 16 per cent less income than before the changes because she had accepted additional work which only lasted five months-that is, more than the 12-week gap before the payment is cancelled. She has done the right thing: she has gone out and accepted more work. The place she is working in then downsizes. Her punishment as the result of this government's action is that she will be worse off and her children will be worse off. For people with a disability the situation even worse because the disability support pension is not taxable but the dole is. That is what this government is doing: taking them off a more generous payment, putting them on the dole and then taxing them for it. According to NATSEM, if a person with a disability works 15 hours a week at the minimum wage they will only keep 25c of every dollar they earn. The Howard government will take back the other 75c. That makes such a person $122 a week worse off by moving into work under these changes than if they moved into work under current arrangements. That is what welfare reform actually means for this government. You are better off going to work at the moment than you will be under the new arrangements. The tax the government is going to take will be higher and the claw-back of social security will also be higher. The Howard government is effectively asking people with a disability to work for a return of $2.27 an hour. That is, once again, before the costs of work are taken into account. People could very easily end up paying to work under these changes. That is the reality of what these changes mean. What greater symbol of incompetence could there be than promising welfare reform but delivering a policy that makes work less desirable than welfare? This government has failed to provide a scrap of evidence that moving people onto the dole will help them get a job. There has been no modelling and there have been no studies or relevant international comparisons. There has been nothing; just a return to the mantra and a repetition of its point over and over again. Of course the government does not like these criticisms-it gets very annoyed-but the best defence it offers is that existing recipients of the disability support pension and the single parenting payment is will not lose their pensions. That is the only defence we have had, but all that shows is that this government knows it is doing the wrong thing and is too scared to do something so bad to the existing 400,000 single parenting payment recipients and 700,000 disability pensioners. The government knows it could not get away with hitting them with these sorts of cuts to their benefits. It is not going to do anything for these people. It is not going to give them a chance to get a job; it is not going to give them a helping hand to get work. It knows that it would be too politically dangerous to cut their benefits, so what it is going to do is just cut the benefits of the people who are going to come on to the payment from next year. There are so many flaws with these changes, but the most fundamental flaw is their extraordinary incompetence. All they do is dump more people onto the dole. That is the essence of this legislation. We have seen far too little spelt out in this legislation about the new requirements for job seekers. Our concern is that as a result there will be very little protection for these new job seekers who are being thrown onto the dole. The government has promised a few sweeteners, but unfortunately we have not seen any of these in legislation. We have been assured by this government that they will appear in guidelines. One of the sweeteners-and I know that the member for Sydney will talk about this, because it is something she has pursuedwas the guarantee by the Prime Minister that a sole parent would not have to take a job that resulted in a low or negative gain from work once child care has been taken into account. We have been told that the detail of that will be in the guidelines. We hope it will, but the fact is that nobody has been able to explain what is meant by ‘low gain', so it does not inspire very much confidence. There is just far too much evidence that you cannot trust this government when it says it will do things, particularly for the very vulnerable in our society. All that the legislation we are debating today says is that the departmental secretary will decide who has to do what to get income support. Something that will take food off the tables of too many Australians is the new compliance regime. There should always be a reasonable approach to compliance. It should be an approach that encourages participation and maintains the integrity of the welfare system, but the Howard government's breaching regime-the new penalty regime-will push too many vulnerable people over the edge. Stopping income support payments for two months to single parent families and people with a disability-for two months they could be left without any payments and without any job whatsoever!will not help them. It will mean that they will not have the capacity to put food on the table for their children, let alone pay the rent. As an admission of this policy failure, the government have promised that they will meet the essential bills for people. Centrelink will hand out food vouchers because the government know that families will be left with no means of support whatsoever when they ram this legislation through. No guarantee has been given that children will be unaffected-that they will be able to get the books they need and be able to go on school excursions like other children and keep participating in sport. There has been no commitment that children will be looked after in these ways. This penalty provides for two months without any payment or any capacity for support. This legislation could result in single parents with children being left without any means of support for two months-all because they will not accept a job that pays below award rates. That is where we are seeing the coming together of this legislation with the Howard government's extreme industrial relations changes. The two pieces of legislation collide in a very brutal way, forcing some Australians, especially those who are being thrown onto the dole, to accept very low wage jobs. The test of suitable work that a Newstart recipient has to accept has changed. We know that the industrial relations changes that the government is also forcing through the Senate will see a loss of award conditions, including penalty rates, overtime and leave loadings. All of these things are about to go. All of these protections that have taken 100 years to be built up in Australia are about to go. It is not just the Labor Party thinks that this is outrageous. We have also heard the Brotherhood of St Laurence and Anglicare, for example, arguing against moving people into working povertybecause that will be the result of the brutal coming together of these two pieces of legislation: the industrial relations changes and the welfare changes. The Brotherhood of St Laurence and Anglicare have called on the government to ‘protect the unemployed from being coerced into accepting jobs, stripped of entitlements that the more advantaged enjoy'. But of course the reality of this legislafits tion shows that the government has ignored the calls from the churches, the Brotherhood of St Laurence and Anglicare-the people out there caring for people who find themselves unemployed and unable to find work. Employers will know that no matter how bad the job offer, the person has to take it or lose income support. That is the reality of the legislation we are debating today. If they do not take the job, no matter how bad the pay, they are going to lose unemployment benefits and be told that for two months they will just have to manage on their own somehow. Somehow the food has to come from goodness knows where-this government does not seem to care! This debate is not about whether a person should have to accept a reasonable job offer. These jobs that will come about because of the industrial relations changes will offer lower wages, worse conditions and no protection from exploitation. We know that the Prime Minister has a favourite job seeker, Billy. Imagine if Billy was a single dad and he was offered an Australian workplace agreement which explicitly removed award conditions for public holidays, rest breaks, bonuses, annual leave loadings, allowances, penalty rates and shift and overtime allowances. All of those things are the reality of that what is about to happen in the Australian workplace because of the Howard government's industrial relations changes. Billy, more than likely, will be told by Centrelink, ‘You have to take a job.' He will have to take a job, even if all of those things have been taken away-the shift penalties, the overtime loadings and all the other allowances, including the annual leave loadings, the breaks and the bonuses. All of those things could be taken away from him, and Centrelink will say to that single dad, ‘You have to take that job and if you do not take that job your benewill be cut and your children will be left without any visible means of support.' The penalty of two months without payment also applies to someone who is, to quote the legislation, ‘dismissed for misconduct'. But in the future the ability of Australian workers to dispute a false allegation of misconduct will also be severely restricted by the Howard government's attack on unfair dismissal rights. A worker could be dismissed on a false allegation of misconduct and not be able to dispute it-once again, they would face an automatic two-month penalty. Of course, that two-month penalty would mean no money coming into that household. These new rules take us down the American path, where so many single parent families and people with disabilities rely on soup kitchens and charity to get by. As St Vincent de Paul already tells us, 70 per cent of its home visits to Australians in desperate need are to single parent families and people with disabilities. That is what St Vincent de Paul says is happening now. How much worse is it going to be once this government forces this legislation through? I cannot let slide the failure to help prepare for work people who are going to be forced onto the dole. This legislation just does not provide the opportunity for these people to get the sort of support they need to get them ready for work. What they need is help to get a job, but of course that is not going to happen as a result of this legislation. What we are seeing here is the government taking people off the single parent pension and off the disability support pension, putting them on the dole and saying, ‘You won't be able to get access to the pensioner education supplement.' This is a little bit of extra money that helps cover the costs for people to undertake training that might help them get a job. The government is taking the pensioner education supplement away from these people who it is throwing onto the dole. This is despite the fact that the Australian Council of Social Service tells us that 60 per cent of jobless single parents have year 10 schooling or less. But what is this government doing in this legislation? Taking the pensioner education supplement away from them. It defies belief that people on the other side are going to vote for this legislation. We know that there are already serious concerns about the way in which preparatory certificate I or certificate II courses help people into work. There is already a lot of evidence that those courses are not doing enough to get people into the jobs that are available, I tell you what: taking away the little bit of support that is currently there through the pensioner education supplement is just extraordinary. We in Australia all know that the American model of social security is a failure. We should be trying very hard to avoid it, but what we have here in this legislation is the exact opposite. This government is going down the American path to social failure, where violence has replaced justice, where communities have become gangs and neighbours are enemies. That is the result of these sorts of social security changes. This is what happens when you tear at the social fabric, when you assign moral failure to the vulnerable. That is the reality of this legislation. It is what happens when people are forced to fight each other for the basic necessities of life. We know that in the United States of America the social security system offers virtually no financial security for the jobless. That is what is happening here in this legislation. That is what this government is going to do. We all saw on our television screens after Hurricane Katrina that the people who died were the poor, the sick, the elderly and the homeless. That is what happens when you tear at the fabric of society, and that is why Labor will so fiercely oppose this legislation. I move: That all words after ‘That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “the House declines to give the bill a second reading, because the House condemns the Government for: (1) failing to allow the parliament and the Australian people proper scrutiny of the bill; (2) ignoring the concerns raised in the Senate's inquiry into this bill; (3) after nine long years, failing to implement real welfare reform that tackles the reason someone isn't working and delivers practical solutions; but (4) simply dumping people from one welfare payment to a lower welfare payment; (5) making extreme cuts to the household budgets of vulnerable Australian families; (6) decreasing the rewards from moving from welfare to work, to the extent that people may actually end up poorer from work than they would have been on welfare; (7) failing to provide any modelling to support their case for putting people on a lower welfare payment to help them gain work; (8) failing its own test of welfare reform by failing to address the growing number of people on welfare; (9) failing to provide adequate assistance for people moving from welfare to work, particularly for making insufficient investment in vocational education and training; (10) failing to guarantee in legislation that welfare recipients can meet their Newstart obligations by improving their job skills through training, and restricting access to the Pensioner Education Supplement; (11) implementing an unduly punitive compliance system; (12) failing to provide that parents can legitimately decline a job where the costs of child care would wipe out their income or worse; and (13) providing insufficient protections for vulnerable Australians in legislation, and relying too much on guidelines”.",24
8,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,SERVICES LEGISLATION,Is the amendment seconded? Ms Plibersek-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,29
9,Mrs MOYLAN,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"The intent of the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005 and cognate bill is without question supportable. A place in the paid work force has the potential to provide an income stream that leads to financial independence. Other benefits flow from being employed and financially independent. Being engaged in the work force is for most people a source of social contact and ensures engagement with the community. The government's efforts to build a strong economy and to provide jobs, education and training opportunities have had a positive effect on the lives of many Australians. We are now in a situation where many jobs cannot be filled, yet we still have 2.6 million people of working age on some form of income support. According to Workforce tomorrow: adapting to a more diverse Australian labour market, by the Centre for Policy Studies, Monash University, Australia faces an estimated potential work force shortfall over the next five years of 195,000 workers. It is also evident that the best way out of the poverty trap is to have access to a job in the paid work force. But these propositions are not in dispute, and the additional support to assist people into work is very welcome. I commend the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and those who have worked on that aspect of this policy. However, I would like to highlight a few problems. The Smith Family's 2001 report, by Ann Harding of the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, found that only three per cent of households with a wage earner were in poverty, compared to 31 per cent of those relying on welfare. In Australia today there are 700,000 children growing up in a household where no adult of working age has a job. Two-thirds of these households are headed up by single parents. A recent book published by Professor Stanley et al, Children of the Lucky Country? How Australian Society has Turned its Back on Children and Why Children Matter, states: Of all cases of abuse and neglect in Western Australia and Queensland in 2001-2002, 40 per cent occurred in single parent families headed up by mothers. It further elaborates that there are a large number of factors that put children at risk of abuse and neglect, but many of the risk factors occur more frequently in those families who are the most disadvantaged, including those with low education, social isolation, low income, poor housing, poor neighbourhoods and a lack of community resources, amongst other things. This concerns me deeply because, although the central feature of this Welfare to Work policy is about helping people access employment, reducing reliance on welfare and supplying the labour market with an additional pool of workers, one question remains unanswered: why are we including in this policy disincentives to work and cuts in income support which can only drive some of the more vulnerable people and families in our community deeper into poverty? Let us take the case study outlined by Catholic Welfare Australia which clearly illustrates the lack of incentive for people to move from welfare to work under aspects of this policy. Let us take a single parent with one child and call her Jenny. Under the current system, if Jenny takes up work of 15 hours a week at $13.30 an hour and is a recipient of a parenting payment single, her disposable income will increase by $146. If she takes up the same work for the same wage under the proposed system-this system-and is a Newstart recipient, her disposable income will increase by only $83. She earns less, not more. That question has not been answered. The argument that there need to be incentives and disincentives in the policy so as to encourage people back to work is accepted. However, there is already one major incentive for people to comply with the new system: that is, they will lose their entire income support for a period of eight weeks if they fail to comply. That is a very large disincentive, particularly for a family with children. It is therefore difficult to understand why we would want to shift people onto Newstart and a lower base support payment, plus all the additional losses that come from the stacking effect produced by shifting people assessed as being capable of 15 to 30 hours of work a week onto Newstart. It has been argued that shifting people onto Newstart is equitable because unemployed people will then all be on the same payment. Newstart was never intended as mediumto long-term income support for unemployed people with a disability and/or parents with the sole responsibility for raising children. The impact of the changes produces some extremely adverse results for some of the most vulnerable groups in our community. These groups include those with a disability and sole parents. The first group includes people with a variety of disabilities who, although they are technically capable of work-and most want to work-are too often faced with difficult or insurmountable systemic problems that prevent them from finding part-time, let alone full-time, jobs. The most vulnerable of these groups, in my opinion, are people with a mental disability or mental impairment. Over 36 per cent of those currently claiming the disability support pension have psychiatric problems and intellectual and learning disabilities. There has been a great deal of public discussion about the plight of people with mental disorders in our community which has highlighted the failure of all governments to adequately support people in our community with a mental illness or mental impairment. Many of these people are living on the street or in squats. Many are to be found in jails around the country. Most go without appropriate treatment or community support. Further, a recent study by Professor Vaughan Carr into mental illness and employment surveyed businesses and found that around 77 per cent of employers were reluctant to employ people with a mental disorder. We are also informed of similar disadvantages experienced by people who have epileptic seizures. The government has attempted to provide incentives to employers to employ people with a disability, and that commendable. As part of this policy-part of the policy that I can support-the government has established an employer round-table to advise it on ways to increase the work force participation of people with a disability. In part, this round-table, though, has been established because, despite generous government funding and incentives in the past, the take-up rate of assistance by business has been extremely disappointing. Under this legislation many people with episodic illnesses will be placed onto the lower Newstart payment while they look for work, prepare for work or work 15 to 30 hours a week, and failure to comply may result in the withdrawal of income support for eight weeks. This legislation will add to the considerable hardship already faced by many people with a disability. The legislation offers reduced income support to people with a disability and individuals with the sole responsibility for rearing children. When these individuals do find a job they will be able to earn half of what they could under the current arrangements before the taper begins to diminish the income support. That is, they can currently earn $64 a week before they begin to lose their government income support at a rate of 40c in the dollar. Under the new proposal, under this legislation, an individual can earn less than half of that, or $31 per week, before the taper cuts in and they lose 50c in the dollar of income support. Once an individual has earnings of over $125 per week the taper clawback is 60c in the dollar. These figures and others that are quoted in this paper today are the result of the work of Professor Ann Harding et al from the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling in a report prepared for the National Foundation for Australian Women. I want people to understand that the National Foundation for Australian Women represents more is than 60 national women's organisations representing some three million women from all walks of life. They had this report commissioned from their own funding-they raised their own money-because they were concerned about the impact of aspects of this legislation on the lives of women in particular around this country and their children. Take the example of Jason, who currently earns $150 a week in the present system and is on a disability support pension. His disposable income, with income support, is currently $369 a week but under the new system his friend Donna, earning the same private income plus the support income, will have a disposable income of $91 per week less than Jason due to the shift to Newstart. Jason's effective marginal rate of tax under the current system is 55c in the dollar while Donna's, under the new system, is 75c in the dollar. The combined effect of moving people onto Newstart is that they will pay effective marginal rates of tax of between 65 and 75c in the dollar when they achieve relatively modest earnings. This is, in part, due to the less favourable tax offset under the new arrangements. This needs to be considered in the light of a typical two-parent family with an income of $125,000 per annum who would typically pay an effective marginal rate of tax of about 48.5c in the dollar for this next tax year, 2006-07. There are further layering or stacking effects as a result of moving to Newstart that impair the disposable income of both categories of recipients. Depending on the level of earned income, those include the possible loss of housing rent rebates of 25c for each dollar earned, the loss of the pensioner education supplement of $31.20 per week and a lower threshold before people lose access to the health care card and the pensioner concession card, with a whole lot of flow-on ramifications from that. The overall effect is reduced income support for people with a disability and for sole parents while they are looking for work, preparing for work or working the 15 or 20 hours per week. In fact, Catholic Welfare's paper makes the point that, under this legislation, a sole parent with one child will lose 43 per cent of their net disposable income and a single person with a disability will lose 40 per cent of their net disposable income. The overall effect is reduced income. In the sole parent group, women are disproportionately affected as 83 per cent of sole parents are women. My major concern in relation to this group is the dependent children. It is already well documented that some of the poorest, most disadvantaged people in our community are sole parent families. The task of raising children in these circumstances is often exacerbated by affordable accommodation being available only in outlying neighbourhoods or country towns and the concomitant loss of support by other significant adults. Sole parents are ten both time and income poor. Many sole parents want to work, but the reality is that, even if they get part-time work, under this new legislation they will be exposed to similar disadvantages as outlined above for people with a disability-that is, the combined impact of the lower threshold of earned income before the taper claws back 50 to 60 per cent of that earned income and the increased taper rates under Newstart. Then there is the higher effective marginal rate of tax and the loss of other benefits available under the parenting payment and the disability support payment. Unlike the disability support payment and the parenting payment, Newstart allowances are indexed to CPI instead of male average weekly earnings. So, by 2009-10, NATSEM estimate that a further erosion of income support will amount to around a $22 per week additional cut in income, with the gap between pension and Newstart allowance continuing to grow apace. Additional concerns include restrictions under Newstart for those who wish to undertake full-time education and training while receiving income support as provided for now. This will seriously limit the option for many talented and capable people, especially women, whom, as I have said, represent 83 per cent of sole parent carers, to improve their income potential and job satisfaction. These people may well be able to totally support their dependent children, provide for their own retirement and make a greater contribution to the workplace, if they were given the opportunity of two to three years of full time education and training. Take the case of Maria, who presented herself in this place as an example. She has seven children. Her husband left when the last child was born. She has taken herself off to university and is six months off getting a of- teaching degree. She can then fully support her children and superannuate herself for her retirement. Mutual obligation in any welfare program is not unreasonable, and the additional assistance the government is offering to help people prepare for work and get access to paid employment are exceptionally good aspects of this policy, and they are totally supportable. Since the policy was first announced, a number of exemptions have been provided for sole parents with children, and some parents with children who have a disability will now qualify for the carer pension. I especially welcome the government changes in that regard. In general, I do not have a particular concern about requiring parents to participate in the work force when their youngest child turns eight or even six or four, or about the mutual obligation placed on welfare recipients in general. However, I am deeply concerned about the cut in income support. As I said, Catholic Welfare have indicated a 43 per cent reduction in net posable income for a sole parent with one child and a 40 per cent cut for a single person with a disability. I am deeply concerned about the effects this change might have on children. I am very concerned about the systemic problems, which were outlined very clearly in the MCClure report, that are preventing people from accessing jobs. I do not see any indication that the majority of these systemic problems are being addressed. I am concerned about the lack of mental health services because, in a full employment environment, many people who cannot get jobs currently do have significant mental health problems, and there is a lack of services available to these people to support them. I am concerned about the lack of housing affordability, which often drives sole parent families and people with a disability out into the outer suburbs and rural areas where, again, there is a lack of support services available to them. And I am concerned generally about a lack of support services, particularly care services, for people who have a physical disability and who need assistance to become ready in the morning for a job. I represent an electorate that is suburban, regional and rural based, and I understand the difficulties of many families and those with a disability when it comes to the links between transport, job opportunity and affordable housing. This policy would have been improved if the mutual obligation test were applied without removing access to sole parent payment and the disability support payment-that is, not moving people onto Newstart but applying the mutual obligation. I have no problem with that. I have no problem with assessing people as being capable of contributing to the work force and earning an income in the paid work force. I have no trouble with that at all. I do not understand why this policy has been damaged, dis- in my view, by moving these categories of people onto Newstart. The minister recently highlighted the government's success in getting more welfare recipients into the workplace-prior to this legislation-as a result of greater support and incentives to employers. Undoubtedly, with further attention to some of the systemic problems, as outlined in MCClure, that keep people from the workplace and with the package of programs under this new legislation, the aim of getting people from welfare into work could have been achieved without cutting income support. In my view, we have lost a golden opportunity to reform welfare in a meaningful way and put in place a package of measures that would strongly support not just the incentives for employers but true and real incentives for employees with additional caring responsibilities and disabilities to be supported in their efforts to access the workplace. I find this cut in income support really very disturbing on the eve of the delivery of tax cuts for families earning more than $1,200 a week. We will all be the poorer if this legislation goes through. In my view, that part of the legislation which cuts income support and imposes disincentives and high effective or marginal rates of tax on some of the most vulnerable groups in our community does not deserve the support of this parliament. As I said, we have missed a golden opportunity. I am disappointed by the short time the government has allowed for the Senate inquiry into this Welfare to Work policy. It has such wide and deep ramifications that it deserved a very thorough examination. I am disappointed that the recommendations of the Senate inquiry have not gone far enough. The few recommendations that have been made. I think there are six-are reasonably sensible and I hope that, at the very least, the ministers involved will encourage a thorough review to be conducted within 12 months of the implementation of the legislation so that unintended consequences of this bill can be identified and managed early.",29
10,Ms PLIBERSEK,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"Sydney) (10.09 am)The government's Welfare to Work proposals are extreme, and the member for Pearce has very eloquently pointed out a number of the problems in the legislation. The Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005 is all about punishment and not about reform. It is all stick and no carrot. It is a disgrace that, when the government are looking at a $10 billion to $14 billion budget surplus on the one hand, they are also cutting payments to the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in our community on the other. These changes do nothing but move people from one welfare payment onto a lower welfare payment. For over a decade the welfare sector, political parties, charities and academics have been calling for welfare reform, but this is not reform. The best that the Howard government can come up with are the proposals in this bill which cut pensions for the poorest of all Australians, coerce parents into low-skilled and low-paid work and oblige sole parents to place their children in someone else's care. Currently, sole parents are getting $244 a week. For their youngest child's eighth birthday a sole parent pensioner will have that pension cut by $29 per week. As a charity worker at the Senate inquiry said of the $29 reduction: It is huge. It always strikes me in the office when we give somebody a $50 food voucher ... they think they have won the lottery. This blunt sledgehammer the government calls ‘welfare reform' downgrades disabled Australians and sole parents to the dole. It abolishes the sole parent pension, getting rid of a payment which is structured to the needs of families. After 1 July next year, sole parents and disability pensioners who are deemed capable of working for more than 15 hours per week will get Newstart. I am going to concentrate my comments today on sole parents because others will cover in more detail the issues for those receiving the disability pension. Newstart is a benefit that was specifically designed as short-term income support for individuals who have no significant caring responsibilities, health problems or disability. On Newstart, the government will start clawing back benefits much sooner than currently occurs when a sole parent starts working, and on Newstart the amount out of every dollar the government will claw back is also much higher. For every dollar sole parents earn from working, they will lose up to 75c of their Newstart benefit. Where is the incentive that the government keeps talking about in these changes to welfare? For sole parents Newstart benefits will be reduced sooner after they start work, and then for every dollar they earn John Howard will demand up to 75c back-even more in some scenarios. That is a disincentive, not an improvement. It is curious, isn't it, that for wealthy Australians an incentive to work means a whopping great tax cut but for the poor an incentive to work means a cut to their pension, the threat of the workhouse and a whopping great stick? Under this bill, sole parents will be forced to look for a minimum of 15 hours work a week, yet they can be forced to take a job that requires up to 25 hours a week if Centrelink thinks that is more suitable. Meanwhile, until they find this elusive part-time job, sole parents will have to comply with a parenting payment activity agreement. These activity agreements involve constant trips to the Job Network provider, endless writing of job applications, mindless resume writing courses and demoralising interviews for jobs that parents know they are extremely unlikely to get. Worse still, many previously approved activities which satisfy these activing ity tests have been outlawed-activities like study, formal education and volunteer work. So, previously, you could do a meaningful tertiary education course or volunteer work to comply with your activity agreement in order to receive benefits. Previously, you could be one of the 41 per cent of Australians who volunteered last year, contributing 836 million hours for the benefit of Australian communities and between $31 and $42 billion to the economy. While volunteering you could also have gained important skills and links with the job market. Well, no more. Previously, you could do a tertiary degree which would have been the best ticket out of poverty for you and your kids. This bill vents that and even gets rid of the pensioner education supplement. The bill says that sole parents will not forced to take jobs when they have no appropriate child care. That was a commitment given to us in the House of Representatives by the Prime Minister when we caught him on the hop. But in this bill there is no such guarantee. The departmental secretary can decide what is appropriate child care for of sole parents-maybe a male secretary of a government department, earning hundreds of thousands dollars a year. We do not know whether he has ever been the primary carer of his kids, but who could be a better judge of who is an appropriate carer in the government's view? The bill says that work will be unsuitable if a person does not have access to appropriate child care, because the Prime Minister was forced to give that assurance on 2 June. He said: If ... the cost of [child] care would result in a very low or negative financial gain from working, the parent will not be required to accept the job. There is nothing in this legislation that enforces that commitment. Perhaps it was a non-core promise. In fact, there are hundreds of details facthe House about the new participation requirements and exemptions for sole parents under the welfare changes, covering everything from a 60-minute travel rule, which provides that sole parents will not have to accept jobs involving more than an hour's commuting, through to an individual's right to decline a job where travel costs would end up eating over 10 per cent of the job's gross salary. There are no such rules about the proportion of a sole parent's wage paying for child care and what is too much to pay. There is complete silence on, for instance, whether a sole parent will be allowed to turn down a job where child-care costs would account for more than 10 per cent of the parent's gross pre- salary-as they can where travel costs are high. It is likely that child-care costs will account for a lot more than 10 per cent of the be gross salary of these people. The truth is the Prime Minister has decided to squib his guarantee that sole parents will not have to accept a job if the child-care costs outweigh the financial gain of taking the job. Guidelines can be changed at the discretion of the secretary. Guidelines can be changed at the kids minister's discretion without reference to parliament. Guidelines are not a guarantee: they do not provide strong enough protection from unreasonable or unconscionable participation requirements such as where the cost of out of school hours care or weekend child care outweighs the wage received. Think about the compliance framework that exists for Newstart recipients, which will now include sole parents and disability pensioners. The Newstart compliance framework is Kevin Andrews' biggest stick. It is notoriously cruel, severe and uncompromising. While the government says this bill amends the current compliance framework, it does nothing to remove the harshness of the stick. Compliance under this bill is simply this: work or starve. On Newstart, if a sole parent commits three activity failures in 12 months without taking rectifying steps his or her pension is automatically cut off for eight weeks. Worse still, if a sole parent commits a ‘serious activity failure' his or her pension immediately cut off for eight weeks. What are these serious activity failures? It can simply be refusing a ‘suitable'-or what the government calls ‘suitable'-job offer. It can be leaving a job voluntarily. It can be three administrative breaches in 12 months. Eight weeks of no payment-how does a family with children survive for eight weeks with no money coming into the house? The government say that these proposals are about moving people from welfare to work. They say they are about incentives to break people's welfare dependency. These are just lies. These proposals are not about skilling up our most vulnerable Australians to give them a ticket out of welfare. These proposals are not about creating a safety net for the vulnerable children growing up in these families. These proposals are not about breaking the welfare nexus-the cycle of welfare dependency. Many sole parents already work. In fact, sole parents have the highest rates of paid employment of all welfare recipients. Of those who do not already work, many want to, and by the time their children are in high school sole parent mothers have the same work force participation rates as female partnered parents. That is very important: these parents are already moving into the work force and they need the support, the help, to do that, not these sets of punishments. But 60 per cent of sole parents have only a year 10 education. The jobs they are likely to be applying for will be shelf stackers, bar attendants, cleaners, factory workers and sales assistants. And this government is doing nothing to offer people the opportunity to study to get jobs that are more secure and that will offer them a higher income into the future. All of these jobs are in the casual labour market-and we know that casual labour is inimical to workers with caring responsibilities. The government is kidding is itself if it thinks that sole parents have bargaining power when it comes to negotiating their pay and conditions. The combined effect of the government's industrial relations and welfare changes are horrific for these people. The industrial relations changes give employers the green light to offer jobs with the lowest possible conditions. The welfare changes give employers a group of people forced to accept these jobs or threaten current workers with giving away their jobs with award conditions to others coerced to wait in line to take any offer. People with choice-real choice-will refuse these jobs but people on welfare will be forced to take them, otherwise they will lose eight weeks of their pension. No payments for eight weeks for refusing an AWA crammed full of belowaward conditions! Christopher Hitchens wrote about similar welfare ‘reforms' in the United States. He said that they created: … a large helot underclass disciplined by fear and scarcity, subject to endless surveillance and used as a weapon against any American worker lucky enough to hold a steady or unionised job. Under these reforms sole parents will be damned if they do and damned if they don't. If they do not accept a substandard offer, they risk losing eight weeks of their pension; if they do, they will be punished by giving back 70c of every dollar they earn. Not surprisingly, most people will come back on to welfare payments pretty quickly when their jobs do not work out, the casual employment they have runs out or it is no longer convenient for the employer to employ them when the employer downgrades the business over Christmas or the new year. Workers will move back onto welfare at the lower rate. These changes mean that welfare recipients will be caught in a constant twilight zone of ‘workfare', as it has been called in the US. In the US, Walmart workers cannot afford to shop at Walmart. A huge proportion of the numbers of people sleeping in homeless shelters every night in the United States are people who are employed but cannot afford to rent. There will be an unbreakable cycle of welfare receipt, unreliable and lowpaid work, and increased hours followed by a drop in hours because of business downturn and followed by another spell back on the dole. It is a cycle that is unbreakable because those caught in ‘workfare' have no time or money to get a better education and have a shot at permanent, better paid jobs that in turn can be used to better their children's prospects in life. Remember that under these changes parents will not be able to undertake formal study. Single parents already have a job. They have a very important job: raising their children. That is the reality of life as a single parent. When your child is sick, there is a concert at school or there are 12 weeks of school holidays, you are the only person there who can look after those kids. If you are not able to care for your children because you are being coerced into low-paid, lowskilled work, then someone else is doing it for you. This is an email I received from Danielle about these changes: I am a single parent of two, working full time currently receiving no income support from the government. Next year, when my youngest son starts school I will have to resign from my job because the federal government funding of childcare places has not kept pace with demand. The only service in my area providing after school care is already fully booked for next year. My children and I will live a hand to mouth existence until I can secure a job during school hours, or access childcare. What will be the future for my children and I, if my new employer forces me into signing away half my holidays? I will have no ‘work choices' as under Newstart regulations I am forced to take any job I am offered. What is John Howard's motto, ‘All children of single parent families will live in poverty'? With this bill the government is deciding what is best for some families-families who happen to need social support for a period to live, many of whom did not choose to be sole parents or to suffer a disability. What the government is saying is that some families deserve choice and some families do not. If you are married to a wealthy partner then, according to the government, you have the right to stay home and care for your kids. What is more, the taxpayer will subsidise you to do so-you get family tax benefit part B. When John Howard introduced family tax benefit part B, he said: Many families choose to have one parent stay at home to look after their children or to work for just a few hours a week. The Coalition supports families who make this choice by providing Family Tax Benefit Part B … But not if you are a single parent. Last year, 76 millionaire families received FTB part B-that is, 76 multimillionaire families. Last year there were 76 families with an income of over $1 million who received FTB part B. If you are a sole parent on a parenting payment you do not have this choice-you have to work and you will be penalised for not taking a suitable job offer, even where that and work sees you just $3.88 an hour ahead. The Prime Minister says parenting is an important job. In the past, he has said: … it is for you to decide what combination of full-time parental care or paid childcare, at what stage in your working life, it is you for you to decide what is best for your children. It is not for the Government to say which is best. On another occasion, he said: We are not in government to tell people how to arrange their lives, we're in government to give people the maximum opportunity to exercise the choice about the family and work arrangements that they want. I think we all recognise that there is pressure on families facing the key life choice of when to have children, of how long a parent might stay at home with a young child, when a parent might return to paid work and also to manage the ongoing work/family balance. And the objective of all of our policies in this area has been to provide the maximum opportunities for individual families to make the choices that they want … So our approach is built very much on that key and enduring Liberal principle of freedom of individual choice. But not if you are a single parent. The government supports choice for the rich and coercion for the poor. The Labor Party supports equal choice and equal opportunity for all. The government thinks these changes will discourage people from staying on welfare. But who needs discouragement from staying on welfare? Who wants to live in poverty? Most often, people fall into welfare through no fault of their own-perhaps they marry and the relationship does not work out or the partner dies. Perhaps a young surfer acquires a brain injury after a surfing accident and ends up on a disability pension. Does the government honestly think these people choose this as a lifestyle? There are two main ways single parents get off welfare: they repartner or they find a job. But, as any economist or social researcher will tell you, for sole parents good jobs and good husbands are pretty hard to find. Labor believes that people who can work should work. But there are people who cannot work, and they should not be humiliated, goaded and punished. Labor supports encouraging people to work. We support raising the tax-free threshold to $10,000 for people earning less than $20,000 so that workers who move from welfare into work can keep some of the hardearned money they make. There is a notion that a lot of people are living the high life on welfare benefits. The government should remember something my parents taught me as a young person: there, but for the grace of God, go I. I support investing in people, not just in compliance measures. We should be providing training and education and skilling up welfare recipients so that when they leave welfare they do not cycle straight back-so that they are enabled to stay off welfare for good. I want to mention another piece of legislation that we are dealing with today in the cognate debate-the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work) Bill 2005, which deals with the rate of child-care benefit families can claim. The bill increases the number of hours for which a family can claim child-care benefit where one or both parents do not satisfy the work/study test. There is an increase of four hours per week-up from 20 hours to 24 hours. That means a stay-at-home parent or a parent who works less than 15 hours a week can claim up to 24 hours of child-care benefit. It also increases the child-care benefit work/study test applicable to those who wish to claim for the maximum 50 hours of childcare benefit from one hour of work or study per week to 15 hours. Labor supports this bill. The changes are nonsensical, silly and, in many respects, pointless, but they are not a patch on the Welfare to Work legislation, which Labor will be opposing most vigorously. This piece of legislation is unnecessarily complex. It cuts people out of getting the 30 per cent rebate for out-of-pocket expenses. The government has promised to fix up this anomaly-goodness knows when we will see that. I hope it is worth more than the child-care guarantee that the Prime Minister gave in the other piece of legislation. The welfare to work changes are all about punishing the most vulnerable members of our community and must be opposed most vigorously.",34
11,Mr MCARTHUR,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"I am delighted to contribute to this debate in support of the government's important welfare to work reforms embodied in the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005. Australia's welfare system is rapidly approaching breaking point. The welfare leviathan is growing so large that the hard-working taxpayer will not be able to cope with the burden. The welfare to work legislation seeks to address a fundamental problem facing the nation: the unsustainability of our national welfare system. Over the past 40 years the welfare state has grown immensely, and it is fast approaching an unsustainable position. In June 2005, 705,000 working age Australians were on the disability support pension; 630,000 working age Australians were on parenting payments, about 450,000 of whom are single parents; and 500,000 working age Australians were on unemployment benefit-the Newstart allowance. This level of increase in payments is not sustainable. In 2004-05, spending on the disability support pension exceeded $10 billion. The total welfare budget for 2005-06 is $60 billion-I emphasise that figure: $60 billion. Peter Saunders the Social Research Director at the Centre for Independent Studies, has researched the problems of welfare in Australia. I commend his book published in 2004 entitled Australia's welfare habit: and how to kick it, in which he noted: Australia's growing addiction to welfare has become cripplingly expensive. Back in the 1960s we could afford what we were spending, for there were 22 people in employment to support every one person of working age living on benefits. Today, this dependency ratio has collapsed five to one. I note that, since the publication of this book last year, the position seems to have become even worse. Official statistics show that today there are only four people in employment to support every one person of working age who is on welfare. The level of welfare dependence has reached the ludicrous position where one in five working age Australians is now reliant on income support funded by the taxpayer. That is almost unbelievable. In today's current strong economic conditions who would ever have believed that one in five people you see in the street, one in five working age Australians, are on welfare. In total, 2.6 million people out of 13.7 million people aged between 16 and 64 years are welfare dependant. This high rate of welfare dependency is despite the relatively low unemployment rate of 5.2 per cent, as at September 2005. Imagine how much worse it would be if we had the high unemployment rates of the 1990s under the Hawke-Keating governments. Over the last four years there has been a remarkable change in the profile of people who are dependant on welfare, with a dramatic increase in the number of people reliant on the disability support pension and on the single parenting payment. In 1980, a small 2.3 per cent of people of working age were on the disability pension. By March 2005 that proportion had doubled to over five per cent, or 705,000 people. The proportion of working age adults who are described as being incapable of work has increased by 117 per cent over the last 25 years. Half of the people going onto disability support each year are recruited from the unemployment rolls, an indictment in itself. The disability support pension is an attractive option for unemployed people who do not want to find a job. DSP recipients are exempt from any mutual obligation requireto just ments, and we have seen people transfer from unemployment to disability support following the introduction of the government's mutual obligation requirements. In the seven years to June 2004, the number of people on the DSP grew by 26 per cent. There are now more working age Australians on DSP than on the Newstart allowance unemployment benefit. The DSP is growing much more rapidly in Australia than in other OECD countries. People who are on DSP can remain on the pension for life, irrespective of their ability to work. The most common problems reported by DSP claimants are musculoskeletal-that is, bad backs; and psychological/psychiatric problems-that is, feeling stressed and other problems. Almost a quarter of a million working age Australians claim disability support because of musculoskeletal and connective tissue medical problems-again, commonly called ‘bad backs'. The bad back is a difficult problem for policymakers to address as the complaint is hard to analyse and to prove or prove. The medical profession and the chiropractors who deal with this problem on a day-today basis have no easy answer or definitive view on the cure. Being a farmer I have had a close association with a crook back for the last 40 years. Personally, I tried to ensure that my back remains flexible so that I can carry on normal activities. Many of the so-called bad back cases have no trouble going to the beach, playing games with their children and doing a few odd jobs for cash. There seems to be an underground bad back work force out there who receive both the disability pension and cash payments for a number of light-duties type jobs. It is not unreasonable to ask people who have the capacity to work to do so, even if is not their normal job. In the 21st century there are alternatives to manual jobs. The computer age is here, and it does not require any great stress on the musculoskeletal system, to use the technical term. There are over 175,000 working age Australians who are claiming psychological/psychiatric problems, including ‘feeling stressed'. In total, these two categories make up about 60 per cent of people on the disability allowance: 34 per cent in the bad back category and 24 per cent in the psychological/psychiatric category. I want to move now to the single parenting area of this bill. There are approximately 630,000 people on parenting payments, of whom about 71 per cent are sole parents. The parenting payment single allowance has grown by over 100,000 persons, or 33 per cent, over the last seven years. On the other hand, the parenting payment partnered allowance has fallen by over 60,000 persons. The budget for parenting payment pensions alone has exceeded $6 billion for 2004-05. I commend to the House the submission by the Department of Employment and disWorkplace Relations to the Senate inquiry into this legislation. It is a high-quality submission. From that submission I note that Australia performs poorly internationally in relation to the number of single parents in employment. Unpublished OECD data have shows that, among 23 OECD countries, Australia has the lowest employment rate for sole parents with dependent children. This is a bad outcome for sole parents and their children. With interest I noted that the government's submission picked up on the situation in Denmark. I recently had the pleasure of travelling to Denmark and Sweden as part of a parliamentary delegation and can report that Denmark and Sweden are facing a real crisis it in managing their welfare systems. I understand that the GST in both these countries is in the range of 25 per cent and that the upper levels of income tax are in the range of 60 per cent. However, there is an endemic culture in the Scandinavian countries that welfare is good and that somebody should pay for it. In the longer term this is a recipe financial disaster and social dislocation. In Denmark, single parents are entitled to only one year of benefits before they are required to look for work. In Switzerland, Austria, Germany, France, Italy and Norway, single parents on benefits are required to look for work when their youngest child turns three. So much for comparisons with this proposition before the parliament! These are policies in other countries which face a significant sustainability problem with the maintenance of the welfare state. In these countries, steps have been taken to encourage single parents back into employment quickly to reduce the burden on hard working taxpayers. In Australia, more than half of the people who receive the parenting payment do not earn any private income, and there are 700,000 children growing up in homes where neither parent is in employment. There is a risk in such families that a culture of not working could be created and handed down from one generation to the next. As a nation, a key equity challenge for governments must be to break the chain of intergenerational poverty and job opportunities. The government is taking steps to address these problems-to address the unsustainability of the welfare system and to encourage working age persons out of welfare and back into active employment. I am pleased to support the government's reforms in this bill to encourage people who are in receipt of disability support pensions and parenting payments to re-enter the work force. A key principle that underpins these reforms is that Australians who have the capacity to work should do so rather than rely on hard working Australian taxpayers to pay their bills. The reforms seek to address the unsustainability of our welfare system and encourage greater self-reliance and deliver self-fulfilment. In the Depression in the 1930s when there for was negligible welfare and very serious human problems with affording the bare necessities of life, Australians were very reluctant to take welfare. There was a wonderful self reliant attitude that they would get through somehow and not rely on Big Brother government for a hand-out. In Australia we are fast losing this self-reliance and independent spirit as creeping socialism and welfarism corrodes the very essence of Australia's characteristic battler culture. If you are in a job and you feel good about yourself, you feel good about your family, you feel good about Australia and you know you are making a contribution to your own children's future well-being. No amount of welfare will be a substitute for this fundamental human value and philosophical approach to life. The reforms recognise that a key symptom of poverty for Australians is the absence of paid employment and that, by assisting welfare-dependent Australians to re-enter the work force, we in the Howard government are taking important steps to improve the living standards of our citizens and to lift as many people as possible out of poverty and free from disadvantage. In terms of the need to address the unsustainability of our welfare system, I just make a few observations about why the government must act. First, it is important to recognise that an equitable welfare system cannot fund itself. For Australia to be able to afford a viable welfare system there needs to be sufficient people in paid employment raising income to afford taxes to pay for the safety net needs of those who cannot provide for themselves. People who can look after themselves should be encouraged to do so. If the welfare system costs the taxpayer too much then we run the risk of not being able to afford suitable welfare for those who legitimately need it. Peter Saunders addressed this problem in his publication ‘Australia's Welfare Habit': With so many more people dependent on welfare, there are proportionately far fewer to pay for upkeep. This trend is clearly unsustainable. The more welfare spending increases, the more those who are still working have to be taxed in order to raise money; but the more tax people have to pay, the less inclined they are to keep working … Welfare thus begets more welfare. We have locked ourselves into a vicious spiral. This cannot go on indefinitely; we are chasing our tails. Those remarks come from Peter Saunders who is certainly a well-qualified person to make comment on this matter. To address this problem, the government have acted to encourage new entrants to the parenting support system and the disability support system into employment where they have the capacity to work. The notion is not new either internationally or within Australia. Within Australia we have seen a similar approach. We are proposing that those on a disability pension and those injured workers who are under state WorkCover schemes are encouraged back into the work force. In fact, in Victoria there is a requirement for employers to implement procedures for the transition of injured workers back into employment, including changed duties where the injured worker is no longer capable of doing previous work tasks. Australia is not the only country that has to address this problem. The United States, amongst others, have faced such difficulties, and I quote former Democrat President Bill Clinton: All Americans, without regard to party, know that our welfare system is broken, that it teaches the wrong values, rewards the wrong choices, hurts those it was meant to help … Real welfare reform requires work, imposes time limits, cracks down on deadbeat parents … That, again, is a quote from Peter Saunders's ‘Australia's Welfare Habit'. That is the view of the Labor side of politics in the USA and I commend that point of view to those sitting opposite. What is the Labor Party's approach in their Australia? They will argue that the government should not take steps to address the long-term unsustainabilty of the welfare state, but instead the government should allow the problem to get worse by forcing Australian taxpayers to pay more for the increasing number of people who have the capacity to work but instead move out of employment onto welfare. Peter Saunders has again addressed this problem and recognised that, in the welfare debate, ‘nothing succeeds like failure'. He says: One of the ironies of contemporary Australian debate over poverty and welfare is that the most ardent defenders of the existing welfare system are among the first to argue that it has been grossly ineffective in achieving what it was set up to do … The more we spend, the worse the outcomes appear to become. Some on the Labor side of Australian politics recognise the reality that the current welfare system is not working. It is not helping those people most disadvantaged who rely on governments to deliver the best policies to assist them. I would like to quote former Labor Leader, Mark Latham, who, in his 2001 paper ‘Making welfare work'-published in his book The Enabling State, coedited by respected Labor commentator and author Peter Botsman-said: Welfare policy … has become a sacred cow-full of warm rhetoric, good intentions and noble traditions. The only problem is that it's not getting results. In the face of the Labor Party's opposition, the government is implementing brave reforms. We have introduced important industrial relations reforms to strengthen the economy and increase job opportunities. We have abolished nuisance tariffs on noncompeting importsMr Tanner-You put them on.",39
12,Mr MCARTHUR,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"a bold move, which even the member for Melbourne would agree with. We have established a Future Fund to meet the government's future superannuation liabilities-again, a very bold move by the Treasurer to put away money for a rainy day to meet those ever-increasing liabilities of publicly funded employees. I hope that future Labor governments-when they eventually come to power-might support that move very strongly. The Howard government is introducing these welfare reforms to make the welfare system sustainable. It is not easy to introduce these reforms but it is necessary. Again, I note that Peter Saunders has addressed the political problem in Australia leading to the failure of past governments to address the problem of a growing welfare state. He said: ... there has been no serious attempt in Australia to introduce a radical reform of social policy to match earlier radical reforms of economic policy. The number of voters who have a finger in the welfare pie is simply too big to risk alienating them. I would agree with that and I am sure that the rhetoric coming from the other side would support that view. However, we need to understand that somebody needs to pay for the welfare in the longer run and in the longer run it needs to be sustainable. The Howard government is taking the bold step to address the problem of an unsustainable welfare system. Through our reforms we will be improving opportunities for the 700,000 Australians on disability pensions by encouraging them to enter the workplace-as is the case in America and will be the case in Europe as their welfare systems topple over like the Berlin Wall. It is clearly on the public record that the welfare systems of France, Germany and other European nations are unsustainable even in the shorter term as the working age population, the high rates of taxation and the excess benefits paid to the welfare system make it unsustainable. Other nations have found the way forward to assist parents with children to combine family responsibilities with work. Australia should follow their example. I strongly commend the bill to the House for its philosophic content, its long-term consequences and its importance for future generations of Australians.",43
13,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"I rise to oppose the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005 and the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work) Bill 2005 and support the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I have been listening carefully to the member for Corangamite and more closely to the member for Pearce. She made a very valuable contribution to the debate in highlighting the entrenched unfairness of these bills. There is no doubt that there is a disquiet amongst coalition backbenchers and maybe some ministers who realise that the sole objective of this legislation, if enacted, will be to punish the most vulnerable in our society. It comes at a time when the Treasurer is attempting to explain how he could appoint to the Reserve Bank of Australia a person who found himself in hock to the Australian Taxation Office of up to $150 million-or at least that was the settlement that he ultimately reached with the ATO because of deficiencies in paying tax. So, when I hear members opposite talk about welfare and the problems with having to pay for welfare, I ask them to consider what role models they promote in society in terms of paying proper tax for income earned. I ask them to consider the juxtaposition between, on the one hand, very vulnerable, in many cases impoverished, families who will suffer as a result of this legislation and, on the other hand, their defence of a multimillionaire who has been on the Reserve Bank of Australia's board for some time and his innovative, imaginativesome might say ‘unethical'-attempts to avoid taxation. I ask the members opposite to reflect on that contrast while we debate these bills this morning. The member for Pearce, a former minister herself, highlighted quite rightly that, whilst it is important to target welfare dependency, while it is reasonable to seek ways to move people from welfare to work and to find methods to enable people to get off welfare, the particular bill before us this morning is all about using a stick without any carrot at all. It is all about punishment. Implicit thereto fore in the bill is a view that these people deserve to be punished, because if it were not the case that the government's view was that these people on the disability pension were to be punished it would find more positive ways to encourage them to find gainful employment. I know every member in this place would know of people who are unemployed who want to find work. I am aware, and I know most members are aware, of people with disabilities who are looking for work. It is hard enough for them to deal with the stigma that, unfortunately, on occasion, they have to experience as a result of their disability and at the same time not be able to properly and actively involve themselves in a workplace. Because, as we know, for good or bad, being part of a workplace, for a person in our society, is a very important part of who we are. We know that when people meet for the first time one of the first questions they ask each other is what they do for a living. That is an important element in the nature of our society. For a person to have to say that they are unemployed, for a person with a disability or otherwise to say that they are not gainfully employed, is not an easy thing to do. Nobody in this House, I am sure, would think that a person who is looking for work should be denied that opportunity. I do not think anyone, certainly on this side of the chamber, would say that we should not be doing everything to provide opportunities for unemployed people, and indeed for people with disabilities who are unemployed, to work and to feel valuable and valued in our society. But it is an interesting contrast between the role model that the government likes to put up in the case of Mr Robert Gerard, who may or may not be ultimately guilty of tax fraud but who certainly has sought to find as many ways as possible not pay tax by placing money offshore. There is no doubt about that. It is interesting that that is the role model that the government wants to defend-that the Treasurer would like to defend, that the Prime Minister yesterday in question time defended-as a commendable appointee to the Reserve Bank board at the exact time that it chooses to introduce into this House legislation that will hurt people with disabilities in this nation. I ask those members opposite to consider what they are seeking to portray in this chamber during the debate this week. I ask those members opposite who will enter the debate to take a careful look at the considered comments by the member for Pearce in her contribution today. I am also aware that there are not many government membersand I applaud those that are-willing to contribute to the debate. I notice the list of speakers to date, in terms of government members, is quite short. There is a limited proportion of government members wanting to be associated with a bill that is going to hurt people with disabilities. The Prime Minister almost 10 years ago said he wanted to govern for all of us, but it clearly is the case that the government want to look after some people more than others. Having watched the government introduce the industrial relations legislation in the chamber recently-enacting legislation that will effectively undermine the capacity for ordinary working people and their families to defend themselves in their workplace just to maintain their current conditions of employment-and having watched the government justify their attacks on ordinary working families, I should not be surprised to see the next plank of their legislation targeting people even more vulnerable than the workers of Australia: those people who unfortunately are not in a position yet to have work. That combination of employment law that will undermine the essence of protection for ordinary working people with this proposed legislation will damage the fabric of our society. Let there be no mistake: you evaluate a society and the fairness of a particular society by the way in which it treats its weakest-not the strongest, not the Robert Gerards of the world-and how it treats the people who are the most vulnerable, the people who have not found themselves in a position of strength. I ask government members to look into their hearts when they consider debating and rationalising the justification for this legislation. Because, if they were honest with themselves or if they actually realised and considered the consequences of the legislation proposed for people with disabilities and sole parents, they would know in their heart of hearts that the effects would be dreadful and horrible to contemplate for many Australians. In the May budget, the government announced a program of welfare reform which they described as a welfare to work strategy. If only it was genuine welfare reform, designed to assist the most vulnerable from reliance on welfare payments to become financially independent and employed, Labor might support it. However, it is nothing of the kind. As other speakers have said before me, this is a welfare to welfare program, cynically designed to save the government some money and artificially reduce the welfare statistics. It will not assist people to move from welfare to employment; it will instead reduce the incentive for people to work and further entrench poverty in this country, not only for people who are already disadvantaged due to disability but for their families and children. My electorate of Gorton in Melbourne's western suburbs already has 11,935 people living in poverty, or 10.8 per cent of the population, according to NATSEM. This is among the worse poverty figures in Australia. These changes can only further sink disadvantaged people in my electorate in the mire of poverty and reliance on meagre welfare for survival. I have seen time and time again but never so clearly as today that this government is about looking after marginals but not the marginalised in our society. There is no doubt, if you were to look at the way in which grants are provided by the Commonwealth, that there are very few that are actually provided to the electorate of Gorton. This is a government obsessed with marginals, not concerned with the marginalised. The bill enables the government to further squeeze the eligibility for the disability support pension and parenting payments in order to restrict access. The effect is to drive recipients of these payments onto the dole, which is a lower payment with more punishing effective marginal tax rates. These new recipients of Newstart will have a new range of punitive obligations to perform in order to receive their benefit. They will also be subject to a new, very severe compliance regime. We on this side of the House will try not to be surprised when there is a sudden drop in unemployment figures a few months after this regime comes into play, which the government will claim is the result of large numbers of disabled people and parents rushing into jobs. Of course the reality will be that the drop in figures will be caused by large numbers of already disadvantaged people opting to escape entirely from the welfare system in order to fend for themselves, figuring that the new compliance measures are cruel enough to compromise their dignity and the effective marginal tax rates are so high that taking up paid work makes them worse off. Instead of paying attention to the unemployment figures, members of this House might do better to watch the rates of poverty in their electorSo ates climb even higher. The taxation and withdrawal arrangements applied to Newstart payments are far harsher than those applying to the disability support pension and the parenting payment. A report was completed by NATSEM-the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling-an organisation that the Prime Minister himself has described as respected, independent and objective. They have considered the effect of these proposed changes. The NATSEM research paper showed that people with a disability will be working for $2.27 an hour and be up to $122 per week worse off. ",43
14,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"To respond to the member for Chifley, they will be $2.27 per hour and $122 per week worse off. That is an effective return on 15 hours work at the minimum wage. A sum of $2.27 per hour, of course, cannot even cover the cost of getting to work. Under current Newstart obligations up to 90 minutes travel time to work is still regarded as an appropriate and reasonable work opportunity. Unless they change the rules, that requirement will remain even with the effective return of $2.27 an hour. Of course many people with a disability have a great deal of trouble getting around. Many have to have recourse to taxis in order to travel. So is a 90-minute taxi fare a sensible option to get to work? Subtracting the taxi fare-even one that is subsidised, as they are for many people with disabilitiesfrom the $2.27 an hour gives you an indication of what this government believes people with disabilities should be prepared to work for. Many people with a disability who will be put onto the new dole will be paying 75c in the dollar back to the government. These are people with a disability who are trying to work. These are people who wish to work. where is the incentive? According to the Minister for Human Services, in March of this year, 5,589 disability support pensioners lived in my electorate. That is 5,589 people who could be paying a 75 per cent marginal tax rate as a direct result of this government's punitive approach to welfare reform. Another NATSEM report recently looked at the impact on sole parents, and the member for Sydney primarily focused her concerns on the effects of this legislation on sole parents. Sole parents who work 15 hours a week will only keep $81 of their earnings while John Howard and his government will take the other $114. In other words, people will be working for, effectively, $3.88 an hour. My electorate of Gorton has 4,039 people on Centrelink's parenting payment single rate. That is over 4,000 people working for less than $4 an hour. Again I ask: how will increasing the financial disincentive to work improve people's capacity to work? Many people will be substantially worse off under these proposals. We know from the government's own figures that over 260,000 people around the country will be worse off if this legislation is passed. But that figure does not include the children who will be affected, which if taken into account would increase the number many times over. How many people do they say will move into work under the package? Even the government can only boast, as the Treasurer did on budget night, that it would be 190,000. But now the department argues instead that it will be no more than 109,000. In order to get 109,000 people into work-and I think those figures are a little rubbery, to say the leastthe government will reduce the incomes and budgets of 260,000 Australians and their children. These changes simply dump people from one welfare payment onto a lower welfare payment and further cut the household budgets of vulnerable Australians. They do nothing to tackle the reasons someone might not be working and deliver practical solutions. The number of welfare recipients in Australia has grown under the Howard government's version of leadership, during a decade in Australia's history when we were told we should be celebrating the benefits of economic growth. It seems clear that the benefits of this prosperity have not been shared equally, a development which will only worsen with the passing of the Howard government's workplace relations reforms. These measures decrease rather than increase the incentive to move from welfare to work, to the extent that people may actually end up poorer from work than they would have been on welfare. They destroy financial incentive by increasing the effective marginal tax rates for single parents and people with a disability when they work part time. NATSEM found that people would be paying, as I said earlier, up to 75c of every dollar they earn back to the government. This legislation flies in the face of what we know to be the primary reasons for welfare dependency: a lack of appropriate skills and a lack of assistance in the provision of proper incentive. The legislation cannot replace adequate investment in vocational education and training. There is no comment, throughout all of this, about what the government will do to train people and to provide them with adequate skills. Real welfare reform involves strong support from government in breaking down barriers to participation, such as skills, workfamily balance and employer attitudes, and having fair and reasonable requirements for job seekers. Such measures are completely lacking in the latest round of proposals to punish the unemployed, the disabled and the disadvantaged. Labor calls for practical support for the transition from welfare to work in response to both the economic problems of an ageing population and skills shortages and the social problems arising from welfare dependence and social exclusion. I oppose these bills very strongly and support the second reading amendment. I ask members opposite to consider what will really occur in the event of them voting for this legislation, because it will do a terrible thing to many Australians. (Time expired)",46
15,Mr BROADBENT,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"The choice today is between recognising the abilities and capacities of people or continuing to focus on their disabilities and incapacities. It is a choice between tackling unemployment or accepting joblessness as a cost of modern society-a choice between the dignity and value that comes from participating in the work force or the despair and poverty that results from long-term welfare dependency. The government has made its choice to pursue the necessary reforms responsibly, mindful that these measures are directed at securing the future prosperity of the nation and providing the opportunity for all Australians to participate in that prosperity-to govern for all of us, as the member for Gorton mentioned. I support the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005 and oppose the second reading amendment put forward by the opposition. The purpose of the bill is to give effect to the legislative measures in the Welfare to Work package announced as part of the 2005-06 budget. The measures in the bill are a significant step towards building a modern and responsive social support system for all people of working age by encouraging and assisting more people to participate in the work force. The three principles that underlie these measures are: people who have the capacity and are available to work should do so, the best form of family income comes from a job rather than welfare and services provided to people who have an obligation to seek work should focus on getting them into work as soon as possible. The most significant amendments in the legislation involve the following: changing the eligibility criteria and the participation requirements for Newstart allowances, parenting payment and the disability support pension; making the private income taper rates for Newstart more generous and providing greater incentive for people to work and leave the welfare system; improving the suspension and compliance framework to encourage and reward participation in the work force; establishing a comprehensive work capacity assessment; and establishing rapid connect arrangements to link job seekers more quickly to employment services. A range of ancillary benefits will be available to a wider group of job seekers-benefits such as the mobility allowance, the pension concession card, the employment entry payment, the telephone allowance and the work for the dole supplement. This is pivotal in shaping and preparing the nation for the future. Our ageing population is one of the most significant challenges facing Australia as we move further into this new century. It demands planning and response now, not later-and that is what the Howard government has been innovative about and proactive on. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Australia's unemployment rate is at a 29-year low of 5.1 per cent. There is now a shortage of workers, not a shortage of jobs. The situation will only accelerate with the ageing of the Australian population. The potential shortfall of Australian workers over the next five years could be as many as 195,000 workers, according to the 2005 report, Workforce tomorrow, from the Centre for Policy Studies at Monash University. Currently Australia's participation rate for working age people is 73.6 per cent. Those are the OECD figures for the employment outlook for this year. This is well behind other OECD countries such as Canada, Denmark, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. A number of valuable considerations have been put forward with regard to our shortage of skilled workers. One of the suggestions has been to allow bridging visa E holders currently in the community to have work rights. I raised that in this place on 2 November, and Gerard Henderson wrote about it in Tuesday's Sydney Morning Herald. But today the government's Welfare to Work package sets in place several measures that will try and address some of the present challenges relating to a shortage of skilled workers. In order to meet the skill and labour shortages that the Australian economy will experience we must ensure that as many Australians of working age are able to participate in the work force as possible, and to their highest level of capacity and availability. The ageing of the population will result in fewer new entrants into our labour force. If we do nothing to address this issue, we will see a substantial reduction in the growth of the labour force over the next 10 to 15 years. At present the net growth in the Australian work force is 170,000 people each year. Access Economics has estimated that over the decade 2020 to 2030 the work force will grow by just 125,000 people. That averages out to a mere 12,500 people per year. The resultant side effects will lead to an everdiminishing tax and revenue base for our governments. This will seriously impact on the ability to provide a range of government services, including pensions, working age income support payments and health services. The best form of welfare is a job. Governments have a responsibility to reduce welfare dependency wherever possible, and this is one of the guiding principles of the Welfare to Work legislation. A job can have a profoundly positive effect on an individual's life and well-being, as well as on the well-being of that person's family and of course society as a whole. The obligation upon people to get up in the morning and prepare to go to a job where they bring their services and skills to the workplace can make a fundamental difference in how people view themselves as being worthy and contributing something to the wider community. But the child or dependant of someone in work can also learn invaluable lessons from that example. Structure and routine are important facets in any child's early years, and the portunity to see their parent or guardian viding for the family unit through the fruits of their labour offers invaluable life lessons. The economic benefits of low unemployment in any community speak for themselves. There are currently 2.6 million working age-15to 64-year-old-Australians on income support, of which only 15 per cent are required to actively search for a job. sive welfare payments, with no obligations, lock people out of participating prosperity and condemn them to a lifetime of poverty. Despite Australia experiencing a sustained period of strong economic growth, including the creation of more than 1.7 million new jobs, the number of working age Australians receiving the disability support pension and parenting payments has increased significantly. In the 12 months prior to June 2004, 55 per cent of people transferred to the disability support payment from another payment. In the seven years prior to June 2004 disability support grew by 26 per cent and parenting payment single by 33 per cent. There are now more working age Australians on the disability support pension than there are on the Newstart allowance. As at June 2005, 705,000 working age Australians were receiving the disability support pension, 630,000 working age Australians were receiving parenting payments, 260,000 were aged over 50 and in receipt of income support and 500,000 working age Australians were on the Newstart allowance. This level of increase in payments is not sustainable. In 2004-05 spending on the disability support pension exceeded $10 billion. The total welfare budget for 2005-06 is $60 billion-$60 thousand million. The general view in the community and amongst welfare recipients is that continuing income support should be conditional on people making an effort to get off payments op- and get a job. This view is shared by threepro- quarters of the community and almost two-thirds of Centrelink customers. Australia's welfare system is designed to provide a safety net for those who genuinely need it. It is a generous and well-targeted system by world standards, and for that this nation should take some pride. However, our system was designed at a time when most jobs Paswere full time, most unemployment was for a short time and mothers and married women in Australia's generally did not work. I have received several emails from people around the community, mostly using a letter template from ACOSS, regarding these changes. I do not for a moment doubt the sincerity or genuine concern that has motivated these people to email me and my colleagues, but I would like to make a couple of points. Despite their concerns, even ACOSS acknowledges the negative effect of not having a job. ACOSS has released studies that show that people who receive the parenting payment are three times as likely as people with jobs to suffer from depression or anxiety disorders. According to ACOSS, 50 per cent of sole parents suffer from poor mental health. The President of ACOSS, Andrew MCCallum, has acknowledged that the best form of welfare is a job. The government's Welfare to Work reforms will provide sole parents with the support and practical assistance they need to combine work and their family responsibilities. Sole parents will also receive the ing, advice and support they need to get ready for work. According to the survey Customer and community attitudes to working age participation requirements, conducted by the Social Research Centre, the majority of jobless Centrelink customers-77 per cent-said they would prefer to be in paid work. This included 82 per cent of jobless disability support pensioners and 74 per cent of jobless parenting payment single recipients. This report is indicative of the comments I received from people within my electorate. For someone living in Warragul, being able to get in contact with the local Network agency or the local Salvation Army Employment Plus office in Warragul and finding work is far more valuable than being permanently on welfare. I spoke before about the profoundly positive impact simply being employed can have on individuals and their families. I was also referring to measures that need to be taken, such as those provided for in this legislation, to prevent intergenerational unemployment from prevailing. For some young people growing up in a household that has second and third generation unemployment, the impact on self-esteem and the examples inadvertently set can be lifelong. Everyone in Australia who wants work should be able to find it, and the Prime Minister's conviction in this ethos is evident in this legislation. Research conducted in Australia shows that growing up in a welfare dependent household leads to poorer outcomes for young people. There are currently 700,000 children in Australia growing up in households where no adult of working age has a job. Two-thirds of these households are headed by single parents. Young people living with parents on income support are much more likely than average to leave school early, become unemployed or become teenage parents and end up on income support trainthemselves. Young people whose parents work, even in a low-paid job, have the benefit of positive role models in their lives and fare much better. Disadvantaged families where no parent is working are more likely to have mental health disorders, lower rates of immunisation, greater risk of juvenile participation in criminal activity, problems adjusting to schooling and a higher incidence of early exit from schooling. Labor will oppose the legislation for the sake of opposing it and will provide no alternative policies. Labor is a policy-free zone when it comes to addressing the issue of welJob fare dependency and increasing work force participation-unless I am about to hear some new ideas put forward by the opposition in the next address. Labor's core constituency is the socialist left of the welfare lobby, not the welfare recipients themselves. These groups believe that welfare is an absolute entitlement and right and that all income should be indiscriminately redistributed from the rich to the poor. Labor will claim that it supports the notion that it is important to assist unemployed people into work; however, it does not support the movement of people from pensions to unemployment benefits which contain mutual obligation requirements. Labor talks about welfare reform but has never actually produced a policy that directly addresses the issue. Labor will claim that this legislation, the Welfare to Work reforms, will create a so called working poor. Such claims are baseless. The primary cause of low income is not a low wage but joblessness. The argument that minimum wage jobs lead to the creation of a low-paid underclass is not supported by the facts. A study undertaken in 2004 by Lloyd, Harding and Payne, from the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling at the University of Canberra, Australians in poverty in the 21st century, showed that around 41 per cent of unemployed people were considered to be in relative poverty, along with 17.9 per cent of people not in the labour force and 24.3 per cent of people whose main source of income was government cash benefits. Only two per cent of people whose main source of income was wages and salaries were considered to be in relative poverty. Labor will claim that people moving from a pension payment to Newstart allowance will be financially worse off. Such a claim is not true, because the majority of people on pensions do not earn any private income. The valid comparison to be made is between a person on a pension who does not work and a person on Newstart who undertakes part-time work. In 1991, when the Labor Party were last in government, they enacted the Social Security (Job Search and Newstart) Amendment Bill and the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill which introduced activity agreements as a supposed condition for the receipt of welfare benefits. Brian Howe, the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services at the time, stated in his second reading speech: In each case, the activity agreement will set out the steps that individuals will have to take to improve their employment prospects. There should be no misunderstanding about this. The activity agreement will be a requirement for payment. If a person is not prepared to enter into, and abide by, an agreement he or she will not be paid Newstart allowance. In 2005 it is clear that the Labor Party no longer support mutual obligation in return for welfare payments. Or is it that we see the Labor Party in government saying one thing and the Labor Party in opposition saying another? The Labor senators involved in the Senate Community Affairs References Committee 2004 report A hand up not a hand out: renewing the fight against poverty recommended that a poverty summit be held, an adoption of poverty targets and an antipoverty agency as an independent statutory authority be established. A poverty summit would neither solve nor resolve anything. The government already gives careful consideration to the views of welfare groups and other community organisations. A summit would be nothing more than a glorified PR exercise in which the participants would feel good about themselves but little else would be achieved. When Labor talk about setting poverty targets their idea of reducing poverty does not extend beyond giving people more and more welfare payments. An antipoverty agency would be totally inappropriate. The responsibility for developing, implementing and monitoring social policy is not a function that should be delegated to a statutory authority. None of these recommendations would do anything to address the issue of poverty. They are typical of the Labor Party, who are bereft of any real solutions to the very real problem of poverty. From 1 July 2006 parents who apply for parenting payment single will be no longer eligible for that payment once their youngest child turns eight. They will instead, subject to meeting other eligibility criteria, be ble for Newstart allowance. From 1 July 2006 parents who apply for parenting payment will be no longer eligible for that payment once their youngest child turns six. They will instead, subject to meeting other eligibility criteria, be eligible for Newstart allowance. Those already receiving parenting payment as at 1 July 2006 will remain on that pension benefit until their youngest child turns 16 years of age, as is the case now. The Australians Working Together 2001 reforms only required parenting payment recipients to undertake a part-time activity of up to 150 hours over each 26 weeks when their youngest child turns 13 years of age. People who apply for the disability support pension after 1 July 2006 will be assessed against a criteria of whether they can work at least 15 hours per week at full award wages with the receipt of two years or less of tance. This assessment will be undertaken by the comprehensive work capacity assessment teams. People who are able to work for 15 hours or more per week will be eligible for Newstart allowance. People who are unable to work at least 15 hours or more per week will be eligible for the disability support ment. Those who are eligible for disability support from 11 May 2005 will be subject to future assessments to determine whether they have the capacity to work 15 hours a week. People currently on disability support can voluntarily seek work and have full access to employment and job search assistance services. A two-year suspension rule will also be applied to disability support pension recipients who enter the work force. This means that a person will be allowed to return to disability support payment at any time during a two-year period regardless of their reason for leaving their employment. Parents in receipt of parenting payment support, PPP or NSA where the youngest child has turned six will be required to work 15 hours per eligiweek. Parents may be considered for temporary exemptions from participation requirements depending on their special family circumstances. Parents' individual circumstances will be taken into account when determining their participation requirements. The government recognises that some primary carer parents-for example, registered foster carers, registered distance educators, recognised home schoolers or those who have large families or a disabled childmay be unavailable for work because of the need to focus fully on their caring responsibilities. If a parent has special family circumstances such as these, they will be taken into account when determining their participation requirements under the Welfare to Work changes, and the parent may be eligible for a temporary exemption. It is important in my role as a backbencher in this govassis- ernment that we monitor and continue to review all of this legislation once it has been implemented. (Time expired)",47
16,Ms GEORGE,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"Throsby) (11.27 am)The Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005 and Family payand Community Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work) Bill 2005, which we are debating in the chamber today, were first flagged in the Treasurer's budget speech earlier this year. I took a particular interest in what the Treasurer had to say because the changes in moving people from welfare to work would have a significant impact on the people that I represent in this parliament. I have about 10,000 people in the categories of disability support pensioners and sole parents in my electorate and so, naturally, any change in their conditions and entitlements is an issue that I need to follow carefully. I listened carefully to the Treasurer's speech, and I must say it left me with the impression that the rationale for these so called reforms was much more about cost savings than a genuine effort to construct a package that would, in a practical and tangible way, assist people to move from welfare to work. In defence of what now appear to be the most radical changes to the provision of social security since the act was introduced back in 1947, the Treasurer glibly argued that the changes would ‘also reduce the obligation on other taxpayers whose taxes pay for the welfare support'. You could not help but conclude that the Treasurer's agenda was really about cost reductions rather than genuine reform, and I think the legislation before us confirms that that is the case. The member for MCMillan has just said that income support for these categories of recipients is not sustainable in the long run. Tell that to the 10,000 people in my electorate who well know that the government's projected surplus this year will be in the order of $12 bilment lion to $14 billion. What the member for MCMillan did not address in his contribution was the fundamental crux of this bill and which goes to the heart of the question: how does slashing the entitlements of people eligible for the disability support pension or the sole parent payment help them to find work? That is the central question that, in my judgment, has neither been properly addressed nor answered by the government. I support the objective of helping people move from welfare to work. I could not think of anything more depressing than facing a lengthy period of time on welfare support alone. Having a job is important. Work is a fundamental building block of social and economic inclusion. The community and the individual benefit when more people are able to participate in the social and economic mainstream. Flowing from this are not only personal and individual benefits but macro benefits as well. The member for MCMillan was right in pointing to the imperatives that face our economy with an ageing population. There is no argument about the need for Australia to increase its labour participation rates-that is an important priority-but how we go about realising these objectives is really the crux of the problem with the bill before us. I would like the member for MCMillan to tell me how it is that merely moving people already on very low income support to an even lower benefit is going to help them achieve paid work. On current entitlements, people who have disabilities in the future and who are able to work for 15 hours or more will be at least $77 a fortnight worse off, and sole parents $44 per fortnight. At the recent Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry, the departconfirmed that, if this bill is passed, by 2008 an estimated 171,000 people will be on lower payments than they would be under current arrangements. What is the government's justification for this action? What is the rationale for moving people to a lesser payment when the legislation is supposedly to assist them moving from welfare to work? Make no mistake about it: the central plank of this legislation is all about income reduction. From July 2006, there will be a reduction in income for many sole parents and people with a disability. People with a disability will face a harsher and more restrictive test when claiming the disability support pension. Those who are assessed as being able to work for 15 hours or more will be entitled only to the Newstart allowance-that is, the dole payment. Future applicants for the parenting payment single benefit will be moved onto the lower dole payment when their child turns eight. Not only does the reduced Newstart allowance cut their income support but, as we also know, the Newstart allowance has a lower ‘free' area. It is subject to higher withplace. drawal rates and harsher tax treatment than both the disability support pension and the single parenting payment. The effect of all this will be to place people with a disability and sole parents in a substantially worse financial position than they would be under current arrangements. In addition, they will face far higher effective marginal tax rates, which we all know operate as a disincentive to work. If the member for MCMillan does not accept my argument, I would like to tell him about the findings of NATSEM, a highly authoritative research body, which had a look at the impact of the proposed changes on sole parents. I think it is very revealing. Their modelling showed that, once placed on the lesser Newstart allowance, a sole parent working for 15 hours a week on the minimum wage would keep just $81 of a $195 weekly pay packet. The government would take another $114 by way of changes to the income test and through taxes so that many sole parents would be facing an effective marginal tax rate of between 65 and 75 per cent. NATSEM claim that a sole parent would be $91 a week worse off by moving into work under these proposals than they would be under current arrangements. The government would effectively be asking sole parents to work for $5.40 an hour. I do not know whether the member for MCMillan thinks about this incentive, but I know that many people in the community would be appalled to think that the end result of these changes, combined with the effective marginal tax rates, would have sole parents working for $5.40 an hour. Please tell me what the incentive is for sole parents to move into paid work when they face losing 65c in every dollar they earn? And that is before they pay for transport and other costs and, very importantly, for child-care arrangements if they can find a child-care People with disabilities will be even more drastically affected by this legislation than sole parents. Single disability recipients aged over 20 are expected to receive about $257 a week on average in 2006-07. The Newstart rate-that is, the new unemployment ratefor a single person without children will be $46 a week less. A crucial factor affecting disability pensioners will be the amount of private income that they can receive before their income support is reduced. In 2006-07, a single DSP recipient will be able to earn $64 a week without any reduction in their income support, but they will be able to earn only $31 on the unemployment benefit before their support is reduced. For every dollar of income they earn above this threshold, their payment from government will be reduced by 40c whereas on Newstart it will be reduced by 50c to 60c. Again I ask: where are the practical incentives and proposals to assist people move into paid employment? No evidence has ever been provided, nor did it come forward in the Senate inquiry, that cutting payments will actually increase labour force participation. It is quite extraordinary that this government has taken a decision to reduce the income levels of so many Australians without providing any empirical data or clear rationale that such reductions would, in fact, enhance work force participation. I agree with the member for MCMillan: increasing work force participation at a time when our population is ageing is a very key economic imperative-but you have gone about it in the wrong way. The government has gone about it in a very punishing, meanspirited way rather than actually building in the kind of support systems required to assist people to move from welfare to work. Furthermore, I think that there will be more complexity when we create these new categories of recipients, with different levels of payment and different activity requirements. We will in effect create a far more complex and inconsistent social security system. The evidence presented to the Senate inquiry from a range of welfare agencies and churches was overwhelmingly to the effect that these changes will increase hardship and poverty. I know that the member for MCMillan argues that it is a baseless claim to say that poverty levels will increase. I suggest he tell that to the Brotherhood of St Laurence, Anglicare and other agencies that work on a daily basis with people at the lower end of the income scale and people desperately in need of help. In their submissions to the inquiry, both of these agencies said: ... reduced payments to sole parents and people with disabilities are unnecessary and counterproductive and will result in increased hardship for groups already facing significant disadvantage. The Bill introduces new activity test requirements for people in these groups but fails tailor these to individual circumstances and imposes harsh penalties on those who do not meet them. I repeat: by the department's own estimates, by 2008 there will be 171,000 people on lower payments than they would be under current arrangements. In concluding my comments on this bill, I want to touch on the very important issue of the interaction of these changes with the very regressive changes contemplated in the government's industrial relations proposals. During the Senate inquiry, St Vincent de Paul and other welfare agencies rightly pointed out that this bill, in combination with the IR legislation, will see an increase in poverty levels and a significant growth in the number of working poor-and, beyond that, of course, not just the working poor as adults but the children in those family groupings. I fear that the impact of income support cuts is going to be felt more intensely in areas like mine-and I dare say in areas like the member for MCMillan's-in regional and rural Australia, where we all know jobs are that much harder to find. When you look at the age composition of people on the disability support pension in my electorate, you see that the overwhelming majority are mature aged people. Try finding a job in the Illawarra if you are 50 or over. I tell you: it is very hard. When you compound that difficulty with a disabled person looking for work, it is even more problematic. If it were that easy, why is it that under this government the number of disabled people in employment in the government sector has dropped from 5.6 per cent to 3.8 per cent? If it is hard for the government to place people with disabilities in employment, how much harder is it going to be in a competitive labour market? What will be the options for many sole parents I represent who have been out of the work force for lengthy periods, to engaged in the important responsibility of child rearing? Regrettably, the provisions of this bill risk placing the most vulnerable in our community in a position where they may be compelled to accept employment with below current award conditions or lose their entitlements. The interaction of the changes proposed in this bill together with the government's IR changes creates a situation in which an income support recipient is required to accept employment on just the bare, basic minimum conditions. We know those minimum conditions as proposed by the government are devoid of penalty rates, overtime, leave loadings and the rest. If recipients do not accept a job, they stand to lose their payments for eight weeks at a time. No-one has told me how sole parents and their children will cope with no income coming into their household for eight weeks at a time. In other words, it will be: accept the contract on offer for the job on offer and, if you do not take it, not only do you risk not finding meaningful work but also you face the loss of your entitlement. In the words of the St Vincent de Paul Society: Our concern lies primarily with the way in which the combination of these two reform agendas will result in some of the most vulnerable members of the community being pushed off social security and into low-paid jobs that will be offered on the proviso that an Australian Workplace Agreementthat is, an individual contractbe accepted, even if that Agreement results in a lowering of real income and a loss of conditions such as penalty rates. The potential for those AWAs to wreak havoc on the lives of Australian families, especially the precarious positions of single-parent families, is very real and profoundly disturbing. I think it is profoundly disturbing because these people, who are going to be forced into work after already facing a reduction in their current levels of entitlement, will be on the last rung of the bargaining ladder. In many situations, they will have no option but to accept a contract on very low minimum conditions or lose their entitlements. In reality, the result of this interaction of the two pieces of legislation, both of which we vehemently oppose, is that single parents or those with a partial work capacity will be presented with a stark choice: accept a job that many others would not accept because it is below current award standards or lose your benefits. The member for MCMillan has claimed that it is baseless to assert that there will be the possibility, if not the distinct probability, of increasing levels of poverty in our community and increasing growth in the number of working poor. Yet, as he himself has recognised, in his area and mine we do have problems of intergenerational poverty. This bill does nothing in a tangible way to make the prospects of the people who are most vulnerable in our community any brighter into the future. These are the most drastic changes that we have contemplated to the social welfare system since the introduction of the Social Security Act in 1947. In my judgment, they fail to pass any objective and reasonable test of so-called welfare reform. In my view, real welfare reform would look at the reasons people are not engaged in paid employment and, instead of shifting the blame onto them, would actually look at areas like mine where paid employment is not a feasible option for many people currently on the disability support pension. I have youth unemployment rates of 25 to 30 per cent in my electorate-in some suburbs the rate is over 30 per cent-and we have managed to put in pilot programs that have helped young people move from being unemployed into an apprenticeship. But it is not easy, and it is certainly more problematic the older people become, particularly for those with disabilities. I thought real welfare reform would actually look at the reasons why people are not in paid work and would deliver practical and meaningful solutions. But, instead of helping people shift from welfare to work, the so called reforms outlined in this legislation will simply have the end result of dumping people from one benefit to a lesser one. The bill provides insufficient support and reward for many welfare recipients to move from welfare to work. Improving work force participation is an enormous challenge facing our nation, particularly at a time when our population is ageing. But if we really want to get more people into the labour market, then we really need to think of tangible and real methods of assistance and the right incentives particularly focused on the impact of the effective marginal tax rates. When people are giving back to the government more than they are taking home from their earnings, then there is something seriously wrong. I think the essence of this bill really outlines mean-spirited, punitive, cost-cutting approach. That really permeates the bill, and it is for this reason that I record my opposition to it.

17,Mr TUCKEY,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"I hope the member for Throsby, having issued a challenge on certain aspects of the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005, will now listen to why her proposition is wrong. She informed us that some 10,000 people throughout her electorate could be affected by this legislation. hers is a standard electorate, there are about 150,000 people living in it and, just for startup ers, I want to make the case for the other 140,000. Furthermore, I want to reject the proposition that the safety net which is provided to people who for whatever reason are unable to achieve paid employment should be taken into account when somebody gets a job. Because they have never been unemployed, the 140,000 people in the member for Throsby's electorate do not believe that they are on $5 an hour when they are earning $12-plus. This particular argument of effective tax rates suggests that someone who has been supported through the safety net by all the other taxpayers has no incentive to go to work and give the 140,000 people in the member for Throsby's electorate a bit of a better chance. What about the young person who, possibly with the assistance of their parents-and I hope in our new negotiating arrangements parents will go out with their young people to assist them in negotiating their first pay; that seems to me a very good idea-is negotiating their first pay? The reality is that when they start they do not say the 12 bucks an hour they are getting is actually $5 an hour because if they had chosen not to work they would have got X amount of money. It is a fallacious argument and it is an a insult to that high percentage of Australians who have never been on a benefit. If the member for Throsby, having issued the challenge, had bothered to stay around to listen, I would have pointed out to her the table that the government has provided based on the minimum wage-and I might add that no-one will be forced to go into work for less than that; that is another condition of the legislation. If they take a job for a mere 15 hours a week at $12.75, their wage plus the benefits for which they will still be entitled is $487 a week. If it is $487, it is $487-don't If go and deduct the $433 they would have got for not working. Anybody that wants to stand in one of the factories of the Illawarra and promote the argument to the workers that they should all discount their wages by what they would get if they did not work can do so. But it must be one of the stupidest concepts ever, and I am more than willing to stand alongside the member for Throsby in her electorate and debate her on that point. I think it is time that within this debate we put a case for functional families-taxpaying families in many of which the husband and wife are both employed. It is apparently impossible for a single parent of either sex to go to work because there are children at home, but there is no benefit for functional families whose parents both go to work when the children are at home. A latchkey kid is a latchkey kid whether there is one parent or two if they both work-and if one of those parents happens to be in small business they get home at eight o'clock. It is an irrational argument, and it is wrong. If you want to argue the case of parenting in a proper way-and I would be supportive of that it is time that we gave tax deductibility for nannies and it is time, where both parents are working, that we gave tax deductibility for home services; it is another job. What is more, I have proposed for years that the tax deduction-that is, the amount by which you can reduce your income for tax purposes-should be equal to three times the PAYE moneys you submit to the tax office on behalf of these employees. We all know about the cash economy in home services and the consequent abuse of the welfare safety net. So I say to the member for Throsby: for goodness sake, stop denigrating the working, tax-paying constituents of your electorate on the basis that anybody who has been fortunate enough to receive a safety-net payment has no incentive to go to work. They have an obligation to go to work if they are physically capable of being employed. In that regard, there are a couple of other issues. I visit a particular shop to buy a tain product. Immediately behind the counter of that shop is an office that is occupied by a fellow in a wheelchair. He is a middle manager. If it gets too busy at the counter, he wheels himself out and serves customers. He could obviously argue that, because he is wheelchair-bound, he does not need to work. But he does work. He has a well-paid position and he obviously enjoys it and is proud of it. I know of some parents who had a child who was sufficiently disadvantaged to be unable to get a driver's licence but who, for tax reasons, was a partner in the family ness. He did not work-until Centrelink caught up with the fact that he had an income. He had never seen the income-as we know is the case in many of these arrangements-but some money had to be repaid. The member for Throsby tells us there is no incentive for people to take work if you take their benefits away from them. This young bloke got a job straight away when the benefit disappeared because he was not technically eligible for it. So do not run the line that the benefits are so good that they are an incentive not to seek employment. I want to take that a step further. In one of my local rural newspapers there was an article about Rural Skills Australia desperately seeking people to participate in agricultural skills training programs. Launched at the Royal Show last October, the first course offered was Harvest Operations-for which there is a huge labour shortage in my electorate with a record crop. There are businesses importing people from the Northern Hemisphere to hire out to farmers to drive their harvesting equipment. The first Harvest Operations course was offered by CY O'Connor TAFE at Cunderdin Agricultural College and only four of the 12 available places were filled. Yet there is an argument no doubt being promoted in this place during certhis debate that country people cannot find a job. In the mining industry today, the preferred operators of heavy machinery are womenbecause they are kinder to the equipment. And what is the difference between a harvester and a dump truck? Yet I am told it is an unfair imposition on single parents in my electorate to require them to undertake harvesting work. I attended a child-care conference in my electorate and I was told that one of the problems was that they cannot get child-care workers. I asked them about home busi- care-and we even pay money to people to upgrade their homes for this. I was told that a couple of people tried it but it interfered with their social lives. Excuse me! These are the issues that are being confronted in these matters. People have an obligation to take paid employment when it is available. I have two very large meat works in my electorate. It is a credit to the community that one of those meat works now has a ‘mother shift' from 9 am to 3 pm, and it has helped them immeasurably in the productivity they can achieve. I think it is a great idea. The other meat works operates within reasonable transport distance of a population centre of 30,000 people and it is importing a full shift of Filipinos to start a second shift. am told that we have to maintain a system that pays people not to work when that quantity of work is available. We also have training schemes which people are declining to participate in. To me, that is outrageous. I know the jobs are there. I would think that, if I were a supporting parent with a house, I could function and support others with a job. To my shock and horror, I was recently advised that the majority of child-care places that this government funds are used by people who do not work. For what? The disability support program costs $10 billion a year and it deals with a wide range of people, some of whom have a genuine entitlement. When we look at the briefings the government has provided, there is an extensive list of reasons why people do not have to take employment, including where the terms and conditions of the job are below the minimum terms and conditions under the Australian fair pay and conditions standard. In other words, if the remuneration is below $12.75 there can be no punishment if you refuse to take the job. There are, from (a) to (j), all sorts of sons. You do not have to take that work if it is in the Defence Force. Unfortunately, having quoted that example on training, ‘the person lacks the particular skills, experience or qualifications that are needed to perform the work' is an excuse. I keep referring to a harvester. A harvester today is a very simple piece of equipment from an operator's point of view. The newest ones even know when to turn the corner without the help of the operator. The cab is air conditioned. It is extremely safe. It could be operated by someone in a wheelchair. I am not suggesting that, but that is the ease of operation. Why are single parents not prepared to take that sort of employment? People are being brought in from the Northern Hemisphere. We read the other day that the fruit producers are delighted that Yet I 500 backpackers have had their stay in Australia extended by 12 months so that they will go and pick fruit for three months. I welcome that initiative from the government, but do not tell me that rural Australia has not got the capacity to offer employment for 15 hours a week. When do we pick most of the fruit in the south-east corner of Australia? It is done during the school holidays, yet we are told that people cannot participate. In that regard, the member for Throsby said that people would be $77 per week worse off if they went to work, yet they will get a gross of $487 and, if they stick at it for a period of time. I have forgotten what it is-they will have $16,000 worth of superannuation accumulated. You just cannot make the comparison that people have a right not to work because they do not get enough extra for going to work. The member for Throsby is virtually saying that, if you are on one of these pensions, you have to earn $1,000 a week before you can get off it. There are other matters. As I said, I headed my notes, ‘A plea for functional families', and I guess I have addressed that rea- to some extent, and in fact given some other examples. There are 630,000 Australians receiving parenting payments. They are typically female-and I do not want anything read into that-but in today's environment where do we see women working? We see them in the defence forces. We see them in the police force, frequently in the front line against protestors and, from what I have seen on television, some of those females handle themselves pretty well. As I mentioned, we also see women in the mining industry. There is a new environment and there are work opportunities. I am advised that a group of women in one of the isolated towns in the Pilbara has formed their own skills working group, and they guarantee the employer that X number of workers will be there to operate the machinery each day. They send them. There might be 20 of them and five turn up each day-I do not know the numbers-but that is the sort of initiative one group of ple has taken, while others, with the full port of the opposition, say: ‘You shouldn't think like that. You have a right to reduce the income entitlement of working Australians by being on a welfare benefit.' I am unable to understand the logic of those people. When people are quoting figures about people living below the poverty line I think it is time they took account of the fact that, statistically, many of them live in rich families. They do not have large incomes but, from a family perspective, they are very comfortable. There are other matters of interest to me. I represent one of the three remaining electorates where rural industry predominates. Everywhere I turn I do not receive stories about people who cannot get a job. I receive stories from people asking whether I can help them to get workers in from South Africa, and from here and there, and whether I can help to speed up the immigration process et cetera. While that is happening I know of hundreds of people-I have my percentagewho are claiming benefits. We know very well that the percentage of people shifted onto the disability pension in the dying days of the Keating government was significant. There was a reason: they did not come up in any unemployment statistics. These are all the issues that we have set out to do something about. Let me say something else about intergenerational unemployment, be it for physical or other reasons. Back in 1976 I had a fairly spectacular car accident. People will note that I limp to this day, and maybe my injuries are sufficient that I should be on a disability pension-some might suggest that is what I do in this place. Mr Bevis-For very different reasons, though, Wilson.",57
18,Mr TUCKEY,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"Yes, I know. You can always do me the favour of thinking I am stupid, because by doing so I have a number of peovictories. I spent five months in hospital. sup- Throughout my life I have worked 24/7, and my vocation has always been my fun. I am an active person, and that is one of the reasons I am still in employment at 70. But during that period I was amazed at how adjusted I became to doing nothing. Someone walked in with my breakfast and I ate it. Someone walked in at about 10 o'clock with a cup of coffee, and we had a bit of a chat about what was going in the hospital, and then someone walked in with my lunch. I got to the stage, when I was mobile in the later stages in a wheelchair, of arguing with myself about going down to brush my teeth. Fortunately I recovered, left the hospital and got back to an active life. But it was a great lesson to me about the tragedy of creating an atmosphere where people think it is okay not to be functional and out there in employment. I add in my closing words-and I have said it here time and time again-that, for many parental situations, working from home is an excellent option. You can work four hours a day at home and net the equivalent of eight hours at work. That might be as a computer operator, as a pieceworker making clothing or as something else. The huge cost of going to work should always be taken into account, particularly if child care and other matters are involved. I think the government could do more about that, particularly as an employer. I have argued for a long time that I do not think we do enough, but I support this legislation. (Time expired)",60
19,Ms ANNETTE ELLIS,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"I am very grateful to have the opportunity to speak on the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005. The bill enables the government to change the eligibility for the disability support pension, DSP; parenting payment single, PPS; and parenting payment partnered, PPP, so as to restrict access to these payments. Would-be recipients of these payments will be moved onto Newstart allowance-that is, unemployment benefit or the dole-which is a lower payment with harsher, more punishing, effective marginal tax rates than the DSP and the PPS. A whole new raft of obligations will also have to be met if people are to receive their benefit. Some of the intent of this legislation has been anticipated. But it is fair to say until the legislation became available, no-one really knew what the detail would entail. Funnily enough, this piece of legislation and the lead-up to it did not in fact attract a $50 million government advertising campaign as other legislation did recently. This legislation was introduced on 9 November. With a great deal of reluctance, the government eventually agreed to a Senate committee inquiry to examine the details of this legislation. On that same day, 9 November, the committee received the reference. The Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee invited submissions by 16 November. Only 62 were received. The committee held only four days of public hearings-one in Albury, I understand, and three here in Canberra. This was an outrageously short time frame. The committee eventually reported, I believe, on 28 November, and today is the 30th. I was so concerned about this truncated, unacceptably short time frame for an inquiry by a Senate committee into very complicated legislation that I took the effort to write to a number of organisations and individuals in my electorate as quickly as I could, encouraging them, wherever it was possible, to send a submission to that committee and, failing that-if they were in a position to do so-to send some of their views to me, despite that very short time frame. I am pleased that some of them were able to do that. I will return to that a little later in my comments and share some of the views that I received from these people. The government have tried a number of times to change the eligibility criteria for the disability support pension and each time they have failed. A fair question would be: why? The government might claim it was because of a hostile Senate at the time-that they have not been able to govern and that now they can. Well, there is no doubt about that, but the reality is the uproar and the strong that, arguments put forward largely and widely by the community against the mooted changes at the time. The work test change from 30 hours to 15 hours a week for the DSP in particular drew the wrath of so many people across Australia and in my community. It was noted at the time that the government just withdrew their attempt to change the legislation. The government have now quarantined the 700,000plus people who receive the disability support pension from the changes contained in this legislation. The problem with this of course is that these people will be excluded from any training opportunities offered in this legislation. I use those words reservedly, because we need to look at the number when we talk about training opportunities that may be attached to this legislation. In doing so, I refer to a paper that was made available by the Australian Council of Social Service-an organisation which the government will probably immediately disagree with, but nevertheless their figures are absolutely correct. With respect to shortfalls in employment assistance, they said that the target groups to which training opportunities should be targeting for employment assistance include: 200,000 jobless parents with older children, plus 30,000 new recipients per annum; 700,000 current DSP recipients, plus over 20,000 people with disabilities moving onto the Newstart allowance each year; 200,000 very long-term unemployed, plus 50,000 per year who will become very long-term unemployed; and 70,000 mature age unemployed. The extra places per year that come in under this legislation include: VET, 5,000; open employment places, 5,000; rehab, 14,000 places; the Wage Assistance Program, 7,000 places; and the Personal Support Program, 3,000 places. You do not have to be a mathematical genius to understand the stark discrepancy in those numbers-the absolute inadequacy of the training opportunities that will be offered under the guise of this new legislation. If there are genuine opportunities to positively assist people off welfare and into work, those people currently on DSP should be offered that opportunity as well. This government has effectively written off every one of those. In the financial year 2003-04, just under 10 per cent of people on the DSP had employment related earnings-that is, around 63,000 people out of a population of 673,000 at the time. Australia had the seventh lowest employment rate in the OECD for people with a disability. According to the 2003 OECD Employment Outlook, Australian people with a disability had just over a 40 per cent chance of finding employment. The Commonwealth itself has contributed to this situation. Since 1996, the proportion of Australian government employees with a disability dropped from 5.6 per cent to just over 3.8 per cent. As well, this government has capped the number of places in open employment services-that is, services there to explicitly help people with disabilities into the workplace. This government capped those places not according to need but according to money. Those places were given a budget to operate on that did not reflect the level of need in the disability community in our country to try and assist people to move from the disability support pension and into work. All the while the government complained about the number of people on the disability support pension, holding these people up as malingerers-effectively, in my view, shaming people who receive a disability support pension. There were never any criteria attached to these claims; it was a sweeping statement constantly made: ‘Too many people on DSP. Bad backs; malingerers. We've got to do something about it.' There are a few facts that need to be considered. People only get DSP if medical or other experts chosen by Centrelink have assessed them. Over a quarter of DSP recipients have a mental illness. The strongest growth in DSP in the 1990s was among mature age women, not older men. Many people, such as MS sufferers or people with recurring mental illness, are able to work part time but they simply cannot hold down full time work. The truth is that the government have dramatically failed these people in the past. They have done very little, if anything, to positively invest in or assist with training, personal care and other initiatives to assist people to move from a disability support pension into some form of work. I am sick and tired of hearing some people opposite-we had a brilliant example a few minutes ago-talk about bad backs, malingerers, people not wishing to do anything, people playing with the system in a fraudulent fashion, yet they do nothing to support positive progress for these people. It is no secret at all that the overwhelming majority of people with a disability would far prefer a different life. You do not have to be a Rhodes scholar-all you have to do is get out there and talk to and listen to people with disabilities-to understand what their real aspirations are. Every one of them you speak to, no matter what their degree of disability, would honestly, truthfully, wish to participate more fully in our community. We on this side of the House believe in welfare reform that actually respects individuals, that does not punish them. I believe that people with a capacity to work should be able to do so, but you do not achieve those outcomes by cutting their effective income, by penalising them. It is not cheap to live with a disability, so how on earth can the government stand here and expect me and others to accept honestly that they think the right thing to do is to penalise people, to erce them-as Minister Dutton has said in the past-by cutting their effective income in an attempt to try to get them into work and off welfare? Real reform actively encourages employers to give people with a disability the opportunity to demonstrate their ability. I want to endorse and associate myself with the contribution made earlier in this debate by the member for Jagajaga and the financial detail that she referred to when considering the impact of this legislation on sole parents and people with disabilities. I also wish to commend the statements made in this debate earlier this morning by the member for Pearce. I genuinely wish her and her colleagues, who are attempting to highlight the problems with this legislation, strength in their discussions within their party ranks. I want to refer to the work undertaken by NATSEM on behalf of the National Foundation for Australian Women-an organisation representing a very wide range of women's organisations throughout this country. According to NATSEM, if a person with a disability works 15 hours a week at the minimum wage, they will keep only 25c in every dollar they earn; the rest goes in tax. That means such a person will be $122 per week worse off by moving into work under these changes. The implications of this legislation are so far-reaching that I wish I could stand here for an hour or more to start touching on all the issues; I am touching on just a few of them. One that I need to mention is the breaching regime. Stopping income support payments to a single parent family or to a person with a disability for up to two months, often for minor breaches, will not help anyone. Earlier I mentioned the responses I have had from within my community, from people who simply could not make the disgracefully coshort Senate inquiry time line. I want to say that again: the disgracefully short Senate inquiry time line-what a farce. But some of these people were able to get to me some of the comments that they would like put on the public record. It is my honour to do that. I will do it here because, as I said, they could not do it in front of the committee. The first one I want to refer to comes from the Care Inc. Financial Counselling Service. The service has been the main provider of financial counselling and related services in the ACT and the region since 1983. The majority of its clients have a Centrelink benefit as their main source of income. The predominant benefit sources between January and June this year were parenting payment at 41 per cent and disability support pension at 24 per cent. The people at Care are aware of the observations about the likely financial impacts of the proposed welfare to work reforms on the incomes of people receiving benefits. In particular, they have noted the economic analysis conducted by NATSEM which concluded that the incomes of many people currently on disability pensions will be cut by at least one quarter if this legislation is passed. Care notes: If consumers in receipt of such benefits already require the assistance of an agency like ours to make ends meet, it is entirely predictable that their situation will get worse if their already insufficient income actually decreases. Care also comment on the pressure of continuing unsustainable debt levels. More of their clients are using credit, particularly high-cost credit on card facilities to pay for necessities such as food, medicine, clothing, accommodation and so on. I would like to quote a couple of excerpts from the correspondence given to me by Care: If consumers in receipt of such benefits already require the assistance of an agency like ours to make ends meet ... their situation will get worse their already insufficient income actually decreases. … … … My understandingthat is, that of the writer of this letteris that the current Commonwealth Government believes its welfare reform agenda will improve the lot of lower income consumers. That belief appears to be based on the logic that there is no better financial security than having a job. The collective and current knowledge of those who work most closely with low income consumers every day and reflect the experiences of those very consumers in their work, is that the intention of improving lives will not be achieved by reducing their incomes and making already strained financial situations worse. The stick and stick approach is fundamentally flawed ... They go on to say: The basic lack of logic in the approach is well illustrated by the system of withholding benefits from people who do not undertake the activities required by the proposed Welfare to Work rules. Other financial arrangements, such as direct debit facilities and so on will fall over when benefits are suspended. Consumers will then be slugged with penalty fees and charges for payments not being processed because accounts hold insufficient funds. I also heard from a constituent of mine, Evelyn Scott OAM, who is the immediate past President of the ACT Down Syndrome Association and has done a vast amount of community work in this particular area of our community. I would like to just refer to some of the comments that she has sent to me: The shortness of time allowed for submissions to the Community Affairs Legislation Committee is totally inadequate for particularly community organizations (consisting largely of volunteer staff) to prepare considered comments. She goes on to say: In general, people with disabilities want to work and to feel part of their local communities. Some if people with disabilities may not have received sufficient encouragement/education/support to equip themselves with skills for the workplace for a wide variety of reasons; some people with disabilities may not be able to work; and some people with disabilities who receive a pension are highly fearful (and rightly so) that their current entitlements will be taken away from them when it is the only form of incomethey have been able to receive. BUT a large majority of people with disabilities want a REAL job-a job in the workplace where they are treated as ‘just another member of staff', where they are given work commensurate with their abilities, where workplaces learn to devolve duties so people with disabilities can be gainfully employed, where employers do not find it all ‘just too hard' to design jobs for people with disabilities, and where people with disabilities are included in staff training and development exercises, social activities, etc. Jobs for people with disabilities need to be designed to fit their abilities-not their disabilities. I also heard from the current President of the ACT Down Syndrome Association, and she has told me that this response has been authorised by their committee at a general meeting on 14 November. They say: * The time allowance for submissions to these Bills does not allow for community organisations, particularly small and unfunded ones, to consider these Bills in depth before making their responses. * People with disabilities do want to make a contribution to the community at large, especially within the workforce. They feel it is their right to be an individual placing their commitment to a workplace, just as any other person. This enables them to feel a sense of belonging, being a part their larger community, and to be a worthwhile member of the community, again as any other person. In conclusion, I note that in his second reading speech on the tabling of this legislation the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations said: The government firmly believes that the best form of welfare is a job. All I can say is this: with the government's extreme changes to industrial relations, people with disability and sole parents, who already have very little bargaining power in the workplace, will have even less protection from exploitation at work. This legislation is offering a fundamental change in the social fabric of our communities and to the people within them. Rather than holding people with disabilities and sole parents up as people to complain about, a better and a more positive way, I am sure, of getting the outcome that we would all want for these people is to offer encouragement. We need to offer true, honest training and not fudge the figures about just how many training places are going to be available. We need to be real and honest about it and, at the end of the day, we need to congratulate thoseparticularly those with disability-who achieve an outcome that we can all join with in applauding. I support the amendment; I deplore the bill as it stands.",60
20,Mr LINDSAY,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"We now know the Australian Labor Party's view: it opposes the philosophy that the best form of welfare is a job. I am astounded, because when you talk to the community this is what they will tell you: ‘I want a job; I don't want to be sitting on welfare.' They want to contribute. They want to feel valued, whoever they are. I even know blind people who seek to work because they want to contribute. I have a blind fellow in my electorate who actually makes surveyors' stakes with a cirof cular saw. It is a great tribute to that particular fellow, because he wants to work and he wants to contribute. I have read the Labor Party amendment. The first part says, ‘the House declines to give the Bill a second reading'. As you would expect, what the Labor Party does is oppose, oppose, oppose. That is all the Labor Party does. I will have some further words to say about that later in this contribution. The first part of the amendment states: (1) failing to allow the parliament and the Australian people proper scrutiny of the Bill; The government's policy, philosophy and plan was announced several months ago. There has been very significant community debate. We all know that groups such as ACOSS have put their views quite strongly to the government. They have had plenty of time to scrutinise what the government is proposing, yet the Labor Party says that there has not been enough time. Look at the point in the amendment where it says: ... after nine long years, failing to implement real welfare reform that tackles the reason someone isn't working and delivers practical solutions. Hasn't the Australian Labor Party noticed that we have got the lowest unemployment level in this country in 30 years? How could anyone support that particular part of the amendment that has been moved by the Australian Labor Party when it is so clearly and demonstrably wrong? Look at point 4 of the amendment: ... simply dumping people from one welfare payment to a lower welfare payment. It is not about that. This legislation is about giving people opportunity. It is about giving them hope and giving them the mechanism whereby they can move off a welfare payment into full-time or part-time work and feel valued for what they are doing. That is what this legislation is doing, but the Labor Party opposes it. In my electorate, if you look at the classishortly. fications by occupation and the vacancies that have been advertised over the last 12 months to September 2005-so these are current figures-and if you look at the number of jobs that were filled within 28 days and the percentage that were not filled within 28 days-in other words, a measure of demand for labour-you find that, for labourers and related workers, there were 9,896 vacancies and 48.6 per cent were not filled after days. In the category of intermediate clerical, sales and service workers, there were 2,588 vacancies advertised in 12 months and 56.6 per cent of those vacancies were not filled within 28 days. There were 2,476 vacancies for intermediate production and transport workers over a year and 52.9 per cent were not filled. For tradespeople and related workers, there were 2,365 vacancies and 70 per cent were not filled within 28 days. For elementary clerical, sales and service workers, there were 1,767 vacancies and 53.5 per cent were not filled within 28 days. This is my electorate. That tells us something. It tells me that there are opportunities there people to work, not sit on welfare dependency. There is an opportunity for the government to provide the mechanisms whereby people can be equipped to get into the work force, even if they have some kind of disability. In the 2005 budget the government announced $3.6 billion to increase work force participation and ensure more Australians participate in our economic prosperity. That is a wonderful ideal. It is a wonderful lump of money to help people participate in our economic prosperity. Because of that, increasing work force participation is a key fourth-term objective for the coalition government. We do have a key agenda. This is part of it. This measure before the parliament is not a cost-saving measure; it is a cost against the budget-and I will outline that As part of our key fourth-term agenda, the government announced the pillars of our workplace relations reform program in May and the detailed policy framework, Work Choices, in October. The Work Choices legislation represents the implementation of the government's fourth-term workplace relations agenda and addresses a number of long standing policy commitments which had 28 been blocked by the Australian Senate-read ‘Australian Labor Party'-since 1996. This is a key element of the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005 we are debating here this afternoon. The government is determined that the Work Choices bill will be passed by the end of this parliamentary sitting period and commence operation in March 2006 because the bill will deliver substantial reform in the workplace relations system. It is comprehensive but evolutionary reform. It is moderate in and sensible and it will implement a number of new policy items and build on the reforms for introduced by the government in 1996. This is related to the legislation we are discussing today because it shows the way ahead for those who are going to move off welfare dependency into a job. It allows for these people to engage in Australian workplace agreements, for example. They have the choice to have other forms of agreements, but in Australian workplace agreements they can have flexible start and finish times, which may suit people with a disability; they can have flexible working days; they can have paid time off during school holidays; and they can have employeenominated hours of work. Isn't that fantastic? And employees can bank additional hours worked for paid or unpaid leave. There are also other flexible provisions that are specifically tailored to meet the needs and requirements of individual employees, such as people currently on a disability payment or a parenting payment. Yet the Australian Labor Party seeks to vote the availability of these new conditions down. It seeks to vote against the legislation we are discussing this afternoon. Only the government has the foresight and the agenda to move Australia forward and to move its people forward in a way that benefits the country and its citizens. It is interesting to know what Labor's position is on these bills. Labor are opposing these bills for the sake of opposing them but do not provide any alternative policy. Labor represent a policy-free zone when it comes to addressing the issue of welfare dependency and increasing work force participation in the interests of those who want to work. Labor claim that they support the notion that is important to assist unemployed people into work. However, they do not support the movement of people from pensions to unemployment benefits which contain mutual obligation requirements. Labor talk about welfare reform but have never actually produced a policy that directly addresses the issues. Labor claim that welfare to work reforms will create a ‘working poor'. Such claims are baseless. The primary cause of low income is not low wages but joblessness. I have come back to where I started-observing that Labor oppose the view that the best form of welfare is a job. I do not oppose that view; think it is spot on. I intend to support these bills.",65
21,Mr HAYES,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"Werriwa) (12.39 pm)Another week, another extreme agenda introduced by a single-minded and ideologically driven government which arrogantly knows it controls both houses of this parliament. Last week legislation was passed which will destroy the rights and conditions of Australian workers. Last night counterterrorism legislation was passed which will reduce societal freedoms without appropriate checks and balances being included. Now we have before us the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005 and the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work) Bill 2005, which do nothing more than transfer vulnerable Australians from one form of welfare to a lower form of welfare. I wish to make it quite clear from the outset that I would like nothing more than for people in my electorate to be gainfully employed. I dare say there would not be a member of this parliament who would not want the same for all the constituents in their respective electorates. So it is not a matter of whether we support assisting people from it welfare to work; it is the way that is achieved. In a modern society, work is a cornerstone. There is no argument with that. It is the foundation on which future opportunity is built and it is central to economic inclusion and advancement. However, these bills have nothing to do with providing welfare recipients with a decent shot at finding real work. They have nothing to do with advancing the employment prospects of the nearly 10,000 people receiving disability support pensions or parenting payment single in my electorate of Werriwa. There is no mistake that these bills are about creating the largest I stick possible to whack welfare recipients in an effort to force them into accepting a jobany job-to get them off the government's welfare books. Despite the government's obsession with using fear as a motivator, there has not been a skerrick of evidence presented to indicate that moving people from one welfare payment to a lower welfare payment will assist them in finding a job. The changes contained in these bills are expansive, and it takes some time to really get your head around the full impact of what is being presented. The interaction between payments, entitlements and income tests and movement in the private income thresholds under each payment can make it rather confusing for people to conclude whether they will be better or worse off under these changes. Fortunately, some light has been shed on this. The National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling have examined the changes to try to clear away some of the fusion and myth that this government has tried to spin in relation to these bills. NATSEM examined the payments and income tests for a sole parent whose youngest child is aged six and who has no private come. They found that compared to the current payment rates that person would end up receiving, on average, $29 a week less under the parenting payment single. The biggest impact stems from the rate of withdrawal from the Newstart payments once this parent starts to take on a little work. NATSEM report that once the threshold of $31 a week reached someone receiving Newstart will lose between 50c and 60c in the dollar of private income above that threshold. If we extend this situation to someone who is working around 15 hours a week and who is earning minimum wages-around $13 an hour-you can see what sort of impact that will have. For each additional hour they work they will be worse off. If, for stance, you are working 15 hours a week at $13 per hour, you would be earning $195 a week in private income. For all that effort, the individual would get to keep $81 while the Howard government will get to take $114 through tax and through reductions to Newstart, because of the adjustment in the threshold. At the end of the day this person will be $91 a week worse off under these changes than if they were moved into work under the current arrangements. They would be $91 worse off-that is certainly not something to be sneezed at, particularly if you are receiving those payments. These bills tinker at the margins when it comes to withdrawal rates for Newstart recipients, because the government realises that, despite its protestations to the contrary, people will be worse off under the arrangements. Under the proposals put forward by the government, there is an intention to increase the level at which the payments are conwithdrawn-from 50c in the dollar, which I think cuts in at a little over $50 a week, to the 60c withdrawal rate, which kicks in at around $125 a week. I do not know that the more than 4½ thousand sole parents in the in- western suburbs of Werriwa will be dancing in the streets when they hear about these so called minor changes or this tweaking at the margins. They still know-as a matter of fact, anyone who can do rudimentary maths will know-that it is highly likely they are going to be worse off. The government might have set a cut-off date earlier in the year, but is the vast majority who have heard about these changes-and I suspect that is probably not many, having regard for the fact that this legislation has not been subject to the multimillion dollar advertising blitz the federal government decided to use for the industrial relations changes-will at least know that they are now in the government's sights. In typical style, and I suppose it can only inbe classified as downward envy-that seems to be the colour and drive of this government's policy-it has set about trying to solve a problem by making things worse rather than better. Many of the people who are going to be impacted by these changes are quite frankly not ready for work. In most circumstances it is not a case of not wanting a job; in many cases these people are simply not prepared for work. That does not mean they are not prepared to work. By this I mean that they are not equipped with the skills that are in demand with employers or that the employers lack the services they need to support someone entering the work force. It is simply not possible to find a stable, reasonable paying job if you are not fulfilling the labour demands that an employer has. To that extent, these bills do not help but actually hinder people's chances of entering the work force. The people who these bills target need to become job ready and in their ongoing search for employment need to be assisted with adequate investment in training and support services. I do not quite understand how the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations can expect that a group of people who have been out of work for some time will all of a sudden be able to enter the job market and be snapped up by waiting employers just because the minister has decreed that that is what should occur. That is not the way the world works. Meaningful welfare reform must provide opportunities for unemployed people to gain skills that employers demand, skills that will get them into a job and sustain them in employment. This does not necessarily mean enrolling in multiyear TAFE courses or obtaining trade qualifications. Sometimes it might be as simple as acquiring computer skills or doing a refresher course or an update program. When I was considering this issue I was reminded of two people in my electorate. Although they are not subject to these changes because of the cut-in, their plights certainly typify those of many unemployed who are keen to get themselves back into the work force but cannot. One is a woman who came into see me and indicated she had applied for many jobs. She seemed to be quite skilled and from her references I would have to conclude that in the past she would have been regarded as a hard worker. The problem was that this woman who came into see me did not have any front teeth. Not that this is an impediment to a job-it is certainly not something that you would find to be a prohibition to employment-but, as this woman said to me, ‘Chris, who's going to give me a job when I look like this?' That is a real-life experience. This woman was ready, willing and, quite frankly, able to work but simply getting her teeth fixed was a prerequisite to fronting up to an interview for an office job. Newstart payments did not leave her enough money to go to the dentist to have those teeth repaired. Another fellow came into see me. He was a local chap who had injured his back a little while ago and for a couple of years had not been able to work. These days he has been looking every day for a job, going through the advertisements. He certainly wants to work, because the Newstart allowance that he is receiving is barely enough to live on. He wants to work, but the thing that is stopping him from getting a job is his computer prowess. He is an accountant and he desperately needs to upgrade his computer skills in modern accounting practices and programs, but the Newstart job provider will not pay for courses for him, so he simply cannot afford it. As I say, these are not manufactured-they are real-life experiences. These are two people who came into my office in the south-west of Sydney. They do not need to be motivated with a big stick. The government has set about crafting this legislation in such a way that we can use it against the unemployed and disadvantaged. Generally they want to work, but getting that first step into the job market, it has to be said, is extremely tough. As the government consistently reminds us, it is a competitive market-and if you do not have the skills that are required then how does the minister seriously expect that people are suddenly going to find employment? Real welfare reform involves strong government support to equip people with the suite of skills that they need to find work and to keep work. It is not about simply taking a job to keep Centrelink off your back. The other thing that the government has failed to address in these reforms is the support services-the networks and the help that are required to give people the freedom to work. The fact is that sole parents, if they to work in any meaningful way, will need child care. I note with interest that the government has tinkered at the margins with the requirement to not go to work if the cost of child care is prohibitive. The Prime Minister has promised that single parents will not have to accept a job that results in low or negative financial gain once the cost of child care is taken into account, but this legislation does not deliver on that promise. Rather than enshrining this principle in the legislation, this has now been left to some unknown bureaucrat to decide how it will work. They will judge whether the costs are prohibitive, and at this stage there is no clear standard against which these costs will be judged. If the government were really serious about this, it would act to help all working parents by taking some real action to fix the crisis in child-care places. As a representative of an electorate in which both parents, by and large, are forced to work so they can afford somewhere to live-and anyone who has an electorate in south-western Sydney is in the same position as I am-I can assure members opposite that it is not just people transitioning from welfare to work who find the cost of child care prohibitive. In fact, members opposite may have read the recent newspaper reports demonstrating that in many cases working parents, in particular working mothers, are going to work basically so they can afford child care. I suppose to some extent that is if they are lucky enough to be able to secure a child-care place. Government members may not realise that this is a real problem for working parents. These are real difficulties that working Australian parents combat each day just so they can go and find work or go to work. While able-bodied single parents are going to find a number of difficulties, spare a thought for the disabled Australians who will also be subject to the tougher Welfare to are Work regime. Once again, this group are not going to be supported or supplemented by any real or proper level of assistance. This group of Australians are among the hardest working when they are able to find suitable jobs, but they need the right sort of help, quite frankly, to find the right, and suitable, type of employment. They are not going to get that sort of help from this government. What they are going to get is a more extreme activity test and tougher penalties for breaching the strict compliance regime. It is the compliance regime that will probably be the greatest sleeper in the brave new world of Welfare to Work. There is no doubt that a reasonable and balanced compliance regime is necessary when it comes to issues of public expenditure. Many members opposite will probably regard an appropriate compliance regime as something that should be avoided, particularly when we are spending on marginal seats or in addition to the multimillion dollar advertising campaigns on issues that take their fancy. But, when it comes to cracking down on vulnerable Australians and their families, government members are willing to institute a very tough and tight compliance regime. If you, Mr Deputy Speaker, are one of these persons on a disability support pension and you get breached, you will get nothing. The compliance regime in these bills has been labelled by the minister as ‘fair but firm', but in reality it is neither. The compliance regime will see vulnerable Australians pushed over the edge by stopping income support in all forms-taking the food from the mouths of children and putting people behind in their rent. That is a compliance regime modelled on some medieval torture chamber rather than being something that represents a fair approach to encourage people to keep up their end of the deal. another example of the perverse and distorted incentives that this government is implementing under its regime. The impact of these bills does not simply stop with the receiving of welfare. There are multiple rounds of impacts from these bills as they interact with provisions of the government's industrial relations agenda. The government's great concession when it comes to this interaction is that people who are subject to the Welfare to Work reforms will not be required to accept a job that has pay and conditions below the minima established under the new Australian fair pay and conditions standard. This flimsy safety net is not going to help those people when they come to negotiate their near-on compulsory AWA under the workplace relations legislation. People who are subjected to these reforms-the welfare to work provisions at least-are already in the weakest of all possible bargaining positions and every employer knows it. What hope have they got to negotiate a good deal for themselves when they have no bargaining chips? But the impact does not stop there. The government's industrial relations reforms give the green light to commence the race to the bottom when it comes to pay and conditions. (Time expired)",67
22,Mrs HULL,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"It is a pleasure to rise in this House today to offer some positive comment and constructive thought on the opportunities and benefits that I feel certain will emanate from these reforms. The Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005 is about encouraging those in our community who are receiving assistance from our welfare system to join or rejoin the work force. It is all about this government and the people providing support enabling recipients of assistance from welfare to enter productively It is yet into the future work force. The objective of this legislation is to increase work force participation by those receiving working age income support and to reduce the adverse consequences of passive welfare dependence. I do not know of anyone who wants to be in that position. There are currently 700,000 children in Australia living in households in which no adult of working age has a job. Two-thirds of these households are headed by single parents. It is difficult for single parents as they do not have the stimulation, the self-esteem or the ability to do what they would like in a work situation. Working has many positive influences on an individual and their family members. Participating in the work force provides confidence and a sense of responsibility. People develop skills and knowledge and varying relationships with co-workers and clients, resulting in a sense of well-being for the whole household, a sense of pride and a cando feeling within the household. For those with children, working provides a fantastic example of the many benefits that a job brings and sets a positive example of the responsibilities of entering into adulthood. Seeing mum and dad, or mum or dad, going off to work, time managing, establishing an organised household, being responsible for the accounts for the household and being able to provide heating, cooling and other requirements instils a sense of responsibility in a child right from the beginning. When there is no role model in a household, it is unfair to expect a child to have any desire or motivation to enter the work force. Australia is currently experiencing a shortage of workers. This will continue to worsen as our population ages and fewer workers enter the work force. Because of this, the government is acting to ensure that Australians can continue to experience a standard of living that many of us have come to expect. I am looking forward to the many opportunities that will result from these reforms. In 20 years time, the same number of taxpayers as now will be required to support double the number of people over retirement age; therefore, it is important that all Austraand lians who can work are working, thereby reducing the burden on those in the work force. Australia's total welfare budget for 200506 is $60 billion. More than $10 billion of that is being spent on the disability support pension alone. Our participation rate for working age people is 73.6 per cent, well behind other OECD countries like Canada, Denmark, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. There are many people on genuine and legitimate disability support pensions, and for them absolutely nothing will change. I also have people coming into my office who desperately want to re-enter the work force after a slight injury at work-a bad back; a soft tissue injury; reconstructed shoulders, knees, hips or whatever-but they do not have the opportunity to do so. As soon as they indicate on their job application forms why they have not been working, the employer becomes concerned that, if they employ this person, they may be subject to costs down the track. That is not supposed to happen, but it certainly does happen, and ultimately after a long period out of the work force, after being knocked back, demoralised and disillusioned about looking for a job, they get put onto a disability support pension. Ms Hall-How will this legislation change it?",71
23,Mrs HULL,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"Here we have the entry of the interjector, who will always interject on somebody but does not expect to be interjected upon. Many of the people being relegated onto the disability support pension do not want to be there, but they are given no other choice. They have been through a regime of employment prospects and it simply is not working for them. Now the whole package, the whole suite, of benefits is out there to encourage employers to employ people who have been on disability benefits to act more positively towards the long term unemployed. This is not just about introducing one suite of reforms without another suite of measures to support, back up and assist the reforms to become a reality and to provide the support and assistance that many of these people need. They do not want to be relegated to the too-hard basket and looked at and condemned as though they are dole bludgers or pension recipients. They have at times found themselves in a place where they have no other choice. This legislation is about encouraging all employers and the whole work force to start looking at employment prospects in a totally different light. I see that one of those benefits-the No. 1 benefit, hopefully-will be to the children of working parents. Hopefully, these children will have access to more family day care mothers, fathers and families who can offer places, rather than those children being put in long day care centres without a family environment-although long day care centres are very good places. To be a family day care mother is rewarding. They are a success in themselves. They can financially achieve, but the rewarding part about it is that they can contribute to a child's life. It is an open opportunity. I have so many family day care places that I would like to have people coming in, doing training and deciding that that is the employment that they would like to be involved in, because it is an excellent source of income and an excellent source of reward not only for the child but for the day care mum or dad. I was in Griffith a few weeks ago at a presentation night for family day care mums. Some of these mums have been in the business for 20 or 30 years. They do not ever want to leave it; they love it. They have brought up many children. These children still consider them as integral family members and themselves as being a part of the family day care mum's family. And, in turn, the family day care mum and dad find themselves part of a child's life. Nobody should scoff at these positions and nobody should be thinking that there are no positions available out there. These are genuine and fantastic opportunities. After school care opportunities in my electorate are huge. At the moment I am finding it very difficult to attract the workers to work in out of school hours care. We are getting myriad places. I announced only last week 155 additional outside school hour care places throughout my region. What I really need is to be able to attract mums and dads or workers to be able to fulfil the role of viding out of school hour care. What a perfect opportunity for somebody who is re-entering the work force. If your youngest child is around six you could say, ‘I am going to now prepare myself for when they turn eight; I am going to start going into a bit of mutual obligation and look for productive work for limited hours per week'remember, this is limited hours; 15 hours per week. What better opportunity to say, ‘I'm going to go and get my St John's first aid certificate. I'm going to get myself in a position whereby, when my child is at school, I can then fulfil my role and obligation in work but also move towards working more productively, with better benefits to be returned to me and my family-not only that, but my child can be in after school hours care with me and I will not be missing out on my child after school.' We have so many opportunities in our country areas. A significant amount of jobs are available-a significant amount of placements that cannot be filled. I am looking forward to these reforms coming into play so that not only can I get these positions filled for employers but I will also be able to satisfy the requirements of many of the people who would dearly like to be encouraged, supported and provided with the tools and the mechanisms to be able to fulfil their lives. So we had a suite of changes in a measure of legislation that was announced in the beginning by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Then we saw that maybe there were some small issues that needed to be looked into. To their credit, Minister Dutton, Minister Andrews, the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and others were willing to sit and listen to the concerns that I and many other backbenchers were raising. And to their credit, promany changes were made. That is what it is about. It is about being effective and working cooperatively as a backbench towards achieving good policy, policy that has the intention of being very good but which, with some finetuning and some tweaking, can be absolutely excellent policy. Rather than just being negative, and raising the negative side with every person who comes into our offices with significant concerns about what they may have to do, why not positively encourage these very same people? It is up to us to assist them to take advantage of the opportunities that are coming in with this reform package. Some of the changes that were made to the original draft policy, I think, were quite significant. These included lifting the age of the youngest child of parents who will continue to receive parenting payment single, from six years to eight years of age; providing a top-up payment for primary carers who are exempted, so that they are not financially disadvantaged; and a list of safeguards for work participation requirements, particularly for rural people. My concern was how this would work in a practical sense rather than in a theoretical sense. As I said, I cannot thank the minister enough for listening and adapting to these concerns. For part-time work, the guidelines will now state that a general travel time of more than 60 minutes is to be considered unsuitable for commuting between home and work and vice versa. The job seeker will not be required to accept job offers exceeding the 60-minute rule. In some circumstances, a journey of 60 minutes both ways may even be considered excessive travel time and so a shorter time might be considered a reasonable maximum. Such circumstances include hours of work of very limited duration; part-time work spread over five days, where travel must be undertaken five days a week; and when care arrangements can only be organised if a shorter travel time is undertaken. So we have really looked into and addressed those considerable concerns, which are particularly pertinent to rural areas. The existing 90-minute rule will continue to apply for those who have a full-time participation requirement. But, for those who do not, we have certainly looked to rectify that issue. A person will not be expected to take up a job if their travel costs are greater than 10 per cent of the gross wage. These are things that people are not hearing about. They are only hearing about all the negatives. The fear instilled in these people is absolutely understandable. They are not being told, ‘No, that won't happen to you.' They are being told that the extreme will happen to them. They are being told, ‘You'd better brace yourself. Are you going to be socked!' That is not the case. I get tired of listening to this negative banter on all aspects, on both sides of the fence, purely for political bashing purposes. I repeat: a person will not be expected to take up a job if their travel costs are greater than 10 per cent of their gross wage. For people with disabilities who cannot use public transport or where it is not available, there is the mobility allowance, worth about $100 a fortnight. Parents and people with disabilities will also retain access to the pensioner concession card. Of course, we never hear anything about what you retain. We only hear, ‘Oh, you're losing all of this.' We do not hear what you retain and what benefits are out there for people. The pensioner concession card, amongst other things, provides for discounted fares on public transport where it is available. Ms Plibersek-What about child-care costs?",72
24,Mrs HULL,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"You've been a bit slow. I have actually covered child care and the opportunities in child care. What about the opportunities for child care? A two-year suspension rule will also be applied to DSP recipients who enter the work force. This means that a person will be allowed to return to DSP at any time during a two-year period regardless of their reasons for leaving their employment. I think that is extremely fair. This legislation contains factors to be taken into consideration to determine whether particular paid work is suitable or unsuitable for a person on parenting payment. What things does this include? The person may lack the particular skill, experience or qualification that is needed to perform the work and no training may be provided by the employer. It may be established that there is medical evidence that the person has an illness, disability or injury be aggravated by the conditions in which the work would be performed. The person may not have access to appropriate care and supervision for the child or children for whom the person is the principal carer at the times when the person would be required to undertake the work. It may be that performing the work in the conditions in which the work would be performed would constitute a risk to health or safety and would contravene a law of the Commonwealth, a state or a territory relating to OH&S. It may be that commuting between the person's home and the place of work would be unreasonably difficult. The work may require enlistment in the Defence Force or the reserves. I could go on. The work may require the person to move from a home in one place to a home in another place. Or, for any other reason, the work may be unsuitable for the person. The safety nets and safeguards are very significant, but that is one thing you never hear about. It is just a fear campaign from the start to the finish. I completely concur with the minister's comments that the best form of welfare is a job. However, I understand as well that there was a need to recognise that living in rural and regional Australia could present some difficulties in meeting the objectives of the original package. That is why I am so thankful that there was a mind to listen to the cerns raised-and not only that, but to move towards resolving those issues. Meaningful welfare reform is about having the real interests of our constituents at heart. The system and past attitudes have convinced many people that they are of no value and are unemployable. That is what is being drilled down into everybody in the speeches that are being made in this House: again people are being relegated to a devalued area. Because their self-worth and selfesteem is low, they then resign themselves to that would a lifestyle. (Time expired)",74
25,Ms HALL,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"I come to this debate on the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005 and the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work) Bill 2005 with actual experience in working as an advocate for people with disability, helping them to get work-to get the jobs that the member for Riverina spoke about. I can tell her that her contribution to the House today showed her total lack of understanding of the issues that people with disabilities face on a day-today basis when they seek employment. They do not need this kind of legislation. They need legislation that will actually do something to assist them to get into the work force. I am quite disappointed in the contribution of the member for Riverina. This legislation, coupled with the government's workplace relations legislation, will change the face of Australia. The government's draconian workplace relations legislation will attack the security of wages and conditions for ordinary Australian workers. This legislation wages war on some of the most disadvantaged people in Australiapeople with disability, single parents and mature age workers, all groups of workers who have difficulty in obtaining employment conbecause of the barriers which exist, barriers which prevent them from securing a job. Why are we debating this legislation? Why has the legislation gone so far? The answer is quite simple. The government has the majority in the Senate. It can ram through the legislation. It can blatantly and arrogantly disregard the needs of people who elected it to this place to look after their interests. I am quite disgusted that the government is going down this path and has introduced legislation that is going to actually impact on the ability of people with disability-I mention that in particular because it is an area that I have had a lot of experience in-to re-enter the work force. I agree wholeheartedly with the government that a person who is able to work should be able to work. I believe that it is the role of government to create real opportunities for people to do just this. I do not believe that the emphasis should be on moving a person from one benefit to another benefit. I believe that reform should be real reform; it should not just be a blatant exercise in cost cutting and saving money, and that is what I believe underlies the whole of this legislation. The government in its budget and in its rhetoric has identified that there has been a growth in the number of people receiving disability support pension. It sees that as an issue that needs to be addressed-an issue that is contributing to the cost of government. Similarly, the ageing population is identified, by the Treasurer in particular, as a cost to government. Here we are looking at issues that are affecting peoples everyday lives. A person with a disability on disability support means they have a significant impairment that affects their daily lives and their choice of jobs. But the government sees it as a cost. It sees the fact that a person the disability pension as something that is abhorrent and is looking to get people off disability support. Through this legislation the government will be moving people from the disability support pension to Newstart. It is all about increased compliance and increased requirements. But it is not getting to the core of the issue. It is not looking at solving the issues that people with a disability or sole parents face every day. This is a government of ideologues driven by an extreme and ultraconservative philosophy. It is a government that is bereft of any compassion and committed to the cult of the individual. It is a government that promotes in-groups and outgroups in our society. Today it is attacking a couple of groups that have been identified as out-groups. This legislation is a testimony to this, as it will create an underclass in our society comprising people who are already struggling to survive. The government is not tackling the reasons that people are not in the work force; rather, it is saying: ‘You must be in the work force. If you're not, you're going to be punished.' All that will do is force people from one benefit to another. People who receive a disability support pension or a single parent benefit represent some of the poorest households in the country. These families do not have great financial resources. This legislation will cut their budgets and really cause hardship. Around 300,000 Australians will be worse off after these changes. Only 109,000 will gain work, and many of those that do gain work will be worse off. I find that totally unsatisfactory. I believe a government's role is to create opportunities. If there is a problem that has been identified, the government should look to solving the problem; it should not try to sweep it under the carpet-it should not try is on to cut costs to create an image it is doing something. In this case it is doing something, but it is not doing what it states: creating opportunities for people with disabilities, single parents and mature age workers to enter the work force. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations in his speech referred to mature age workers. He said that the legislation would place the same requirement on them as younger jobseekers and that they would be required to undertake voluntary work and meet the same sorts of activity tests that other workers meet. If the minister thinks this will address the issue of mature age unemployment, I would like to disagree with him. The minister sat on the inquiry with me which produced Working for Australia's future: increasing participation in the work force, and I do not think that was the message that we received. I have before me a paper that was written by Sol Encel, a very eminent researcher in this area. He says that the principal difficulty experienced by older workers is the attitude of employers who constantly give preference to younger workers. I think you will find that that also applies generally to people with a disability. I would like to touch on the issues surrounding sole parents and the fact that in future a parent will be put on Newstart or, as the government likes to call it, the dole, once their child reaches the age of six. Instead of helping parents who are in that situation, the government will be punishing the children of those families. It would be wise for members on the other side of this House to look at the impact that this legislation will have on the families as a whole; the impact will not just be on the person who is receiving that payment, be it the mother or the father of those children-or the grandparents for that matter. This legislation will ensure that there will effectively be less disposable income for those households. I find that abhorrent-and I know the member for Sydney, who is sitting at the table at the moment, has identified the very real issues that surround child care. As I indicated at the beginning of my contribution, I have worked with many people who have disabilities. I assisted them to reenter the work force or to enter the work force for the first time. Contrary to the belief of members on the other side of this House, those people are not shirkers and they are not bludgers: they are people that would really like to enter the work force. Moving them from disability support benefit to Newstart will hardly achieve that. What a person with a disability needs is a comprehensive program. They need a job that will not exacerbate their injury and they need support while they are establishing themselves in that job, and they need employers who are prepared to accept them and to offer them the opportunity to work for them. I have spent many hours on the phone ringing employers, asking them to give an opportunity to a person with a disability to work for them-where they do not have to pay a wage and where they are covered for workers compensation. I have been refused time and time again simply because of the attitudes that those employers have to people with disabilities-the stereotyping that takes place. In the contributions from those on the other side of the House, people have spoken about issues like bad backs. The Treasurer even mentioned bad backs in his budget speech in May this year. I have news for people on the other side of the House: bad backs and back injuries are very debilitating. Bad backs prevent people from going to work. If a person who has a back injury finds employment and that employment is unsuitable, they exacerbate their injury. So not only does this legislation have the ability to force people back into the work force and into unsuitable jobs but it also could create further injury for those people. It is very important that any person with a physical disability has a proper work assessment, a proper physical capacity assessment, before they enter the work force. This government is very big on promoting myths that the only reason that people are not re-entering the work force is that they are being encouraged to be welfare dependent. I believe this legislation will encourage that dependency, because people will not be prepared to take the risk. I refer to the budget submission made by the MS Society. ‘Andrew' has had MS for 12 years. He lives alone because his disability is such that he has some cognitive impairments which make it impossible for him to live with other people. He works 20 hours a week and he gets $600 a fortnight. So he is a guy who is in there having a go. You might ask what this legislation will mean to him. Currently his disposable income is $970. He pays $480 rent. His medication and modified diet costs $130 a week. His food and household expenses are $220 a week. His car and fare expenses are $155 a week. His total expenditure is $985 a week. Thus he has a shortfall of $15 a week. He relies on his family to meet that shortfall. If Andrew were on Newstart instead of DSP, his fortnightly disposable income would drop to $736 or only $368 a week. That would leave him $249 per fortnight worse off. If this legislation has been designed to assist people with disabilities, that is not the case when you look at an example like Andrew. In the UK they have introduced a new deal for people with disabilities, but that is voluntary program that is aimed to help people with health conditions and disabilities to obtain and sustain employment. That is a very different type of program from the program that we are looking at here. I think the government could learn a lot by looking at that. I do not have the time in this speech to detail that program; needless to say, this government's approach is not the approach that has been undertaken over there. Rather, this is an approach that moves more towards one of blame. We need to look at the government's performance in the area of disability. No area demonstrates more graphically than the Public Service the government's failure in the employment of people with disabilities. When I was working with people with disabilities, the federal government had a very strong policy of creating employment opportunities for people with disabilities. They were very proactive in that area. Under this government, unfortunately, the number of people with disabilities in the Public Service has declined dramatically. A number of the people with disabilities that I assisted into work in the Public Service have subsequently been sacked or given a redundancy. One young woman-and I find this quite heart breaking-was a deaf girl who worked for the department of social security. Once this government started to introduce efficiency measures, she was one of the first to go. She was no longer employed. She also developed diabetes. Within a month of her being made redundant, she was dead. I feel that she was a victim of this government's cost cutting and discrimination against people with disabilities. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation inquiry into increasing participation in the work force received a number of submissions from a people with disabilities, and that area of employment in the Public Service was highlighted. The minister was a party to that inquiry, and I do not know how he can bring down legislation like this. It shows that he had blinkers on and that he was not listening. Mr Barresi-You are misrepresenting him.",75
26,Ms HALL,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"If you listen to statements made by people with disabilities, you would know-as would the member opposite-that people with disabilities need support, security and assistance. They do not need to be transferred from one welfare payment to another, and that is what this legislation is about. It is about transference from one benefit to another, not about creating real and new opportunities for people with disabilities. People with disabilities, single parents and mature age workers are the most disadvantaged people in our community. This legislation is set to extend that disadvantage and increase their level of disadvantage. They have less bargaining power than other workers, and the new workplace relations legislation will make them prime targets for exploitation. They have limited ability to negotiate AWAs, and, as for unfair dismissals, we all know who will go first. As a person who has worked with people with disabilities and fought for them to be given the opportunity to get a job, I know how difficult it is for them to find a suitable job-one that they are able to perform, that is within their physical capabilities and where they have a supportive employer. I believe this legislation will act as a disincentive for people with disabilities to take the risk to enter or work force. (Time expired)",78
27,Mr BARRESI,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"I need to start my contribution by correcting a misrepresentation by the member for Shortland. As the member knows, the Minister for Workforce Participation, while his name appears as a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation, was a member of the committee for only a very short time prior to being promoted to his portfolio. In fact, he was not part of much of the committee's deliberations, considerations or recommendations or much of the evidence that was submitted. That needs to be clarified as something that was thrown in there by the member for ShortlandMs Hall- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I believe the member opposite is not giving a true and accurate description of the minister's involvement.",79
28,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,SERVICES LEGISLATION,Mr Quick)There is no point of order.,79
29,Mr BARRESI,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"There has been enough waffling. I will go back to the substance of the legislation. The debate on the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005 is significant, and it comes at a time that is right for Australia. If you were going to make changes that would help to encourage people into the work force, when would you do it? You would do it at a time when there is a drop off in the participation rate and a need for jobs to be filled in the workplace. It is important for structural changes to take place right now to help ease people away from the growing trap of welfare dependency. This is especially so at this very time when there is a crying need for an increase in the labour force, a need which is not going to go away but in fact will increase to re-enter the as the years march on. The notion of welfare as an inalienable right, which members on the other side would have you believe, is an unfortunate legacy of the years of their great mentor Gough Whitlam. In a strong, productive and prosperous society, welfare is only a solution when the means towards employment are simply not available. The means to employment and the incentive by business to employ is there today. When you do not have the confluence of those factors taking place then you can understand why welfare would be seen as the one and only solution. At present, Australia's work force participation stands at 63.8 per cent. It is a very low participation rate and one which can certainly be increased. Our current net growth in the Australian work force-and this is an important statistic-is 170,000 people each year. Access Economics has estimated that over the decade 2020 to 2030-and that is only 15 years away-it is expected that the work force will grow by only 125,000 people over the period compared with 170,000 per annum right now. There is going to be a major shortage in the years to come as I enter that phase which perhaps you, Mr Deputy Speaker, might be entering a little earlier than me-but not by much-of exiting the work force. A mere 12,500 people a year will enter the work force for that entire decade. There is a gap there of 157,500 people. Do we take action in 15 years time, do we take action in 10 years time or do we take action in 20 years time? We must take action now, while we have a strong economy where the need for jobs is growing and a shortage is taking place. This is one of the lowest participation rates in the Western world and a real, long term concern for our economy. The member for Shortland highlighted the report entitled Working for Australia's future: increasing participation in the workforce. I am very proud of that report as I chaired that inquiry. I took over from the previous chairman, and the committee completed that inquiry earlier this year. Certainly we heard a lot of evidence, but it was not one-dimensional, as the member for Shortland might have represented. One of the pieces of evidence from one of the submissions is that by 2030-the end of that decade period-Australia will have 500,000 jobs with no-one to fill them. If you were dependent on welfare in 2030, you would be asking yourself, ‘Who is in the work force to pay taxes in order to pay for the welfare that will be much needed by those who cannot look after themselves?' We need to take action, and we need to take it now. We cannot wait. We cannot have another talkfest. I notice that the Leader of Opposition is saying that we should have a poverty summit. The problem with the opposition is that, whenever there is a difficult issue, they always want a summit, a conference or some other sort of talkfest-or they want to refer it to a committee. We would have an endless period of inquiry with no time frames, and all that will happen is a lot of talk and very little action. The Australian people vote for their representatives to take leadership, not simply to enter into endless meaningless talkfests that do not seem to achieve anything. It is a bit amusing to see the Leader of the Opposition call for a poverty summit. Halting the decline in our work force participation rate and breaking the cycle of welfare dependency requires vision, which is something this government possesses with genuine zeal. Australia still has more than half a million people looking for a job, with many more in work who believe they are underemployed. There are also over 600,000 children living in jobless households. Unless we take bold steps now, the Australian labour market faces a real crisis in the next 15 to 20 years. In his Intergenerational report, the Treasurer, Peter Costello, referred in part to some of these problems as the three Ps-the participation, population and productivity problems we are going to face in this country. Through the Work Choices bill, which has been debated in this House and is currently in the Senate, the government is working to address some of the potential future shortfalls that will be characterised under the third P, productivity. The Work Choices bill provides the ability to enter into flexible working arrangements that suit individual circumstances. Additionally, rigid work practices can often be a huge disincentive to those on some form of welfare payment who are trying to re-enter the work force. This bill tackles another aspect of it. It provides the incenthe tives and highlights the disincentives of not being part of the work force. As has been acknowledged by members on the other side-and it is one of the things I agree with-the best assistance anyone can offer to someone who is on welfare, the best way to get out of welfare, is a job. There is nothing better than having a job to get out of that situation. One of the three Ps that was mentioned is population, and the government has looked into this through increasing migration, particularly in areas of immediate need because of skills shortages. This is not a long-term solution. We have skilled people. We have people with ability in the Australia marketplace today who have, for one reason or another, not been part of the work force particisults pation group. Somehow we need to encourage this group to come back into the work force. The time is right to make these important changes, and this bill does that by helping to ensure that our welfare system remains on a sustainable footing. At the moment, the growth of those on some form of welfare is not at all sustainable, and members on the other side must acknowledge that an unsustainable growth is taking place. We also have-and I recognise this-an obligation as a government to provide support to those in genuine need. The task is not only to create a balanced environment where people can participate in the work force but also to dispel the myth that people cannot afford to move off welfare and back into the work force. In debating this bill, a number of areas have been highlighted, such as single parents and those on the disability support pension, DSP. It is important to highlight that a healthy working life can be very good for a parent. Employment brings with it a sense of independence, and it has a positive effect on the long-term well-being of parents and families. The positive effect of a steady job and a life outside the home cannot be underestimated. Earlier this year I told the House about a study that demonstrated this, and I would like to share it with the House again today. It was a study by the Australian Institute of Family Studies called Growing up in Australia. The study found that 70 per cent of parents feel that working makes them more competent parents. At the time of the study, the director of the study, Ann Stanson of Melbourne University, told the Age: ... a lot parents feel that outside involvement helps them to be positive and responsive to their children when they are there ... This study focused on the families of 1,000 infants under the age of 12 months and children under four and five years old. The reare very significant, because they go a long way to dispelling misguided assertions about what mothers will feel in returning to work. In many cases, young single parents want to work. While the workplace environment can provide a boost to confidence and self-esteem, the last thing a young parent wants to face is a financial burden when they enter part-time work. The changes to the parenting payment are fair. From 1 July 2006, parents who apply for parenting payment single will no longer be eligible for it once their youngest child turns eight. This stands as a very generous measure when you compare it with those of nations around the world with an economic status similar to ours, be they in Europe or across the Tasman. At the moment, we have an eligibility age of, I think, 16 rather than four or five, which is common in other countries. We are increasing that to eight for those who are currently on parenting payment. From the same date, parents who apply for parenting payment single will have a part-time work requirement of 15 hours per week, once their youngest child turns six. When listening to members on the other side, you would be hard pressed not to believe that we are forcing parents to go back to work full time. The requirement is 15 hours per week-that is, a 15-hour contribution to a workplace in dire need of the skills, possessed by a lot of these people, which are needed by this country. That 15 hours of contribution will be not only of financial benefit to parents but also of benefit to their selfesteem-a sense of self-worth that takes place by being part of the work force, by enjoying the camaraderie of the workplace, by achieving, by doing things in an environment where there is real progress and by helping out in a business environment or wherever else they work. This legislation is generous and helps both the individual and the nation as a whole. Members opposite carp on about how parents in part-time work will be financially worse off than when they were dependent on the parenting payment. Once again, this assertion is misguided. As the minister recently highlighted, a sole parent in receipt of the single parenting payment now has a weekly income of $433.13. Under the proposals in this bill, when the youngest child turns eight the sole parent will be encouraged to find a minimum of 15 hours work per week. If they are working on a minimum rate of $12.75 per hour, combined with the income support and family tax benefits they retain, the will have a weekly income of $487.81. So under this scheme a sole parent will be $50 per week better off. In addition, access to pensioner concession card, the telephone allowance and pharmaceutical benefits allowance will remain. Those benefits will not be taken away. If they work 15 hours per week on a minimum rate-and most of them will probably go back to work on a rate higher than the minimum rate-they will receive a combination of the new payment through Centrelink and their working payment as well as all their concession cards and allowances. They will be much better off. The reforms in this bill are sensible and fair. While it is important that parents are encouraged into the work force, as part of these changes people with disabilities-the other cohort that is often talked about-will also be able to fulfil their potential in the workplace. Like the member for Shortland, I have a special concern for those who are receiving DSP, and recognise their special circumstances. Australia has one of the highest percentages of people on DSP in the world. Is there something about the Australian sun or our way of life that makes us far more prone to be on DSP than people in other nations? Why do we have more people on DSP than any other OECD nation? Why do those people on DSP in Australia have the lowest work force participation rate in the world? Is there something about our employers and what they are doing, or the incentives or disincentives out there, which is stopping people from entering the work force? The answer to the second question is partly yes. We need to break down the barriers that may be erected by employers to putting on people who may have a disability but who do have the capacity to work at least 15 hours. As much as possible, we need to break those barriers down and help employers realise that there is a real benefit to their busiparent ness in employing people who have some form of disability. We do not need to go very far to see the the evidence out there of the benefits of putting on someone who has a disability. Earlier this year Minister Dutton came to my electorate and visited the MS Society, which is located in Blackburn in the electorate of Deakin. The MS Society is taking a proactive role in disability employment. This year it began its Saving Jobs project, which focuses on building awareness between employers and employees. The project breaks new ground between MS employees and their employers. Minister Dutton, when he visited the society, met with local employers and job agencies. He also met with an academic from Deakin University, Dr David Edwards. Dr Edwards is a researcher who has concluded from a recent study across a number of organisations that, on balance, employers consider that they get an economic return on their employees with a disability. Moreover, they consider that the employee with a disability enhances the social value of their business. This complements some of the research coming from the United States, which indicates, on every human resource indicator-whether it be absenteeism, staff turnover or staff morale-that those who have a disability and are employed in the work force are some of the best workers that an employer can possibly have. That kind of common sense approach needs to be encouraged in the work force, not one of engaging people with a disability for altruistic motivesalthough that should not be scoffed at. If need be, it does make economic sense to put on people who have some form of disability. We are asking for 15 hours per week where it is possible. This is positive legislation. It has an eye on tomorrow for the nation, when we are going to have a shortfall in the numbers participating in the work force. The legislation also has an eye on providing real benefits and encouragement to those who are not participating in the work force to enter it and get themselves off the dependency cycle and into a situation where they can be masters of their own destiny and in control of their financial circumstances. This legislation deserves the support of the House.",79
30,Ms KING,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"The government's attempt at welfare reform, as represented in the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005, should be opposed because it does nothing to support parents or people with a disability to gain appropriate skills to enter the work force. It does nothing to help sole parents or people with a disability make a successful transition from welfare to work. It punishes these most vulnerable Australians, effectively dumping them onto a lower Centrelink payment with more compliance. It fails the government's own test at welfare reform in not addressing the growth in the number of people on welfare payments. The measures in this bill, alongside the government's extreme industrial relations agenda, are set to create a new class of working poor, forced to accept any job, regardless of the pay and conditions, regardless of whether they will be worse off financially. I want real welfare reform in this country. God knows, we only have to look at the current system to see why it is needed. We need real welfare reform that tackles the reasons someone is not working and delivers practical solutions to them. We need real welfare reform that treats people with dignity and respect and helps them find work. We need real welfare reform-not this Claytons welfare reform, which is all about reducing the cost of welfare and not about helping people into work.",83
31,The SPEAKER,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"Order ! It being 2 pm, the debate is interrupted. The member will have leave to continue her remarks at a later stage. NA Mr Robert Gerard",83
32,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer and relates to his numerous failures to answer the same question in parliament yesterday. Did the Treasurer say to Mr Gerard: I know there's an issue with the Tax Office, but I don't have a problem with you on the board. Will the Treasurer now answer this question in this place today?",83
33,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I made clear yesterday, what I said to Mr Gerard-and I will repeat it-is that, in order for his appointment to go forward to the cabinet, he would have to give an assurance about his tax affairs in a standard form, which he said he was able to do and which in fact he did. In addition to that, he forwarded to the government a letter from the Commissioner of Taxation, which I tabled yesterday, which said that the Tasxation Office had no current disputes with Mr Gerard. I indicated to them that, given the fact that he had given an undertaking-and, indeed, the commissioner had given an undertaking-it could go to the cabinet. It went to the cabinet; it was approved by the cabinet. Mr Gerard has been on the board for 2½ years. In those 2½ years, he has discharged his duty as a director of the board very well. Can I say that I thoroughly endorse what the Leader of the Opposition said yesterday when he said that he was not putting any questions as to his fitness for office. Exports",83
34,Mrs HULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. Would the Deputy Prime Minister advise the House how rural Australia, including the electorate of Riverina, is contributing to Australia's export success? How will this continue into the future?",84
35,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Riverina for her question and recognise the enormous contribution that the electorate that she represents makes to Australia's export effort. The member for Riverina would be aware that, in 2004-05, there was a record level of exports out of Australia of $162.3 billion. Some of the products that are produced in the electorate of Riverina made a significant contribution to that figure. Beef exports rose by 24 per cent to $4.8 billion. Lamb exports-and we all remember the dispute we had over lamb exports and tariffs a few years ago-grew by nearly nine per cent last year and now stand at $1.19 billion, which is an enormous amount of growth in recent years, and of course coming from the member's electorate. Dairy exports rose by 9.4 per cent to top $2.36 billion. All this has taken place in a global economic environment that from time to time has been challenging, with an exchange rate that has been higher than it has been in some recent years and in the face of one of the worse droughts that Australia has had in recent years. It is very important that we recognise the great effort and great job that Australia's farmers and exporters do in making a contribution to that export figure. This means increased income for regional Australia and jobs in regional Australia. The member for Riverina knows only too well the importance of flexibility in the labour market, particularly with some of the agricultural and horticultural industries in her electorate of Riverina. The member for Riverina, along with the National Farmers Federation, would recognise the importance of the government's workplace relations reform package that we have before the parliament. The NFF have said that the government's workplace relations reforms are critical for continued economic growth in Australia. The NFF have also said that the flow-on effects from the introduction of the Work Choices package will be a crucial component for our industry to continue to remain competitive. Interestingly, at the Senate inquiry into the Work Choices bill, the NFF stated that Work Choices is the right choice for Australia. The NFF's views are supported by their state based affiliates, including Agforce in Queensland. Agforce believe that the Work Choices reforms will provide an opportunity for wages and conditions to reward individual effort and initiative-that is, to benefit employees, not employers. Agforce went on to say, ‘If excessive industrial relations regulations are removed, the flexibility and competitiveness of farming businesses will be increased.' That is something they want to see happen, and they want to see this legislation pass through the parliament. I will leave the last word on this to Peter Corish, the President of the National Farmers Federation. He said, ‘It is imperative that the bill is passed before Christmas so that we can get on with the job of educating farmers about the changes and implementing the reforms we have sought for decades.' This government is delivering those opportunities. As I said yesterday, the coalition will continue to work with, and listen to, the job creators in this nation. We know that the Labor Party is tied hand and foot to the job destroyers in this country. NA",84
36,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon Mr Reuven Rivlin, Speaker of the Knesset of Israel. On behalf of all members, I extend to you a very warm welcome. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Mr Robert Gerard",85
37,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to the statement by Mr Gerard reported yesterday: I told the Treasurer to check with all the departlia's ments before I went on the board. The Treasurer rang back and said: ‘There is an issue with the tax office but I don't have a problem with you on the board.' Between these two conversations, did the Treasurer, the Treasurer's office or a representative of the Treasurer have any discussions with the Commissioner of Taxation or his office regarding a letter of clearance for Mr Gerard's personal tax affairs?",85
38,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Without asking all the members of my office, which I am quite happy to do, I cannot vouch for them. But, as I have already told the honourable member, the obligation to give an undertaking as to tax affairs is always that of the appointee. In this case, as in every other case, the appointee was told that he would have to give an undertaking as to his tax affairs. Not only did he do that but he produced a letter from the commissioner as to his tax affairs. As I said yesterday, I do not believe that there are any matters in dispute between Mr Gerard and the Commissioner of Taxation. Indeed, I believe that all outstanding matters are settled. I do not believe that it is wrong for a person to contest a tax audit. There would be thousands, probably hundreds of thousands, of Australians who do that. Every Australian has the right, if they do not believe they are being assessed for the proper amount of tax, to contest that in court. The fact that they do that is not wrong; it is not illegal. It is a right that every Australian has. If an Australian goes to a court or contests a tax audit, that is not a blemish on their character. They have every right to do so, whether it be Mr Gerard, members of parliament or other companies. Economy",85
39,Mr HENRY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer outline the latest information on Austracredit rating? What does this indicate about the strength of the Australian economy?,85
40,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I can inform him today that Standard and Poor's have just issued a press release which has reaffirmed Australia's top credit rating-a AAA credit rating. Standard and Poor's say that Australia's AAA rating has been affirmed on solid finances and a robust economy: Public sector finances remain extremely strong in Australia, and the Commonwealth has very low levels of debt and strong commitment to ongoing fiscal discipline. It was not always the case that the Commonwealth had extremely strong finances. We can remember back to 1996. The then Minister for Finance, now the Leader of the Opposition, had the federal budget in deficit by $10 billion. The then finance minister, now the Leader of the Opposition, had racked up Commonwealth debt of $96 billion. Let me also make the point that, back in 1996, Australia did not have a AAA credit rating. In 1996 Australia had been downgraded twice because of the policies of the Australian Labor Party. We were downgraded for the first time in 1986 and for a second time in 1989. It was only after the election of the coalition government that we were upgraded in 1999, and our final upgrade to a AAA rating was in 2003. So it was Labor that ran Australia's credit rating down and it was the coalition that ran it up again. The consequence of that, of course, is lower interest rates, because if Australia were not AAA rated there would be a premium not only on government borrowing but on private companies through the interest rates they pay. I think all Australians would probably welcome the fact that Australia has a AAA credit rating. I have only known of one member of parliament who has complained about the upgrading of Australia's credit rating, and it was the member for Lilley, who complained on 17 February 2003 about Standard and Poor's upgrading Australia to a AAA rating. Mr Beazley interjecting",85
41,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition is not helping!,86
42,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"His claim at the time was that the credit rating upgrade came ‘at the expense of Australian families'. The member for Lilley complained about Australia's credit upgrade. The credit upgrade, notwithstanding the complaints of the member for Lilley, came about because of good economic policy-coalition policy-that is giving all Australians lower interest rates. Mr Robert Gerard",86
43,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. I refer to his previous answer, and I also refer to his statement in this House yesterday: Unusually, in this case, the taxpayer also provided a letter from the commissioner. Treasurer, isn't the only explanation for the unusual procedure that the Treasurer knew Mr Gerard had a major tax problem and that the Treasurer then took steps to camouflage a Bermuda style tax haven in which Mr Gerard was personally involved?",86
44,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is absolutely false and I repudiate it in its entirety. The reason the commissioner wrote a letter saying that he had no dispute with Mr Gerard is that he had no dispute with Mr Gerard. That is the reason he wrote the letter. The Commissioner of Taxation made it clear that he had no dispute with Mr Gerard. To my knowledge, he still has no dispute with Mr Gerard. To my knowledge, Mr Gerard did what any taxpayer is entitled to do. You are entitled in Australia to contest a tax audit and, what is more, it was settled to the complete satisfaction of the parties. Robert Gerard has broken no law. Robert Gerard has done what every Australian is entitled to do. Robert Gerard has no outstanding matters with the tax office. Robert Gerard has served on the Reserve Bank board for 2½ years without any complaint. The Australian Labor Party has never made a complaint about his fitness to be a member of that board and nor, to my knowledge, has anybody else. Workplace Relations",86
45,Mr GEORGIOU,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Would the minister inform the House how Australian workers have benefited from the system of enterprise bargaining? Are there any alternative views?,86
46,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Kooyong for his question and, in response, say to him that the system of enterprise bargaining in Australia has led to more jobs, higher wages and greater productivity in this country. This is a system which is underpinned by the corporations power in the Constitution. Indeed, in the Work Choices package before the parliament the corporations power will be used to further that system, rather than have the old system that we had in the past based on a system of industrial disputes. The corporations power was first used not by the coalition but by the Labor Party under the leadership of the then Prime Minister, Mr Keating. Indeed, in is second reading speech in 1993 the then Minister for Industrial Relations, Laurie Brereton, said this: The operation of enterprise flexibility agreements will be supported by the use of the corporations power. This removes the requirement for an interstate dispute and makes the arrangements more accessible This was not a new idea for the Labor Party. Indeed, as far back as October 1972, in an address to the Metal Trades Industry Association, the then Prime Minister-the then Labor Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam-had also advocated the use of the corporations power for industrial relations in Australia. In the past, Mr Whitlam, Mr Keating and Mr Brereton were all in favour of the use of the corporations power because this enabled the creation of a system based on cooperation rather than a system based on the old Conciliation and Arbitration Act, which at its core had this bizarre proposition that, to resolve an industrial arrangement, you first had to create an interstate dispute in order to have an arbitration commissioner move in and then resolve that dispute. So the corporations power was strongly advocated by the Labor Party and its leadership in the past. What is the position of the Labor Party today? This was revealed on the Insiders program last Sunday when the Leader of the Opposition was interviewed.This is what he said when he was asked about this matter: The theory under which it's imposed, that is, using the corporations power to do industrial relations legislation, that's all wrong. I mean, basically, industrial relations legislation should be done under the conciliation and arbitration power as the founders of this nation determined it should be. So, all of it is wrong. The whole theory of it is wrong. That's why you've got to junk the lot. So we had the Leader of the Opposition say use of the corporations power is all wrong. He went on to say: I mean, basically, industrial relations legislation should be done under the conciliation and arbitration power as the founders of this nation determined it should be. And this is what he finished up by saying: So, all of it is wrong. The whole theory of it is wrong. Mr Kelvin Thomson interjecting",87
47,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Wills is warned!,87
48,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So what we have here, whether he intended it or not, is a clear indication that the Leader of the Opposition wants to rip up the use of the corporations power, which was advocated by Gough Whitlam and Paul Keating and put in place by Laurie Brereton as industrial relations minister. What that means is this: the consequence of that is not just undoing the reforms that this government has put in place; it is undoing the reforms which the Leader of the Opposition voted for when he was a member of the Keating cabinet. That is what he is doing: he is saying I am going to rip up the reforms which I was partly responsible for in 1993 to bring about a more collective approach in Australia. He wants a system which is based on awards and conflict rather than a system based on cooperation. The consequence of this is not just a rip-up of legislation; it is a rip-off of ordinary lian workers, because under both collective and individual agreements they earn more. That is what we will be telling the Australian people day in and day out. Mr Robert Gerard",87
49,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer the Treasurer to this morning's Australian. It reports that some of his cabinet colleagues have privately said that they did not consider Mr Gerard was ‘a good choice' in the first place for the Reserve Bank board but that the Treasurer had said, ‘ Mr Gerard had settled the tax dispute and paid the outstanding tax, penalties and interest and was a proper person to be on the bank board.' Did the Treasurer give such assurances to his cabinet colleagues? If so, why did he, given that these matters were not settled until well after Mr Gerard's appointment?",88
50,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Much and all as I would like to give a blow-by-blow description of what happens in the cabinet, I would like to say, just for the sake of the record, that this appointment was supported by all members of the cabinet, so I cannot vouch for the Australian newspaper in this respect, I regret to say. Economy",88
51,Mr BAIRD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer inform the House of the results of the latest OECD economic outlook? What is the OECD's assessment of the Australian economy and policy challenges?,88
52,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question and for his interest in economic policy. The OECD overnight released a very positive economic assessment of Australia's economic outlook. The OECD expects Australia's GDP to grow 2.6 per cent in 2005 and its growth to accelerate to 3.2 per cent in 2006 and 3.6 per cent in 2007. It expects Austrabusiness investment to be underpinned by high company profitability and healthy corporate balance sheets. The ongoing investment boom is expected to make it possible to take advantage of buoyant export markets. In line with that, the OECD expects that the current account deficit will narrow during 2007, forecasting 5.2 per cent. The OECD expects inflation to be affected by higher energy prices-which is also the position of the government-and predicts that underlying inflation will peak at around three per cent in 2006 before easing. So this is a very positive assessment of the Australian economy and, in particular, of the strong Commonwealth government finances underpinned by surplus budgets and low Commonwealth debt. One of the recommendations the OECD makes about how Australia could improve its economy is that there should be ‘rapid implementation of the planned industrial relations reform'. The OECD is a group of developed economies in the world. There is regular peer assessment. The United States, France, Germany and Japan are all members of it. What does the OECD call for in Australia? Rapid implementation of the planned industrial relations reform. So that is what the developed world believes would help Australia. That is what the developed world has called for in Australia. We have the OECD calling for it and we have the IMF calling for it. Practically every economic commentator says industrial relations reform improves flexibility. And who have we got opposing reform in Australia? None other than the Leader of the Opposition, ‘ Mr Antireform' himself, who has stood opposed to every reform that has got Australia to where it is and stands against every reform as to where it wants to go in the future. Mr Robert Gerard",88
53,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. Treasurer, is it the case that Mr Gerard was appointed to the Reserve Bank board on 25 March 2003? Is it also the case that Mr Gerard's company did not settle his tax affairs until September 2003?",89
54,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He was certainly appointed in 2003. An opposition member-When?,89
55,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is on the public record-you can look up the book. I have a statement issued by his solicitors yesterday-which, I note, disputes a lot of what was reported in the Financial Reviewwhich says that settlement was achieved but not as reported in the Australian Financial Review.",89
56,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,When was it achieved?,89
57,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It was achieved in late 2003, I believe. I cannot give you the precise date. I do not believe that Mr Gerard would be the only director of a company which would have outstanding matters with the tax office. Without going into the detail, I would be very surprised if there were not other bank directors who have also been associated with public companies or other companies that have contested audits, as they are entitled to do. I repeat, as I have said to the House on many occasions, that every Australian has the right to contest a tax assessment. Every Australian has the right to go to court in respect of a tax assessment. It is no crime to contest a tax assessment. Particularly when the matter is settled without any findings of factMr Crean interjecting",89
58,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Hotham is warned!,89
59,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"or settled without any findings against the person, there is no adverse implication on that person at all. The fact that a person has settled their affairs with the Australian Taxation Office indicates that the two have come to an agreement. As I said earlier, Mr Gerard has been a valued member of the Reserve Bank board for 2½ years and no-one has suggested that he has not discharged his duties properly. Iraq",89
60,Mrs GASH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister update the House on Iraq's path to democracy and what the government is doing to support it? Opposition member interjecting,89
61,Mrs GASH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Don't be so ignorant! Minister, are there any alternative views?",89
62,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. I appreciate the interest she has in this issue. Planning by the Iraqis is going ahead now for general elections to be held on 15 December to elect a new national assembly and indeed to elect a new government in Iraq under the constitution that was approved in October. Our expectation-we obviously do not know for sure-is that the turn-out for that election will be at least as great as the turn-out for the referendum, which was 10 million people. The government has contributed $12 million to the United Nations to support both this election and the referendum in addition to the $5 million we provided to support the first election on 30 January. Australians are also assisting the process, including through the International Mission for the Iraqi Elections. The deputy head of the Australian Electoral Commission-who will no doubt be known to some members-Paul Dacey, is the deputy chairman of the International Mission for the Iraqi Elections. We have supported out-of-country voting in Australia for the 30 January elections, and we will do so again for the elections in December. I am sure the Speaker of the Knesset would agree with that analysis, and how welcome he is here today-he is a very good man. Let me make this point: the advent of democracy in Iraq for the first time is an extraordinary and great thing. On this side of the House we are very proud of the role that we, members of the Australian Defence Force and many officials have played in helping to make that possible. Mr Wilkie interjecting",89
63,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Swan is warned!,90
64,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Our policy on this issue has always been crystal clear. The honourable member for Gilmore asked whether there are any alternatives. The people in my office are probably the only people in Australia who keep tabs on the opposition's cies on Iraq. The House may be interested to know that the opposition has now had 31 different policies on Iraq. The latest one is apparently back to where Mark Latham was-that is, all the troops out. Just as democracy arrives in Iraq and the international community is getting behind the Iraqis and dealing as best as we all can with the insurgents, the oppositionMr Rudd- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order that goes to relevance. Could you bring Saddam's bagman back to the question please?",90
65,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Griffith will withdraw that comment. Mr Rudd-I withdraw, Mr Speaker.",90
66,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister has completed his answer. Mr Robert Gerard,90
67,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. Treasurer, did any other minismember ter raise any concerns about Mr Gerard's appointment to the Reserve Bank board at any time? In particular, did the Minister for Finance and Administration or the Minister for Foreign Affairs raise any concerns?",90
68,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No. Transport Network Funding,90
69,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Would the minister advise the House how the government will ensure the delivery of vital funding for Australia's transport networks? Is the minister aware of any alternative policies?,90
70,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As a Queenslander the honourable member for Hinkler will be pleased to learn that, at long last, the Queensland government has signed the AusLink agreement. It has taken a long time but, finally, Queensland has signed up to an agreement that will deliver $2,688 million to Queenpolisland, until 2008-09. This includes $1.864 million under the AusLink investment program and over $1.5 billion for construction. This funding from the Commonwealth government represents an 81 per cent increase in construction funding for roads in Queensland over the five-year period of the agreement. The funding represents a significant advance and a real opportunity to address some of the really important projects in Queensland. The Prime Minister has already announced $550 million in funding under AusLink for the Ipswich Motorway. The member for Groom, the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, announced $10 million in funding for the next stage of development in the project in the Toowoomba Range. There is significant funding for the upgrade of the Bruce Highway and for a range of other important projects in the state. Last week I also announced funding for some important rail upgrade projects. The for Moreton, the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education, will be particularly interested in the announcement of $25 million in funding for the Acacia Ridge level crossing upgrade. It is a high priority project for the minister. Mr Hardgrave-A promise delivered.",90
71,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes. He indicated in his election platform that this would be a project he would be pressing for, and now he has delivered. AusLink has enabled these sorts of projects to be delivered. In all, there is $12.7 billion nationally for getting on with the job of upgrading the roads and upgrading the rail systems. Last week the Leader of the Opposition presented what he called the ‘blueprint speech' at AusRAIL ‘05, with regard to the Labor Party's proposals for road and rail upgrading. There were three essential elements. Firstly, he is going to have a national infrastructure audit. AusLink has already done that. We had a public process which identified deficiencies and what we needed to fix them. Secondly, he is going to establish a national infrastructure priority list. AusLink has done that too. We have five years of projects already identified on a 20-year planning scale. Thirdly, he is going to set up a Commonwealth statutory authority to oversight all of this. So instead of action and road building we are going to get another bureaucracy to redo all that AusLink is already doing. We are getting on with the job. Labor will only ever talk and never deliver. Mr Robert Gerard",91
72,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. Treasurer, is it the case that any person whose company is subject to ongoing investigation for tax evasion cannot be appointed to the board of any Australian bank? Treasurer, how can you justify, then, Mr Gerard's appointment to the board of the Reserve Bank?",91
73,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would be surprised if that were case because I would be very surprised if the Australian banks are not being subject to audits. I think you ought to recognise the fact that the Australian Taxation Office conducts audits on all major companies in Australia. For most of them. I would believe that the Australian banks would have been under tax audit for quite some time. In addition to that, the Australian Taxation Office does audits on all so-called high-wealth individuals, so I think there would hardly be a high-wealth individual in Australia who has not been subject to a tax audit. Most of these tax audits go on for very long periods of time. Without going into the matter, I would be very surprised indeed if the Australian banks had not been subject to tax audits. Health Insurance",91
74,Mr TOLLNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Would the minister inform the House of the steps the government has taken to make private health insurance better for consumers? Is the minister aware of any alternative policies?,91
75,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Solomon for his question. Like the rest of the government, he understands that you cannot have a strong Medicare system in this country without a strong complementary private health sector too. Support for the private health system has been one of the signature policies of the Howard government, particularly the private health insurance rebate. It is a rebate worth $1,000 a year to the average Australian family with private cover-a rebate which means that nearly nine million Australians now have access to the choice and security that private cover brings, including nearly one million people with incomes of less than $20,000 a year. In the September quarter, nearly 60,000 people took out private insurance, and from tomorrow the government is taking further steps to guarantee that portability of private cover is a reality. I have been asked about alternative policies. So I turn to Labor's forbidden book: the diaries written by the person whom they wanted to be Prime Minister just 12 months ago. Opposition member interjecting",91
76,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is right, the forbidden book. I read on page 129 that the Leader of the Opposition's former chief of staff says: ‘The private health insurance rebate would be one of the first things abolished in any Beazley government.' I read on page 129 that ‘the member for Jagajaga despises the rebate and wants to poleaxe it.' Then on page 347, I read that Medicare Gold was ‘my plan'-that is to say, Mark Latham's plan‘for killing the private health insurance rebate'. Ms Gillard interjecting",92
77,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"‘It required a lot of work, all handled by Gillard'-the would be assassin of the private health insurance rebate, now interjecting furiously, who said on the Friday when this book first hit the public pages, ‘People should not ignore the truths in this book.' The truth that I most liked in this book was on page 112. There Mr Latham says of the Leader of the Opposition: ‘A big bellowing cow in parliament will never fool the public'-and haven't we seen plenty of that today! Mr Robert Gerard",92
78,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to his terview on ABC's AM program this morning in which the Treasurer denied having had referred to him any letters between Mr Gerard's lawyers and the Attorney-General about Mr Gerard's court proceedings. Aside from the letters, did the Treasurer, the Treasurer's office or a representative of the Treasurer have any discussions with the former Attorney-General or his office about this matter?",92
79,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am informed by the Attorney-General that there was no letter to the Attorney-General. I am also informed by the Attorney-General that it was not referred to any minister and, if I am right-because I assumed you would be asking this question-because there was no letter, there was never a letter referred to the Attorney General. So that ends that one. Because no matter was ever referred to the Attorney, there was nothing the Attorney could ever raise with me, nor did he. NA",92
80,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of a parliamentary delegation from the Democratic Republic of Timor Leste. On behalf of the House I extend a very warm welcome to our visitors. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Youth: Financial Literacy",92
81,Mr VASTA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer. Would the minister advise the House of initiatives to help young Australians better manage money? What are the challenges young people face in developing better financial literacy?,92
82,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Bonner for his interest in the young people of his electorate and the young people of in- Australia and their financial future. At the last federal election the Howard government announced that we would be establishing the Financial Literacy Foundation-which we subsequently have done and funded to the tune of $5 million a year-to raise awareness amongst the Australian population, young and old, of the significance that financial literacy can make in their lives by providing them with the information and advice they need to be able to make appropriate decisions. I want to commend the Commonwealth Bank on some groundbreaking research that it did which pointed to just how beneficial this work can be. A key finding of the CBA stated: An improvement in financial literacy has the tential to boost Australia's economy by $6,000 million a year with the creation of more than 16,000 new jobs. You can appreciate that these are significant things for the average Australian. The CBA also identified the particular target groups which have the lowest level of financial literacy in Australia. Unfortunately, one of the highest groups represented were young males, aged 16 to 20. The Australian Financial Literacy Foundation and the Master Builders Association here in the ACT have teamed up together to provide the first opportunity for young apprentices in the building field-predominantly young men-to gain, as of March next year, direct financial literacy advice and assistance so they will understand budgeting and how to conduct their own finances. It is quite likely that many of these young men, and some young women, will find themselves in business in four or five years time, adding to the wealth of this nation. It is a well-known fact that apprenticeships were at a 30-year low when the Howard government was elected in 1996, due to the neglect of apprenticeships by those who sit opposite-the Labor Party. It is also a fact that these same apprentices today are more likely to be in full-time employment throughout their life than even those with a tertiary education. It is absolutely essential that they gain the financial literacy skills they need, so they can make the right decisions in their personal lives and in their business lives. This is what the Financial Literacy Foundation was established to do. It is the start of what is going to be fantastic work, raising the financial literacy standards of all Australians to the benefit of both the individuals and their families and the wider Australian economy. Mr Robert Gerard",92
83,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question po- is to the Treasurer. Isn't the Treasurer's attempt to differentiate between Mr Gerard's personal tax affairs and his business tax affairs just hairsplitting? Wasn't the Treasurer thoroughly aware that Mr Gerard had, on behalf of his company of which he was the major shareholder, negotiated in the Cayman Islands an insurance scam that had been fought by the tax office for 14 years? Isn't it a fact that Mr Gerard should not have been appointed to the Reserve Bank board because of that tax scandal? Isn't the Treasurer inventing spurious distinctions in full coverup mode to try to escape responsibility for having made this grossly inappropriate appointment of a Liberal Party mate?",93
84,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No. Welfare to Work,93
85,Mrs VALE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Human Services. Would the minister update the House on how the government is working to streamline the process for people without jobs to enter paid work?,93
86,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Hughes for her question. She knows when there is good news pending and there is good news. We want Australians to have the opportunity to get a job. That is what the coalition believes in. The Intergenerational report, released by the Treasurer, properly forecasts that Australia is running that out of workers. In fact, over the next 15 years, work force participation is expected to drop by close to four per cent. The coalition recognised that this issue had to be addressed. So we have two approaches. The first one is structural reform, workplace relations reform, which the coalition is absolutely committed to. The second reform is Welfare to Work. It is about providing up to 2.6 million Australians of working age, who may not be working, with the opportunity to get a job. When I first became Minister for Human Services, we approached the Centrelink call centres and asked them for the first time to start ringing people on benefits and ask them, on a voluntary basis, if they were prepared to work-to make a commitment to serve the country by getting a job for a few hours. This was on a voluntary basis. We rang nearly 300,000 people over the last 12 months. One hundred thousand indicated that they were prepared to work, to be referred to the Job Network, and 45,000 have gone into jobs. Forty-five thousand people work on a voluntary basis because we rang them up and asked them if they were prepared to work. It is an even better chart-and we all have to have charts. It is an even better chart, a good chart, a bit like the Qantas symbolindicating the number of new jobs on a voluntary basis of people who are prepared to work.",93
87,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,94
88,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Labor Party have a bit of a problem with people getting jobswe know that. I was flicking through old press releases and I came across one by the member for Lilley, Wayne Swan. It is not that long ago that he said: The coalition is not serious about assisting seekers move from welfare to work. How wrong he is: 45,000 people in the last 12 months going into work on a voluntary basis simply because we asked them to do it.",94
89,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Does the minister wish to table a document?,94
90,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Yes. Mr Robert Gerard,94
91,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his statement yesterday. He said: The relevant point about the dispute between Mr Gerard and the Australian Taxation Office is that, by hand of the letter from the commissioner, all the outstanding matters were resolved. Can the Prime Minister confirm that the Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia registered a charge over the assets of Mr Gerard's companies for a maximum prospective liability of $250 million? Can he confirm that the Commonwealth took this action in September 2003, some six months after Mr Gerard's appointment to the board of the Reserve Bank? Why was the Commonwealth forced to take this heavy action to protect its interests in relation to Mr Gerard's tax arrangements if all outstanding matters had been resolved, as the Prime Minister said, at the time of the appointment to the board?",94
92,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I repeat what I said yesterday. What I said yesterday was absolutely correct. Naturally, because of the secrecy provisions of the tax act, I am not privy to the individual affairs of a taxpayer, but I am privy to the wording of a letter which was provided by the tax commissioner and that wording stands for itself. Aged Care",94
93,Mr WOOD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Ageing. Would the minister inform the House how the Howard government is providing choice to older jobAustralians who wish to remain at home?,94
94,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for La Trobe for his question and acknowledge his deep interest in aged care issues in his electorate. Over the past decade, an increasing number of older Australians have sought the delivery of aged care services at home. The Australian government have responded. We have led a quiet revolution in the way aged care services are deliv- Australians. ered in this country. We are providing far more choice. We are moving away from the one size fits all mentality that was the hallmark of Labor aged care policy back in the good old days-when Labor had an aged care policy. We are increasing the types of services that are available and we are increasing the availability of those services, and the sheer volume of change speaks for itself. When we came to office there were only 4,000 community aged care packages; today there are 34,000. That means that 34,000 people can receive hostel level care but at home. The Howard government introduced the Extended Aged Care at Home package. There are now 2,700 of these packages. That means people can receive nursing home level care but at home. And we have now introduced another model of care, dementia specific Extended Aged Care at Home, so people living with dementia can stay at home rather than enter a nursing home. This choice is in addition to the increase in residential aged care places that we have introduced to meet the challenges of the ageing of our population. Since coming to office, over 95,000 new aged care places have been allocated and subsidised by the Australian government, and we are well on the way to meeting our target of 200,000 operational aged care places by 30 June 2006. As at June this year, there were a record number-193,753-of operational aged care places in Australia. This demand for greater choice seems to have passed Labor by. They do not understand the importance of community care. They do not have an aged care policy to meet this issue. They neglected aged care in government; they have abandoned it in opposition. Meanwhile, this government is getting on with the job of providing world-class care with choice to meet the needs of individual",94
95,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Behaviour in the Chamber",95
96,Mr NAIRN,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, I have a question for you. The question is in relation to the role of advisers in this House. Is it appropriate behaviour for an adviser on the opposition side to be mouthing, gesturing and even waving when particularly, but not only, the Treasurer was answering questions during question time?",95
97,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I thank the member for Eden-Monaro. I was not aware of the matter that he raised, but his question is a valid one and it is certainly not in order for someone in the advisers box to be interfering or intervening during question time. Mr Rudd- Mr Speaker, if you are reflecting on that question, can I ask you to reflect in an equal manner upon any gestures or reflections or observations, physical or otherwise, by advisers on the government's advisory benches?",95
98,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"In response to the member for Griffith, of course it applies to all people occupying advisers' seats.",95
99,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"In the light of these questions, could you perhaps provide a packet of cotton wool for tomorrow's question time so we can wrap the Treasurer's jaw in it?",95
100,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"In response to the Leader of the Opposition, that was a frivolous question. Divisions",95
101,Mr ANDREN,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, my question is to you and you may care to take it on notice. The television tape of last night's proceedings of the third reading stage of the antiterrorism legislation clearly records you as saying: ‘In that case, a division is required. Two members calling opposition means a division,' after I and the member for Franklin indicated our opposition to the AntiTerrorism Bill (No. 2) 2005 as it stood. House of Representatives Practice clearly states at page 272 that: More than one member cannot record dissent at this time, as a division would then have to be proceeded with. Mr Speaker, why did you acknowledge that a division was required and then call on the clerk for the third reading without offering the opportunity for that division? Why are not your comments recorded in Hansard, which incorrectly shows the bill was read a third time before my and Mr Quick's recording of dissent?",95
102,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I thank the member for Calare for that question, and I will respond to him now. When I declared the final question on the Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2005 in favour of the ayes, I heard the member for Calare indicate that he was voting no. The chair's declaration, the result of a vote on the voices, must be challenged by at least two members. I was not aware of any other dissentient voice at that time, and I heard no call for a division. The member for Calare then indicated he wished his dissent to be recorded, as it will be in the official record the House. Subsequently the member for Franklin also asked for his dissent to be recorded. I did not hear the member for Franklin vote against the final question, and I did not hear him call for a division when he asked for his dissent to be recorded. The time for a division had passed. It is not possible for the dissent of two members to be recorded formally in the way allowed by standing order 126, but their words are recorded in the Hansard. Furthermore, my attention has been drawn to a media release issued yesterday in the name of the member for Calare about this matter. The media release casts some serious reflections on the actions and motivations of the chair. Such reflections seriously undermine the orderly conducting of the business of the House. I will require any reflection of this kind, made inside or outside the House, to be withdrawn without qualification. Accordingly, and in the light of my explanation, I require the member for Calare to withdraw his reflections on the House.",96
103,Mr ANDREN,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, with your indulgence, could I just make a comment?",96
104,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,The member for Calare has the call.,96
105,Mr ANDREN,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"With no knowledge of a seconder for any call for a division, with the member for New England having left the chamber to abstain from the last two votes, I was not in a position to know that there was anybody else in this place who was prepared to second my call for a division. Having stood up to record my dissent, thinking I was the sole voice, I then heard the member for Franklin indicate his opposition. In the bedlam that ensued after that statement was made, I would have thought that it would have been your course to have offered a division, the question to be put, and I would then of have called for such a division. I had no prior knowledge that there was another person in the chamber.",96
106,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,The member for Calare is only furthering the problem. I call upon him to withdraw without reservation.,96
107,Mr ANDREN,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I withdraw in the interest of harmony in this place, but the record shows the sequence.",96
108,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,I thank the member for Calare. Divisions,96
109,Mr JENKINS,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, without tempting fate by extending the discussion that we have just had, can I clarify your statement that the vote of the honourable member for Calare against the third reading will now be recorded in the Votes and Proceedings?",97
110,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"No, the position of the member for Calare will be recorded in Hansard. Parliament House: Access",97
111,Ms ANNETTE ELLIS,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, as a member representing an electorate in Canberra, it has come to my attention recently that community groups are having difficulty in the normal course of access to this building when the parliament is not in session. If I can briefly explain, there was a national organisation here in Canberra last week and they sought my assistance in holding a function in this place as a national organisation, with schoolchildren from almost every jurisdiction in attendance. Because of the security requirements now in this building, it was not possible for that function to held unless I personally or a member of my staff were in agreement to be in attendance at all times, from the beginning to the very end of that function. I wonder if you could consider this situation and maybe come up with a way that we could continue the relationship between the parliament and the community without having that sort of requirement put on it. While I am very happy to play that role, it is not always possible for me to do that. I respect the security arrangements, but I am also concerned that, without that personal involvement by me or one of my local colleagues, organisations like the school group I am talking about-through the Epilepsy Foundation-would not be able to utilise this building in the way that they have in the past.",97
112,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,I thank the member for Canberra. I will take advice and report back to her as appropriate. AUDITOR-GENERAL'S REPORTS Report No. 18 of 2005-06,97
113,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,I present the Auditor General's Audit report No. 18 of 2005-06 entitled Customs compliance assurance strategy for international cargo-Australian Customs Service. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper. NA,97
114,Mr ABBOTT,DOCUMENTS,Documents are tabled as listed in the schedule circulated to honourable members. Details of the documents will be recorded in the Votes and Proceedings and I move: That the House take note of the following documents: Australian Public Service Commission-State of the service-Report for 2004-05. International Labour Organisation-Submission be report on ILO instruments adopted in June 2004. Debate (on motion by Ms Gillard) adjourned. NA Reserve Bank of Australia Board,97
115,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Lilley proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The need for the Treasurer to uphold the highest standards of probity in the selection of candidates for the Reserve Bank Board. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",97
116,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The Treasurer has not upheld the highest standards of probity in appointing members to the Reserve Bank board. The Treasurer has not told the truth in the House today. He has misled the House today,98
117,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The member for Lilley will have to move a substantive motion,98
118,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"No, I said he misled. I did not say he deliberately misled; I said he misled. It was entirely in order, Mr Speaker, because the Treasurer did mislead this House today",98
119,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The member for Lilley said ‘the Treasurer has not upheld the truth'. He either withdraws that or moves a substantive motion.,98
120,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: it is entirely within the standing to say that the Treasurer has misled this House. What is not in order is to say that he deliberately misled this House. And my point today",98
121,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Lilley will be aware that I was asking him to withdraw the previous statement.,98
122,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I never said ‘deliberately', Mr Speaker, but if you think I did I withdraw it.",98
123,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"No: the previous statement. The member for Lilley will withdraw, thank you.",98
124,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I withdraw. The Treasurer of this country did not come into the House and tell the truth today. He asserted that Mr Gerard's tax affairs were in order before he was appointed to the Reserve Bank board. That has been his defence right through this debate and it is simply not the case. Mr Gerard's personal affairs may have been order, but his business tax affairs were not settled until September. Mr Gerard was appointed to the board of the Reserve Bank in March 2003, but the Treasurer cannot admit that because if he did admit that he would have to acknowledge that someone under investigation for tax evasion had been appointed to the Reserve Bank board. And that is his problem. Such a person would never have been appointed to the board of a major bank in this country if they were in a situation similar to Mr Gerard, because he would have failed the fit and proper person test under the Banking Act. He would have been disqualified for board membership. That is the fact. Let me just quote from the RBA code of conduct as it relates to board members. It says: In pursuing the ... legislated goals, members recognise their responsibility for maintaining an unparalleled reputationorders an unparalleled reputationfor integrity and propriety in all respects. Let us go to the Banking Act. Let us look at the fit and proper person test, which says that the relevant APRA criteria would include an assessment of whether the person has (1) been criticised by a regulatory body, (2) been obstructive, misleading or untruthful with a regulatory body, (3) demonstrated a lack of willingness to comply with regulatory requirements or (4) been involved in business practices that appear negligent, deceitful or in other ways improper. He fails all of those tests if you look at the results of the ATO audit team. So we say that this Treasurer has not upheld the highest standards of corporate governance in the appointment of Mr Gerard. In the last 48 hours he has not provided one satisfactory explanation for any of the allegations made against him in this affair. He has sought to cover up his knowledge of Mr Gerard's business dealings to create the impression that his appointment was above board. On AM this morning we got more evasion, but one essential fact remains-one hurdle this Treasurer cannot jump over. He cannot deny, and has not denied, that Mr Gerard said that the Treasurer said to him, ‘I know there is an issue with the tax office but you can go on the board anyway.' You have never denied saying that, Treasurer. The Treasurer has never denied saying that Mr Gerard could go on the board anyway, despite all of the evidence from the ATO audit. So what is the situation we are dealing with here? You can get on the Reserve Bank board through the size of your donation but you cannot have a probity process that applies the highest standards of integrity. In case of Mr Gerard those standards have not been applied. You could see in question time today the embarrassment on the faces of the backbenchers over there, who have all deserted the Treasurer. The Liberal supporters on the back benches are disappearing like an Australian Idol audience-the numbers just get smaller and smaller. Look at them over there. There are two or three supporters of the Treasurer; they would fit into a Tarago van. You can see that your colleagues are cringing, Treasurer. They do not want to know you today. They do not want to go back to their electorates on Thursday night and defend your actions in this affair. Mr Wilkie interjecting",98

Treasurer, there has been no clamour to support you today from the front-bench. There has not been a peep from the member for Bradfield. Did anyone hear what he had to say? There has not been a peep from the member for Warringah. There has not been any support there. There certainly has not been a peep from the member for Mayo, who looked very embarrassed when we were raising questions about his role in the affair. And there certainly has been nothing from the member for Wentworth. So there has been stunning silence from the Liberal Party backbench because they know there is a stench associated with this affair. They want the it to go away and you will not tell the truth. Mr Kelvin Thomson interjecting",99
127,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Wills has already been warned.,99
128,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Australian people always knew there was something sneaky, tricky and arrogant about the Treasurer, and this whole affair simply proves it. What are the facts that we are dealing with? What are the facts of this affair that condemn this Treasurer and prove that he has been misleading the House? The first point is that there has been an argument going on with the tax office for 14 years. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister got up and talked about Mr Gerard as if he had made a mistake in his personal tax pack. They did not talk about the fact that, following the conclusions of the ATO audit, $150 million was at stake in Mr Gerard's negotiations with the tax office. We should remember what the conclusions of the ATO audit were. The audit concluded that either there was a deliberate and knowing intention on the part of Gerard Industries to avoid the payment of tax or there was a flagrant disregard for the operation of taxation law that could not be excused in people of their skill and experience. Does that sound like a recommendation for a member of the Reserve Bank board? It certainly does not. Does that sound like the standard of probity that we expect of members of the Reserve Bank board? Absolutely not. It was simply a no-brainer that he could not be appointed to the Reserve Bank board. We want to know what went on in the Liberal Party backrooms when this appointment was made. We want to know what the conversations were. We do not want the continual misleads that we are receiving in this House. This investigation culminated in an audit by the ATO and court action. So this was not some minor dispute. As the Leader of the Opposition demonstrated at the end of question time, the ATO, through the DPP, had a very substantial claim on the assets of this man-to the tune, I think, of $250 million. That was put in court documents filed by the DPP-and the Treasurer comes into this House today and denies that there were any issues! In fact, he said that these matters were all resolved when Mr Gerard was appointed to the Reserve Bank board in March. But the documentation today proves that these matters were still outstanding months later-and that is despite the fact that were press reports at the time of Mr Gerard's appointment which proved that this was a matter of discussion within business circles in South Australia and, I believe, within the Liberal Party at a wider level. And there were documents in the Supreme Court registry in South Australia for over six months. But we are expected to believe that this Treasurer knew nothing about these things and that it was all okay. The man's personal tax records and affairs were all okay and somehow they are completely distinct from his business life! The company is called Gerard Industries, Mr Treasurer, and for you and the Prime Minister to pretend in this House that there were no issues involving this gentleman sets a new standard in public life. Now we come to the evidence from Mr Gerard. Mr Gerard has said that he rang up the Treasurer and said to the Treasurer, ‘Check me out.' Did the Treasurer check him out? What checks were made after Mr Gerard made that invitation to him, as Mr Gerard says on the public record? Mr Gerard has also said that in a subsequent conversation the Treasurer said that he knew all about this but it did not matter to him. His standards of probity did not matter because no standards of probity applied. What actually happened between when Mr Gerard first spoke to the Treasurer and the subsequent phone call when the Treasurer said, ‘I do not have a problem with your tax issue'? What went on in the Liberal Party? What went on in the smoke-filled rooms during that period to convince the Treasurer that this was all okay? There is a knowing smile on his face. Perhaps he is thinking: ‘The Prime Minister made me do it.' Maybe that is his excuse. Maybe that is an excuse he may choose to use later onthat it really was not his fault that he did not uphold the highest possible standards that we there expect of a Treasurer in this country. Perhaps he did not do it because the Prime Minister did it or perhaps because the Prime Minister got Alex to do it or perhaps because the Prime Minister was speaking to Senator Minchin. There may be a whole set of implications regarding who was involved in this, but we certainly know that this Treasurer did not uphold the highest standards of office that we would expect from a Treasurer of this country for a body as important to us in economics as the High Court is in law. This is a body which has a fundamental impact on the lives of all Australians, a fundamental impact on the interest rates they pay and a fundamental impact on our macro-economic stability. This Treasurer, and indeed this Prime Minister, can be so ruthless with working Australians but so soft on their mates in the Liberal Party, particularly when they have become very large donors-in this case to the tune of $1.1 million. So what I say to the people of Australia, Treasurer, is simply this: this is exhibit the case against you ever leading this country, exhibit A in the case against the Treasurer ever succeeding to the leadership of the Liberal Party. The whole episode is tied up in your ham-fisted and pea-hearted bid for the Lodge, and it should disqualify you from that job. The real import of this scandal is very simple, Mr Treasurer: if you are an ordinary PAYE taxpayer, it is impossible to dodge the highest taxes in the nation's history, but if you are a million dollar donating mate of the Liberal Party you get rewarded for it. You get rewarded for this sort of action: you get elevated to the highest body in the land.",99

132,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The point is this: if you are a million dollar mate of the Liberal Party, you get rewarded for it. He gets a seat on the Reserve Bank board. You can be appointed to the Reserve Bank board with no probity checks whatsoever-and they hang their hat on their financial management credentials! You can see the reputation of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer of this country demeaned when they come into this House and pretend it was okay because there was a letter from the tax commissioner saying his personal affairs were in order, somehow expecting the country to believe that they did not know anything about his business affairs. This is a very sad reflection on the Howard government. The truth is that the whole episode really points to a creeping arrogance in the Howard government and a moral decay at the heart of this government that goes A into its approach in so many other areas: its suppression of the parliament, its use of terrorism to divide the community, its attack on working Australians through its divisive industrial relations legislation-all of these things are on a par with the record of this government. But, Mr Treasurer, no slippery barrister talk is going to get you out of this one-no more evasion, no more distortions or nondenials. We need answers from you, Treasurer, and we are going to hound you for the term of your political life because you are not worthy of the top job in this country and you are most certainly not worthy of the title Treasurer of Australia.

137,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Before I call the Treasurer, I remind the member for Lilley that the chair will not tolerate the use of the word ‘you' spoken across the table in a personal manner.",101
138,Mr COSTELLO,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We just had 15 minutes where the member for Lilley produced no substantive news and where he had trouble seeing out the 15 minutes, which ended up with personal abuse and the suggestion that someone is not fit to be Treasurer of Australia. Can I suggest that it was very clear after the MPI speech who is not fit to be Treasurer of Australia, and that is the member for Lilley. The one thing we did not get in the course of the discussion was an address of the MPI, because the MPI is ‘the need to uphold the highest standards in the selection of candidates for the Reserve Bank board'. Let me make this point: the people who currently sit on the Reserve Bank board are held in the highest esteem by the business community and the general community of Australia-and certainly in much higher esteem than appointees to the Reserve Bank board were held during the period when the Labor government was in office. One of the things that this government has done is to elevate the independence of the Reserve Bank and, if I may say so, it has ensured a wide cross-representation of qualified people to sit on that bank board. One only has to go back to the last Labor government and look at some of the appointees. The member for Lilley would say he is very worried about the probity of Reserve Bank board members. Let me remind the member for Lilley-he did not seem to go back very far-that it was not so long ago that Labor appointees to the Reserve Bank board did jail terms. I am not going to name the member of the Reserve Bank board because his family has probably suffered enough, but there was a member of the Reserve Bank board appointed by the Labor Party who did a jail term. If the member for Lilley comes in here and says that the standards on the Reserve Bank board are slipping, let me say that under the Labor Party we had Sir Peter Abeles sitting on the Reserve Bank board. Under the Labor Party we had Bill Kelty sitting on the Reserve Bank board. What is the gravamen of the charge here? Mr Gerard had been a donor to the Liberal Party. Mr Kelty had been more than a donor to the Labor Party; he had been the financial controller of the Labor Party, funnelling union funds in the tens of millions through to the Australian Labor Party. Mr Gerard is not suitable to go on the Reserve Bank board but Bill Kelty is! Bill Kelty is the financial controller of the Australian Labor Party with a 60 per cent interest, because the trade unions own 60 per cent of the votes of the Australian Labor Party. So their major shareholder and major financial controller sat on the Reserve Bank board. Did the member for Lilley deal with that? No. Did he deal with Sir Peter Abeles? No. Did he deal with Bob Hawke? Was Bob Hawke a political neutral? Bob Hawke was on the Reserve Bank board before he went on the wagon. He was sitting on the Reserve Bank board as a member. As the President of the ACTU-apparently that was no conflict of interest-he was sitting on the Reserve Bank board. And the Australian Labor Party would have you believe that they are worried about the prestige of the board. Let me tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, the prestige of the Reserve Bank board is higher than it has been for decades, possibly ever. We did have a bit of a blast from the past today when I was asked on the AM program about comments from a certain former Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Bernie Fraser. Without going through Mr Bernie Fraser in detail, I will remind the House that during the term of Reserve Bank Governor FraserMr Swan interjecting",102
139,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Lilley will be warned if he is not careful.,103
140,Mr COSTELLO,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"the Treasurer of Australia, one PJ Keating, said publicly that he had the Reserve Bank in his pocket. There is no more damaging statement that has ever been made about the Reserve Bank than when the Treasurer of the day said that he had the Reserve Bank in his pocket. What he was essentially saying was that the Reserve Bank was not independent, that it did not have independence, and that it was the Treasurer of the day who was calling the decisions of the Reserve Bank. That comment haunted Australia for years. It haunted Australia and the financial markets because it was always believed that when Mr Keating made that comment he was making it about the bank and about the governor of the bank, Mr Bernie Fraser, who had been a former Treasury secretary. This is the government that pulled the Reserve Bank's independence up with an agreement between the Treasurer and the governor which enacted its independence and gave it a new standard of independence that the Reserve Bank board had never had before. When we actually did that in 1996, what was the position of the Australian Labor Party? They opposed it. The Australian Labor Party claimed that the agreement between the Treasurer and the Governor of the Reserve Bank to enhance and recognise its independence was illegal. The then shadow Treasurer, Gareth Evans, said he would be taking legal action on behalf of the Australian Labor Party to strike down an agreement which gave the bank its independence. That is how much the Australian Labor Party cared about the independence of the Reserve Bank. Not only did we enshrine its independence, not only did we make sure that no person could say or claim that the bank was in the pocket of the government of the day, but also we appointed people to the bank board who had wide experience in business and industry-and Mr Gerard is one of those people. Let me tell you why Mr Gerard is on the Reserve Bank board. He is a major manufacturer in Australia, probably one of the largest manufacturers in Australia with 3,300 employees and with the Clipsal brand, which not only has been a household name here-literally a household product here in Australia-but has gone right up through Asia. So, if you want somebody on the Reserve Bank board who can give business experience about manufacturing and about the state of housing construction-what is needed in relation to housing markets, manufacturing markets and manufacturing- Mr Gerard is highly qualified. The opposition would now say he never should have been appointed because everybody knew he was contesting a tax assessment. Everybody knew. The Australian Labor Party can come back into this parliament and they can give all of the statements where they stated they knew and where they opposed it. I have been looking through all of their web sites and there was not a mention from the Australian Labor Party at the time of Mr Gerard's appointment that he had a tax objection on foot, nor was there a mention that it is improper to have a tax objection and nor did they say he was disqualified from going on the bank board as a consequence of that. All of this objection to Mr Gerard relates to the fact that he supported the Liberal Party and, as of yesterday, the Australian Labor Party decided they would find a few bullets and they would try and fire them off. After 10 questions today what did they actually establish? Their big question of the day was: what happened to this letter to the Attorney General about the tax affairs of Gerard Industries? As the Attorney-General said, what happened to it was that it was never written. There was no letter to the Attorney-General, let alone a letter passed from the Attorney General to the Treasurer. They did not even have a question for the Attorney-General about that after that little attack fell flat on face. The member for Lilley then says that there are no probity checks in relation to Mr Gerard. The probity checks on Mr Gerard are the probity checks that are made on every other director of the Reserve Bank board and, as far as I know, in relation to taxation affairs, they are the same probity checks that were undertaken by the Australian Labor Party during its 13-year term of office from 1983 to 1996. They are the same probity checks that are undertaken, I believe, on judges. They are the same probity checks which are taken in relation to all Commonwealth appointees. That is, if a person is qualified for a Commonwealth appointment by reason of their experience, their ability, their training and their qualifications, the last thing that they are asked to do in the process is to sign a statement as to their tax affairs in a standard form-a form that was used under the Australian Labor Party, a form that was used for every other member of the Reserve Bank board and a form that I believe is used in relation to Federal Court and High Court judges. They are asked about their taxation affairs. Mr Gerard gave that statement and, what is more, the Commissioner of Taxation had written him a letter which also indicated that there were no outstanding disputes. The taxation commissioner could have come back and said, ‘I've got objections to this, this or this.' Did he? No, of course he did not. The taxation commissioner could have said, ‘I am not satisfied as to his taxation affairs.' But he did not. The taxation commissioner came back and said, ‘There are no disputes with Mr Gerard.' So Mr Gerard is given the undertaking which every person, including judges, the ACCC chairman and the ASIC chairman, can get. The Commissioner of Taxation said that he had no disputes. Mr Gerard was eminently qualified. He has sat its on the board for 2½ years. Is there one incident in which he has failed to properly discharge his duty? No. Is there any complaint about the way in which Mr Gerard has exercised his powers as a member of the Reserve Bank board? No. There is nothing. In fact, the member for Lilley said earlier, ‘Interest rates are set by the Reserve Bank board, and he's on it.' I would think most Australians would be pretty happy with the way interest rates have been set in the last two years. I can tell you this: as I walk down the streets of Australia and talk to people about interest rates, they do complain about some people and their record, but they do not complain about Mr Gerard. The people they  Australian Labor Party. They remember them very well. I have never had a house buyer who has said to me, ‘I'm unhappy with interest rates, and Mr Rob Gerard has not adequately discharged his duty on the Reserve Bank board.' I have never had a house buyer say that. Then the member for Lilley said: ‘House buyers are worried. The fate of their mortgage rests on this man on the Reserve Bank board.' Funnily, I have never had anybody in Australia say, ‘I'm worried about my mortgage because Mr Gerard is on the Reserve Bank board.' The Australian Labor Party could have mentioned in relation to the discharge of his duties some action in the last 2½ years which proved that he was not fit to be a board member. They cannot. They have no objection to the discharge of his duty. Even the Leader of the Opposition in question time yesterday said: ‘We're not asking questions that go to his fitness. We're not asking questions which go to whether he is fit and proper.' By Lateline last night, they were asking questions. This morning, when they were asked, ‘Should Mr Gerard be sacked from the board?' the answer was no. They are not asking that he be sacked. They were not questioning his fitness yesterday afternoon, although they were on Lateline last night, and this morning they are not questioning his eligibility. So where does this leave it? The Australian Labor Party are not questioning his eligibility. They do not say that he should be sacked or that there are grounds for sacking him from the Reserve Bank board. So where does that leave it? It leaves it here. The Australian Labor Party will, if they can, smear someone in public life if they think there is political advantage in it. They could not care less. They will, if they can, smear someone in public life if they believe that there is advantage in it. Mr Swan-You know all about that.",103
141,Mr COSTELLO,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Lilley interjects: he would know. Unlike him, I have not been the subject of a royal commission.

I ask that it be withdrawn. It is not true.",105

He is not able to defend the indefensible. We saw the Treasurer do it yesterday, and he has done it again today. He is under attack, and he resorts to an attack on the opposition-a scurrilous attack on the member for Lilley. We have seen the Treasurer and the Prime Minister valiantly try to characterise Mr Gerard's difficulties with the Australian Taxation Office as a simple disagreement, as some trifling argument over deductions. The Prime Minister said yesterday: ... it is often the case that people have differences of opinion with the Australian tax office. Taxpayers have a right to have a difference of opinion with the Australian tax office; there is nothing particularly revolutionary about that.

152,Mr BOWEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Prime Minister says this like we are talking about some disagreement over whether Mr Gerard was entitled to claim a tax deduction for his dry-cleaning. The context that he tries to put it in is that this is some sort of trifling dispute between an honest citizen and the Australian Taxation Office. The Treasurer has just tried this fallacious argument again today, but of course this is a blatant misrepresentation. Mr Brough interjecting",106
153,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The Minister for Revenue might wish to contribute to this debate later.,106
154,Mr BOWEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Gerard was required to pay to the tax office $150 million. But this was not back tax; $36 million of this was tax penalties. The Australian Taxation Office audit team demanded that the maximum penalty be imposed. This was not simply a disagreement. Mr Gerard did not simply say, ‘We don't agree with the tax bill we've got, but we'll pay it.' A penalty of $36 million was imposed. For the layman in the street there is another word for a tax penalty, and that is a fine. He had to pay a fine of $36 million for tax evasion. We are not talking about tax avoidance. We are not talking about a lawful way of reducing your tax bill. We are talking about tax evasion. The Taxation Office alleged that this tax evasion occurred over a period of 12 years. This was not a slip-up or an accounting error; this was 12 years of tax evasion. The tax office made the case that Gerard Industries set up a company and deliberately made it look like it was part of another group of companies. The ATO also argued that Mr Gerard made false and misleading statements during an investigation and did not provide ‘a reasonable level of cooperation'. Yet with all the eminently qualified industrialists in this land, with all the heads of industry with impeccable credentials-none of which would have been questioned by the Labor Party-and with all the economic experts available for appointment to the Reserve Bank board, the Treasurer thought Mr Gerard was the best Australian that he could appoint. There is evidence that there was plenty of information available at the time to suggest Mr Gerard was not an appropriate appointment to the Reserve Bank board. It is not the case that the Treasurer appointed Mr Gerard and then later an issue arose. Mr Costello could then have come into the House and said: ‘I trusted Mr Gerard, I thought he was the best appointment, but he let me down. I made a mistake and I am sorry I appointed him.' A reasonable observer would say that was fair enough. But the Treasurer cannot say that because Mr Gerard says he knew. And if the Treasurer did not know, he should have, because there was plenty of information on the public record at the time. There was plenty of information on the record of the Supreme Court of South Australia for the alarm bells to ring in a very serious way. At every level this is a scandal of the highest proportion. The Treasurer was quick to point out yesterday, and he did it again today, that this was a cabinet decision. ‘It's not all my fault,' he said, ‘the whole cabinet is responsible.' We have seen some ducking and shoving from cabinet members. Yesterday in the Australian Financial Review a senior unnamed cabinet member was quoted as saying that Mr Gerard's tax record was not discussed around the cabinet table and that the Treasurer did not reveal it. Mr Costello had an obligation to say to his cabinet colleagues, ‘This is the man I want to appoint to the Reserve Bank board. He's in a major tax evasion case with the Australian tax office, which answers to me as Treasurer as well, but I want to appoint him anyway.' The cabinet could then have made an informed decision. But, judging by the statements made by the senior unnamed cabinet minister yesterday, that is not what occurred. Some ministers would have known about the tax evasion problem, particularly ministers from South Australia, I would presume, but others would not. What about the Treasurer's other line of defence? He brandishes a letter. He says, ‘This letter vindicates my position-this is my defence.' But the letter was signed by none other than Mr Gerard. It is a letter of self-defence. This is the weakest line of defence that has been used in this House since Doc Evatt stood up 50 years ago and said, ‘There are no Russian spies in Australia because the Russians told me there aren't.' The Treasurer has adopted the Molotov defence. Mr Gerard said there was nothing in his tax record to embarrass the government. I think he got that wrong. Next the Treasurer relied on a letter from the Commissioner of Taxation. He brandishes this as exhibit B in his defence. He says the tax commissioner signed off that there was nothing wrong with Mr Gerard's tax records. But, of course, there was a very important caveat in that letter: it said that the tax office had no dispute with Mr Gerard's personal tax record. It did not indicate anything about Gerard Industries, in which Mr Gerard happens to be a 50 per cent shareholder. These defences are convenient for the Treasurer, but they are fallacious. All government appointments are important and should be handled with great care. But the board of the Reserve Bank of Australia is a particularly important appointment. The Reserve Bank of Australia does not just set interest rates, as important as that task is-that is its highest profile role. The Reserve Bank has several other responsibilities. It is responsible for maintaining financial stability. It is also the banker to the government and conducts foreign exchange on behalf of the government. The term ‘bank' in its title is not symbolic; it is called the Reserve Bank because it is a bank. I have stood in the foreign exchange room of the Reserve Bank with the Governor of the Reserve Bank and with other members of this House, including members opposite, and watched the foreign exchange being conducted. The Governor of the Reserve Bank regularly makes the point that the Reserve Bank is, in some ways, just another bank. If it were just another bank, then there would be certain rules as to who could be appointed to its board. There would have had to have been an assessment as to whether the applicant to the board had (1) been criticised by any regulatory body, (2) been obstructive, misleading or untruthful with any regulatory body or (3) demonstrated a lack of willingness to comply with regulatory requirements. If any one of these requirements had been enforced, then Mr Gerard could not have been appointed. Of course, these requirements do not apply to the Reserve Bank; it operates under its own act of parliament. But wouldn't you have thought that the Treasurer of this nation would want at least the same level of integrity in the appointment of board members to the Reserve Bank as would apply to any other bank in this nation from the smallest to the largest? Wouldn't you have thought that that would be at least the minimum requirement of the Treasurer? You would think so, but apparently this is not the case. The Treasurer thought it was more important to appoint a Liberal Party mate-a long term member of the party and one of its major donors. Heather Ridout belled the cat on this issue yesterday in the Financial Review when she indicated that Mr Gerard is close to the Prime Minister. This is a Prime Minister who boasted about higher moral standards in government when he came to office. We saw how long that lasted. The Treasurer says, and it is true, that it not a disqualification for appointment to government boards to be close to certain government figures. It is quite true that donating money to the Liberal Party is not a disqualification from serving on government boards. The Labor Party are not making that charge and never have, but we do say that people appointed to senior government roles should be of the highest integrity. Donating $1 million to the Liberal Party should not be enough to buy you a seat on the board of the Reserve Bank of Australia. The people of Australia deserve better than this lack of integrity from the Treasurer, the Prime Minister and the most senior levels of this government. They deserve transparency and honesty. They deserve integrity. This scandal makes it clear that they will not get it from this government or this Treasurer. He has appointed a long-term mate of the Liberal Party to the board of the Reserve Bank, and he should hang his head in shame. (Time expired)",106
155,Mr BROUGH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Longman-Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer) (3.44 pm)-This MPI today is about one thing. It is about the fact that the Labor Party members who sit opposite and call themselves an opposition are bereft of policy, bereft of direction and bereft of leadership. Look at their so-called leader who sits here at question time pulling faces across the chamber like a schoolchild-the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Brand. There is no excuse for this opposition who are trying to be relevant in the important economy that we have today. That is just plainly pathetic, as is the attack that we have seen on Mr Gerard. We all know that the Labor Party have been told that they have to muscle up. No doubt they have done new focus tests which have said the member for Brand, the Leader of the Opposition, is a bit too soft and fuzzy. is So his way of muscling up is not to get into policy debate with the Treasurer, the Prime Minister or any of the other members of the Howard government but simply to get down into the gutter and to start throwing insults at both public and private individuals to deflect the criticism that is rightly coming the opposition's way because they have not spent any time as an opposition over nearly 10 years on developing policies that can benefit Australia. They are great at knocking thingsabsolutely first rate. They know only too well how to be negative but they do not know how to construct positive policies. So what do they do? They muscle up with personal attacks on individuals that cannot be sustained and they use coward's castle in order to do it. And we have seen nothing more disgraceful than the behaviour of the two speakers from the Labor Party that have just led this attack, not using the rule of law, where in this country an individual is actually innocent until proven guilty, but making wild allegations that cannot be founded in any way, shape or form about reputable Australians. We saw on Monday how their tactics in this place went wildly astray. When the member for Perth made the huge tactical error of defying the rule of the Speaker on three separate occasions, ‘ Mr Muscle Man', the member for Brand, decided he would muscle up and take on the Speaker, because he cannot take on the Treasurer. We do not get any economic questions to the Treasurer and we do not get any questions to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations on industrial relations, so what do we get? We get an attack on the Speaker to waste the time of the parliament and we do not get questions on what is potentially and arguably one of the most important passages of time in this parliament in the time since Federation. Here we have industrial relations and monumentally important legislation before the parliament-Monday an attempted question, Tuesday zero, Wednesday zero. In fact, the only time industrial relations was mentioned by anyone of any substance on the other side was in the last two minutes of the contribution from the member for Lilley when he was making the MPI and that was as a passing reference-nothing of any substance, yet they are out there shoulder to shoulder with the union movement telling us this is going to destroy Australians' way of life. What a load of rubbish! If there is so little to discuss of national or international significance in this place, maybe that is the reason they have decided to attack Mr Gerard. We have had questions today from this side of the House on significant issues such as exports, industrial relations, Iraq and Australian economy. The Treasurer took a question today on something that does involve interest rates and the Reserve Bank of Australia and is of interest to every Australian who has any interest at omy of this country-our credit rating. Australia's having a triple A credit rating means that we are all-businesses, individuals and the nation as a whole-paying less for the loans that we take out, no matter what they are. So you have to go to the motivation. What is motivating the Labor Party? The fact is they have no real policy position on industrial relations other than to oppose it; they have no real position on Welfare to Work other than to oppose it; and then we have counter-terrorism. Here are three extraordinarily significant and important pieces of legislation before the Australian parliament. In question time today, what of the opportunity that democracy allows the opposition to ask questions of the pertinent ministers? There was not one utterance from any of them on these issues of significance. So let us go to the MPI today. The Treasurer put it very succinctly: we heard nothing from the two Labor Party speakers on the MPI today that actually went to the core of it. The core of this was ‘to uphold the highest standards of probity in the selection of candidates for the Reserve Bank'. Let us look at the one person they are interested in here and at this individual's history to see whether or not he is suitable to be on the board of the Reserve Bank- Mr Robert Geoffrey Gerard AO. This is the individual we are referring to, a person who has been in public life, who has been scrutinised and whose life has been open for people to see for a very long time in South Australia and in Australia generally. This is a little bit about the person that they stand here and denigrate today, saying that he is a tax cheat in coward's castle when there has been nothing about him in a court the of law anywhere. Nowhere has this been even suggested by the Australian Taxation Office; never has it been brought up in a court of law. It has been suggested only by those who sit opposite, because they are beall in the econ- reft of policy. This is the individual who gives his time to the Reserve Bank. He is currently the Chairman and Managing Director of the Gerard Corporation Pty Ltd group of companies. He holds the following positions. He is a board member of the Reserve Bank. He is Chairman of the Australian Made Campaign. He is a councillor of the Australian Business Arts Foundation. He is a councillor of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. He is a director of Order of Australia Association Foundation Ltd. He is a trustee of South Australian Business Vision 2010and it goes on. He is the Chairman of the Royal Zoological Society of South Australia. He is heavily involved in the Duke of Edinburgh Award. Is anything getting through to those that sit opposite about the credibility this man, his longevity in public life, the sorts of values that he holds dear and has espoused and what he has performed over a very long time in public life? He is Chairman of the South Australian State Award Committee and is Deputy Chairman of the World Fellowship, Australasian Region. He has also been a major fundraiser for South Australia, for the Olympic fundraising appeal, having raised over $1 million as part of that committee from 1994 to 2000. He was also appointed as an Officer in the General Division of the Order of Australia in the Queen's Birthday honours list in June 1999. He was made honorary consul for Austria in South Australia and the Northern Territory in May 1997. Robert Geoffrey Gerard was recently appointed Master Entrepreneur for the Central Region. In other words, he is a person who drives innovation and understands what it is to be in business. He is the sort of individual who understands what it takes to employ Australians and he has demonstrated that through his actions. In 2000, he was honoured as South Australian of the Year for his contribution as an ambassador for the state. If you are looking for someone qualified to be on the Reserve Bank board, you cannot go past this gentleman. But the only thing we have from the opposition is a smear campaign. They came into this House yesterday grinning from ear to ear because they had a chance to get off the policy hook. They did not have to deal with the issues that the people who sit in the gallery, the people who listen to parliament and the people who will pick up the newspaper tomorrow have to deal with every day-are they going to have a job, are we going to help people on welfare back into work, are we going to protect Australia from terrorism and are we going to liberalise the industrial relations laws? These are the policy issues of of the day and these are the policy issues the Labor Party have elected to move away from because they have no position at all on these issues. The one allegation they make is that Mr Gerard was in dispute with the tax office. As Minister for Revenue, I know only too well how many people there are in this country who disagree with the rulings of the tax office. That is not a crime in this country. There is nothing wrong with that. People have a different perspective and a different view. They get private rulings, they get public rulings and they go to the courts. If they are found guilty in the courts, the book is thrown at them. That is not the case here. What the Labor Party will not admit to-will not acknowledge-is the letter, dated 3 March, from the Commissioner of Taxation, Michael Carmody, which goes to the heart of whether or not Mr Gerard had a conflict with the ATO which would preclude him from being on the RBA board. The letter says: As requested, I am writing to confirm my previous advice that there are no current disputes with the Tax Office in respect of your personal tax affairs. The case against Mr Gerard and the Treasurer is unfounded. (Time expired).",108

173,Ms KING,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for allowing me to continue my comments on the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other the ParMeasures) Bill 2005. The government has again shown its contempt for this parliament and the people we represent by failing to allow proper scrutiny of this bill. The government has limited time for debate. It has allowed the Senate only a cursory inquiry and now it has rushed the bill on for debate, with the ink barely dry on the Senate report. The government has failed to take into account any of the genuine concerns raised in the Senate report-concerns that clearly Parshow that this bill punishes some of the poorest people in this country and makes it harder, not easier, for them to move from welfare to work. This bill is not about welfare to work. The reality is that it is merely about dumping people from one welfare payment to another-a lower payment at that-and making it even harder for people who are already struggling to survive with increasing day to day living costs. These families are already struggling with high petrol prices. Food, utility charges and housing costs are all on the increase. The cost of basic phone services has increased and is set to increase more under a fully privatised Telstra. The government's own policies have seen out-of-pocket health costs skyrocket. By cutting payments-which, effectively, is what this bill does-families will struggle even more. The government has not proved that cutting payments will help these people into work; in fact, of the 60 written submissions and over 60 witnesses heard during the Senate inquiry into the changes, not one provided evidence that linked reduced payments to increased chances of finding a job. Even the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations could not provide evidence of this link. Cutting payments will not make it easier for parents to find part-time employment that fits in with child-care responsibilities, and it will not help a person with a disability to find satisfying or appropriate employment. The government has admitted that 300,000 Australians will be financially worse off under these changes-300,000 Australians will be affected. At best, fewer than half of them will be able to find work and many of those who do find work will actually end up poorer. I cannot support this bill, because the Australians that it targets will not be better off nor will they have a better chance of finding a job. The bill is not about improving the lot of those about to be dumped from parenting payments or those who are unable to claim the disability support pension due to the new eligibility criteria. It is a retrograde step aimed at punishing those who have the responsibility of raising young children, sometimes on their own, and it also punishes those who have the burden of a disability. We all accept that nobody benefits from unemployment and that the best way that we can help people is to get them a job. But, under these changes, many will not benefit from employment either. Sole parents who are pushed onto Newstart when their youngest child turns eight will find it very difficult to their parenting responsibilities with their new responsibility-provided by the Howard government-to find work. Family-friendly work hours are now rare in most workplaces. Finding a job can be difficult, but finding a job that fits in with school hours is a very difficult task indeed. However, when a job has been found, locating child care can be an equally difficult task. Once you have got over these major hurdles-you have found a job, located child care and managed to find a workplace that you can fit around your child-care responsibilities-imagine discovering on pay day that you are in fact worse off with the job than you were on a welfare payment. It is absolutely absurd. According to the modelling completed by NATSEM, the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, a sole parent who has one child and works 15 hours a week-doing the right thing and getting a job-will keep only $81 of their earnings, while the Howard government claws back the other $114. This means that this parent will be $91 a week worse off by working under the proposed arrangements than they would be if they moved into work under the current arrangements. Effectively, they will be working for $3.88 an hour. The government may say that the best assistance you can give people on welfare is a job, but what sort of assistance is it if you are worse off in the job? The last time. I looked, it actually cost people money to look for work, so cutting people's payments to get them into work is really not the most sensible suggestion. Labor proposed ideas such as welfare to work tax bonuses, which would improve the financial reward for those making the transition from welfare to work by increasing the tax free threshold to $10,000 for those earning under $20,000. But what juggle did the government do when Labor made these sensible suggestions? They gave the biggest tax savings to those who were earning the most rather than assisting those who were earning the least. Not only will everyday Australians be worse off under this bill but also the number of people reliant on Centrelink payments will not decrease. The government has failed its own test on welfare reform. It says the test of its welfare reform is the reduction of the number of people on welfare payments. This bill fails that test. This bill does not address the growth in the number of people on welfare payments. Moving people from one Centrelink payment to another does not reduce the number of people dependent on their fortnightly Centrelink payment. Labor wants real welfare reform that tackles the reasons why someone is not working and delivers practical solutions. Directing Centrelink to shuffle the deck and to move people from one payment to another-from one database to another-does not reduce the numbers who are receiving payments. When Australians are moved to another payment, what support do they get under this bill? This bill lacks any real opportunities for skills acquisition, and it provides little port for those who need it. However, it does provide for punitive breaching of parents and persons with a disability if they fail to follow instructions. Parents will be given a Job Network guarantee which, if it is anything like mutual obligation, will be a one-way street at best. I am sure that this will guarantee parents one thing: if they do not play the game, they will be breached and their payments will be cut or suspended. Catholic Welfare Australia stated in their submission to the Senate inquiry that the proposed breaching regime is unnecessarily harsh and that, if the ultimate objective of the breaching regime is to actively re-engage job seekers, this is counterproductive. This could also mean that job seekers could walk out the front door of the agency that breaches them and in the back door of the same agency to seek emergency relief and material support. The ability of parents to return to work is affected by a number of issues, including the ability to access affordable child care and appropriate vocational training. Parents who are returning to work and people with a disability who are seeking employment need further assistance and support, including vocational education and training. Parents who have spent years performing the important role of raising children, at the same time being out of the paid work force, do need training. They need access to quality vocational education that updates skills, builds confidence and improves their employability. Without appropriate training, parents returning to the work force or seeking employment for the first time will be at a great disadvantage as they compete against those with a recent employment history. Parents and people with a disability are currently able to access training with the assistance of the pensioner education supplement. Being dumped onto the dole will mean sup- that they are no longer able to access this payment. The pensioner education supplement is $62.40 per fortnight for full-time study and $31.20 per fortnight for part-time study-study that improves people's confidence, their skills and their employability. Under these reforms, the pensioner education supplement will be gone, and 60,000 parents will have to fight 60,000 mature age unemployed for the few vocational places available-only some 12,300. With many single parents having high school as their highest education level, if they are unable to secure one of these few vocational training places, their ability to be competitive in the labour market will be greatly curtailed. People with a disability also need a great deal of assistance with vocational guidance, identifying suitable employment, vocational trainingall of this-before actually finding an employer who will give them a job. In my own electorate of Ballarat, I have utilised the services of Highlands Personnel, a specialist disability employment agency that assists with the training and placement of job seekers with a disability. I am impressed by the quality of their service and the standard of the young person that I employed for a short period of time in my own office. Highlands Personnel have a large client base of quality job seekers seeking employment. But for many years Highlands Personnel and the CRS struggled with lengthy waiting lists of people with disabilities who were desperate to get work but who were unable to get assistance from the specialist disability employment service because the federal government would not provide enough funding to allow that to happen. Two hundred people were actually on the waiting list of Highlands Personnel at one stage, and the federal government is now telling those 200 people who were desperate to get work and who were on the waiting list for Highlands Personnel: ‘We think you've really been bludging on the disability support pension, and we're going to force you into work.' It is an absolute disgrace. The issue is not just about what has happened in terms of disability employment services or training availability for people with disabilities; the issue is also about incentives available to employers and the willingness of employers to give a person with a disability a fair go. And there is always the issue of the funding to assist with the training of the job seeker and, in some cases, the cost of ongoing support once they have located employment. But again, once a person with a disability secures employment, they will actually be worse off under this bill. Modelling completed again by NATSEM shows that if a person with a disability works 15 hours a week at the minimum wage, they will keep only 25c for every dollar they earn, while the Howard government takes the other 75c-some incentive to work. They would be $122 per week worse off by moving into work under these changes than if they moved into work under the current arrangements. This means that the Howard government is actually asking people with a disability to work for a return of $2.27 per hour. It costs money to gain work, and this bill is forcing people onto a lesser payment which means that they in fact will find it very difficult to afford the costs of finding work. It is bad enough, without considering the limited bargaining power people with a disability will have after the Howard government's extreme industrial relations changes come through this parliament. What position will a person with a disability be in when trying to negotiate wages and conditions with an employer? With jobs being difficult to secure and the proven difficulty disadvantaged Australian job seekers already have finding employment, they are going to be in no position to negotiate with an employer for overtime pay, Christmas and other holidays, leave entitlements and penalty rates, let alone a reasonable wage. As I mentioned earlier, these Welfare to Work changes will force people with a disability and parents to accept ‘suitable' work, and they will suffer penalties if they do not comply. They will not have to accept work if there are special circumstances, but there are too many unanswered questions. What constitutes a ‘suitable' job under this bill? What constitutes a ‘special circumstance' under which to refuse a job? What will happen if a job seeker is ‘breached'? Under the Howard government's extreme industrial relations reforms, ‘suitable employment' could mean just about anything. But we do know that a job seeker will be breached if they do not accept a job that pays below award rates. What position will a person with a disability or a parent returning to the work force be in when trying to negotiate with an employer? A pretty poor one, I would think. We also know that if someone who is successful in finding employment is ‘dismissed for misconduct' they will also be breached. It will be hard to tell if someone has been dismissed for misconduct or unfairly dismissed under the Howard government's extreme industrial relations changes. The Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee Chairman, Liberal senator Gary Humphries, said that the committee was worried that the ‘devil was in the detail'. A lot of the detail of this bill will not be available until the legislation is passed and the bureaucrats of the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations have laid down their guidelines. Rather than shuffling people from one payment to another, what Australians need is real welfare reform. I cannot support this bill, and I certainly hope that the new member for Greenway who, like me, is social work trained, actually understands the impact that this sort of bill going to have on the people that she used to work for. These reforms do not adequately address why someone is not working and do not provide practical solutions to help them find a job. What the government is proposing is not welfare reform. The bill just allows people to be moved from one database to another, without offering anything tangible to assist them to enter the work force. Rather than providing opportunities, it provides hurdles. We should be investing in the skills of welfare recipients, leading to employment. We need to look at skill shortages and provide real training opportunities. I want to briefly mention that I have had a social work student on placement in my office, which is something that I do regularly as a field educator for social workers, and he has been having a really good look at the Work for the Dole program compared to the state government funded Community Jobs Program. He has only been able to have a fairly limited study, and I am going to have a good look at that. It seems unbelievable to me that this government can continue to say that the outcomes in terms of employment and entry into study under the Work for the Dole program are acceptable when you see that, post three months of the Work for the Dole program, the outcome rate in relation to further employment and study is 27 per cent compared to the outcome under the Community Jobs Program, which is a wage training program, of 74 per cent. The Community Jobs Program provides a real labour market training program, yet the government's ideological obsession with blaming the victims of structural unemployment, with bashing ‘dole bludgers'-and I have heard that language used incessantly by the other side-means that it is committed to a labour market program that, yes, provides some great community outcomes for local is communities in terms of the terrific work that Work for the Dole people put in but does not provide for real work and training outcomes. The statistics prove that, and the comments of people who have participated in both the Work for the Dole program and the CJP indicate that as well. I will read some quotes from the people from that program. Under Work for the Dole, one of the people who participated in my social work student study said: Work for the Dole in fact cost me $15 per day on petrol to come into the program. The program actually takes money off you compared to CJP. $12 per hour is better than the unemployment benefits. The CJP program is enabling me to actually get the money in order to fix my car. In terms of employment outcomes, participants said: I wouldn't tell employers if I'd done a Work for the Dole program. Compared to CJP I've had a job interview this week thanks to the CJP program. If I hadn't undertaken CJP I think I would still be unemployed. It's a small study but it's a start. The government should be tackling the real reasons that someone is not working and should be delivering practical solutions to those. People with a disability or parents entering the work force are not held back because they are work-shy or lazy. I am sure that, having done a four-year social work degree, the member for Greenway would understand what the talking-down, blamethe-victim approach means. This blame-thevictim approach does not help people move off welfare payments, does not help build their self-esteem and does not help them get into the work force. People with disabilities are not work-shy or lazy-they desperately want to get into the work force-but the government's big stick approach would make you believe that that is the case. People cannot find employment for a number of reasons: a lack of recent work experience; poor skills; a lack of vocational training; an inability to find child care that is both accessible and affordable; and a lack of employment opportunities in the region they live in. If the government were fair dinkum about welfare reform, it would address these issues. The government would provide employers incentives to encourage them to employ people without a recent employment history or people with a disability. The government would continue to provide the pensioner education supplement to people moving from parenting payments and to those who are not eligible for the DSP under new stringent guidelines. The government would provide adequate funding for skills and vocational training that meets the needs of employers. The government would fund adequate child-care places to meet the needs of parents of school-aged children returning to the work force, and it would improve on its own record in relation to the employment of people with a disability-we would not see a massive drop from 5.6 per cent to 3.8 per cent of Australian government employees with a disability, which has happened under the Howard government. Without a doubt, under the Howard government's Welfare to Work proposal, people are going to be worse off. They will have their payments cut and their compliance requirements increased, the training and education opportunities they need to get work will not be available to the majority, and accessible child care to enable parents of school-age children to work is not readily available. Real welfare reform would provide opportunities, incentives and support, not penalties, punishment and reduced payments. This bill is not real welfare reform. It is a meanspirited attempt by the government to cut the welfare bill and punish sole parents and people with disabilities. It fails to deliver the government's end of the mutual obligation deal by putting in place programs that help people find work, not just churn them through the system. (Time expired)",112
174,Mrs MARKUS,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"I rise to support the government's Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005. This is an issue I feel very strongly about. With 23 years experience working at the grassroots level, I have seen first-hand the impact of people dependent on welfare. I feel that I am uniquely placed within this parliament to speak about the real impact of welfare dependency, particularly when this becomes intergenerational. In contrast to the members opposite, I believe that many people who are dependent on welfare have the capacity to work and that their potential is limited by the current environment. Underpinning this bill is the government's belief that there are Australians receiving welfare payments who can and do want to work. This side of the House firmly believes that there are people receiving welfare payments who have the capacity to work and who should do so; that the best form of family income and security comes from a job rather than welfare; and that services provided to those people who do have an obligation to seek work should focus on getting them into the workplace in a timely manner. There is no doubt that one of the most alienating feelings is a feeling of dependency and as though there is a shortage of pathways and options. For those Australians who have become dependent on welfare and whose skills are outdated or underutilised, there is little doubt that there is a feeling of disconnectedness from society. Intergenerational dependency is a major concern for our community. Far too many children live in families with no experience of participation in the broader social and economic life of their communities and their nation. These children can often grow up feeling as though there is little point in trying to break this cycle. I have spoken with teenagers in my own electorate-people who live in my very suburb-who talk about wanting to become doctors or pilots. A young woman of only 15 talked about wanting to become a policewoman. She said: ... but that will never happen and I guess end up on the dole. This is an attitude that is deeply concerning and should be the concern of all members of this House. I have personally challenged this statement. This young woman, like many other young people across this nation, has the potential and the capacity to achieve her goals and aspirations. On this side of the House we are taking responsibility for ensuring that these young people have every opportunity. There are 700,000 children in Australia who are growing up in households where there is no working adult, and two-thirds of these households are headed by single parents. Let me say that I believe in the potential of these single parents and their children. We believe in them and we place value on them. This is not about punishing them but encouraging them to reach their full potential. There are 2.6 million Australians of working age between the ages of 15 and 64 who receive welfare payments. Of this number, only 15 per cent are required to actively look for work. It is little wonder that many people and their families fall into a cycle of dependency, unable to fully enjoy Australia's prosperity. The number of people receiving welfare assistance from the Australian government has increased significantly over the last decade. Between 1997 and 2004 the disability support pension grew by 26 per cent and the single parenting payment grew by 33 per cent. More concerning, there are now more working age Australians on disability support pension than there are on Newstart allowance. Let me highlight the breakdown of the figures we are seeing. There are 705,000 working age Australians receiving disability support pension. There are 630,000 working age Australians receiving parenting payments. Two hundred and sixty thousand peoI will ple receiving income support are over the age of 50. Five hundred thousand Australians are in receipt of Newstart allowance. The implications are far reaching, with economic and social consequences. The bare economics of the problem show that the level of increase is not sustainable. In the 2004-05 financial year, spending on the disability support pension alone exceeded more than $10 billion. In the coming financial year, the total welfare budget for Australians will be $60 billion. Although the economics of the problem are concerning, it is critical that we amine the social ramifications. The Smith Family undertook a study into welfare dependency in 2001. The report's author, Ann Harding, of the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, made some important findings. She found that, of the waged households in Australia, only three per cent were in poverty. Compare that to the 31 per cent of households in poverty that rely on welfare. The report clearly demonstrated that a person was more likely to live in poverty if they were unemployed-not in the labour force-and/or dependent totally on income support. The Australian Council of Social Service has agreed with this side of the House's assessment that the best way out of poverty is a job. With jobless poverty comes a real sense of despair and isolation. As a government we have a responsibility to assist people to their full potential and make important contributions to their communities. For many people on income support, work is something they have the capacity and the desire to engage in. A job really does provide the best route out of poverty. This side of the House is committed to finding real solutions and outcomes for people on income support. We recognise that, with an ageing population and an increase in the number of welfare recipients, Australia faces new and unique challenges. Let me highlight an example of a single parent in my electorate. She lives in Toongabbie and has five children. As a young woman, her youngest child was diagnosed with a brain tumour. This left that young child with severe disabilities, but this young woman was determined to provide a future for her children. She engaged in training when her youngest child was able to attend school. She was then able to obtain a job. She saved enough to find a deposit for a also exhome. She now lives in her own home-a single parent. Her children will not grow up in poverty. Unfortunately on the other side of the House there has been a policy vacuum. Rather than try to debate sensible policy options for Australians-real solutions-the Australian Labor Party has come here with the obstructionist tactics that we have all come to expect. The people of Australia deserve better. They deserve a government that is committed to providing opportunities for all Australians and that is planning for their future. It is about placing value on them and their future. We have for a long time been of the view that participation in the workplace provides people with psychological and social benefits, and this is borne out in the findings of research being conducted by the Australian Institute of Family Studies. Their reach findings demonstrate the impact clearly. Seventy per cent of parents agreed that work made them feel more confident; 84 per cent of parents considered that their working had a positive effect on their children. Consider also that 70 per cent of the jobless customers at Centrelink who responded to a survey by the Social Research Centre said they would prefer to be in paid work. I would like to echo this finding with something from my own experience. A young man who was unemployed and had a history of being in prison came to me after the birth of his first child-at that time. I was working in emergency support. These were his words: ‘I want to find a job so that I can pay for my daughter to experience ballet classes.' This young man had a terrible background, but he had a future and a dream and a desire for a future for his children. Some of the most compelling findings come from the Australian Unity Wellbeing Index 2005. That study shows that sole parents demonstrate the lowest levels of overall personal well-being, putting them at high risk of mental health disorders. There is little prise in the fact that increases in income relate with increases in well-being across the index. ACOSS itself has acknowledged the impact of long-term joblessness. Their Welfare reform: participation or punishment? paper demonstrates that people receiving the parenting payment are three times as likely as people in employment to suffer from depression or anxiety disorders. ACOSS figures estimate that 50 per cent of sole parents suffer from poor mental health. There are clear signs that we need to re-engage people into the work force. There are clear signs that we need to provide assistance for Australians to reconnect. Australia is a country that is prosperous and generous. It is a nation that provides a wealth of opportunity for people. Australian governments have recognised that there are people who require assistance. We have one of the most generous social support systems in the world. Our system has been developed with an eye to supporting those people who do not have the capacity to work, but we must focus on helping those who can and want to work to make the transition to the work force, while providing support to overcome any potential barriers to employment. This is about recognising the value and potential of all Australians. In particular bill looks to make changes to the arrangements for those on the disability support pension-DSP-and on parenting payment. It is important that we look at these two categories, given their incredible rate of growth over recent years. It is also important to highlight that people receiving DSP and parenting payments remain on those income supports for a very long time. The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations estimates that the average duration of receipt of the DSP is eight years. The department also calculates that over 80 per cent of sole parents receive income support. What surthe department is finding is that, on average, cor- a sole parent remains on income support for more than 12 years during their working age life. What are the consequences of such extended periods of reliance upon income support? The longer you are out of the workplace the harder it is to get back in. Not only do your skills need updating but your social interactions change, making re-entry to the work force that much more challenging. For single parents, being out of the workplace for extended periods of time raises significant problems when the child reaches an age of independence, and re-entry into the workplace becomes daunting and difficult. While the Australian welfare system was designed when full-time work was the norm and female work force participation was definitely the exception rather than the rule, things have changed significantly. Thankfully, there are a great number of women active in the workplace. Employment is not now restricted to only full-time options. These changes mean that our welfare system can provide a great many more opportunities to assist Australians to make the transition from welfare dependency to work. The Australian Labor Party have tried to argue that this government is making onerthis ous demands on single parents and DSP recipients, so I think it is critical to highlight the following. Firstly, the majority of recipients want to work and want the skills to be able to work. The requirements that recipients of parenting payments are now subject to are far from onerous. Currently, recipients are required to attend an annual interview with a Centrelink personal adviser if their youngest child is between the ages of six and 12. Recipients whose youngest child falls between the ages of 13 and 15 are required to participate in 150 hours of approved activities that are not work focused over a sixmonth period. We know that, by international standards, this is far from tough. Danish single parents in receipt of income support have no special treatment or assistance when it comes to looking for work. They are entitled to one year's leave and are then required to seek work on their own. In Austria, Germany, France, Italy, Norway and Switzerland single parents must look for employment when their youngest child turns three. The provisions in this bill, which require a greater level of participation in the work force, have a series of benefits. Firstly, let be clear: by no means is the government requiring single parents to go unsupported into the work force. The two-year training provision provides assistance for parents to reskill and reconnect. It boosts the chances of finding income from work and increases the selfesteem of parents. Being a single parent is a tough job. In my later teens I was a child of a single parent. It is even tougher to find yourself in a situation where the children have grown up and you have few skills to fall back on. We want to break the cycle and set up Australians for success by empowering them, but it is important that the right balance is struck between assistance, incentive and obligation. The change to principal carer payments requiring engagement in part-time work force participation of 15 hours per week reflects that the capacity of these carers to work is not at a full-time level, given their parenting responsibilities. Given the rise in part-time job creation, this requirement provides single parents with a great deal of opportunity. This demonstrates that the government is providing an opportunity for them to supplement their income through work, while not being deprived of government assistance. Single parents will have full access to employment assistance. This means that a new employment service, Employment Preparation, will be established to help parents, carers and mature age people returning to the work force. I have long been an advocate of providing suitable service delivery during this transition. I hold the belief that it is important to reconnect people with the work force and that this requires the highest level service delivery, coupled with assistance. I am pleased to see that this focus is shared by my colleagues on this side of the House. Employment Preparation will provide specific assistance to individuals which is us tailored to their own circumstance. This may involve career counselling, short courses for updating skills, addressing self-esteem issues or assistance with outside of school hours care and its associated practicalities. I am even more pleased to see that this program will be uncapped for those single parents who are receiving income support. There are a great many safeguards in place to ensure that sole parents have exemptions where necessary and that they be required only to look for suitable work, not work that is detrimental to the care of their children. These are the initiatives that this government recognises as being important to helping people make the transition to the work force with dignity and preparedness. I wish to turn my focus to the disability support pension. The disability support pension has grown rapidly over the past several years. With nearly 700,000 recipients, these changes are sensible and fair. Those people who were receiving the DSP as at 10 May 2005 will remain eligible for that payment under the current conditions and will not be required to participate in the work force. Those who claim the support between 11 May 2005 and 30 June 2006 will be assessed under the current eligibility criteria. They will be periodically reassessed. Those with a work capacity of under 15 hours per week will not be required to seek employment. Those with a capacity to work over 15 hours per week will be assessed for an alternative payment, such as Newstart or Youth Allowance, and will have a participation requirement. From I July 2006, new DSP claimants will undertake a work capacity assessment. Again, those with a capacity of fewer than 15 hours per week will remain on the DSP and will not have any work requirements. Those who can work for 15 hours or more independently of support, with up to two years of assistance, will be assessed for an alternative payment and have a part-time participation requirement. Let us just clarify what that means: it means 30 hours per fortnight of paid work or part-time work searching or participation in employment services or a mutual obligation activity. This does not lock an individual into any one option, but it does provide them with a choice. I also want to highlight the fact that a safeguard will exist within the new arrangements. Should a person be unable to maintain their employment, they will be able to return to DSP within a two-year period. The focus here is on work capacity. I want to highlight the privilege I have of supporting an organisation called Ability Options in my own electorate. Let me highlight first that their focus is on ability, not disability. On many occasions when I have met participants who are working in open employment, they tell me they are all enjoying work and all its benefits and, let me tell you, they are some of the best workers that any employer could ever have. Families want to provide a platform for their children that is positive and encouraging. People want to feel as though their contribution to society is meaningful. Individual and family development is bolstered when there is encouragement and empowerment. We are a government that believe in people and in their capacity to make a contribution and a difference. Above all, we are a government that believe every person and every family in Australia deserves a framework which helps them to achieve this. It is a pleasure to support this bill.",117
175,Ms VAMVAKINOU,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"I rise today to join other colleagues on this side of the House in opposing the government's Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005. Yet again, this is another bill which exposes just how extreme and incompetent the Howard government is in its handling of the most vulnerable of Australians-in this case, sole parents and people with disabilities. The nature of this bill is to change the eligibility for parenting payment and the disability support pension to make it harder for recipients to access these benefits in the future. The result will be that future would be recipients will be put onto Newstart allowance instead, which provides a lower payment and carries more punishing, effective marginal tax rates as well as prescribing a whole new array of obligations that must be met in order for the benefits to be received. This is the government's much trumpeted Welfare to Work package, which is supposed to give people an opportunity to better themselves and improve the living standards of themselves and those of their families. The member for Greenway spoke before me, and I have no doubt about the sincerity of her commitment to seeing sole parents and people with disabilities enter the work force and better their own lives and those of their families. However, this Welfare to Work package does not help them, and that is the reality. It does not achieve the sorts of things that the member for Greenway hopes and aspires for her constituents. This is supposed to be the legislation that gives people a hand up off welfare and into work. But a thorough analysis of the package and its ramifications, conducted by a number of key stakeholders-as well as the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry which concluded recently and reported the other day to the parliament-has exposed weaknesses and flaws in the government's package which will result in people actually being worse off under the new regime both from a financial and social point of view. And, far from assisting people to move from welfare to work, this legislation creates massive disincentives and setbacks for individuals and their families. In short, the government's Welfare to Work package has been exposed as nothing more than a sham. One of the fundamental weaknesses of this legislation-and there are many-is that it is totally silent on the future of the 1.3 lion Australians who are currently on disability support and parenting payments. This package offers them no assistance whatsoever to get into the work force-as the member for Greenway wants them to do-and improve their lives. They will become the forgotten people, as the government creates a two-tiered system where individuals in identical circumstances will receive different treatment, depending on what day they apply for their benefits. So much for the government's desire to help people get into the work force, and so much for its desire to address the overall skills shortage and projected labour shortage that this country faces, as we move through our ageing population. The changes that the government proposes through this legislation are extreme in many ways. They will cut household budgets for families who can least afford it, they will not necessarily help people find appropriate jobs and they will not provide any incentive for people to work, given that those people who actually find work stand to be worse off. We in the Labor Party support helping people get employment, despite what has been said by members opposite. We support helping people get into the work force. We know-we do not need to be told-that gaining meaningful employment is good for people's financial situations, as well as providing the opportunity for self-development and improvement of their self-esteem. We also know that, if you are working, you are making a good contribution to your community, you feel good about yourself and you are also contributing to the overall economy. But you do this by creating realistic and meaningful opportunities in order to assist people off welfare and into the work force, rather than-as this legislation does-assisting them off welfare and into disadvantage. Labor strongly believes that a successful milWelfare to Work strategy, if it is to be effective, must invest in the skilling and training of the one million or so people who are currently on welfare, as well as those who will be required to enter the work force under this legislation. People cannot be expected to get jobs if they are not skilled accordingly. For example, the government should adopt one of Labor's proposals to offer a training bonus as a practical solution to moving people from welfare to work. Our proposal for a training bonus will help cut the costs of study and transport for people wanting to improve their skills in preparation for work. You do not achieve successful reform by dumping people from one welfare payment onto a lower welfare payment, without providing support and real opportunity to improve their skills and qualifications so that they are job ready. The government knows this legislation is flawed. It has already admitted or accepted that well over 200,000 Australians will be financially worse off under these changes, and only about 109,000 of these Australians are expected to find work. Of these, 60,000 are people with disabilities and some 77,000 are single parents. But what is concerning about this figure is that over 77,000 children of sole parent households will face reduced household incomes as a result of the impact of this legislation, yet the government remains unmoved by the hardships which await Australian families under its Welfare Work package. My electorate of Calwell is home to a very large number of welfare recipients, individu- welcoming. as and their families, who no doubt are going to suffer the consequences of these extreme changes. So it was no surprise to me to find out from recent NATSEM research and a recent ACOSS report that my electorate of Calwell will have the largest number of people affected by these changes in Victoria. Some 2,224 of my constituents will actually be worse off because of this legislation. In money terms that means more than 21 per cent of welfare recipients in Calwell are likely to lose between $29 and $164 per week because of these flawed and aggressive changes. On behalf of sole parents and people with disabilities in my electorate, I the government to rethink this Welfare to Work package and to get serious about implementing real welfare reform which addresses the reasons for unemployment and delivers practical solutions through investment in vocational education and training, rather than dumping people from one welfare payment to a lower one which, as we know, will do little more than reduce household budgets and compromise the ability of families to provide for their children. I want to discuss my constituents who are on disability support pension because, as I have said, I have a large number of those people in my electorate. With regard to the disability support changes, we need to start this debate with an understanding that many people with disabilities who can work actually do want to work. I know this for a fact because a large proportion of people with disabilities live in my electorate and I speak to them constantly. I also work closely with organisations charged with helping these people find work. The reality is that people with disabilities struggle to find work, employers generally do not prefer to employ to them and there is ample, documented evidence that proves the workplace reality for people with disabilities is difficult and unFrom July 2006, under this legislation, all people who apply for the disability support pension will be assessed under a new capacity test. If they are deemed to be able to work at least 15 hours per week, then they will be put on Newstart-that is, colloquially, they will be put on the dole. This is a much lower rate than the current DSP rate and these people will be worse off in many ways. My constituents are entitled to believe that the government is not being fair dinkum about helping them improve themselves and their earning capacities; it is simply looking for a cheaper way out of its welfare obligations to urge the most needy and vulnerable Australians. There is a myth put about by many, including the government, that people on disability pensions are malingerers and welfare cheats. It suits the government and all those who are ideologically opposed to the idea of the welfare state to perpetuate this myth because it helps to justify the government's extreme welfare reforms by playing on the misconceptions and prejudices of the broader community. The Treasurer himself conveniently referred to the so-called bad back syndrome in his budget speech earlier this year when he was introducing the Welfare to Work package. This is cleverly crafted language that vilifies people who are unable to defend themselves. As I have discussed before in this place, those on disability support are not malingerers. Most of them are decent people, and the vast majority of those who are able-bodied enough to do so would actually like to work and to achieve the sense of purpose that comes with earning a living, interacting with people and learning and acquiring new skills. The reality is nobody wants to employ them. A sensible welfare to work policy would recognise and address the availability of appropriate jobs and employer attitudes. The government must match its rhetoric with appropriate and adequate programs that will train and support those disabled people seeking to enter the work force and it must also recognise the significant and considerable barriers that often inhibit a return to the work force by people with disabilities. This point was made in the report on increasing work force participation, tabled lier this year by the Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation, which noted that barriers to employment included negative stereotyping of people with disabilities, crimination, inappropriate or inadequate assistance and support, lack of information for employers, poor job design and inflexible working arrangements. The committee's report also noted the evidence submitted by Disability Action Inc. which reaffirms the fact that people with disabilities need adequate support in order to access job training and employment opportunities. Without that support they cannot sustain themselves in the work force. In this legislation the government has not provided any sensible mechanisms to bridge the gap between welfare and work in a sustainable manner. The focus should be on encouraging, through employer incentives and other measures, the employment of people with a disability. It is no good saying that they have to work; you have to encourage the employment sector to employ them. For the sake of those people with disabilities who will be assessed under the new policy when it comes into effect, I ask the government to show that it is, in fact, fair dinkum about helping their transition from welfare to work. I certainly hope, for my constituents' sakes, that this is not just some cynical, cost-saving measure that will leave them and their families financially worse off and without any real prospects of gaining meaningful employment. But unfortunately, on the record of this government, I suspect that is exactly what my constituents are faced with. Constituents in my electorate will also be affected by changes to the parenting payment. The changes to the parenting payment work obligations also provide no real assistance in moving parents from welfare to earwork and will only have detrimental consequences for those single mums or dads who will be forced on to a reduced Newstart payment when their child turns eight years of age. These changes are an attack on some of disthe poorest and most vulnerable people in our community, who are already undertaking the precious task of raising children in very trying circumstances. It is widely acknowledged that single parent families face a much higher risk of poverty than any other group in the community and as such need genuine effectively and practical support. The reduced payments and increased work obligations of the new sole parent payment do nothing to provide the training and other assistance needed to help sole parents back into the work force. It does nothing to improve the job prospects of sole parents, and it does nothing to provide the assistance they need to move from welfare to work. What surprises me about this debate is that it is also premised around another false stereotype: that single parents are bludgers. Single parents work hard raising and caring for their children, often holding down a part-time job and juggling their kids' schooling, sporting and social activities with the responsibility of putting food on the table while struggling week to week to make ends meet. This is a role which does not end at the child's eighth birthday. It goes on far beyond that time, and these parents should be supported and commended for the task they are undertaking, not derided and punished. Recently I met with the Council of Single Mothers and their Children, a community based organisation that provides support, information and aid to single mums. That organisation represents over 1,450 members and 120 organisations. They raised with me their concerns about Welfare to Work and its impact on sole parents. I would like to quote Jane Stanley, one of the representatives of that organisation: At best, the Welfare-to-work legislation does solutely nothing to address the barriers which prevent single mothers from entering the paid workforce. At worse it is an attack on families who are already the poorest and most marginalized in the country. What I and many others want to know is: where in this legislation is the assistance and support to get single parents into the work force, and where are the jobs they are supposed to simply walk into? The reality is that there are not enough jobs, let alone the jobs that offer flexibility allow parents to drop their kids off at school in the morning and be home at night to help them with their homework and other activities. Because, let us face it, that sort of flexiand bility is rare, and in an industrial relations environment which the Howard government has now tipped in favour of the employers, people will be working harder for less money in less family-friendly workplaces and struggling to maintain that very important balance between work and family. With 130,000 unemployed single parents, the unemployment rate for single parents was at 12 per cent in July 2005-more than double the national rate at the time, which was five per cent. Again, where are these jobs that single parents are supposed to go into? In my electorate of Calwell, unemployment has jumped from 6.6 per cent to 8.8 per cent over the past 12 months, so not only are there not enough jobs but there is concern about how an already struggling Job Network will cope with a dramatic increase to its caseload. Labour market assistance outcomes, a report by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, illustrates this point, with only 11 per cent of single parents receiving customised assistance from Job Network in the year ending September 2004 finding full-time employment and only 39 per cent finding a part-time job. So it is pretty clear that these jobs are very few and ab- far between. But even for those sole parents who actually do manage to find jobs, there is an ominous fate awaiting many of them. A letter that was published in the Age on 27 October, entitled ‘Welcome, the servile state', written by Gary Fallon, talks about a Melbourne company that employs process workers. I would like to quote from this letter, because I think it is very telling about the fate of the poorest and most disadvantaged Australians as they enter the work force: The company then intends to replace the preto sent workforce with the same number of casual employees on AWAs and pay the absolute minimum wage that they can get away with, plus the basic statutory ... conditions. The higher pay scales, permanency, penalty rates, shift loadings other benefits now enjoyed by this company's workforce will be converted into profit ... for the owners. The letter also goes on to say that the owner: ... pointed out that in the area near the plant is a large number of households containing single mothers who will be compelled to work under the changes to single-parent mutual obligation rules. Thus, to use his reasoning, the Government's welfare reforms will deliver this company lowcost labour through compulsion. This legislation does nothing more than cut benefits and create an underclass for profitdriven employers like the one described in this letter I have read in the House. This legislation, in addition to leaving sole parent families worse off, will also deny single parents the choice that other partnered parents have: the choice to stay home with their children as they progress through the critical years of schooling. This legislation, coupled with the industrial relations changes, creates an appalling situation in this country where the poorest workers in our society will be forced into exploitation in the workplace. Make no mistake: today in this parliament we are being asked to vote on a bill that creates wage slaves in this country-people who have no choice other than to work or face breaching regimes that could result in eight-week suspensions of payments and little prospect of finding anything but the lowest paid casual work, offering little job security and placing unreasonable pressures and expectations on their households and, in particular, their children. The concerns I have outlined today have also been expressed to me by representatives of many agencies and community groups in my electorate. These groups include Uniting Care, the Salvation Army, the Brotherhood of St Laurence, Distinctive Options, City Mission Disability Services and North West Disability Services. (Time expired)",122
176,Mr CADMAN,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"I lived through a period when I saw tens of thousands of people unemployed in Western Sydney. Nothing is more soul destroying for there families or young people than not having a job. The Australian Labor Party were the government of the day, and the best remedy that Paul Keating, the Treasurer and Prime Minister, could offer at the time to protesters wanting jobs was to say to them, ‘Get a job.' There were no plans that were effective. The economy was in ruins. We have today an Australian Labor Party that would want us to think that they have reformed. I do not know how they can demonstrate that, because they have got to live down those records of the past. The Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005 and cognate bill put into action $3.6 billion of remediation for people who have been out of work long term, who have disabilities or who are single parents. It is a program of support and assistance from which the government does not expect to see any economic benefit for some years. It is a program which seeks to establish a fair regime of compassionate support, training, education and assistance into jobs. Tony Blair has said many times that one of the keys to his success as a Labour Party leader has been to supply jobs. Across Western Sydney at this moment, instead of double-digit unemployment we have unemployment in most electorates of three, four or a maximum of five per cent. People are anxious to work. The prosperity is obvious. People are building homes, they are finding new schools for their children and they are planning their futures. The turnabout-the change in attitude and the dynamics released-since 1991 has been massive. It is very interesting to see the increasing number of electorates that are changing their vote based on the delivery of services, opportunity, and prospect and future offered by the current government. There are three principles that underlie the $3.6 billion program. The first is that people who have the capacity and are able to work should do so. The second is that the best form of family income comes from a job rather than welfare. The third is that services provided to people who have an obligation to seek work should focus on getting them into work as soon as possible. The most significant amendments in this legislation include changing the eligibility criteria and participatelephone tion requirements for Newstart, parenting payments and the disability support pension; making private income taper rates for Newstart more generous; providing greater incentive for people to work and leave the welfare system so that the change from welfare to work is less harsh; and improving the suspension and compliance framework to encourage and reward participants. This is what the legislation does. It is a balance between reward and encouragement. It must have both factors. One of the prizes for people who feel that they do not have a responsibility in society is to go onto a disability pension. That is for life, parked in a slot with no obligations to society and with no obligations on society as regards them. It is too easy. It is ineffective, damaging and destroying. I have a young man in my office who was for many years on a disability pension and he is partly on one at the moment. The change in his character and outlook from being able to have regular work and to study at TAFE is massive. His family cannot believe that he now has so much to offer where previously he had nothing, in the sight of many, to offer to society. I am so proud of his efforts and I am so proud that he has been able to take up the challenge. I believe there are many more like him. A comprehensive work capacity assessment program needs to be established, and that is partly in action at the moment. It makes an assessment of a person's physical or mental capabilities to fulfil a task. The establishment of rapid connect arrangements to more quickly link job seekers to employment services is also part of this legislation. A range of ancillary benefits will be available to a wider group of job seekers, such as the mobility allowance that encourages people and gives them a capacity to travel and look for a job. There is the pensioner concession card, the employment entry payout, the allowance and the work for the dole supplement. All of these are adjuncts to the programs that are going into place. There is encouragement as well as compliance. I think this program is something that many Australians have been looking for but we have not been able to provide for them. There are currently 2.6 million Australians of working age-that is, between the ages of 15 and 65-on income support. That is 2.6 million people, with only 15 per cent required to actively search for work. It is passive welfare. We are providing hammocks, not safety nets, and we need to do better than we are doing. As a nation we are falling down on providing people with opportunities. One only has to look at the change in the way in which benefits have been allocated over the last 12 months. In the 12 months prior to June 2004, 55 per cent of people who transferred to the DSP came from another payment of some sort. Parking somebody on a DSP instead of doing something of benefit to help them is not an outcome that is worthwhile for society. In the seven years prior to June 2004 the DSP grew by 26 per cent and the single pension by 33 per cent. As of June this year, 705,000 working age Australians were receiving disability support pensions and 630,000 Australians of working age were receiving parenting payments. In 2004-05 spending on the disability support pension exceeded $10 billion. So $3.6 billion on top of that to try to resolve some of these problems is a worthy investment. Even if it only returns a little after a fouror five-year effort, it will be an effort worth making. We have the resources to do it. People talk about vesting in infrastructure and that is fine in some ways, but it creates jobs for those who are already employed. Investing in personal infrastructure is what the government is doing with these measures. The Smith Family 2001 report by Ann Harding of NATSEM found that three per cent of waged households were in poverty, compared with 31 per cent of those relying on welfare. Regular and ongoing employment is almost a guarantee against poverty. So it is not the payment of welfare that solves the poverty problem; it is the finding of a job and continuing employment that solves the poverty problem. A study done by one of the archbishops of Sydney found that it was not the amount of resources available to individuals but their incapacity to manage their finances that created poverty. Finding a job is part of that process. The Australian Institute of Family Studies, in a report for the Australian government, showed that parents reported positively on the role of employment in the lives of their families-70 per cent of parents agreed that work made them feel more competent; 84 per cent considered that their working had either a positive or neutral effect on their children. Therefore, the benefits to the whole family are obvious. These are things that we feel but seldom take the time to measure. Some measurement factors that I have quoted today are useful. A University of Canberra NATSEM study by Lloyd, Harding and Payne, Australians in poverty in the 21st century, showed that around 41.1 per cent of unemployed people were considered to be in relative poverty, along with 17.9 per cent of people not in the labour force and 24.3 per cent of people whose main source of income was government cash benefits. Only two per cent of people whose main source of income was in- wages and salaries were considered to be in relative poverty. Those facts back up the whole process. The Australian Labor Party are making some extraordinary claims today. I listened to the member for Ballarat and she seemed to indicate a wish to get back to the 10.8 per cent unemployment we had when Kim Beazley was the employment minister. She indicated that Labor would scrap the work experience programMs King- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member is now impugning another member-unfortunately that member is me. I ask you to call him to order.",127
177,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,SERVICES LEGISLATION,There is no point of order. There are other remedies open to the member for Ballarat.,129
178,Mr CADMAN,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"The member has had a chance to remedy those things. Does she confirm that the Labor Party will scrap Work for the Dole? She deliberately misrepresented the fact that 27 per cent of participants of Work for the Dole were employed three months after completion of a project. That is wrong; the fact is that 41 per cent of participants of Work for the Dole are employed three months after completion of a project-and this figure continues to grow. That 27 per cent is not the figure. I understand that the Labor Party do not like Work for the Dole-they never have and they never will. That is obvious, and there is no substitute in their eyes. This takes the number of times Labor has criticised Work for the Dole-somebody has been counting it, and I think this is fascinating-to 397 since the program began in 1997. It is an excellent program. I have been involved in the hands-on program and its delivery. I suggest that the member for Ballarat get tightly involved with the committees in her area and use a bit of imagination and hands-on administration, and she too could have great results. This is an excellent program. Since 1997, 436,532 young job seekers have been helped by Work for the Dole programs. Let us have a look at some of the other claims made by the Australian Labor Party. They claim that it is better to be on benefits than to work because the government is so lousy with its money. Let us have a look at what they are claiming. I will use some of the figures I have here. Let us compare someone on the minimum wage of $12.75 per hour and someone on the single parent benefit and the Newstart allowance for 15 hours paid work-which is the minimum. The private income of $12.75 per hour will bring in $191.25 a week. Income support brings in $247 per week, but under the Newstart allowance a part benefit of $134.95 is paid. Both the people I am drawing the comparison between would get family tax benefit A and family tax benefit B. Of course the person who has 15 hours work would pay some income tax, but when you look at the total income that they can per week you find that the single parent will gather, just on welfare, $433.13. The person who goes out to work has the benefit of $487.81. That is significantly beneficial. As well as that, there is an accumulation taking place through the employer contribution to their superannuation. They both receive the pensioner card, a telephone allowance and the pharmaceutical allowance. The claim has been made that it is not worth working for that little amount of money. Come and have a talk to the bloke who works in my office. He stopped sitting around and found a future for himself. He has an additional amount of money and pride in his existence through having a job and being able to study at TAFE at the same time. Make the comparison between him and the person who does not do that, if you are prepared to, and still stick to your weak arguments that this program of $3.6 billion will fail! Let us have a look at the difference under these proposals between the weekly disposable income of a person with no children, in receipt of the disability support pension and with no job, and that of the same person on Newstart with a job. Let us say that this person is on $12.75 per hour, the minimum amount. Of course, this person has an opportunity to work more than 15 hours a weekthey are not going to stay on 15 hours a week for life and they are not going to stay on $12.75 an hour for life. They have an opportunity to go above that, as the bloke in my office has. The person on a private income working 15 hours at $12.75 will bring in $191.25 per week. On top of that, the income support, which includes rent assistance, will provide $168. They have to pay tax, of course, and there is a mobility allowance of $50. The person on Newstart gains $296.95 per use week. So what is the difference? It is $296.95 for the person on Newstart compared to $384.89-an increase in benefit of roughly $90 a week. In a year that is a significant difference. They are being supported, they are learning things and they are feeling better about themselves. And, yes, they are getting a superannuation contribution from their boss, the pensioner concession card, the pharmaceutical allowance and the telephone allowance. There is also a chance of earning more than $12.75 an hour or going beyond 15 hours. That is the rockbottom minimum of somebody starting to participate in our system, and that is what the government expects to achieve over four or five years with the expenditure of $3.6 billion. To say that these processes are harsh or that they are designed by people who dislike people with disabilities or who hate single mums is staggering. The claims of the Australian Labor Party that the expenditure of extra resources and the goal of participation and pride in success, both for oneself and one's family, can be presented as harsh and unreasonable defy description. One has to look at some of the claims made by the Australian Labor Party. When Mr Beazley was the Minister for Employment, Education and Training we had a very unsatisfactory situation. I am afraid he did not apply his mind to what was going on in the Australian community and the needs of the Australian community. In too many instances his job creation record was poor. While he was employment minister, there was average unemployment of 10.5 per cent and peak unemployment of 10.9 per cent. This was absolutely devastating to families in Western Sydney. It was much higher than that there, and now we are down to rates of three, four and five per cent. Families are doing things, people are earning and they see a future. The lowest unemployment rate achieved by the Australian Labor Party was 10 per cent, in January 1992. The peak rate of long-term unemployment saw 329,800 people parked on unemployment. The incident rates were 36.2 per cent. That is the proud record of the Australian Labor Party. No wonder they are not believed in the community. NA",129

190,Ms OWENS,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"Parramatta) (5.20 pm)When I listen to the government speakers on the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005 and the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work) Bill 2005, I am amazed that they do not appreciate the deep passion that we on this side of the House have for helping people find work. Anybody who spends time in their own electorate, as I do in mine on a daily basis, would meet people day after day-people with physical or mental disabilities and sole parents-who are desperate to work, who get up every day wondering how they can make that happen. When you look at bills called ‘Welfare to Work', you find yourself having a little bit of hope for a moment that perhaps we are going to be looking at bills that will actually help the many hundreds of thousands of people currently on welfare to find work. I deeply wish that these bills would achieve that, but we on this side of the House do not believe that they will. Of the many people in my electorate who I talk to, some are sole parents without a car who need to find jobs close to the school where they drop their kids. I find sole parents who tell me that they would love to work but that, if they do go back, they will be financially worse off. If they could afford to be financially worse off they would go back to work, but currently they cannot afford to feed their kids, so going back to work and being worse off is not an option. I meet sole parents with 14-year-old boys who are at risk and who are getting into trouble and they are not game to leave them home alone after school. We all know that child-care facilities for 14-year-old boys are very rare in Australia. I met a sole parent with a real dilemma. She had registered for child care when her child was born. The vacancy came up and she was offered it the month before she was due to start work. She could not afford to pay for the child care, so she had to turn the vacancy down. When she was to start the job a month later she did not have a child-care position, so she had to turn the job down. That is a standard dilemma in my electorate-women desperately trying to return to work who cannot do so because of the lack of accessible child care in the area. I meet people with physical disabilities who are dependent on public transport to get to work. I met a woman with a mental illness. As long as she is taking her medication she is perfectly capable of working-she is even quite qualified-but when she does return to work and loses access to the PBS she cannot afford the medication that she needs to keep her well enough to work. I meet mothers who have been out of the work force for several years who are lacking in confidence and with outdated skills who need considerable support in order to get them ready for work, let alone back into the work force. If you dare call a bill ‘Welfare to Work', it really must assist these people, the many hundreds of thousands of people, the 700,000 people currently on the disability support pension and the 600,000 people on sole parent pensions, many of whom want to work. It really must provide the means for those people to return to the work force. But this bill does not provide assistance to these people. Instead, it assumes that they do not want to work and it creates a bigger stick-a bigger stick for them than the one they already have because of their circumstances. And why is this? It is because when the government looks at these people, these hundreds of thousands of people, it does not see essentially good people struggling to make a go of it. It does not realise that any of us could be in those same circumstances, that people do not choose necessarily to be a sole parent. Circumstances outside of their control can bring that on, as they can bring on mental illness and physical injury. Any of us, with the best will in the world, could find ourselves in the same position that many of these people are in. When the government looks at sole parents and people with disabilities it sees bludgers. It sees 700,000 people on the disability support pension who are refusing to work and 600,000 sole parents who are refusing to work. Only if such people were bludgers, only if they were not willing to work, only if they had to be forced to work would this bill actually make a difference. Only if these people were not willing to work would forcing them into it actually do anything at all. But the reality for the majority of these people is that they want to work and the barriers are just too great for them at the moment. What they need is help in reducing those barriers. When this government was first elected back in 1996 I came to the conclusion that it brought out the worse in us-it brought out our greed, our self-interest, our fear of others and our intolerance. It reached down inside us and brought out the worse. And then, after watching the government for a few years, I decided that it actually saw the worse in people. It saw the greed, the self-interest and people trying to rip off others. Since I have been elected to this House I have decided that the government actually governs for the worse elements of us. It looks at those 700,000 people on disability pensions and it believes they are all bludgers. The government has introduced a bill aimed at the very worse elements because there are a small number of people out there who could work and are not. There are a small number of bludgers, but you do not govern for everybody on the basis of the worse behaviour. You do not punish the good in order to force the worse. In fact, it would be good to see this government start with the positive. Why not? Joe Hockey today said that Centrelink had called 300,000 people and 100,000 of those wanted to work. Let us start with those. Why not have welfare to work reform that actually helps the people who want to work? Why not start with the best of us instead of punishing the best of us in order to get at the worse of us? This government does this with all legislation. Whether it is super choice, the tax act or financial regulation, it always assumes that we Australians have to be forced to do the right thing-and the bigger the stick and the tighter the process the better. Whether it is forms that families fill in over their breakfast tables or whatever, it always assumes the worse about us and governs for our worse character. The government in defence of this billand it is really its only defence-says that the best form of welfare is a job. In Australia a job is not a form of welfare. A job is actually a thing of dignity. The current industrial relations legislation, which we assume will be passed in a few days, might change that for many Australians, but in Australia at the moment a job is not welfare; a job is actually a job. The problem with this bill is that it will not assist the good people at all. When unemployment gets as low as it is in Australia, you can assume that people are not working because of the extremely stubborn situations that they are in-not stubborn people but stubborn situations in which people have difficulty getting work, people are not skilled in appropriate areas and people do not live in the areas where the jobs are-and the extremely stubborn structural issues that keep them out of the work force even when they want to work. When you are in that sort of situation you have to assume that all of those issues are different, that one size fits all does not work and that you need sensitive and often long-term solutions almost on a one by one basis. People returning to work after periods of mental illness or injury might, and often do, feel quite fragile. They might have several false starts as they return to the work force. They might move in and out of the work force, and they need to be able to do that. Under this legislation, if a person on the current disability pension or sole parent benefit manages to move back into the work force of their own volition-without additional help from this government, I have to say, they are punished for that attempt. Many will fail the first time or the second time not only because their own bodies and minds might let them down after several months but because they might have a relapse, the stress might get to them or they might actually return to a period of more significant illness. Also, quite often the jobs that they get are not long term-they are not secure or simply might not last long enough. But for these people who do make those tentative steps back into the work force the punishments are quite extreme. I have recently employed two women in my office who have taken time out for children. When those people first return to the work force the time it takes to bring them back up to speed and the patience and support you need to give them is quite extreme. And for many that I meet their confidence level is simply not high enough for them even to apply. Their skills are out of date, their computer technique is no longer up to it, their speeds are down and they are not familiar with the current practices as well. Those people need significant programs to bring them slowly back into the work force. If they return to the work force for a while and then need to drop out to stay at home with their children because their children are having difficulties, because their children are at risk or simply because as a parent they have no alternative for their children during school holidays, they move from the higher sole parent payment down to the parenting dole, the Newstart allowance-a significant drop in support for these people. For many people returning to the work force, there is a need for security. That security net that allows them to make false starts, that allows them to try, is extremely important, and the new system in this bill rips that security away. It removes from people tentatively trying to get back into the work force the opportunity to try a risky venture-to try and move back into the work force when there is an extreme likelihood that they could fail. That is why in Australia we have a long tradition of paying higher amounts for long-term assistance. For many decades, we have paid higher amounts for long-term matters such as disability support, sole parenting and pensions. Short-term assistance like youth allowance and unemployment benefits are usually much less. We recognise that people with long-term conditions and long-term issues that make it difficult for them to work will need to move in and out of the work force perhaps many times because of their circumstances. The government will turn that well and truly on its head in the next few weeks and rip apart what has been an extremely effective support system in Australia for many decades. And why is that? The government has been talking about welfare reform for years. It blames a hostile Senate for the rejection of its 2002 plans to tighten eligibility for the disability support pension. This has been on the government's agenda for many years. In addition to the fundamental unfairness of the proposed legislation, it is worth focusing on the welfare reform tests that the government set for itself. Specifically, the changes were meant to reduce the number of people who are already receiving welfare payments, provide greater incentive for these people to move from welfare to work and simplify the already complex welfare system. By its own test, this bill fails miserably. It will not reduce the number of people who are already receiving welfare payments-in fact, it completely corrals people who are currently on such payments. It leaves them where they are and, one could say, it traps them there. People currently on disability support pensions will stay on the old system as long as they stay on the disability support pension. They might try to move back into the work force, as a friend of mine is trying to do at the moment after several years of therapy and drug treatment. If she moves back into the work force for a significant period and eventually relapses, which even her psychiatrist expects that she will, she will go back the lower payment. I suspect that many people out there will be looking at their options now and thinking, ‘If I take that risk and my circumstances change or if I have a relapse, can I afford to go onto the lower Newstart allowance, the disability dole?' Many of them will decide that the answer is no. Effectively, people currently on the disability port pension are trapped there by this legislation. It is a similar situation for sole parents. Sole parents who form a new relationship or reconcile with their partners, even for 12 weeks, go from the current sole pension onto the new considerably lower one. So, again, we will find sole parents seriously considering whether or not they are prepared to take a risk with a new relationship and risk the financial security for their children. Will the legislation provide greater incentive for these people to move from welfare into work? No. It will not be an incentive for those who are currently on a disability pension or for sole parents. They are better off staying where they are, on the current system. The legislation also removes the pensioner education supplement for new recipients, which means that people do not have the same opportunity to get training and education to move into better quality work. Will it simplify the already complex welfare system? It creates a brand-new, two-tiered system well and truly. It is not only complex but confusing. Despite its so-called commitment to the changes, the government has been prepared to make three separate backdowns, as its own backbench react to community concerns about the harshness of the measures. Full credit to the backbench for doing that, because these are extremely harsh measures even after the proposed changes. The decision to delay taking the pension off a single to mother until their youngest child turns eight rather than six is a concession that confirms that the government's whole approach lacks any coherent logic. The failure of the government in the initial stages of the legislation to consider parents of children with disabilities, foster parents and carers was extraordinary as well. It sup- shows a complete lack of understanding that the vast majority of these people want to work but that sometimes circumstances make it extremely difficult. The so-called welfare reform package is confused. It fails to meet the government's own objectives. It creates severe disincentives for people to move from welfare to work. It is manifestly unfair. It is not reform but punishment in large part of those who are currently on income support and who, because of their circumstances, have found it extremely difficult to move into the work force. Under the government's welfare changes, the income support paid to a single mother with two children will be cut by nearly $1,500 a year as a way of somehow encouraging her to seek work and give up full-time care of her children as young as eight years old. At the same time, the non-working partners of the better-off are eligible to receive up to $3,300 in welfare in return for them not seeking work and, instead, staying at home to care for their children. Under John Howard, if you are the non-working partner in a well-off couple, you should be supported by taxpayers to stay at home. But if a mother finds that, because of her circumstances, difficult finding local work and she prioritises being with her children above their being in constant child care or even leaving them home alone-as I find people who are under difficult circumstances quite often do in my electorate-she is well and truly to be punished. In 2004 a single mother of two received two $600 per child family tax payment supplements-a total of $2,400 in lump sum payments with no questions asked, no mutual obligation and no work test, just a bonus from a government buying votes in an election year. Give them money during an election year and rip it away from them in between. When it comes to the next election, I am sure there will be a few more little lump sums to buy their votes again. Give them money during an election year and rip it away as quickly as possible as soon as you regain power. In 2006 a single mum will have her income slashed by $1,500 per year when her youngest child turns eight. It will not take much to eat up that $2,400 lump sum payment at that rate. That is over $28 a week less to feed her children, even if she meets the government's new work test. Under John Howard, the welfare system has become filled with perverse incentives, poverty traps, disincentives to work and outright inequities. The Howard government's economic and policy credentials in the area of welfare are in tatters with this bill, replaced with pre-election expediency and special deals for politically troublesome demographics. Give them money in an election year and rip it away in between. Will these welfare changes reduce the number of Australians already on welfare? The short answer is: absolutely not. The government's key economic argument in support of its plans is that the changes will provide greater incentive for people to move from welfare to work. This claim has been comit is prehensively rejected through economic analysis by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling-a group the Prime Minister himself describes as ‘respected and independent'. The NATSEM research shows that the two groups most affected by the proposed changes-those on disability support pensions and single parents on parenting payments-are robbed of any incentive to work because of the higher effective marginal tax rates they now confront due to the government's decision to dump them onto the dole. NATSEM found that, as people are pushed from the disability support pension and parenting payment onto Newstart, they not only will suffer a direct cut in benefits of $46 or $29 a week respectively but also will be financially penalised for actually getting a job because of the different income-testing rules for Newstart compared to the pension.

191,Mr ROBB,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"I rise to add my support to the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005. I do so in a very positive and constructive way. This is a very important piece of legislation and I am very proud to be associated with it. At present there are three major challenges driving the focus of government legislation-three challenges confronting Australia. One, of course, is the threat of terrorism, and that is the subject of other legislation. The other two major challenges that we confront as a community, as an economy and as a population are the ageing population and the continuing strong growth of globalisation. Let me briefly look at these two challenges. Regarding the ageing population, we know that studies by conservative groups suggest that within five years we will have at least 195,000 more jobs than we have people to fill them. It is a real issue and a real to our living standards, and we have to respond in a constructive and proactive waynot put our heads in the sand. The other and related issue is that of globalisation, particularly the very strong emergence of China, India and some other countries in the region. It presents enormous opportunities, but it also presents very serious threats if we do not position ourselves as a country, as an economy and as a people to deal with these opportunities and these threats. This legislation also goes to a related challenge. I see the challenge that we face as a country is that more and more Australians are beginning to lose the habit of self reliance. It is a cultural problem that is creeping up on us and it must be addressed. It is, in part, a product of passive welfare. The low participation rate of people of working age in Australia compared with other major OECD countries is a reality. It is something we have to confront, and I suggest that part of the problem is that we as a people are starting to lose the habit of self-reliance. This Welfare to Work legislation is part of a range of legislation designed to address the two challenges of our ageing population and the growth in globalisation. They need to be seen in the context of a range of legislation. There is no silver bullet that will deal with these challenges. We have to confront this in a comprehensive way across many portfolios. As such, the workplace relations legislation is a central part of this. It is critical to increasing work force participation. It is critical to the flexibility and fleetness of foot required for industry and workplaces to capitalise on the opportunities and to avoid the threats that confront us with the growing globalisation of our economy. The independent contractors legislation that is in the design phase and has been foreshadowed is part of this pattern. Even somethreat thing like the super drawdown for people who have reached the preservation age is another really important initiative as part of this matrix of legislation to deal with these challenges. The mature age worker $500 tax offset is another component, in tax policy, as is the senior Australian tax offset. All of these things make up a concerted attempt to deal with these challenges. The Welfare to Work legislation that we are debating in the House at the moment is very much a part of this attempt to increase work force participation, flexibility and the opportunities that are there for every Australian. There is now a shortage of workers, not a shortage of jobs. This is commonly accepted. This situation will only accelerate with the ageing of the population. As I said earlier, there will be a shortfall within five years of potentially close to 200,000 workers compared with the number of jobs available. In order to meet the skill and labour shortages that the Australian economy will experience, we must ensure that as many as possible Australians of working age are able to participate in the work force to their highest level of capacity and availability. It is an imperative to deal with the challenges, but it is also an imperative for other reasons. At present the net growth in the Australian work force is 170,000 people each year. Yet it is anticipated that by the decade 2020 to 2030 we will have on average a mere 12½ thousand people per year coming into the work force, compared with 170,000 today. It is a very serious looming problem and the ultimate effect is an ever-diminishing tax and revenue base for our governments. This will seriously impact on the ability to provide a range of government services including old age pensions, working age income support, payments and health services. The genuine safety net that has been built up by successive governments throughout our history, which is a proud feature of policy in this country, is under threat unless we acknowledge and deal with this problem that is looming very large and is already on our doorstep. This Welfare to Work legislation is part of that pattern of legislative response to deal with this. There are currently 2.6 million working age Australians on income support, of which only 15 per cent are required to actively search for a job. I put to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that passive welfare payments with no obligations lock people out of participating in Australia's prosperity and condemn them to a lifetime of poverty. Not only that, they contribute to this problem of diminishing work force that is on our doorstep. They contribute to the acceleration and magnitude of that looming problem. Despite Australia creating more than 1.7 million new jobs in the last 9½ years, the number of working age Australians receiving the disability support pension and the ing payment has increased massively. In the 12 months prior to June 2004, 55 per cent of people transferred to the disability support payment from another payment. In the seven years prior to June 2004, the disability support payment grew by 26 per cent and the parenting payment single grew by 33 per cent. There are now more working age Australians on a disability support pension than there are on unemployment benefit. We have 705,000 working age Australians receiving the disability support pension, 630,000 working age Australians receiving the parenting payment, 260,000 aged over 50 in receipt of income support and 500,000 working age Australians on unemployment benefit. This is not sustainable both culturally and financially. It does underscore in many respects an emerging cultural problem: we are losing the habit of self-reliance; we are losing the sense of self-responsibility. We are losing that great Australian trait of taking responsibility for ourselves to the best of our ability and of defying the odds and persisting. People need to be encouraged to help themselves to the best of their ability. Many cannot work; many have not got the opportunity of work. But we must do all we can as a government and as a legislature to ensure that people are encouraged to help themselves to the best of their ability. Passive welfare is undermining that objective in a very serious way. Something serious is happening which is not good for our country, and those statistics shine a very big light on that problem. In my view, those on the other side of the House have got their heads in the a sand. I have listened to many of their contributions, and none of them have addressed this problem. None of them have provided any solution to this problem, this challenge, that we have. There is a critical mass of people who are reliant on passive welfare payments and it is starting to cause an emerging parent- cultural problem in this country. Australia's welfare system is designed to provide a safety net for those who genuinely need it. It is generous and it is well targeted by world standards, and of that we should be proud. This legislation does not in any way affect those who genuinely need the safety net. We can remain proud of it and we can remain responsible to those who genuinely need a safety net. But we are going to give some encouragement to people to help themselves to the best of their ability. Our system was designed at a time when most jobs were full time, most unemployment was for a short time and mothers and married women did not work. We have had the increasing availability of part-time jobs and the increasing flexibility of our work force, which was started by the other side of the House in 1993 with Paul Keating's changes-those opposite conveniently forget that-and continued in 1996 with further changes to the work force rules by the Howard government. We now have another body of changes proposed to increase flexibility in the workplace. All of that is driven by the reality of a globalised world. We are responding as a parliament to what is happening on the ground, to the imperatives on the ground. Given these changing circumstances and changed opportunities-the importance of and ability to provide part-time jobs-it is important that people with a partial capacity to work are encouraged to do so. Not only will the community benefit but also these people will benefit from the financial, psychological and social benefits of engaging in the work force. The best form of welfare is a job. We must never forget that. It is not a cliche; it is a fact. It is something that should drive our legislative response to these challenges. It underscores the Australian way of life. Employment also increases people's self-confidence and self-esteem. It reduces anxiety and depression. It provides financial security and, more than anything else, it provides a sense of fulfilment to people. Having a job gives people the ability to do something constructive and make a contribution. This gives a sense of achievement which ultimately leads to happiness. No amount of money provided by passive welfare is a substitute for that. If we can encourage those who have some capacity to work to do so, we will have done a very good thing not only for the country but for those people themselves. Research conducted in Australia shows that growing up in a welfare-dependent household leads to poor outcomes for young people. There are currently 700,000 children in Australia growing up in households where no adult of working age has a job, and two-thirds of those households are headed by single parents. We can encourage and make a change to that circumstance even with part-time work so that some of those parents can show an example. Most of these people want to work. We have to provide the encouragement and support that will lead these people to take up opportunities. In a time of labour shortage it is even more critical. Young people living with parents on income support are much more likely than average to leave school early, become unemployed, become teenage parents and end up on income support themselves. This is a well-researched and well-documented point. Young people whose parents work, even in a low-paid job, have the benefit of positive role models in their lives and fare much better. Disadvantaged families in which no parent is working are more likely to have mental health disorders, lower rates of immunisation, greater risk of juvenile participation in criminal activity, problems adjusting to schooling, a higher incidence of early exit from schooling and increased risk of youth suicide. It is a slippery slide. I picked up a survey yesterday of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth perspectives. These were young people across Australia in our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. The survey looked at the five most important issues affecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people in their communities. One hundred per cent of them listed addiction and substance abuse as the major problem, 55 per cent listed crime and justice second, 42 per cent listed education third, 35 per cent listed physical, emotional and mental well-being fourth, and fifth was health and well-being. Four of the five problems go to personal abuse, substance abuse, addiction, crime and justice. This is a breakdown of community. What has been the problem? What has been identified as the cause of that? It is the dle-to-grave welfare that is provided, with no obligation, to these communities. Over the decades, we on both sides of this House have done a great disservice to these communities. The root of their problems is passive welfare. They have forgotten about self-responsibility and personal obligation. We have not learnt anything if we pursue this passive welfare approach across the rest of the community. Those arguing for cradle-tograve welfare risk doing as much damage to the mainstream community as has been done by imposing the policy on the Indigenous community over the last few decades. We need to reverse this cultural trend. Labor's answer is to throw more and more money at the problem, as if we have learnt nothing from the debacle within our Aboriginal communities. Labor believe that welfare is an absolute entitlement without obligations. Read between the lines-that is what they are saying. They mouth all the platitudes‘people who can work should work'-but they defy that prescription in their policy solutions. The primary cause of low income is not low wages, but joblessness. The argument that minimum wages lead to the creation of a low-paid underclass is not supported by the facts. If people are capable of working, they have an obligation to work. It is good for them psychologically, socially and physically. Labor claims that people moving from a pension payment to Newstart allowance will be financially worse off. This is not because the majority of people on pensions do not earn any private income. This is a wide-ranging piece of legislation. The two principles that underline the measures in this legislation are that people who have the capacity to work and are available to work should do so and that the best form cra- of family income comes from a job rather than from welfare. Australians are losing the habit of self-reliance. We have to recapture the habit of self-reliance. These welfare to work measures are an important contribution to reversing this trend. No decent society forces those who are seriously disabled or caring for young children to go to work. This legislation does not do that. Contrary to what we have heard from the other side, this legislation protects those very important principles of protecting the seriously disabled and those caring for young children. But nor should a caring society hold out the perverse incentive of welfare passivity to those who can work. If it does so, it denies to those individuals a major source of meaning and satisfaction in their lives and risks creating a permanent underclass. If we do that, we not only let down the individuals in our community who should be given every encouragement to do what they can, but we also neglect the challenge that is faced by an ageing population which we must address and take responsibility for. I commend the bill to the House.",136
192,Mrs ELLIOT,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"I rise to speak in opposition to the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005. I speak today on behalf of the people of Richmond to voice our grave concerns about how these proposed changes will severely impact upon their lives. The Howard government likes to call true, this policy welfare reform, and we have heard many speakers mention this today. But, after nine long years, we have come to know a lot about the glossy policy labels the government places on many of these measures. Almost always the detail contains a complex tangle of extreme legislative change, underpinned by a philosophy of unfairness, meanness and short-sightedness. And that is what is at the heart of this bill: unfairness, meanness and short-sightedness. This bill does not constitute reform by any stretch of the imagination. Just as the government's Work Choices bill provides no choice for Australian workers, this Welfare to Work bill will not help people to get back into the work force. Reform does not mean change for the sake of change. Reform means improving on how things have been done in the past, based upon new knowledge and clearer understanding. It means a holistic, considered and systematic change for the better. It is all about vision for improvement. So when the Prime Minister talks about welfare reform it is in fact code for ‘punishment of the most vulnerable', because there is nothing in this bill that is visionary. There is nothing about building a better society in which those who can work do and those who cannot are cared for. I would like to know, because the people of Richmond have put me here to ask the government on their behalf, how punishing the most vulnerable-and make no mistake about it: that is what this bill is essentially about-helps our families and our communities. How does the Howard government's brand of welfare reform make for a better Australia? What is visionary about this bill? What is visionary about cutting the household budgets of our most vulnerable families for no good reason? What is visionary about making 300,000 Australians financially worse off? What is visionary about shunting people from one welfare payment to a much lower welfare payment rather than providing real pathways to employment? What is visionary about making work less financially worthwhile by taking back more of every dollar that these people earn? What is visionary about all of that? Absolutely nothing. It is true that those who can work should work. Nobody benefits from unemployment. We all agree that having work brings huge benefits to individuals, families, communities and our nation both financially and socially. We should never stop looking at newer and better ways to support people to get into the work force, to reduce unemployment and to fight disadvantage. But the Howard government strategy is to get out a great big stick and start whacking away at the most disadvantaged and vulnerable in our society. This government is hell-bent on rushing down the road of an American style welfare system in which benefits are low and a the disadvantaged are driven into a new class of working poor. Under this new welfare system, individuals are no longer guaranteed a fair go and support. The tight targeting of benefits to those in need is gone. We now see that millionaires are eligible for thousands of dollars in benefits, provided their partners stay at home. Yet, at the same time, single parents and people with disabilities are to be punished by a set of changes that will do nothing to help them get a job. This proposed new system fails to deliver economically sustainable outcomes. We are seeing from this government a grand vision that consists of dumping 75,000 people with a disability and 85,000 single parents onto the dole, making them and at least 85,000 children a lot worse off. Is that really the best that this big, old and tired government can come up with? As usual, it has not even been able to provide a scrap of evidence to show that putting people on lower welfare payments will help them get a job. This is lazy policy development from an out-of-touch government that has all the control it wants but only archaic, second-hand ideas to deliver. In my electorate I talk regularly with lots of single mums and dads, and they all tell me the same thing: they would love to find work and provide a better life for their kids, but they are struggling to find any work at all, let alone a job that can help them balance their parenting responsibilities. Not only that, even if they do find work, they cannot find any affordable child-care so that their kids are looked after when they are not at school. Under this legislation, a single parent will now be pushed off the parenting payment and onto the dole when their child turns eight. Adding parents to the dole queue does not provide them with support, such as training and reskilling, which they need to gain work. It provides no practical solutions and it does not assist them to realise their potential. Just like sole parents, many people with disabilities also want to work. They have a right to access work, and we have a responsibility to give them the right help so that they can be successful. My constituents are telling me that they already struggle to find an employer that will take them on if they have a disability. This government talks a lot about family values and the important role of parenting, but this seems to be relevant only for those who are well off. While the government continues to reward rich parents to stay at home, it is obsessed with pushing single parents who are already struggling out into the work force. This work force will very soon become a whole lot less flexible once the government's industrial relations changes take place. Under the government's proposed welfare changes, the income support paid to a single mother with two children will be cut by nearly $1,500 a year as a way of somehow ‘encouraging' her to seek work and to give up full-time care of her children as young as eight years old. At the same time, the non-working partners of millionaires are eligible to receive up to $3,300 in welfare in return for not seeking work and staying at home to care for their children. The hypocrisy is breathtaking. The government's key economic argument for these changes that they have proposed is that they will provide greater incentive for people to move from welfare to work. This claim has been comprehensively rejected through economic analysis by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, NATSEM. This is a group that the Prime Minister himself has described as respected and independent. Let us have a look at the NATSEM research. The research shows that these changes will remove incentives for welfare recipients to get work because of the high effective marginal tax rates they now confront, due to the government's decision to dump them onto the dole. NATSEM found that, as people are pushed from the disability support pension and the parenting payment single pension onto Newstart, they will not only suffer a direct cut in their benefits-$46 a week and $29 a week respectively-but also be financially penalised for actually getting a job because of the different income testing rules for Newstart compared to the tests for pensions. The NATSEM study also found that, if a person with a disability works 15 hours a week at the minimum wage, they will keep only 25c of every $1 they earn, while the government takes the other 75c. That makes such a person an incredible $122 per week worse off by moving into work under the proposed changes than if they moved into work under the current arrangements. The Welfare to Work bill will actually penalise people for getting a job. The dark truth here is that the Prime Minister wants to take us towards this American style welfare system, where people are eligible for much lower benefits and are faced with very low net returns from any job that they get. Our Prime Minister wants to take us towards the creation of a new class of working poor. Under these changes this government is effectively asking sole parents to work for a return of $3.88 an hour and asking people with a disability to work for a return of $2.27 an hour. This situation is indeed truly outrageous. This extreme punishment is made so much worse for people with a disability. As well as cutting income support, these changes force many people with disabilities to look for work. They are unprepared because they are not offered sufficient opportunities for trainhave ing and skill development needed to help them get jobs. For example, only 7,600 new vocational training places have been allocated. For sole parents, not only is this government taking away money that parents use to feed their children, it has also failed to provide enough child care to support these changes. The Prime Minister has given us his word that single parents will not have to accept a job that results in a low or negative financial gain once the cost of child care has been taken into account. Yet, after 10 years of deceit, his word is small comfort to many single parent families out there, and that is what many families in Richmond are telling me. The hard truth is that there is nothing in this legislation that delivers on the Prime Minister's promises about child care. The Howard government is also leaving parents who receive benefits unprepared by failing to offer sufficient training. The reality now is that 600,000 parents will have to fight with 60,000 mature age unemployed for 12,300 vocational training places. It is no coincidence that these welfare changes are being introduced at the same time as the government's extreme industrial relations changes. It is obvious that the industrial relations changes will provide employers with unprecedented power to offer cut-price employment conditions to new employees, whilst removing almost all protections for new employees. Those people most vulnerable under the industrial relations changes will be those filling unskilled positions on minimum wages-the jobs the government wants welfare recipients to accept under its mantra: ‘The best form of welfare is a job.' This means that people with a disability and sole parents-those who already have very little bargaining power in the workplace-will even less protection from exploitation at work. These same people can lose their payments altogether if they refuse to work under an unfair AWA, even if the conditions are totally unacceptable, such as allowing no flexibility for sole parents to spend time with their children. Let us have a look at what we have got here: Welfare to Work plus Work Choices. Welfare to Work plus Work Choices means serious exploitation of the most vulnerable in our society. There is no doubt that these people will be like lambs to the slaughter. At the end of the day, this government is legislating to cut the benefits of the poorest in our society in an effort to force them into the labour market, whilst at the same time setting up a system designed to drive down wages and conditions. It is a disgusting situation, and it is not the kind of Australia that we want. We are currently experiencing a major skills shortage in this country. It presents the government with a golden opportunity to assist people to move off welfare and into work for the economic benefit of all Australians. But, instead of strengthening the economy by investing in the skills, education and training of our work force-by being a smart and great trading nation and by investing in infrastructure, innovation, research and development-this government wants to strengthen our economy by punishing our most poor and taking away the working rights and conditions of our most vulnerable. I strongly believe that the people of Richmond and all Australians certainly deserve so much better. I, like the rest of federal Labor, strongly support the principle of welfare reform. I believe that, as a government, there is a responsibility to deliver to the people of Australia strong, compassionate leadership on this issue and also fair, effective policies encourage and assist people to move from welfare into work. Welfare reform of this kind is vital for Australia's continued economic and social prosperity. It has long been federal Labor's view that the welfare system should be means tested and targeted at those in need so that we have a system that recognises that a job is the best outcome for individuals, families and society-a system that never leaves people financially disadvantaged for finding a job and a system that helps people break down barriers to work, such as providing the skills and training that many welfare recipients need to help them get a job. Unfortunately, the Howard government is not interested in these aims. Unemployment and welfare delivery is indeed a complex issue and it deserves a very detailed and sophisticated response from the government. Yet our Prime Minister thinks, ‘Here's a magic quick fix: let's just get out a bigger stick to hit people with.' When I go back to my electorate and I talk to families who are already doing it tough, do you think they say that they want their government to take us down the road of an American style welfare system where benefits are low and the disadvantaged are driven into a new class of the working poor? No, they do not. Of course they do not want that. I am sure we all agree that everyone benefits when more people participate in our society, both economically and socially. We all agree that those who can work should work. But we also need to care for those who cannot. What my constituents say to me is that they want to see developed a strong, effective welfare reform package that addresses all these complex issues. They want to see a package that tackles the underlying reasons someone is not working and that delivers practical solutions. They want to see a systhat tem that gives people the chance to get the skills that they need. They want to see a system that encourages employers to give people with a disability the opportunity to demonstrate their ability. They want a system that understands that being a parent is an important job in itself and that work makes families more secure. They want to see a system that helps parents find the balance between supporting their family and raising their kids. They want to see a system that involves strong support from government in breaking down barriers to participation, such as skills, work-family balance and employer attitudes, alongside fair and reasonable requirements for job seekers, and they want a system that, at the end of the day, makes sure people get a fair reward for effort. That is what they are telling me they want to see. This is the kind of welfare reform that our great country needs and deserves and this is the welfare reform that Labor is advocating. It is a type of welfare reform that includes people, picks people up and welcomes them to share in our economic prosperity-not one that leaves them out in the cold and all alone. To build a great and strong nation we need to get everyone on board so that we can work together to achieve great things. And this is not just about welfare reform. This is about the development and implementation of good policies across welfare, education, workplace relations and infrastructure. It means working with people in all aspects of their lives, across their life span to help them be and achieve the very best they can. This requires investing in our people and our country. It means giving our kids access to a decent education so that they can achieve all of their potential. It means making sure our young people are not leaving school with nowhere to go. It means giving them an opportunity to build their skills and get into vocational training. In my electorate of Richmond, youth unemployment is at 34 per cent. These young people desperately need to have a future; they need to be able to access training and employment. This system also means helping mature age workers who have much to offer but who have been retrenched because their old jobs do not exist any more. These are people with great skills and great knowledge. It means a system to enable them to find work. It also means having a system that helps single parents to reskill and get jobs but not at the expense of their family life. means finding that family and work balance. This system also has to encourage those who need it to get involved, in the work force and in their community. It also means diversifying our industries and investing in our infrastructure and in research and development. This is what is required, not an extreme measure that punishes our most vulnerable but one that creates the basis for people to find their potential through adequate training and skilling. It is not one disadvantages them all the way along. There is much that can be done to build and make our nation a greater place and that does not involve punishing our most vulnerable. It does not mean destroying their lives and making it more difficult for them. I strongly believe there is much that can be done to make this country an even better place to live and we can become even prouder Australians with a fair go for everyone. Essentially that is what this is about. It is why I oppose this legislation, because there is not a fair go for everyone. It is extreme and it disadvantages so many people in our society. Instead, I want to see a fair and just system where people are given adequate access to training and reskilling.",140
193,Mr SLIPPER,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"I would be absolutely the last person to rise in the House and suggest that the honourable member for Richmond was not speaking from the heart or was not sincere in what she had to say, but when one listened to the claptrap that the member uttered during her contribution one had to wonder whether some members on the Australian Labor Party side of the House actually understand how to run an economy. She seems to think that somehow there is a great money bin and unlimited resources. She does not seem to understand that the government needs at times to make difficult decisions to make our welfare sysIt tem sustainable and to make sure that money gets through to the needy and not to the greedy; to make sure that, as a relatively wealthy country, we are, in fact, able to meet our social security obligations and, indeed, the obligations we have in other areas of government spending. One does not have to go past the first page of the explanatory memorandum to the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other that Measures) Bill 2005 to see that it states: This Bill implements the Government's Welfare to Work reforms which are aimed at comprehensively rebalancing Australia's welfare system to make it more sustainable and to encourage increased workforce participation for those with the capacity to work. The memorandum goes on to say: The Bill includes a range of measures aimed at assisting and encouraging participation in the workforce, improving returns from work for people receiving allowances, a new compliance framework, and RapidConnect, which would require job seekers to register with the Job Network prior to making a claim for newstart allowance or youth allowance. The reforms recognise the importance of paid employment, whether full time or part time to each individual's well So, far from being an extreme and draconian piece of legislation, as the honourable member for Richmond would have us believe, this is a balanced piece of legislation brought in by a responsible government which understands, unlike its Labor predecessors, that you have to balance the books-a nation cannot spend more than it earns-and that responsible ministers are not able to meet every wish list of every interest group and of every person in the community. What the government has to do is balance the funds available against the needs of the community. The member for Richmond also said that she would like to become an even prouder Australian and that we could make this country an even better country. I think the government would be the last to say that Australia is perfect, but certainly the Australia of 2005 is substantially better off than the Australia of 1996, when we inherited the keys to government. The best form of welfare is a job, and the best way to get ahead is for people to get out there and to find real and meaningful employment. This government has built job opportunities, increased the number of jobs which are available in the workplace, created the incentive where business is prepared to grow and invest, and caused a situation with the new industrial relations legislation where there will be new flexibility. People will get higher pay for more effort; people will be able to sit down and talk with their respective employers to work out mutually satisfactory arrangements. We are seeing a brave new world where Australia will be better off. So the honourable member for Richmond, after the implementation of not only this legislation but also the industrial relations legislation, will be able to be an even prouder Australian-although she has every right to be richly proud of what this government has achieved since 1996. I being. commend her for the sense of pride she has expressed. Even though Australia is an extremely lucky country, it is easy at times to forget or to take for granted just how lucky we are to have a stable country, a strong economy, high employment, low inflation and also a very good welfare support system. None of these things happen without good government, sound government, responsible government-such as the government that we currently have. It could be argued by some people that our welfare system is perhaps too good. Some people suggest that in the pastand even now, to some extent-there was excess generosity and that there is not sufficient incentive for people to go out there and take the job opportunities which are now available. People are not always encouraged to get that first foot on the employment ladder. There are plenty of anecdotes that endorse the idea that, if you continually give to someone who is in need, then that person will grow to rely on your handouts. Their life will become one of dependency rather than a preferred one of independence and growth. The two bills that we are debating here today are designed to help that general sector of the community that is growing dependent on Australia's welfare handouts to become selfsufficient and more self-reliant. The social security system ought to be a safety net and not a lifestyle choice. These bills are designed to reduce a financial burden on our welfare system-a burden that is unnecessary, counterproductive and excessive. The two bills, the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005 and the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work) Bill 2005, aim to bring in the Welfare to Work measures that were outlined in the May budget. I have to say, and I suppose it happens with all governments, that takes a longer than ideal period to bring in budget measures, but these measures are at least being brought in within months of the May budget being handed down. Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, you personally may be interested to know that one of my staff members has relatives who live in Fiji. Fiji is a nation that is known for its beautiful islands, crystal clear oceans and friendly people. But it is struggling-as is any developing nation-with employment, economic growth, encouraging its industry and supporting its people. Members of the Labor Party might not be aware that Fiji has no welfare support system, and those who cannot find work must rely on relatives for support or must return to a subsistence existence of fishing and growing crops. Residents of many other nations also face similar conditions. It is a source of regular frustration that many Australians are simply unable to appreciate by comparison just how good we have it here. Our welfare system as it is day is one to be admired by the needy in this country-in fact, as Australians, we can take pride in it. We have payments for single parents, couples with families, the unemployed, the disabled, those going to school or univerforce sity, those who are retired-and the list goes on. These payments are legitimate to those in need and are designed to help them through tough times, but the reliance of some able bodied citizens on welfare as their long-term source of support-those who have no intention of attempting to reduce their reliance welfare-is an unfair burden on this wonderful support system and, might I add, on their fellow Australians. With Australia's total population of around 20 million people, it is a concern to think about 2.6 million are on some form of welfare to support their income-almost one in eight of the total population-and fewer than one in six are reat times it quired to search for a job. The two bills we are debating here are designed to usher in three foundational platforms. Firstly, those people in Australia who have the ability to work should actually work. I do not see that as being a terribly controversial proposition. Secondly, the most valuable and beneficial of incomes for families is that which is earned through a fair day's work rather than that which is received through government handouts. Who on earth could possibly object to what, I think, is a axiom of truth? Thirdly, welfare assistance that is given to those people who do not have a job should have as its underlining aim that of getting jobseekers into a job-again, hardly remarkable, yet we find that those opposite come into the House and oppose the very positive reforms outlined in this legislation. Some members opposite seem to take the view that this legislation is in some way extreme. What an absolutely unsustainable proposition that these bills are anything other to- than moderate, reasonable and an important reform measure to ensure the long-term sustainability of Australia's welfare system. The need for these changes is underpinned by a recognition that the average age of our work is increasing. If this continues, coupled with the demands on our welfare system, Australia will face significant economic difficulties in the years ahead. As has been outlined in the House on previous occasions, the current net growth of our work force is around 170,000 per year on and estimates are that this growth will slow dramatically to an average of around 12,500 per year from 2020 to 2030. If we do not make adjustments, it is not difficult to see the massive difficulties that this will cause. There will be a reduction in the worker base that helps fund the welfare system through taxation and reductions in general revenue for the government, resulting in significant cutbacks in service provision. The impact will not be felt for some time, but it will come down in a big way unless changes are put in place as early as possible. As I said earlier, the government is strongly of the belief that the best form of welfare is a job. I have said publicly on numerous occasions that a worker gets much more than a regular income from his or her job. Not only does a person receive income to enable them to support their family; in addition, the employee gets the self-esteem that comes with achievement and they get the personal satisfaction that they are contributing to Australia's economy. They also get the satisfaction that they are providing for themselves and their dependants. These are the foundational aims of these two bills: to build Australia's economy, to increase the overall productivity and efficiency of Australia's population and to reduce dependence on welfare so that we can prepare properly for the challenges that will come with our ageing population. These bills are not radical. These bills ought not to frighten anyone. These are bills which the government has brought in because it was economically responsible and necessary to do so. These are bills that preserve the underfor lying basis of our welfare system-that as a relatively wealthy society we cannot meet everyone's wish list but we do have the capacity to provide a safety net for those inely in need. This legislation is all about identifying those who are genuinely in need. It is all about weaning off welfare those people who are not genuinely in need or those people who have the capacity to re-enter the work force, receive and earn an income and in doing so receive the satisfaction of making a contribution to our nation and also the satisfaction of making provision for their respective families. I am pleased to commend the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005 and the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work) Bill 2005 to the chamber.",145
194,Mr JENKINS,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"The name of this piece of legislation is quite intriguing: the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005. It represents the long-awaited welfare reform of the Howard government. But, if we really look at the detail of this bill, it should be called the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to a Lower Level of Welfare) Bill, because this 250-page bill is mainly about social security benefits. For 248 pages it amends the Social Security Act 1991 and the Social Security Administration Act 1999. On the last two pages it amends the Disability Services Act 1986 and the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Australians Working Together and Other 2001 Budget Measures) Act 2003. It is about income support. Some members from the other side have claimed that this is really about encouraging people on benefits into work. The Minister Employment and Workplace Relations, in his second reading speech, quoted the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair. He is the person of last resort when the government wants to genu- justify its actions. When the government quotes Tony Blair as saying that fairness starts with the chance of a job, all in this chamber could and do agree with that. In his second reading speech the minister went on to claim that the opposition refused to acknowledge that people on welfare have the same aspirations as other Australians. What a nonsense! In the main the electorates that are represented by members of the Labor Party have high numbers of people on the disability support pension or the parenting payment-either single or partnered. We do not have to be lectured that people on those benefits would like to be in the work force. We understand the benefits, not only in economic terms but in their psyche and their self-worth. So to be lectured in that way by the minister in his second reading speech is a bit galling. What this piece of legislation does not do is provide the incentives for people to get work. There is a need not only for the work to be provided but also in many cases for the incentives for those who will go on to the new benefits after July 2006. The bill does nothing to prepare them for the next step from benefit to work. As must be emphasised, the main action of this piece of tion is to take those who will go onto a benefit from 1 July 2006-who in the past would have been on disability support pension but are assessed as being able to work 15 to 29 hours-and place them on Newstart. It has to be emphasised-and those opposite have to be reminded because most of them have forgotten, with one exception which I want to go to later in my speech-that Newstart is a lower payment, has a harsher income test and is taxable. These are the things that those opposite, making their set piece contributions and in trying to justify their position to their torates, are ignoring and will not emphasise. As is the case with the disability support pension, those who are on the parenting payment single pension before 1 July 2006 will remain on that pension. Those commencing a benefit after 1 July 2006 will go onto the parenting payment single if their youngest child is under six years old and will move onto Newstart when their youngest child turns six. They start on Newstart immediately, if they are commencing a benefit, if their youngest child is six years or over. Therefore, the Newstart benefit is less generous than parenting payment single and there are other disincentives in the payment. In fact, if you look at the payment rate for those who have one child and compare PPS-parenting payment single-to Newstart allowance, you find that the commencing weekly rate is $29 less. The amount of income that can be earned before payment is reduced goes from $76 to $31-so the difference is $45. In the case of Newstart the income support cuts out when private income reaches $426, while those on parenting payment single can earn $718 before the income support cuts out-that is a $292 difference. Many who have spoken in this second reading debate have looked at past legislaNATSEM-National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling-studies and have quoted studies by Ann Harding and her colleagues. They ought to go to the study released in August, The distributional impact of the proposed welfare-to-work reforms upon sole parents, and another paper, The distributional impact of the proposed welfare-to-work reforms upon Australians with disabilities, to see an analysis of this change in benefits that should be taken into consideration. Those opposite have to understand in the dramatic effect that this will have on people who are on these benefits and who elec- then move into work. The decrease in the total income is quite dramatic and the change in the effective marginal tax rate, especially at the lower end of the scale, is quite appalling. If you take, for instance, a single person with disabilities who, instead of being on a disability support pension after 2006 goes onto the Newstart allowance, you will see that there is a steady increase in the effective marginal tax rate-the EMTR. With the DSP there is a cut-in point of about $75 through 40 per cent after that, so if their private come is $100 the EMTR is 40 per cent. Under the new regime it goes to 65 per cent, and by the time they get a private income over their benefit of $200, the effective marginal tax rate is 75 per cent. So the government claws back 75c from every dollar of private income. These are the changes that are really important and really bell the cat on what the intention of the government is in putting through this legislation. Whilst the minister, in his second reading speech, did not say that there has to be a change in the welfare system for economic reasons, time after time in support of this legislation backbench members of the government have talked about the Intergenerational report. They have said that if this welfare system continues it will be a drain on the pockets of taxpayers. They are belling the cat by indicating that that is the main reason they support this legislation. Once you say that, you cannot then say that this is about welfare to work, as the titles of say: these bills imply. In the contributions from the other side, because it is not in the hymnbook they are all singing from, most of them ignore the disincentives that exist to get people from welfare into work. I will acknowledge that the honourable member for Deakin, who has actually looked at these matters, did say that when you make international comparisons one of the questions that have to be asked is: is there something in the attitude of employers, especially as concerns people with disabilities? He went on to say that we must break down the barriers that employers have as regards DSP recipients. That was the only element in the main part of his speech that I agreed with, but that is the point rect. That is the point that we really have to look at. It is intriguing that today the Australian to Public Service Commission tabled its report, inState of the service report 2004-05. On page 213 it has a series of comments about the employment of people with disabilities in the Australian Public Service. This government is introducing this legislation and beating the drum that it is important to get people from welfare to work for a whole host of good reasons, but what is its record as an employer? The Australian Public Service Commission's own document, which was tabled today, says: Over the past decade, the data shows a consistent decline in the employment of people reporting a disability as a proportion of APS employees. In absolute terms, the number of employees fell each year, before recovering slightly in 2002–03, and then declining again for the past two years. At June 2005, people with a disability represented 3.8% of ongoing APS employees, down from 3.9% last year, and from 5.4% in 1996. So there was a 1.6 per cent decrease in the proportion of employees in the APS reporting disabilities between 1996 and 2005. The State of the service report 2004-05 goes on to While the decline can be partly explained by a reduction in the number of positions at APS 1–2 levels, where people with a disability were historically over-represented, the past 10 years has seen a decline in the representation of people with a disability at all classification levels. On page 214, figure 9.7 shows that dramatically, in graphic form. So much for this concern. If they are going to do things that encourage employers to take on employees with disabilities, they are going to have to do much better throughout the Public Service. I would hope that the ministers who sit around the cabinet table, who come up with legislation like this and proposals like this that were in the budget, will take that on board. That is that is cora challenge for them. We should not have to have the sorts of schemes that quite rightly celebrate the achievements of those employers who have gone out of their way to ensure that they employ people with disabilities. A couple of years ago I was quite happily involved in endorsing the nomination of Susan Fechner at Spotlight, Mill Park, for the Prime Minister's Employer of the Year Award. It is quite right, as I said, to have this recognition. In this case, Spotlight had employed seven people with disabilities over a three-year period. I met with a group of these employees at Spotlight and I have to say that they represented everything that people have been talking about in this debate. They really had increased confidence because their worth had been recognised and they were there in a job. One indicated to me that she was going to go for her car licence soon so that she would be able to drive herself to work. Many things flow from the rich experience of employment. Nobody has any beef about that. Across this chamber there is complete agreement. But let's get down to the important things when we look at those with disabilities and those single parents who are on parenting payments. Let us look at what the impediments are for them in getting into the work force. That is where I go to the contribution of the honourable member for Pearce, the first government speaker in this debate after the minister. Quite courageously, she revealed an attitude that indicated she understood very well the ramifications of this legislation. She indicated that she understood that the cut in income support was disturbing, especially in the context of her now being a backbench member of a government that is talking about large tax cuts for those on large salaries. She indicated that the government had had a real opportunity to look at this question of welfare and that it had lost the opportunity. Real incentives were needed for employers, and they are the things that should be supported. As did the opposition, the member for Pearce decried the way in which the proper parliamentary processes had been transgressed. In the case of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, the process had been so truncated that its worth was lessened. In fact, a report has been tabled and we have not had time to go through that report-the report of an inquiry that was held over such a short period of time that there was no opportunity to advertise for contributions. These were done by networks and through email. But the fact is that still 60 contributions were made to the inquiry, and none of them was able to indicate how this legislation-250 pages of legislation and 184 pages of explanatory memorandum-was suddenly going to get people from welfare to work. Not even the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, in coming forward to the Senate committee, could make claims about that. As with a lot that we see from this government, they are unable to do so. This is a misunderstanding of the way in which people on welfare actually see that welfare. Of course to have people stuck for generations in unemployment and to have families that have not seen work is a problem, but it is not going to be solved by this legislation. The other factor that is ignored and that has been ignored in the debate here is that this has spatial consequences: different regions of Australia will be affected by this in different ways. There is a very good ACOSS report, Who is worse off? The regional distribution of people affected by the Welfare to Work policy, which indicates that. I am glad that the honourable member for Solomon is going to follow me in speaking here, because he represents one of the top 50 electorates in numbers of people that ACOSS estimate will be worse off because of this legislation. If we look at the seats in Victoria that will be worse off, we see they are the outer metropolitan seats. You start at Lalor and sweep around through Gorton and Calwell to the electorate that I represent, Scullin. You go down to the south-east, to Holt and Dunkley. We find that they are electorates that already have high numbers of people on DSP and parenting payments but, because of the way in which people are attracted to cheaper forms of housing, they will be affected by this. So what we need is support. People on benefits need affordable housing and they need support in retraining and gaining skills, but they do not need an income support system that drives them even further away from support. These are the things that are really going to be very important as we go forward. (Time expired)",148
195,Mr TOLLNER,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"I rise today to speak on this important Welfare to Work legislation before the House. I was interested to hear the member for Scullin mention the ACOSS report, which I will talk about later in this speech. The member for Scullin certainly displays that old handout mentality of the Labor Party-so very, very sad to see. I believe that the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005 and the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005 are two of the most important bills for the Northern Territory that I have had the opportunity to debate since being elected in 2001. I want to start by saying that these bills perfectly highlight to me the profound differences between this government, a government that wants all Australians to get a job, and the Labor opposition, who believe that it is fine to throw money at people to keep them out of jobs-as was amply demonstrated then by the member for Scullin. Mr Jenkins-No, no. If you had come in at the early part you would understand.",152
196,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,SERVICES LEGISLATION,The member for Scullin will refrain from interjecting.,152
197,Mr TOLLNER,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"This government has a commitment to ensure that those Australians, and in particular those Territorians, who want to work can get every opportunity to get that work. Let us have a quick look at the differences between this government-a government of consistent economic growth, a government of ongoing job creation, a government of low interest rates, a government with a program of workplace flexibility and choice and a government that has delivered real wage increases of 14.9 per cent since 1996-and the Labor Party. Since March of 1996 the coalition government has created more than 1.7 million jobs, the unemployment rate of 5.1 per cent is now close to a 30-year low and there are now more than seven million Australians in employment. Under this government there have been more full-time jobs created in the last six months than there were in the last six years of the previous Labor government. These figures show a government that is committed to creating jobs for all Australians. It is a government that is dedicated to the sustained economic well-being of all Australian families, and this can only continue through labour market reforms and through the welfare reforms that we have seen and are seeing now. This is in stark contrast, of course, to the record of the Labor Party. In fact, Labor's record in government says it all: a peak unemployment rate of 10.9 per cent in December 1992 and an average unemployment rate of around 9.2 per cent for their last two terms in office. That is Labor's record of getting Australians a job. I was doing a bit of research today and-I am not sure if many members are aware-yesterday was the 15th anniversary of the announcement by former Labor Treasurer, Paul Keating, of the recession we had to have. Yes, on Thursday, 29 November 1990 the then Treasurer said: The first thing to say is that the accounts that Australia is in a recession. The most important thing about that is that this is the recession that Australia had to have, that the spending we had in the two years up to now was unsustainable, that we couldn't go on spending and consuming at the rate we were, carrying the imports we were, and the debt we were and, of course, the erosion on our gains of inflation. At that stage the unemployment rate was nearing 10 per cent and going up. We had interest rates around a whopping 12 per cent, a level of debt that left tears in most economists' eyes and a quarterly growth rate ofget this, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - minus 1.6 per cent. Further, due to the labour market policies of the Labor Party the total number of unemployed Australians grew by over 460,000 between October 1989 and July 1992. Of course, that is the difference between these two governments. This government is a government that wants to see more people in jobs and has the vision, the policies and the drive to see it through. Contrast that with the policy black hole that is the Australian Labor Party. This bill is designed to improve on the employment figures of this government and introduces measures that will address the future hurdles that we face because of an ageing population, demographic changes and continuing high levels of welfare dependency. The remainder of my remarks in this debate will address the unique situation that the Northern Territory is placed in and why there is no doubt that this bill, and the industrial relations reforms, will significantly benefit many Territorians who are on welfare payments. I believe in a hand up, not a handout. I believe that getting a person into employment benefits not just that person but the whole community. In the Territory we face a unique situation. In my electorate of Solomon the unemployment rate is about three do show per cent-lower than the national average. The unemployment rate for the rest of the Territory is about nine per cent, which means that the unemployment rate for the Northern Territory as a whole is 4.8 per cent. Why is it higher outside of Darwin and Palmerston? Because there is a higher proportion of Indigenous Territorians who have historically suffered from higher rates of unemployment. Indeed, the Chief Minister and the Treasurer of the Northern Territory have in the past argued that the real Indigenous unemployment rate would be 10 per cent higher than the figures show. On that argument, Indigenous unemployment under the Labor Party would have been around 20 per cent on their watch. However, this government is about creating jobs in these regional and remote areas of the Northern Territory. As a complementary part of the industrial relations reforms and the proposed changes to the Aboriginal land rights act, the Welfare to Work package will create jobs in these regions of the Territory. There have recently been criticisms of the Welfare to Work reforms by the Australian Council of Social Service, as the member for Scullin mentioned, that the policy will mean less money in Indigenous and remote communities because welfare payments will be reduced if a person fails to find work. That argument does not wash with me. In fact, the opposite will be the case. These reforms will mean the creation of an additional 450,000 positions for employment assistance, training and rehabilitation to assist people around Australia in getting off welfare and into a job. My understanding of economics is at times a bit vague but, as I understand it, if you have more people in jobs you will have more people spending money, you will have governments collecting more taxes that can be reinvested in the economy and you will have more money going into communitiesall being driven by the reforms that the government is putting forward. For example, under the changes, businesses in the remote regions will have the flexibility to negotiate directly with workers to formulate an agreement that suits that business in their specific region. They will not be tied to the major centres in Australia such as Sydney or Melbourne; they will be able to negotiate flexible agreements that suit their particular location. Mainstream businesses outside the remote regions will be enticed to set up operations in these areas because of the security of leases. Not so long ago, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs proposed changes to the Aboriginal land rights act. The reforms to the act would allow long-term leasing of Aboriginal land in communities and townships. If there were long-term leases, they would provide security for businesses such as butchers, bakers and market gardeners. Even MCDonald's may choose to set up in these communities. At the moment, there are very few communities in the Northern Territory that have a market garden, a bakery, a butcher shop, let alone a MCDonald's or an Irish theme pub. In any case, as businesses set up in these communities, they will have access to a ready pool of workers who live locally and who know the region. These reforms will see young, single mothers across the Territory, of which a high proportion are Indigenous, being provided with all the opportunities possible to enter the work force. The Welfare to Work bill will see those Territorians on the disability support pension being able to get a job when and where they can. We have an untapped work force in the Territory that must be developed, particularly if we want Aborigines to gain better access to the mainstream economic system. Once again, the approach by the government is completely contrasted by that of the Australian Labor Party, who believe that welfare should be handed out willy-nilly to all and sundry. They prefer to see a system where there is no incentive for the jobless to seek and gain employment, where the ‘sitdown money' concept is retained and supported. We all know that that approach has not worked. It must change. Just ask Noel Pearson about the effect of welfare poison on Aborigines. When I was first elected, all of the winning candidates were invited to give a speech at the Australian Electoral Commission offices about their plans for the future. I was interested to note that the fundamental goal of the member for Lingiari-his overriding desire-was to see a Centrelink office at Port Keats. That was his goal for the term. He succeeded: we now have a Centrelink office at Port Keats. But I often wonder: if that is the best that the member for Lingiari can come up with, things are pretty bad in Aboriginal communities. Labor will of course protest and say that they have a policy that supports people getting into jobs. Fine-let us see their policy in detail. What they have done in the past is a record of how successful any policy of theirs would be-and I clearly illustrated their record earlier in my contribution. With the industrial relations reforms, the Welfare to Work package and, specifically in the NT, changes to the Aboriginal land rights act, these bills and related legislation probably constitute the most important debates for me and the Northern Territory. These reforms will see more people-in particular, Indigenous Territorians but also non-Indigenous Territorians-being provided with the opportunity to engage in employment right across the board. I want to conclude with a quote from the current Leader of the Opposition. This is a perfect example of the difference between the current government's policies, which deliver real benefits to Australians, and Labor's failures. In this House on 31 October 1989 he said: ... we have been able to deliver on wages policy for one very important reason-we are trusted by the ordinary wage earner in this country, who holds his or her wage demand in check ... That has got to be it. Under Labor, real wages grew by just 2.2 per cent between 1987 and 1996. Under this government, they have grown by 14.9 per cent since 1996. That is the fundamental difference between this government and the Labor opposition. I urge all members to get behind these bills and support them.",152
198,Dr EMERSON,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"Rankin) (7.06 pm)Under this legislation a single mother is expected to work for $2 an hour. That is the brutal truth of legislation that the government says is all about encouraging people to move from welfare to work. Labor supports initiatives that encourage people to move from welfare to work and that improve the incentive to do so. But this legislation goes in precisely the opposite direction. It creates extra disincentives to move from welfare to work. It is punitive legislation and it puts vicious nature of this government on display for all Australians to see. Let me explain how a single mother is expected to work for $2 an hour. That is the take-home pay that she can expect to receive on the minimum wage when moving from the parenting payment into work, after taking account of the reduction in benefit as she moves from welfare to work, the increase in taxation, the loss of rental assistance, the estimated cost of travel to and from work, and work clothes. Those estimated costs have been provided by NATSEM and the figure of $2 an hour does not-I emphasise: does not-take account of child-care costs. This legislation has been designed by wealthy parliamentarians. It is a disgrace to this country that wealthy parliamentarians could design a system where single mothers, who have a responsibility for looking after their children and in most cases have been deserted by their partners, are required to work for $2 an hour. Yet this government has the gall to describe this as a welfare to work measure. It is nothing but brutal punishment of people for whom this government has no respect. Single mothers in this country do it tough. They deserve some respect, they deserve some consideration and they deserve some support in trying to improve themselves and some genuine reward as they move from welfare to work. Instead of getting that support, under this brutal government they are being punished. In many cases the effective marginal tax rate-that is, the amount they will lose under these arrangements for every extra dollar earned-is 75c. I find it sickening that there is a debate in this country about abolishing the top marginal rate of income tax because 48.5c in the dollar is regarded as a very tough marginal rate of tax, but for single mothers 75c in the dollar seems okay. As I pointed out, that does the not include the cost of travel to and from work, child care, loss of rental assistance or any clothing that needs to be bought. That is the dimension of what this government is doing under this legislation. For people on the disability support pension, the rewardsthe take-home pay from moving from welfare to work-are not much better than for single mothers. We need to ask: why is the government doing it? The Treasurer of this country has rightly pointed to the ageing of the population and the need, therefore, to lift work force participation and productivity. Labor supports programs that are genuinely designed to lift work force participation and labour productivity, but these measures will not lift work force participation or productivaccept-in ity because, in the case of people on the ability support pension, they will be cajoled into the work force. With all respect to those people-and I have plenty of it, one reason being that there are many disability support pensioners in my electorate-they are not the most productive people in the work force and they know that. So it cannot be on the basis of lifting productivity that the government is doing it. It cannot be on the basis of lifting participation, because the government is actually encouraging a shift not from welfare to work but from welfare to welfare-from one form of welfare payment to a less generous form of welfare payment. That is the real reason for this government introducing this legislation. The real reason has nothing to do with work force participation or productivity and everything to do with achieving some budget savings. Let us understand these measures for what they really are. They are budget-cutting measures-nothing more, nothing less. So when the Treasurer and government ministers say, ‘This is all about lifting work participation and combating the ageing of the population,' they are wrong or they are not telling the truth. They know, as every Australian would know, that if you reduce the incentive to move from welfare to work you are going to get fewer people moving from welfare to work, and that is what this legislation does. It moves people off the parenting payment onto Newstart, the unemployment benefit, which is a lesser benefit. Therefore the government will achieve some budget savings. But, very importantly, the disincentives to move from Newstart into work are greater than the disincentives to move from parenting payment into work. The technical reason is that the taper on Newstart is more severe than that for the parenting payment. Labor introduced the whole notion of reciprocal obligation. We do understand and fact, we proposed-that there dis- should be some obligation on the part of those who are receiving government income support payments to reciprocate in some way, if they can, by participating in the work force to help pay their way. But this is not reciprocal obligation. This is not a two-way street; it is a one-way street of punishment. Having established that the true reason for this has nothing to do with participation and productivity but everything to do with budget cutting, let me point out that, while the number of disability support pensioners has in fact ballooned over the last 20 or 30 years, it has since stabilised and there are forecasts that the rate of disability support pension is likely to fall over coming decades, so one of the major drivers of falling participation rates by men is set to play a much less significant role in the future. There is absolutely no doubt that this government is doing this for all the wrong reasons. What really should happen is this legislation should be withdrawn and in its place genuine incentives should be created in a bill for people to force move from welfare to work. Those punitive effective marginal tax rates are stopping people from doing that. I have already referred to the fact that single mothers would be facing effective marginal tax rates of 75c in the dollar. Labor, in the recent past, and I, even more recently, have proposed genuine tax reforms that would improve the incentive to move from welfare to work. For the record, one of those tax reforms is to increase the low-income tax offset from $235 to $625 and to phase it out not from $21,600, as is presently the case, but from $70,000. Treasury has recently costed that proposal, and the result of that costing confirms that this would be affordable in the 2006-07 budget. It would be a much better move by this government to adopt that sort of proposal, because by increasing that low-income tax offset and then converting it to a fortnightly or weekly payment-effectively a pay-as-you-go tax concession-together with the tapering of that low-income tax offset from $70,000 means that there is an improved incentive for people on low incomes to move from welfare to work. I made that proposal as part of a broader tax reform proposal in a prebudget submission. Such submissions were invited by the Treasurer from people all around Australia. That prebudget submission has been costed by Treasury. From documents that were obtained under freedom of information legislation, I know that the Treasury costings confirm that this sort of proposal would be affordable. I should add that also affordable would be a reduction in the 42c rate of tax to 36c on the way to its ultimate abolition. So for an affordable amount of about $7.5 billion or perhaps a little more, we could be restoring incentives all up and down the income scale. We could be restoring incentives for middle-income earners to do that extra overtime and go for a promotion. But very importantly from Labor's perspective, as we do have a genuine interest in compassion for the poor, this proposal would improve the incentives to move from welfare to work. This legislation ought to be thrown out in its entirety. The fact is this legislation was put together by very mean people. I say that advisedly. It was assembled by very mean people who could not possibly have any compassion for single mothers, most of whom have been deserted by their partners and are struggling financially and are struggling with the challenge of bringing up their children. Now they are being told by this government that unless they go out and actively seek work they will be dropped onto the Newstart payment, a lower payment, with a steeper disincentive to move from welfare to work. It is a vicious piece of legislation and it should be thrown out. More generally, there should be a debate in this country about tax reform. That debate is being stifled by the Treasurer of this country. I do not agree with a number of the proposals put by Malcolm Turnbull but at least Malcolm Turnbull is debating tax reform.",155
199,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,SERVICES LEGISLATION,The member will refer to members of this House by their proper titles.,157
200,Dr EMERSON,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker, it is the member for Wentworth. At least the member for Wentworth is actually debating and contributing ideas as to genuine reform. My priorities and those of the Labor Party do not coincide with his because he is so much more interested in abolishing the top marginal rate of tax. I find an extreme irony in that: that he would want to abolish a top marginal rate of tax of 48½c in the dollar but leave in place an effective rate of taxation of 75c in the dollar for single mothers. I would also point out, as the member for Rankin, that my seat covers most of the area of Logan City in which there is a very large preponderance of single mothers and people on disability support pension. I am proud to be able to stand here tonight and represent their interests and also their views that these measures are unacceptable and brutal and should be thrown out in their entirety. There is absolutely no doubt that the colours of this government that are flying high tonight are the colours of a vicious and mean government. This legislation should be rejected.",157
201,Mr GIBBONS,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"I stand to oppose the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005 and support the amendments put forward by the shadow minister. For the past 15 years we have had an unprecedented time of economic prosperity, mainly as a result of the solid foundations laid down by the Hawke and Keating Labor governments. But now we have the Howard government hellbent on punishing those who are unfortunate enough to be unemployed, disabled or otherwise disadvantaged. The government spin on this punishing legislation is that ‘the best form of welfare is a job'. Virtually every speaker from the government side has continually parroted this meaningless line. Of course people on welfare should take every opportunity to gain employment if they are able, but it should be meaningful employment without having the Prime Minister's gun pointed at their heads. The government spin hides the true motivation for these changes, which is to strip billions of dollars from the welfare sector-and to hell with the impact on vulnerable people. The government also hide behind the one-size-fits-all mentality-further evidence of their quest to cut welfare just because they believe in the American welfare system that leaves millions of people without any hope of a decent chance to secure even a modest future for themselves. This government will not accept that thousands of Australians who are disabled, whether intellectually or physically, are just not able to participate in any worthwhile job. This welfare reform bill will ensure that more people will be reduced to living on payments as low as $200 a week, whilst only two per cent of the massive $11 billion budget surplus would be needed each year to prevent these people from being placed on lower payments. The so-called welfare reforms do nothing to help those people who are able to work. Reducing their payments, in an attempt to force people into jobs which, in most cases, do not exist, clearly shows that the Howard government is treating the most disadvantaged Australians with all the compassion of the Third Reich. The Senate committee attracted overwhelming evidence that these payment reductions will not help people get jobs but will simply leave single parents and people with disabilities much poorer. The Senate inquiry proves beyond all doubt that the Howard government is guilty of the biggest welfare fraud in Australian history as, under this bill, the most vulnerable will be severely penalised by the most callous and uncaring federal government in this nation's history. There is no credible evidence that reducing people's payments decreases unemployment over the long term. Instead, jobless people will simply be less able to cover basic costs. If the Welfare to Work bill goes ahead unamended, single parents will lose $29 a week, because they will be on unemployment payments instead of pension payments, and people with disabilities will lose $46 a week. Time and time again, we have had the Howard government steering us down the road towards the American system, not only in welfare reform but also in industrial relations, education and foreign affairs policies. If the Prime Minister and his ministers think so much of the way the United States implements these types of policies, perhaps they should go and live there themselves. ACOSS research presented to the Senate inquiry shows that, by putting people on lower unemployment payments rather than the current pension payments, this bill will reduce work incentives because more single parents and people with disabilities will face higher effective marginal tax rates. It is unfair that just because a single parent, or person with a disability, applied for a payment after June 2006 they will lose 60 cents in every dollar they earn when they get the job, while those on pension level payments lose 40 cents. ACOSS says that, rather than putting people on lower payments, to get more people into work the government must address work disincentives such as effective marginal tax rates and increase investment in employment assistance to give people the means and incentive to find a job. An estimated $400 million is required to restore the payment reductions proposed in the Welfare to Work bill 2005-just two per cent of the expected $14 billion surplus in 2006. The figure of $400 million is an annual figure the third year of implementation of spending and is calculated on the basis of figures from the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations and ACOSS analysis. The ACOSS research illustrates that countries that have had dramatic success in ing unemployment tend to be those which have invested heavily and strategically in employment assistance for unemployed people. For example, Denmark reduced unemployment from 9.6 per cent in 1993 to 5.4 per cent in 2004 by spending three times more on employment training and counselling than Australia does. Denmark spends 1.6 per cent of its gross domestic product on tive labour market programs-among the highest in the OECD. Australia spends just 0.5 per cent of GDP on such employment programs. Ireland devised a National AntiPoverty Strategy in the late 1990s which helped reduce unemployment from 11.3 per cent in 1996 to six per cent in 2004. It reduced long-term unemployment from four per cent in 1997 to 1.2 per cent in 2001. The Irish National Anti-Poverty Strategy resulted in increased numbers of people moving from welfare to work by boosting spending. In 2001, Ireland was spending 1.14 per cent of GDP on active labour market programs and had also raised the level of unemployment payments to reduce poverty. ACOSS has been calling on the government to create and implement a national antipoverty plan in Australia to tackle the combined issues of unemployment, poverty, homelessness, housing, education and other services. In Australia there are still many people who have been jobless for some time, despite relatively good economic times. The facts are that 330,000 people are on long term unemployment payments; 800,000 children in Australia are growing up in households where no-one has a job; 700,000 people, many of whom want to work, are on for disability support pension; and 600,000 parents, many of whom want to work, are on parenting pensions. The level of payment is not a significant factor in determining incentives to work. If a single person on an unemployment payment gets a full-time job at the lowerminimum wage, their income goes from approximately $200 a week to $400 a week. A Reserve Bank study of jobless people over time found that few people refuse job offers and concluded that a lack of job offers was the main reason people were still unemployed. The level of payment was not a causal factor in continuing unemployment. Effective marginal tax rates and a move in ac- the Welfare to Work bill towards putting more people on unemployment payments will act as a disincentive to work. The taper rate at which payment cuts out as people gain work is different for people on pension payments, disability support pension and parenting payments than for those on the unemployment payments of Newstart and youth allowance. People on unemployment payments lose 60c of every dollar they earn when they work, while those on pension payments lose 40c. A jobless single parent who gets 15 hours of minimum-wage work a week gets a 19 per cent increase in income if they are on an unemployment payment but a 32 per cent increase if they are on a pension payment. A jobless person with a disability who gets 15 hours of minimum-wage work a week gets a 38 per cent increase in income if they are on an unemployment payment but a 52 per cent increase if they are on a pension payment. Labor has called on the Howard government to offer a training bonus as a practical solution to move people from welfare into work instead of dumping single parents and people with a disability onto the dole. A training bonus would help with study costs such as books and transport for single parents and people with a disability. While Australia faces a skills crisis, the Howard government is stopping jobless Australians from getting the skills employers need. We need to be encouraging jobless Australians to gain skills so that they get off welfare and help the skills crisis, but the Howard government is leaving job seekers and the nation unprepared. Under the Howard government's incompetent welfare changes, when single parents and people with a disability are dumped onto the dole they will be refused access to the pensioner education supplement. This supplement acts as a bonus to working-age pension recipients who are improving their job prospects through approved training or education. Currently the pensioner education supplement provides $62.40 for full-time study and $31.20 for part-time study each fortnight. Blocking access to training shows how badly the Howard government has botched welfare reform. After all, a person only gets a job if they have the skills an employer needs. Debate interrupted.

202,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 7.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Community Carers",160
203,Ms KING,ADJOURNMENT,"Last year Qantas's net profit after tax was $648.4 million. In the same year, Coles Myer made a net profit of $678 million. These businesses are often held up as making a great contribution to the Australian economy. However, neither of these figures comes close to the contribution that carers make to the Australian economy. Many of us do not realise that the unpaid work carried out by carers equates to approximately $74.5 billion each year. Our carers are priceless, and I am fortunate enough to represent a community that has a great number of exceptional carers. Community care agencies in my district have been running a very successful local fix campaign to raise awareness of the looming resource crisis in the community care sector. As part of this campaign, they have published a book entitled The Never Ending Stories, a collection of stories from local carers who, day in, day out, make amazing personal contributions to our community. The Never Ending Stories brings together the experiences of 26 different carers, and the blatant honesty of their stories is both refreshing and very confronting. I would like to share some of them. This is Val's story: When my husband was diagnosed with an incurable disease it affects the one you love and you think you will spend the rest of your life with. Our life has been turned inside out, upside down and around. We can laugh and cry at the same time and, as a carer, I look into his eyes and I see the frustration as he is trying to tell me something that I want to hear. But he has no voice, his arms won't move, his legs are useless, he can still smile. You want to hold him and tell him everything will be all right, but you know that can't be and that he can't hold you. It's so hard. When I read this story to my husband, we cried. An anonymous carer wrote: I have moved away from old friends, lost my independence and my long companion, and although he is with me he is a patient these days instead of a husband and friend. I am happy to keep him here with me as long as I can get a day off every now and again. Helen Newcombe writes: You eventually find yourself tied into a life controlled by time. You must leave work on time, you have a specific time allowance to get the shopping done or you don't eat and there is no spare time to do the little things like going to the library or just to have a coffee with a friend after work. You have no time just for yourself, and it's like you are on call 365 days a year. Holidays are now a thing of the past. Another carer wrote: We miss the things we used to do as a family, like going on holidays together and enjoying having a family social life. There was not much time to maintain social connections really. Our financial status changed as well. This is the story of another carer: There are many arguments and tears in the first few months he is home, mostly because you feel what you can't see doesn't exist. I expected him to be capable of more than he was able to do. Sandra wrote: My role is different from parents whose main role is to nurture and help their children to develop. Instead, my role is to manage my son's condition and development. Having a child with a disability has opened up new doors for me. Skills that I have gained through having access to information, using a computer and discovering an ability to write have helped me deal with what life has thrown at me. These are but a few of the many stories that underline the extraordinary contribution that carers make to our community. The core theme of these stories is the desperate shortage of community care: shortages in respite places, home and community care, access to suitable accommodation and lack of support to carer organisations. The government has responded in the past two years with one-off payments to carers. Carers have accepted this money willingly, but that is not why they do the job. The money is helpful but what they are really after are community care services. In many areas across our communities they are at crisis point. Cuts to the Commonwealth-State Disability Agreement and continued failure to take responsibility for young people in nursing homes, some of whom are under 10, are just a couple of areas where the government could better support carers. State governments, of course, also have to share some of the responsibility in terms of community care services. I would like to conclude by congratulating Carolyn Barrie from the Ballarat District Nursing and Healthcare, Jen Pollard and Deb Whitecross from the City of Ballarat, as well as Angela Taylor from Linkages and Bill Weidner from the Ballarat Hospice. Most of all, I want to acknowledge the carers who shared their stories. All these stories together make up the The Never Ending Stories, about the Ballarat carers, the people they love and the lives they live every day. Well done. Qantas: 85th Anniversary",160
204,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"When the veterans of World War I returned to Australia they had unknowingly created the ANZAC legacy, which today still defines what it means to be an Australian. They epitomised the Australian values of mateship, patriotism, sense of adventure, courage, compassion and generosity. Two young and inspirational veterans of the Great War left Australia with another legacy: an iconic company which is also synonymous with these values and ideals created by the spirit of the ANZACs. This company is the second oldest airline in the world and, just last week, it celebrated its 85th birthday. Its company slogan, ‘Spirit of Australia', conjures up patriotism and pride in each and every Australian. This company is Qantas. I was honoured to attend the 85th anniversary celebrations in Brisbane. It was a fanfare of history, heritage and future plans for the company. This was particularly so with the newest aircraft soon to join the fleet, Airbus 380, on display. As the member for Maranoa I have a real connection with Qantas, because its first moments in history were forged in several parts of my electorate. At the 85th anniversary celebrations the growth of Qantas was summarised: ‘From Winton to the world'. Winton was the venue for the very first board meeting, in February 1921, and later that same year Qantas relocated to Longreach. In November 1922 the first passenger flight took off from Charleville, bound for Cloncurry. This inaugural flight took two days to complete and included an overnight stay in Longreach. The total distance of the trip was some 923 kilometres-a trip which would have taken some 10 days, had roads been passable, in the motor vehicles of that era. However, this first Qantas flight was three years in the making. In 1919, after returning from the Great War, Lieutenant William Hudson Fysh DFC and Lieutenant Paul MCGuinness DFC were commissioned to locate a suitable landing site for an air race between Great Britain and Australia. After working together on this task they realised that to break down the tyranny of distance for people in outback Australia, air travel would play a significant part in the future. These two men were backed by a prominent grazier, Fergus MCMaster, who helped raise the capital for these two progressive and visionary young Australians to register a business name and develop a company. In Brisbane, on 16 November 1920, Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services Ltd was born. I pay tribute to these pioneering men: Fysh, MCGuinness and MCMaster. They had a vision and a commitment to forge new frontiers. Today the name ‘Qantas' is an acronym for the original name and the company continues to remember its original roots and the the Australian spirit in many ways. The spectacular sight of a Qantas Boeing 747, which today forms part of the Qantas Founders Outback Museum in Longreach, is a reflection of how Qantas has never forgotten its heritage. However, the true Australian spirit of generosity, compassion and determination are reflected in the decision of Qantas management to help Australians in South-East Asia caught up in the tragedies of the terrorist bombing and also the natural disaster. Qantas assisted over 5,000 people, including holders of other airline tickets, to return to Australia from Bali after the two terrorist bombings. Transport was also provided to many more medical, consular, security and aid personnel to Bali. The Boxing Day tsunami also found many Australians stranded and yearning for family and friends back home. Once again, Qantas operated special flights to and from various countries which were devastated by this natural disaster to evacuate these stranded travellers. It also transported medical and charitable supplies free of charge. These more recent actions illustrate just how much Qantas reflects and resonates the real Australian spirit. For Australian travellers on Qantas, there is always a sense of ease felt when you step onto that Qantas plane with its famous flying kangaroo tail to make the journey home. It does not matter where you have been or how far you have travelled, Australians all over the world call this great nation home, and of course they know the great safety record of Qantas will get you home. My congratulations to all management and staff, both here and around the world, on the way they have upheld the visions of the original founders of Qantas: Fysh, MCGuinness and MCMaster. May their passion for flying live through Qantas forever. Education: Teachers",161
205,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise this evening to remember those who have been forgotten in the current debate about education standards. The Minister for Education, Science and Training is obsessed with assessment, national curriculum and elite universities, but what about teachers? They are pretty central to the education system. Teachers carry the most important responsibilities in our society: they are helping young people to achieve their potential, to the benefit of all in the commuUnlike nity, and they are creating the wealth and opportunities for young people of the future. I think it is about time the government went back to basics. The research shows that a good education comes as a result of good teachers. Dr Kenneth Rowe, Principal Research Fellow at the Australian Council for Educational Research, describes emphasis on ‘middle-class curricula' as ‘post-modernist claptrap'. He urges a focus on what matters most-that is, quality teachers supported by strategic professional development. Dr Rowe says the focus has been on school structures, which account for less than 15 per cent of variance in measures of student achievement. The minister complains about the quality of teacher training. But it has taken nine long years for this government to commit $30 million to it, only after it had stripped the university system of billions of dollars. The New South Wales government has diverted scarce state resources into retraining and accelerated teacher training through scholarships-areas that should have been funded by the Commonwealth. The Victorian government is subsidising teacher training from industry. Teachers, in my humble view, are underpaid, overworked and stressed more than ever. A recent survey by the Australian Education Union of more than 600 first-year teachers reveals a worrying level of disillusionment-a real problem for the Australian community. One young teacher told the AEU: ‘It is difficult to sustain the energy, the workload keeps increasing and I am increasingly teaching out of my area and not enjoying that experience.' Teachers may enter the profession on what we might regard as a competitive salary of $46,127 per annum but, after a short period, there is little incentive to stay when the best, most experienced teachers can only achieve full a maximum salary of $65,414 per year. the top end of the Public Service, where the salaries are rising in competition with the private sector, those who are most critical to a well-functioning and decent society-teachers, nurses and police-are being left behind, as is also the case with firefighters. How will current teacher shortages be met when young teachers are already disillusioned and around 50 per cent of teachers are now over 45 years of age? That is a real problem in terms of the regeneration of our teaching work force. It is also hard to see how teachers will be attracted and retained the when they witness the disillusionment of their principals. More than 500 of them told a recent AEU survey that they were disillusioned with the increasing workload. A major report by the Victorian Department of Education and Training, aptly entitled The privilege and the price, also paints a bleak picture of the health and well-being of the state's principals. In the past three years there has been a steady increase in the number of hours worked and 70 per cent of principals said that their workload had increased substantially. The result is that fewer people are applying for the position of principal. This illustrates that across the teaching profession, from young teachers to principals, there is a crisis of morale and commitment. I am not talking about a commitment to teaching but about a commitment in terms of just how far they can go to try to make the system work. But all the Howard government is interested in is blatant inequity. It is supporting the wealthy private schools at double the rate of government schools. What we need is a government that will invest in teachers, not just in better teacher training but in professional development, improved pay and far less bureaucracy. It is about time we were as passionate about the need to improve the quality of teaching as teachers are about the profession that they pursue. It might also be appropriate for us to start thinking about some of the old ways, where people used to compete for teacher scholarships, where the government paid the HECS fees and actually assisted with the education and the purchase of the books during their training. It worked in those days and we had people wanting to be teachers because it was competitive and interesting. I simply recommend to the House this evening: let's start focusing on the need to improve the quality and opportunities of the teaching forces throughout Australia at a state and territory level by a new partnership agreement between the Commonwealth government and the state and territory governments to teach our community that teachers are part of the leadership and that we are required to create opportunities for the future. (Time expired) Wind Energy",163
206,Mr BROADBENT,ADJOURNMENT,"In today's Melbourne Herald Sun under the heading ‘Wind won't replace coal', Craig Falconer wrote: No matter how many wind turbines the Bracks Government wants to disfigure the state with, we are still going to require coal-fired power stations to run in spinning reserve. At the recent hearing in Foster about the proposed Dollar wind energy site, an expert said 20,000 turbines would not reduce the amount of coal being burnt today. The wind industry doesn't want people to know this and now they're trying to stop people from South Gippsland appearing at the Macarthur wind energy hearing. All power to your arm, Craig Falconer from Dollar in South Gippsland. As a response to wind turbines being placed, even on the Molonglo Hills in this region, there is a lot of opposition to them. I am representing the opposition that is coming out of my electorate in South Gippsland. I am concerned for the amenity of the people and the preservation of the landscape. The Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Ian Campbell, has been addressing this issue and he has written to Steve Bracks, and I am sure to the other state and territory leaders, proposing an agreement to develop a national code for the location of wind farms. He says: A key component of this code should be an agreement that wind farms not be constructed against the wishes of the local community that will be most affected. He continues: I am most concerned that members of local communities are often being given only limited involvement in determining if a wind farm is to be established in the area. While wind technology is a part of the portfolio of power sources that the world needs to combat greenhouse gas emissions, it is vital that local communities, including those in often sensitive and scenic coastal areasthat is what I am talking aboutdo not have wind farms thrust upon them. If such action continues to be taken it will make wind farms increasingly unpopular and this will create animosity towards wind energy and be counterproductive to all our interests. I believe that we need a truly inclusive and consultative local planning process. As you would be aware, the EPBC Act currently allows me to regulate to define specified actions as requiring referral under the Act. Because I am so concerned about the growth in negative sentiment toward wind energy which is occurring as wind farms are established against the express views of the democratically elected councils, considering making a new regulation under the EPBC Act in relation to wind farms. This regulation would require all proposed wind farms to be referred under the EPBC Act. As you know, economic and social factors such as views of local councils and their communities would be relevant considerations in any decision I make to approve any wind farm following assessment. I would certainly be reluctant to approve a wind farm in the face of clear local opposition expressed through votes of shire councils. I also intend to examine my programmes to consider future funding arrangements for those wind projects that are clearly against the expressed wishes of the local community. There it is. I have called today for the Bracks government to accept the minister's opportunity and grab hold of this proposal for a national code for the location of wind farms. I do not like wind turbines. I do not like what they do to the landscape and I find that they are an inefficient renewable energy proposal. In fact, I would go so far as to say I will never offer South Gippsland as the sacrificial lamb to the gargantuan appetite of the feckless, burping juggernaut that the wind industry is. Mr Sercombe-Did you write that?",164
207,Mr BROADBENT,ADJOURNMENT,"I will not sacrifice the exquisite South Gippsland coastline on the altar of renewable energy. Yes, I wrote that. I will repeat it. I will not offer South Gippsland as the sacrificial lamb. I will not sacrifice the exquisite South Gippsland coastline on the altar of renewable energy. It is becoming a passion for me now that inappropriately placed wind turbine developments are industrial sites that are being placed close to our coastlines. They are not majestic to me; they are ugly. They are not the best form of renewable energy; they are inefficient. They disrupt power systems, as we have seen in New Zealand where they have virtually said, ‘This is driving us mad.' I am We have come to a time now where we have to be very careful about what we put up in this generation, live with for a generation and will take a generation to tear down. (Time expired) Falun Gong",165
208,Mr BOWEN,ADJOURNMENT,"Prospect) (7.50 pm)Tonight I wish to raise in the House the case of Mr and Mrs Li, residents of Blacktown, who are facing deportation to China. Mr and Mrs Li escaped China in 2000, fleeing persecution as members of Falun Gong. Their application for asylum in Australia has been rejected. The Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Mr Cobb, has declined to intervene in this case and grant them permanent residency. I want to stress that I have no particular quarrel with Minister Cobb in this regard. He has a very tough job to do. Many people can and do claim that they will be persecuted if they are forced to return to their country of origin. The minister needs to weigh up each of these claims, and this is not an easy task. He needs to sort the wheat from the chaff and sort out which applications are genuine and which are not. As I stress, it is not an easy job. However, I do implore the minister to change the decision to reject this claim and grant Mr and Mrs Li permanent residency. It is not just Mr and Mrs Li who say they will be persecuted if they have to return to China. Various independent, credible groups have outlined the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners in China. These include Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. There is also a fairly recent example of what can happen in cases very similar to this. Germany recently deported Mr Jiang Renzheng and his wife, Mrs Guo Rui. The German government were of the view that they were not senior enough to be persecuted if they returned to China-that they were low-level practitioners of Falun Gong and that they would not be likely to be persecuted. So they deported them back to China. On their return to China on 8 April, Mr Renzheng was arrested and sentenced to three years in a labour camp. The German government are now making desperate attempts to get them returned to Germany. Having seen this example of what can happen in circumstances like this, I would implore the minister to reconsider his decision, to examine this German case and to reflect sympathetically on the request of Mr and Mrs Li to remain in Australia. They have been granted a temporary extension to their visas and they are now due to return to China on 8 January 2006. But time is ticking on. We recently saw, of course, the application for asylum in Australia of the former Chinese diplomat Mr Chen Yonglin. Mr Yonglin, who was granted asylum after some consideration by the government, identified persecution of practitioners of Falun Gong as one of his roles, one of his jobs, as a functionary of Chinese government. I think this is something which needs to be taken into account by the government. We have Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, various independent assessments of the persecution of practitioners of Falun Gong and now we have Mr Chen Yonglin. Some estimates put the death toll of Falun Gong practitioners as high as 2,780 in China. I am sure no member of the House would like to see a situation where we had the chance to help Mr and Mrs Li and we sent them back to China and an unfortunate fate awaited them. We have a chance to help them. Minister Cobb needs to reflect on his decision. I recognise this is a complex case. recognise that Mr and Mrs Li have pursued their opportunities through the courts and have failed, and now their only hope lies with Minister Cobb. Minister Cobb has a very responsible position in this regard-he is now responsible for deciding whether to return them to China and to leave them in the hands of the Chinese government, with a questionable at best fate, or to grant them permanent residency in Australia. I would implore him to reflect on his decision and grant them permanent residency-as I think there is eminently justifiable evidence to do-to allow them to live in freedom and not put them at risk of persecution should they be forced to return to China. Bowman Electorate: Quiet Achiever Awards",165
209,Mr LAMING,ADJOURNMENT,"As the hundreds of school graduates from my electorate in Bowman are currently enjoying the great range of entertainment that is available to students and school leavers along the south-eastern Queensland coast, I know that all of them are thinking about the work, apprenticeship, study, vocational training and travel options available to them. I know that they all have just completed an extremely the demanding final year at high school, and I was privileged at each of their speech nights to acknowledge that by inaugurating a Quiet Achiever Award in each of the schools in my electorate. Tonight I would like to acknowledge the fine achievements attributed to those who won the award for the quiet achiever in each of the high schools. Those winners included Lauren Wuoti of Chisholm Catholic College. The speech night at the Logan Cultural Centre was a wonderful evening, and Lauren was warmly and enthusiastically acknowledged for her achievement. The popular Jason Nankervis from Cleveland District State High School was acknowledged at the Smith Street ComI munity Hall at their speech night, which was a packed-out evening. There was Jacqueline Macedo of Kimberly College, again at the Logan community cultural centre. This was followed by the school musical and, of course, her headmaster's speech, which proclaimed the virtues of the Finnish education system. At the Ormiston College graduation night at the Sleeman Centre in the seat of Bonner, my neighbouring seat-across those soporific undulations which one has to travel to get to the Sleeman Centre-Duncan Fox was acknowledged and given the Quiet Achiever Award, followed by a fantastic graduation address by former Victorian Premier, Jeff Kennett. Claire Marshall of Redlands College was the worthy recipient at the Redlands College speech night at the Christian Outreach Centre main auditorium. Minandi De Wilzem of Victoria Point State High School won the Quiet Achiever Award, and she is a South African permanent resident whose parents are only recent arrivals to Australia. Already Minandi has made an extraordinary contribution to Victoria Point State High School in her final year. Jonathan MCCallum was welcomed with great approbation from parents and students alike when he won the award at Wellington Point State High School. Jessica Ellmers of Alexandra Hills State High School was presented with the school's Volunteer Award by Mr Andrew Trim in my absence while in parliament. Finally, Michelle Day of Faith Lutheran College received the Service and Loyalty Award, presented by Mr Malcolm Cayley, again in my absence due to parliamentary commitments. Each of these students, among other colleagues as well, have made extraordinary contributions both to their school and to community. The intention of the Quiet Achiever Award was to recognise more than just conventional achievement in academic, sport and cultural areas and to recognise those that went beyond the school to make contributions to their community. I congratulate all graduating students from the seat of Bowman and particularly the winners of the Quiet Achiever Award. They received, in addition to certificates, leading autobiographies from the year in which those awards were made, and they will enter the community with numerous challenges. I can never say that I will know the challenges that a 17-year-old faces in entering the community in 2005 and 2006, but I can say that Bowman will be working hard to provide every opportunity available in the community, with things like a tertiary education available in the seat and integrated employment zones-opportunities for these great young Australians to remain in our seat rather than moving away to get an education in other locations and moving away from the seat forever. The challenge, of course, for these young leaders-and it is indeed a personal challenge-is to continue the great contributions they have made into the future. I congratulate them on, as Robert F Kennedy said, the tiny ripples of hope that they are responsible for, and I hope that they become great achievements in the years that follow.

Such things our troops are able to carry out their tasks. That example shows the wonderful concert manders in the field and by ordinary troops of our troops to think on their feet-and on what can be the kinds of problems you would never in Iraq our troops are concerned about roadside and places like that particularly but also in in the recent past. They have been devised with high explosive power, has been used to to create havoc where possible. Wherever the inrebuild Iraq, they can bring in these weapons and loss of life and limb. It is a credit to our troops to fight down those sorts of weapons. it is something that needs to be considered in area our troops happened upon a group actmanner.
