2,The Clerk,PETITIONS,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: National Flag To the honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: (1) The majority of Australians are completely satisfied with the existing Australian national flag. pray. (2) We therefore request that the House of Representatives ensures that the Australian national flag, as provided in Section (3) of the Flags Act, is not changed or replaced without first being voted upon by the people of Australia and passed by a majority of votes in a majority of States. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Chaney (from 19 citizens), Mr Fife (from 648 citizens), Mr Hawker (from 570 citizens), Mr Jull (from 47 citizens), Mr MCArthur (from 78 citizens), and Mr Reid (from 11 citizens). National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Austmlia draws to the attention of the House our strongest support for the existing National Flag. The Australian National Flag is the most important symbol of the Australian nation and our national unity, and has evoked deep feelings of honour and respect from many generations of Australians. Your petitioners therefore respectfully ask the House of Representatives to preserve our current Australian National Flag and to ensure that its design is not changed without the support of a referendum carried by the majority of Australians in the majority of States. by Mr Anderson (from 847 citizens), Mr Cobb (105 citizens), Mr Tim Fischer (from 87 citizens), and Mr Hicks (from 97 citizens). National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The Petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that: (1) We the undersigned wish to signify our strong opposition to any change in the design or colour of the Australian National Flag. (2) We believe that the current flag has served Australia well and will continue to do so in the future and represents a true manifestation of the Nation's history. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever by Mrs Bailey (from 16 citizens),  Mr MCGauran (from 198 citizens), and Mr Reid (from 23 citizens). National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia showeth that whereas: (1) They are completely satisfied with the design of the existing Austmlian National Flag. (2) They are aware it properly reflects the immutable characteristics of Australia, namely: (a) The Union Jack, itself the creation of three Christian crosses, represents the nation's historical origin and the source of its language and law; (b) The Southern Cross on an azure blue background signifying its geographical location on this planet Earth; (c) The large star depicting the advent of Federation in 1901. (3) They know the Flag has been a source of inspiration to generations of Australians in peace and war. (4) They recall that millions of native-born Australians and newcomers to these shores from other parts of the world have become united under its proud symbolism. (5) They are certain that any change to the Flag will produce division in the Australian community. Your petitioners therefore pray that your honourable House will: Propose and pass a motion that ""the existing Australian National Flag be changed only with the approval of the Nation as expressed in a referendum"". And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mrs Bailey (from 38 citizens), Mr Halverson (from 165 citizens), and Mr Webster (from 37 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia showeth that whereas: (1) They are completely satisfied with the design of the existing Australian National Flag.

Your petitioners therefore pray that your honoiIrable House will: Propose and pass a motion that ""the existing Australian National Flag be changed only with the approval of the Nation as expressed in a referendum"". And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Halverson (from 30 citizens). Television Program To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled, this petition from concerned parents and consumers respectfully requests that the Broadcasting Services Bill which will control Television and Pay Television, will: prohibit all considerably violent programs, prohibit indecent and obscene programs, (to protect the young and impressionable), prohibit blasphemous programs which denigrate religious faith or belief, establish strict, legally enforceable Standards National Flag for programs and hours, ensure that ""nothing is included that will offend against good taste or decency"", ensure that films are judged not as a whole, but each in its several parts, that the Bill underpins and supports pro-social media in spirit and intent, reject industry Codes that will sell-out Australia's defenceless children, exempt all classification criteria and hours from s149(d), ensure genuine consumer consultation, so that parents can have access to Program criteria information, and input into decision-making for their home environment. Because children are defenceless and helpless, they have no vote, no power, and no advocate other than you. And your petitioners as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Duncan (from 138 citizens), Mr Riggall (from 85 citizens), and Mr Smith (from 403 citizens). Unemployment To the Honourable, the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. We the undersigned who are Members of the Parish of St Augustine's, Balmain Community respectfully ask you to place the issue of unemployment before the Federal Parliament. We believe that such a serious and socially devastating problem needs to be addressed nationally in the hope that Strategies will be put in place to restore and support the working people of Australia. by Mr Baldwin (from 244 citizens), Abandon Gilgandra By-pass To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of residents of Gilgandra Shire draws to the attention of the House a Proposal in the NSW Road and Traffic Authority Inland Route Report Section 1.5.13 dated April 1991 to re route the Newell Highway which would then by pass the town of Gilgandra completely. The Newell Highway (SHI7) from Dubbo through Gilgandra to Coonabarabran links with both the Oxley and Castlereagh Highways at Gilgandra. The section between Dubbo and Gilgandra has been substantially upgraded and widened over recent years with at least four new bridges and The Jack Renshaw Bridge in Gilgandra constructed, while extensive work has also been undertaken between GUgandra and Coonabarabran and further work planned. The Federal Government is examining the possibility of designating this route as a National Highway and has initiated a further study of the above mentioned proposal (RTA 1991 Report). The residents of Gilgandra Shire are concerned that the future of the town will be jeopardised should the re routing of the highway proceed. Gilgandra has been financially strong for years supported by the rural community and particularly the motorists who use the Newell Highway through Gilgandra. This town is dependent on the income from the Newell Highway which supports many families in employment at motels, automotive dealers, general stores, service stations and 2 large 24 hour truck stops. Should the change of the highway take place Gilgandra will face total ruin forcing businesses to close resulting in the loss of hundreds of jobs and peoples livelihood. The severe hardship and mental stress this would cause would be beyond comprehension. ' Your petitioners therefore request the house to abandon the proposed Feasibility Study being undertakenÂ· by the Federal Government on this section of the highway and to give the residents of Gilgandra a guarantee that the highway will not be re routed. Please make sure your decision is not responsible for Gilgandra's devastation. by Mr Cobb (from 1,635 citizens). Meteorological Station Gladstone To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain electors of the division of Hinkler points out to the House the disadvantage of the regionalisation of the meteorological station in Gladstone. The disruption to station personnel and their families and the lack of personal service to the local community should this service be transferred to Rockhampton would be considerable. The Charter Fleet, trawlers and the considerable boating community rely heavily on the personal service provided by the staff in Gladstone. Your petitioners therefore request that the House should retain the staff in the meteorological station in Gladstone to service the local community. by Mr Courtice (from 16 citizens). Australia: Christian Commonwealth To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the }louse of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That we, the undersigned, call for the full and total recognition, by Federal Parliament and the High Court and all government agencies that Australia is a Christian Commonwealth according to law and its heritage traditions and customs. That as Australia prepares for the Centenary of Federation on 1st January, 2001 AD we celebrate our Centenary as a Christian Commonwealth as described by the Founders of Federation such as Sir John Downer, who said ""The Commonwealth will be, from its first stage a Christian Commonwealth and as stated in our Federal Constitution-""Relying on the Blessings of Almighty God. . . That our Federal Parliament therefore implement the following policies before 1st January, 2001 AD. (1) The Adoption of a Christian National An'them-""God Bless Australia"" to the tune of ""Waltzing Matilda"". (2) The adoption of a Christian National Motto-""One Nation Under God"", for use on our coins, banknotes, etc. (3) The appointment of practising Christians as Vice Regal Representatives of our Christian Queen, Elizabeth II. (4) The retention of our Christian Prayers at the daily opening of Parliament in the standing respectful presence of all Members of Parliament. (5) The retention of ""God Save the Queen"" for Vice Regal Functions as our Royal Anthem and as our National Hymn for all other civic functions. (6) The retention of Christian Christmas Carols in our State Schools and other civic functions during the Christmas Season. (7) Officially inform the United Nations and all the other nations of the world that Australia is a Christian Commonwealth. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your Honourable House will reaffirm our Christian Heritage as a Christian Commonwealth. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Courtice (from 13 citizens). National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the State of South Australia draws to the attention of the House our strongest objection to any attempt to alter Australia's existing national flag without seeking prior approval from the Australian people by way of referendum. The Australian National Flag has been the symbol of the Australian nation and of our national unity for over eighty years. Throughout history men and women have expressed their feelings for their country by showing honour and respect for their country's national flag. This flag must remain our emblem as a tribute to those who laid down their lives for our freedom. Your petitioners therefore respectfully ask the House of Representatives to preserve our current Australian national flag as a symbol of our national pride and identity. by Mr Downer (from 266 citizens). National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: 1. The majority of Australians are completely satisfied with the existing Australian national flag. 2. We therefore request that the House of Representatives ensures that the Australian national flag, as provided in Section (3) of the Flags Act, is not changed or replaced without first being voted upon and approved by the people of Australia in a national And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Fife (from 367 citizens). Rights of Independent Contractors To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: 1. The majority of Australians believe that independent contractors playa vital role in keeping Australia internationally competitive. 2. We therefore request that the House of Representatives gives every considemtion to protecting the current rights of independent contractors. And yoUr petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr MCArthur (from 68 citizens). Proposed Superannuation Act To the Honoumble the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain Horticulturalists of the Riverland Region of South Australia, draws to the attention of the House. the request that. . . NA LABOURERS BE EXEMPT FROM THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE PROPOSED SUPERANNUATION ACT. Your petitioners therefore request the House to.. ; ..consider the unworkable nature of the proposed Superannuation Legislation when the harvesting of Horticultural produce requires the employment of numerous short term labourers creating enormous . difficulties in implementing Superannuation requirements. ..exempt employers of casual labourers from the requirements of the proposed Superannuation Legislation and of the proposed Superannuation Guarantee Levy requirements. by Mr MCLachlan (from 185 citizens). Call for General Election To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Bendigo draws to the attention of the House the significant level of unemployment in Australia, and its effect on the well being of the community and the Country. We particularly draw to your attention the poll. increase in the level of unemployment during the past 12 months, which has jumped from 8.1 % to 10.6%, and is expected to rise further. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House of Representatives, in Parliament assembled, should request the Australian Government to: Immediately call on the Governor-Geneml to issue the writs for a general election to provide an opportunity for all Australians to decide upon the economic direction of the Nation. by Mr Reid (from seven citizens). National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of certain citizens of Australia showeth: The need forÂ· the Government to recognise that our Flag represents History, Heritage and Culture and should not be changed without a full referendum of the people. Your petitioners humbly pray that the House of Representatives call upon the Government to retain our existing Australian Flag and to give Australians the opportunity to express that wish through a referendum. Your petitioners, as in duty bound, will .ever pray. by Mr Sharp (from 235 citizens). National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of the electors of the division of Bass call upon the House to urge the Federal Government to leave the current Australian Flag as it is and call upon the House to ensure that no changes should ever take place without the consent of all Australians by Referendum. by Mr Smith (from 726 citizens). Medicare: Abortions To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That every human being, from the first instance of fertilization, is of unique and precious value, not only to him/herself, but also to hisjher parents and to the community at large. That every abortion kills a human being before hisjher birth. That the right to life of all human beings is the most fundamental of all human rights according to article 3 of the 1948 UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights. That the primary duty of the Parliament is to protect this inalienable right to life of all citizens, born and unborn. That in 1989/90 alone, medical benefits were paid for almost 70,000 abortions at a cost to Australian tax-payers of $7.8 million. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament will protect the right to life of all Australian citizens before birth by ceasing to fund abortions through Medicare and by other means at its disposal. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Webster (from 14 citizens). National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that we are extremely distressed at the Prime Minister'S intention to change the flag without real consultation with the Australian people. Thousands of Australians fought and died under our present flag. We believe it would be an insult to their memory to change the flag, particularly in an underhanded way. We are disgusted that on the eve of ANZAC Day the Prime Minister lowered our nation's dignity by questioning our flag in front of a foreign audience in Indonesia. Your petitioners therefore ask that the House do everything in its power to ensure any decision on the future of the Australian flag is decided by all the Australian people by way of a referendum and not by the Government, which sits isolated from the Australian people in its ivory tower in Canberra. Your petitioners, as in duty bound, do ever pray. by Dr Bob Woods (from 197 citizens). Petitions received. NA Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority",10
3,Mr OKEEFE,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"On behalf of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority and in the absence of the Chairman, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) on parliamentary business overseas, I present the report of the Committee entitled Legal Casinos and Organised Criminal Activity. Ordered that the report be printed.",14
4,Mr OKEEFE,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"Under paragraph 55(1)(d) of the National Crime Authority Act 1984 it is the duty of the Committee to examine trends and changes in criminal activities, practices and methods and report to both Houses of the Parliament any change which the Committee thinks desirable to the functions, structure, powers and procedures of the Authority. Pursuant to this duty the Committee decided in December 1990 to conduct an inquiry into aspects of the establishment and operation of legal casinos in Australia. The report I have just presented announces that the Committee has decided not to pursue this inquiry at this stage. 1\vo members of the Committee, the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) and Senator CrichtonBrowne, have dissented from this decision. The Committee emphasises in the report that it is not terminating its inquiry; it is merely suspending it. Early in the next Parliament the Committee will review the decision to suspend its inquiry. The report sets out the background to the Committee's decision and I will briefly summarise the reasons. Since the Committee decided in December 1990 to undertake the casino inquiry, three other inquiries commenced which have looked at aspects of possible criminal involvement in legal casinos. The Committee wishes to avoid . duplicating the work of these inquiries. The first is the Street inquiry in New South Wales. On 6 August 1991, the New South Wales Government announced an inquiry into the establishment and operation of legal casinos in New South Wales. The inquiry was headed by the Honourable Sir Laurence Street and reported in November 1991. Of direct relevance to the Parliamentary Joint Committee's inquiry, the Street report stated that the regulatory scheme proposed for the New South Wales casinos was one: . . . in which the casinos can be protected from criminal influence and exploitation, kept free money laundering and maintained as places for honest gaming. The Street report also identified the exchange of operating information and criminal intelligence and the establishment of a database to assist in the licensing processes for casino operators and staff as areas in which a nationally coordinated approach would be of benefit. The report also considered that a more fonnal and structured approach was highly desirable in these areas. The second inquiry that I refer to is the National Crime Authority's inquiry into money laundering. In December 1990 the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) gave a reference to the NCA to investigate money laundering. As a result of the NCA's work on that reference, it became apparent that one aspect of investigations would be the extent to which legal casinos would or could be used to launder money. In February 1992, the National Crime Authority reported to the Attorney-General on its inquiry. The non-confidential parts of the report were released to the public last month. The NCA inquiry brought to light no known cases whereby casinos were used to conceal the origin of criminal funds. Casinos were not found to be used for laundering money in Australia in the commonly accepted view of the phrase. However, the NCA inquiry did identify some matters of concern in relation to casinos. The NCA has recommended that: The Attorney-General refer the NCA's findings in relation to the casino industry to the appropriate State Governments, with the recommendations that: (i) consideration be given to the establishment of a National Casino Standards Organisation; and (ii) junket operators should be - licensed and all participants on junket tours should be fully identified. The Attorney-General is preparing the Government's response to this report. Thirdly, there is the Western Australian Royal Commission which was established in January 1991. It was appointed in Western Australia to inquire and' report on whether, amongst other matters, there had been corrupt, illegal or improper conduct by anyone in the from affairs of the.Western Australian Government or its agencies in respect of the Burs,wood Island Casino. The Parliamentary Joint Committee has also received evidence on this matter. The Royal Commission sat in June and July 1991 for some 25 days hearing evidence and argument on the Burswood matter. It has not yet reported. In view of the findings and recommendations of the Street and NCA inquiries, and the fact that the Western Australian Royal Commission has heard casino related evidence but has not yet reported, the Committee considers it would be unproductive to pursue its inquiry at this stage. When, early in the next Parliament, the Committee reviews its decision to suspend the inquiry, it will take into account any action by governments in response to the Street and NCA inquiries and whether the Western Australian Royal Commission has reported and sufficient time has elapsed for its findings to be acted upon. Finally, the Committee expresses its appreciation to all those who have made submissions and in other ways assisted its inquiry. On behalf of the Chairman-who, as I mentioned earlier, is overseas on Government business-I want to convey the appreciation of the Committee for the efforts of our staff and the work that they have done on this inquiry to date.",14
5,Mr FILING,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"I want to indicate my dissent from the decision of the Committee to suspend the inquiry. My view is based on a number of reasons for which I will refer, more or less directly, to my dissenting report. During the next year or so, applicants will be selected and new casinos will be opening in Cairns, Brisbane, Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne and on Christmas Island. The deferral of the inquiry will mean that the Committee's findings will not be available during the licensing and establishment of these new casinos. By delaying its findings, the Committee risks trying to shut the stable door after the horse has bolted. This is compounded by the fact that the Committee's inquiry was the first opportunity for the general community to comment on casinos as a national issue. I turn to the issue of the Christmas Island casino. Christmas Island will rely on its casino as its principal source of income. This will put extra pressure on casino regulators to overlook irregularities in order to keep the casino operating and the revenue coming in. It is planned that the Christmas Island casino will be administered under Western Australian legislation. That Western Australian legislation has been strongly criticised in relation to the licensing process for the Burswood Island casino. It is a matter of regret that Casino IslandMr Downer-It may as well be called Casino Island.",16
6,Mr FILING,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"Yes, as the honourable member for Mayo says, perhaps it should be called Casino Island. It is a matter of regret that the Christmas Island casino is going ahead with no public inquiry at all. The relationship between crime and legal casinos, raised in the NCA's report and elsewhere, is still a matter of concern. It is our view-that is, the authors of the dissenting report-that the submissions made to the Committee substantiate the need for the continuation of the inquiry and the opportunity to further examine witnesses. I turn now to the arguments raised by the Committee to substantiate my view that the Committee's inquiry has been put into cold storage. The Committee's report cites the report of the 1991 inquiry into the establishment and operation of legal casinos in New South Wales, headed by the Hon. Sir Laurence Street, and the National Crime Authority's report Taken to the Cleaners: Money Laundering in Australia, December 1991, to support its view that the Committee's inquiry should be suspended. The Committee's report states: The statement in the Street Report that the provisions of the draft Casino Control Bill would protect casinos from 'criminal influence and exploitation, kept free from money laundering and maintained as places for honest gaming' was qualified in the same paragraph as follows: Ultimately, the measure of success in achieving an honest, crime-free gaming environment will depend upon the capacity, commitment and diligence of the administration and enforcement of the mechanisms and controls. The stature and independence of the (Casino Control) Authority and philosophy of 'people watching people watching people' , embodied in the statutory scheme, as well as the requirement of accountability through reporting to Parliament, justified confidence in the quality of the administration and enforcement of the mechanism and controls. The same report warned of the need for care in the use of documents produced in other contexts in support of arguments to his inquiry that were critical of the casino industry. In particular, there was a paper the Gambling in Australia, produced by the Australian Institute of Criminology in 1990, that was used by a number of submissions to the Street inquiry. In paragraph 2.3.4, the Street report described how the Institute's view in Gambling in Australia fitted into the framework of the report. By emphasising the central tenets of effective regulation, adequate and workable powers, allocation of sufficient resources for the regulatory task and an active commitment on the part of government to achieving the regulatory goals, the Institute pinpointed the importance of the behaviour of those responsible for proper licensing, supervision and review procedures to ensure that the opportunity for corruption is kept to an absolute minimum. In order to prevent criminal infiltration, the Street report called for a national system for the coordination of information exchange, intelligence gathering and assessment of operators and employees. These views were supported by the National Crime Authority'S report into money laundering. It recommended that the Attorney General refer the NCA's findings in relation to the casino industry to the appropriate State governments with the recommendations that consideration be given to the establishment of a national casino standards organisation and that junket operators should be .licensed and all participants on junket tours should be fully identified.",16
7,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEE REPORTS,Order I The time allotted for the debate has expired. Motion (by Mr O'Keefe) proposed: That the House take note of the report.,17
8,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"In accordance with sessional order 102B, the debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology",17
9,Mr FERGUSON,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, I present the Committee's report entitled The Shipbuilding Industry: In the Wake of the Bounty, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the Committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",17
10,Mr FERGUSON,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"In conducting this inquiry, the Committee was concerned to ensure that the industry maintained its competitive edge and realised its full potential through continuing development of technological expertise, better training and use of skilled personnel. The Committee received 60 submissions and 85 exhibits and recorded over 700 pages of evidence from public hearings in Adelaide, Cairns, Canberra, Fremantle, Launceston, Melbourne, Newcastle and Sydney. The Committee visited eight shipyards in six centres around Australia. These sites provided a very worthwhile overview of a diversified industry, ranging through successful pleasure craft, catamarans and ANZAC ships construction. The recent history of the Australian shipbuilding industry entails considerable changes in structure and direction. The key developments have been the rationalisation of the number of shipyards, improved technology, a move away from steel to aluminium and an orientation towards export markets. The industry now focuses on the production of fishing vessels, luxury yachts, high speed ferries, tugs and smaller commercial and naval vessels. Between 1984 and 1989, export orders for Australian built ships increased from nil to $15Om. This year exports of these vessels will account for over $200m. Shipbuilders specialising in lightweight materials secured most of these orders. They are considered to be world leaders and currently have 10 per cent of the global market share of lightweight high speed vessels. The latest example of innovative design and technology produced by this sector is the development of 74-metre wave piercing catamaran ferries for the international market. While this occurred, there has, however, been a downturn in industry employment. Those working for registered shipbuilders fell from 2,900 in June 1989 to a little under 1,900 in May 1991. Hopefully, the success of the lightweight sector of the industry will increase confidence within the private sector and lead to greater investment in the shipbuilding industry overall. The production of large steel-hulled ships in' Australia has declined markedly over the last two decades. However, shipbuilders have a market opportunity over the next decade as the world fleet of bulk carriers requires replacement. This expectation has prompted a proposal for a major shipbuilding and marine engineering facility at Port Kembla on the New South Wales south coast. The private sector has shown interest and, given the employment potential, the Committee considers that further examination of the viability of the project is warranted. Accordingly, the Committee recommends that the Government contribute up to half a million dollars towards a feasibility study of the project, provided that the private sector is prepared to contribute at least 75 per cent of the cost of the study. Australian shipbuilders have, since 1947, received aÂ· bounty to assist them in meeting the cost of ship construction. These payments were initially restricted to vessels for use in Australia coastal waters. In 1984 the bounty was extended to cover eligible vessels built for export. In 1988 the Industries Assistance Commission reviewed the bounty and concluded that, while the bounty enabled industry to enter export markets, it was not encouraging a viable, efficient industry. As a result of that report, the bounty is being phased out, ending in July 1995. While the Committee agrees with the conclusions of the Industry Assistance Commission report, it recognises the concern of the industry that, as it is being phased out in Australia, there is a significant problem whereby some competitor nations are continuing to subsidise their shipbuilding industries both directly and indirectly. The Committee considers that the Government needs to examine some other ways to assist the industry to maintain its liability. Other assistance to the industry currently provided by the Government includes export enhancement, research and development schemes, import duty concessions and export finance. The Committee recommends that such schemes be consolidated and their delivery to the industry be improved. Government regulations which affect the industry can be both industry specific and general. The Committee is aware that general industry regulations such as labour market provisions, oc-upational health and safety requirements and environmental protection measures can serve to increase manufacturers' costs and decrease international competitiveness. The Committee considers, however, that many of these regulations establish workplace and social standards which reflect community expectations and therefore should be accepted as part of the cost of production. The Committee notes that some reform of labour market regulations, specifically in the development of enterprise based agreements, is occurring, which will assist the industry. One example of industry specific regulation which has a major impact on the shipbuilding industry is the uniform shipping laws code. Complaints were received that the USL is administered differently in the various States. The Committee recommends that the States and Commonwealth review the administration of the USL to ensure that it is enforced uniformly throughout Australia. A major issue currently facing the shipbuilding industry is the provision ofÂ·adequate financing for shipbuilding loans. We note the timely conference on innovative financing for the industry convened in Sydney late last month. This joint venture of DITAC, EPIC and legal and financial fields signals this major problem for this sector of the economy. The principal financier for these loans is often the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation. Two areas of concern to shipbuilders are the time delays in processing loan applications and EPIC's policy of taking only 30 per cent to 50 per cent of the value of a .vessel as security for a loan. The Committee recommends that EPIC review its policy, so that it accords more closely with overseas financiers, otherwise our exporters face major impediments. It is expected that some of the causes for complaints will be eased by changes made to EPIC in November last year. The Committee recommends that the effectiveness of these changes in allowing EPIC to become more market orientated be reviewed later this year. A significant cause of delay in loan approvals is the lack of adequate information provided by exporters themselves. Shipbuilders need to be more aware of the information needs of EFIC to streamline application processing, and the Committee recommends that EFIC prepare an information kit for use by the industry. There is a widespread concern among shipbuilders over the level of, and fluctuations in, Australian interest rates. These adversely effect the provision of competitive financing for shipbuilding loans. The Committee considers that the creation of special tax free savings accounts, as a means of creating investment funds for Australian industry, should be examined. Government assistance in export matketing for the shipbuilding industry is provided by Austrade. Comments received by the Committee on the value of Austrade ranged from very supportive to extremely negative. Austrade's preferred approach for the industry is to work with sectoral interest groups, such as the Australian Ferrybuilders Association and the Australian Marine Export Group, to foster an awareness of Australian shipbuilders. in overseas markets. While Austrade could not place a value on the service it supplies to shipbuilders, Austrade's presence does assist in marketing the shipbuilding industry overseas. The Committee believes that to pass final judgment on the adequacy of Austrade in assisting the shipbuilding industry will be premature, as the changes recommended by the MCKinsey and Co. review are still being implemented. Small companies, such as builders of leisure and leisure craft, often fall outside the guidelines for Austrade's services, and the Committee suggests that steps should be taken to encourage the greater use of the export access program by these finns. The importance of research and development to the future of the industry was stressed throughout the inquiry. This research and development, however, must be responsive to the needs of the industry. The Committee notes that in December 1991 the Government announced approval for the establishment of the Australian Marine Engineering Cooperative Research Centre. The Committee considers that the Cooperative Research Centre approach is appropriate to meet the demand for research and development facilities. Its progress, research outcomes and level of usage by industry will indicate whether the establishment of a federally funded research centre is warranted. The major avenues for Government support for research and development are via the 150 per cent tax concession and through programs such as the industry research and development grants scheme, the national procurement development program and the advanced manufacturing technology development program. The Committee is concerned about the confusion amongst shipbuilders as to what research and development grants are available and their reluctance to apply for assistance because of difficulties with the bureaucratic process. There is a need for DITAC to more closely coordinate these assist-nce schemes and to improve their delivery to the industry. In building for the future, the shipbuilding industry must look to its training needs. University courses in naval architecture are viewed by many in the industry as less practical and up-to-date than required,Â· owing to the rapidly changing technology used by the industry. There is a need to combine practical and theoretical knowledge in such a way that graduates have immediately useful skills when entering the industry. More flexibility in the structure of courses offered would benefit the industry by providing graduates with both sound theoretical backgrounds and relevant practical experience. The Committee is of the view that while a formal four-year naval architecture degree may not be necessary to undertake boat and ship design successfully or to oversee construction projects, there isa growing need for some fonnal qualifications to be held, particularly as the skill base of the industry increases. The Committee therefore recommends that the Australian Shipbuilders Association and the boat manufacturers, in conjunction with the Australian division of the Royal Institution of Naval Architects, draw up minimum qualifications for registration as a boat or ship designer. Shipbuilders were enthusiastic about the benefits of the apprenticeship scheme. The Committee endorses the emergence of enterprise based educational programs and suggests that the Commonwealth work with the States, industry and unions to develop a system of training wages based on percentage of full adult wages, incorporating the recognition over time of increasing skills attainment. Naval procurement has a major impact on the shipbuilding industry. The Department of Defence has in place policies to encourage Australian content in its acquisition programs. The high levels of local production in the submarine and ANZAC ship projects reflect its approach. Australian involvement in these programs is likely to have flow-on effects for Australian industry involvement in major defence contracts in the future, and hence export opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region and in its offshore oil and gas projects. In conclusion, I would like to thank the Committee members. A very tight schedule was kept to in the last month to finalise these matters. I would also like to thank the Committee staff, particularly for their work in period. I commend the report.",17
11,Mr FORD,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"As the honourable member for Reid (Mr Fetguson) has said, the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology is tabling its report titled The Shipbuilding Industry: In the Wake of the Bounty following an inquiry into the that industry. The honourable member h-s given an excellent summary of that report. For an island nation with the largest warmwater coastline in the world and the. advantages of a developed economy and abundant natural resources, our shipbuilding industry has not been as successful as it should be. For a nation which in total tonnage of goods exported ranks second in the world, our shipbuilding industry has been singularly lacking. Australia ships only a small percentage of its exports in Australian owned ships and an even smaller percentage, in fact a positively minute proportion, in Australian constructed vessels. Shipyards such as those that once existed in Whyalla and which were capable of building large vessels disappeared some 20 years ago. Similarly, many smaller yards, such as Carringtons in Newcastle, have almost disappeared. There is no doubt that we have the skills in design and manufacturing that are the basis for an industry such as shipbuilding, as was outlined by the honourable member for Reid. However, we have not been able to organise appropriate marketing and financial services in a way that would benefit this industry. In general, in the two areas left to private industry-design and manufacture-we seem to be quite competitive. Yet when it comes to services either controlled or offered by the Government, we fall down. During this inquiry, members of the Committee visited most major yards in Australia, as the honourable member for Reid has indicated. They also visited support facilities, held inquiries in all States, and are now tabling what I believe to be a very worthwhile and thought-provoking report. In the Wake of the Bounty examines aspects of the industry which are the most prosperous, that and explains why. It also investigates the areas of shipbuilding which are not currently buoyant, anq suggests reasons why this has happened and what might be done to improve the industry. A major feature of In the Wake of the Bounty is its discussion on the potential of the industry, which I believe is considerable. Shipbuilding in Australia should be a basic industry, an industry in which we could, if we applied the correct policies, be very successful-and not just in niche markets as we are at the moment. Australians are already world leaders in the design and construction of high-speed, lightweight vessels up to 40 metres, as was suggested by the honourable member for Reid. AMECON in Melbourne is building worldclass naval surface vessels at what was formerly the Williamstown Naval Dockyard. We are building world-class submarines at the Australian Submarine Corporation yard at Port Adelaide. It is interesting to note that in the first instance these yards are successful, almost in spite of the hazardous financial packages offered in Australia. In the case of the naval vessels, of course, and the submarines, the actual finance is being provided by the Australian taxpayer. What Australia needs is to have this industry working within a simple set of guidelines, supported by financial arrangements which are both competitive and predictable. Indeed, almost without exception, those people in the industry who contributed to the report spoke of finance being a significant and continuing problem. For example, a few words from the Australian Shipbuilders Association's submission to the inquiry clearly illustrate this point. The submission stated: Undoubtedly the biggest single factor which addressed aggressively would do much to enhance this industry is the provision of readily available finance for ship owners, packages which at match those of overseas countries. Mr J. Rothwell from Austral Ships Pty Ltd put the problem even more succinctly: We could probably double our orders at the moment if we could get a more substantial more attractive finance package out of Australia. In recent months speakers from both sides the House have called for the introduction a tax-free savings scheme in Australia. The honourable member for Fraser (Mr and Langmore), the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) and I have suggested various schemes, all of which are based on a similar concept. The report recommends should examination of such schemes. I will quickly outline one such scheme morning. The main features of such a scheme are: interest on the deposits is !ax free; size of the deposits and interest accrued have no effect on other social payments; the maximum limit on deposits will be, say, a quarter of a million dollars; interest payable will be 2112 to 3 112 per cent. In particular, it is dear that high and unpredictable interest rates contribute to lack of competitiveness in the international marketplace. They drain the confidence of individuals in an industry. A finance package negotiated at 10 per cent interest can be business. However, if that interest rate denly becomes 20 or 25 per cent, it can spell disaster-and it has. In contrast to Australia, countries such Japan enjoy a significant advantage of interest rates, as such countries have benefited from a long established policy of encouraging domestic savings. For example, in Japan, individuals have been able to make deposits in Maruyu-type accounts. The pool of capital established by small savers investing in those accounts has provided funds for much of the rebuilding of the Japanese economy. For instance, at the end of March 1986, 25 per cent of all personal deposits in Japan were held in this manner, representing some 20 per cent of total savings. There is no reason why the same principle if cannot be applied in Australia. Accumulated funds would become a source of cheaper funds for the development of export industries least involving shipbuilding; import replacement production, such as replacements for ships; and high-tech projects, such as robots and laser development which can contribute to manufacturing techniques. Such a fund would or a be controlled by the Commonwealth Development Bank. This institution has a proven track of record and is the appropriate bank to adof minister such a scheme. Deposits in such a fund should be tax free earn interest at a rate of around 3 per cent. The minimum deposit limit would be between $150,000 and $250,000. However, the size of the deposit and the interest earned not affect a person's eligibility to other entitlements. As I said, access to the fund this should be controlled by the Commonwealth Development Bank. Finance at 5 per cent the would be available only to, say, Australianwill owned companies. That certainly would help security the shipbuilding industry. The charter of the Commonwealth Developand, ment Bank embraces the establishment and development of business ventures, including primary production and small business. In its a role as manager of the tax-free savings accounts, the bank would be directed to become proactive as the administrator of high priority projects in industries such as shipbuilding. good The aim of this proposal is to encourage sudsavings in Australia while simultaneously encouraging the development of industries such as shipbuilding which can contribute to as genuine employment and opportunities for in respect wealth creation. Another area where significant progress has already been made is in industrial relations. The shipbuilding industry should be commended for its success in this area. AMECON, with union agreement, has dramatically cut the numbers of unions on the site and revolutionised productivity. Productivity increases are on average nearly 800 per cent, with some aspects of production increasing by over 2,000 per cent. Likewise, the submarines are being built very efficiently. The smaller yards are nonunionised and have high productivity and employer involvement in agreements. In the Wake of the Bounty lists many excellent recommendations, which I trust will be implemented. However, there is one aspect which is general to shipbuilding and covered in this report, and that is the application and retention of intellectual property. The expertise build-up in the various establishments should not be lost due to the lack of continuity of work. The problem with re-establishing a shipbuilding industry is that we are more or less just re-inventing the wheel. The shipbuilding skills, for instance, at Whyalla have been lost. The shipbuilding skills at Carrington in Newcastle have largely been lost. The engineering and technical expertise now assembled at AMECON should never be lost. This matter was raised by Dr John White, the Managing Director of AMECON. He expressed the concern that having established a.world-class facility, it should not be allowed to disappear-likewise, with the Australian Submarine Corporation. Many of its developed skills, such as the welding techniques employed, are world class. Its largest subcontractor, Rockwells, which is providing the fire control system or the electronic fighting capability of the submarine, have assembled a world-class technical team. This team comprises over 150 highly skilled technical people, and all but a few are Australians. Some countries have such a wealth of enterprise, they can afford to lose an occasional industry in a recession. Australia does not have that luxury. Once lost, these skills or intellectual property will be difficult and costly to replace. I commend the report to the House. I thank the secretarial staff and I thank all members of the Committee for their endeavours. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-The time allotted for statements on this report has expired. Does the honourable member for Reid wish to move a motion connected with the report to enable it to be debated on a future occasion? Motion (by Mr Ferguson) proposed: That the House take note of the paper. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-In accordance with sessional order 102B the debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. NA Parliamentary Delegation to Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Hungary",20
12,Mr MACKELLAR,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Hungary, July-August 1991. We were extraordinarily fortunate to have visited the four former Eastern Bloc countries following the very recent downfall of their communist regimes. What I will be saying today mirrors, to a very large extent, what the President of the Senate has said in presenting the report in that chamber. We were also extraordinarily fortunate in meeting the leaders in each of those countries that I have mentioned-in most cases, the President, Prime Minister and Foreign Minister and number of other Ministers as well. Not only did we meet, of course, the people in senior administrative positions and political positions, but we took every opportunity to meet as many of the citizens of these countries as we possibly could. In Poland, we were both privileged and intrigued to meet President Lech Walesa, who was, of course, one of those most closely associated with the ousting of the communists in Poland. The example of the success of Solidarity led by Walesa encouraged public expressions of opposition by dissident movements in other countries of the region. One could legitimately say that in many senses Poland kicked the whole process off. As we went around, we were struck by the political and economic problems facing each of the countries. They simply cannot be overestimated. As an example, Lech Walesa told us that he much regretted that there was not an historic blueprint for the conversion from a communist command economy to a market economy. Each country faces in a very real sense a catch-22 situation: without a stable political environment, foreign investors will be discouraged; without foreign investment to assist in the funding. of economic recovery, political instability is bound to continue. One of the great problems that is faced by these countries is that the expectations that so many people have following the move away from communism simply cannot be achieved in the short term. We have found that crippling levels of foreign debt discourage foreign investment and trade. For example, Bulgaria's foreign debt of $US 11 billion is almost 25 per cent its gross national product. It is simply unable to service the debt. We went to several places which demonstrated in a very real sense the economic downturn. One of the most evident of these was the city of Lodz, a large industrial centre that we visited in Poland. As we went through Lodz we passed block after block of factories which had closed down. Unemployment in that city exceeded 30 per cent when we were there. I mention Lodz because it was the main centre in Poland for the processing of Australian wool. We found that our market for wool in Poland has now collapsed. It serves as an example of the plight of industry in eastern Europe because its manufacturing plant and its processes are outmoded and inefficient. Without substantial investment in new plant and technology there is very little prospect that Polish industries can successfulreforms ly compete in world markets. Without investment there are no funds to purchase raw materials or to provide jobs, and in a very real sense it is a downward spiral. But there has been a benefit from the factory closures in many of these countries and that benefit has been the reduction in the level of pollution. One of the other things that has improved, of course, is that we now have a newer fleet of cars and buses in a lot of these countries. The pollution emanating from the old cars and buses was absolutely horrific. As the countries change and more new cars are available, then pollution from motor vehicle emissions will hopefully lessen. But the disastrous legacy of the communist promotion of heavy industry fuelled mainly by the inefficient burning of brown coal is polluted air, poisoned rivers and forests which have been destroyed by acid rain. It was very clear, for instance, from the level of pollution in the Danube that the river is just a great drain taking heavy metals and other pollutants through to the Black Sea. It is a very difficult problem to overcome and one which will require a very great capacityfor cooperation between the countries involved. One of the other things that really struck us was the safety of the Soviet built reactors in of the nuclear power stations dotted throughout eastern Europe. That is a real cause for concern. The authorities are aware of the danger but because of their requirements for energy production the reactors simply cannot be closed down unless there is massive Western assistance with the provision of alternative sources of energy. We believe there is a really great opportunity for clean Australian coal to find a market in these countries. There is in all of the countries a general commitment to the development of a market economy, but there are significant differences between the countries and the nature and pace of change. There are also differences amongst political parties and groups in each country about the way reform should be accomplished and the pace of that reform. I believe that there is no doubt that political and economic are painful and will continue to be painful. There is an abiding fear that loss of faith in the benefits to be won from reform may result in the return to power of the communists. There were some indications of that in conversations that we had in the countries that we visited. One of the very great factors in all of this is the disintegration of the Soviet Union since the delegation's visit. That has had a marked impact on eastern and central Europe because most of the former Soviet's satellites were dependent on the Soviet Union for more than 50 per cent of their trade. That trade has now evaporated. The countries have to change not only their political focus but also their trade relationship. Certainly, as former Soviet republics emerge from their current difficulties, there will be considerable market opportunities to be won, particularly in the more developed republics. I think particularly of the Ukraine when I mention that. But that is of really small comfort to the countries of east-central Europe which need to establish beneficial trade relations immediately. There was a very strong conviction in each of the countries that we visited that they must gain membership of the European Community as soon as possible. The facts are that that membership will not be granted quickly in my view. It really needs a significant effort part of the European Community to appreciate the difficulties of these newly independent democratic countries and do what it can to bolster the democratic forces which are presently in control. The long years of communist domination .served to contain simmering nationalist rivalries among the various ethnic groups in these countries. But, with the downfall of the communist governments and the lifting of social repression, ethnic tensions unfortunately now have risen again to the surface. In some cases those tensions have boiled over, as we have seen in Yugoslavia and several former Soviet republics. Hungary's interests in the Hungarian minority in Romania continue to strain relations between those two countries, and Czechoslovakia is threatened with partition by calls for Slovak independence. The tensions throughout the region make the implementation of political and economical reforms all the more difficult. There is a tremendous opportunity for tourism to be expanded, because these countries have great tourist potential. Surprisingly, many of the people in the countries did not seem to fully appreciate the benefits of tourism, particularly the economic benefits that could accrue by its promotion. Australia's total trade with the four countries is about $230m. Our exports to the countries slightly exceed our imports from them. I believe we could be doing a great deal more, simply because there are so many groups in Australia that have a familial relationship with the countries the delegation visited. Therefore, Australia is in an excellent position to re-establish those relationships and trade with those countries. We have helped in many ways. There is our membership of the OECD Group of 24, and we have taken a one per cent shareholding in the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, representing a grant of $45m over five years. All in all, it is a region of enormous potential for Australia. It is a fascinating region to look at, particularly its economic and political developments. We truly appreciated the range of people we were able to meet and their hospitality. I want to thank all who were on the associated with the planning and the implementation of the visit because I think great benefits can come from it. I would encourage members of the House to read the report very carefully.",22
13,Mr WEST,DELEGATION REPORTS,"Cunningham) (10.18 a.m.)The delegation from the Australian Parliament to countries in central Europe-including Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Bulgaria-was a unique opportunity for members of the Australian Parliament to meet newly elected members of parliament in those countries and to examine, at close hand, the effects of the momentous political and economic changes that are occurring as central Europe moves from a command to a market economy. No doubt there will continue to be significant problems involved in this huge change. In my view, there will be problems particularly affecting output and employment in the agricultural and manufacturing sectors of central Europe. The problems will be further exacerbated in future by the slow rate of investment from foreign sources because there is not nearly enough such investment at this time. There is increasing inflation and unemployment in central Europe as a result of the slowness of change, in my view arising from the low rate of investment. Consequently, there is a danger of increasing disillusionment. This was evident in the turnout of only 40 per cent in last year's Polish elections. It is, in a sense, also evident in the moderate resurgence of some of the better elements of the former regime now currently involved in the democratic left alliance. Nevertheless, one cannot help being impressed by the sense of change and freedom in these countries of central Europe and the sheer political - xuberance which prevails there. The task for the newly liberated nations of central Europe is obviously to rebuild their economies and to gradually eliminate the extensive pollution which has occurred under the former regime. There will be future trade opportunities for Australia. They will be real but they will be limited. There is a contraction of output as a result of the decline of Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, or the old Comecon, and this has greatly affected output and exports. The honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar) mentioned the effect of the collapse of CMEA on the Australian wool trade with Poland, as Polish exports to the former USSR have declined with the collapse of Comecon. Another example of the contraction of the former Comecon is the rapid decline of the arms manufacturing industry in Slovakia. This is a very welcome development from our point of view, but from the point of view of the people around Bratislava there is a huge loss of employment involved. I agree also that there are opportunities the export of Australian coal to central European countries. There is a need in those countries to convert from brown coal for electricity production to less polluting sources of power, and I think that black coal will be a viable alternative. There is a continuing and increasing fear of nuclear technology in that part of the world because of the proximity of major cities and capitals to the site of the infamous Chernobyl nuclear disaster. Another issue of great interest to Australians is the desire of Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary to enter the European Community as soon as possible. As the honourable member for Warringah said, they will be seeking associate membership, and in future full membership. They hope to achieve full membership by the year 2000. When that occurs, there will be pressure on Western nations of the European Community to take central European agricultural produce, and hence there is an ever increasing need for the EC to reform the common agricultural policy. Welcome as the recent move to reduce production subsidies by 29 per cent was, there will be a need to further reform CAP as export from central European countries of agricultural products occurs. (Time expired).",24
14,Mr HICKS,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I would like to say what an honour it was to be part of the parliamentary delegation and I thank the Parliament for that opportunity. I congratulate our leader, Senator the Kerry Sibraa, President of the Senate, on the work that he did in leading the delegation. I thank Rob Alison, the Usher of the Black Rod, and Fred Peppinck and Julie Hatcher, advisers to the delegation, for their help during our visit. I found it an incredible experience to be in central eastern Europe at this time in its history and I would just like to comment, as other members have, on some of my impressions. The first impression gained was the extreme optimism and the joy of most people in shaking off communism. As we all know, it is a terrible system and many people in those countries had suffered a great deal over many years at the hands of the communists. There for was a slight feeling of fear too, in that they were not quite sure where they were going. They had this great optimism in the free market economy they were about to adopt, but they really were not quite sure where it was all going to lead them and had a slight fear that perhaps they might slip back. They certainly said they would not be slipping back into communism as it was known before, but nevertheless there was just this feeling there that they were a little concerned. We found, having been into those countries that had suffered under communism, that communism does not mean equality for all. It means equality for the masses but, of course, some people are more equal than others. At the palaces of some of the leaders there, we talked to people in the situation where husband and wife and their parents and children were living in a one-bedroom complex, and we found out just exactly what communism meant to some of those people. I would like to pay a tribute to the leaders of those countries, both church and secular, who have suffered so much but have brought their countries back into freedom. Previous speakers have spoken of Lech Walesa, an incredible person and character in his own right to speak to, who led the Solidarity movement in Poland, which I believe was the catalyst, if you like, that started the whole uprising throughout that part of Europe. I would also like to pay tribute to His Holiness, Pope Paul II because, as a Polish Pope, he had a great deal to do, although not directly, with what has happened in Europe. Honourable members may have read the history of Poland. I have read Mitchener, which may not be a complete history of Poland but certainly whetted my appetite to go to that country. Situated where it is in Europe from the time history began, Poland has had its share of problems, of course, and it is wonderful to see it now with a great optimistic outlook. Czechoslovakia is an interesting country, consisting of 9.9 million Czechs and 5 million Slovaks. Hopefully, they have overcome their problems and that country will remain united. As a previous honourable member said, it was interesting to be in that part of the world where they have such a heavy armament manufacturing plant. I think 70,000 people were employed at the plant until recently, many of whom are out of work now. When we put the argument about armaments to them, they said: 'Well, we can produce one tank; we are sure we are going to sell it, particularly to the Middle East. We would need to produce 43 tractors to make the same profit. We are not sure we are going to sell those'. In practical terms, that is the problem they face. As for Bulgaria, 85 per cent of exports go to Comecon and, of course, with its collapse, there is a major problem. Sixty-five per cent of its exports went to the Soviet Union, so with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Bulgarians had difficulty in deciding where to carry out their trade. Their unemployment, which they were concerned about, was to reach 10 per cent by the end of the year. It is amazing that this country just came out of being under the communist regime with a 10 per cent unemployment rate and ours is matching it. Hungary would have been a"" front-line state if there had been a third world war with the West. The Hungarians would have been annihilated, some of the people told us, because they would have been a nuclear target. In all of Hungary's history there have only been a few years where there has been what you could call democracy. The pollution of eastern Europe has been touched upon. We have to do a great deal to assist to overcome that problem. In Poland three-quarters of the forest has been damaged by acid rain, one-third of its rivers are polluted. A previous honourable member spoke about the nuclear reactors, which are a great problem. However, something that we should remember in this House is that the greatest enemy of the environment is poverty. We can see in eastern Europe just what poverty has done for the environment under a communist system. It is a lesson that we could all well learn.",25
15,Dr CHARLESWORTH,DELEGATION REPORTS,"Perth) (10.28 a.m.}-I would like to briefly comment in the time that is available about the opportunity that was afforded the parliamentary delegation to visit Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Hungary. Indeed, having been to the Soviet Union the previous year, I found it interesting to draw comparisons between the places. The aspects of political dislocation, the ethnic tensions, the environmental difficulties and the economic woes of the former Soviet Union and in the countries that we visited were consistent. It was very interesting for us to have the opportunity to look closely at those difficulties. I am travelling to what was fonnerly East Gennany later this year and it will be interesting to compare that country, which has been provided with the technological expertise and the capital to make the transfonnation perhaps much more rapidly, with some of the countries that we were able to visit. It will be interesting to see the comparison between the ways in which they are solving problems in former East Gennany and the ways in which they are dealing with problems in the old Eastern Bloc. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Riverina-Darling (Mr Hicks), mentioned the optimism of the people there. It was indeed gratifying, but when it came to their theoretical understanding of the capitalist system, while it may have been competent, there was some concern about the practical way in which they would put that philosophy into action. I believe this is the biggest problem that is faced by those countries. There are in that region great opportUnities for Australia . .In Poland we ran into Australians who were organising a telecommunications structure for parts of that country. In Hungary we met officials from the Hawthorn Institute who were interested in developing training links between themselves, an American university and the Hungarian Government, so there are opportunities for Australians in that area. We met people who were selling coal and other things in Bulgaria. I believe that part of the role of delegations such as the one we were on, and indeed the Australian Government, must be to facilitate things for those very many Australians who are trading with that part of the world, who do have interests in that part of the world, and who through their ethnic background or through their contacts in business are busy developing an Australian presence in the region. It has been my view and it remains my view that Australia, because of its size and its geographical position, will only ever be a spectator when we look at the developments in that part of the world, but there are significant niches where we have expertise and where our skill and ability or our products can make a mark on the market. It is important that Australia establish and develop trade links in those areas, and in many of the cities that we visited that was occurring. In Hungary we saw some facilitation occurring at a more rapid rate than in some of the other places, and I believe that needs to be developed and established even more. The great problems for those economies in the Eastern Bloc are the issues of inflation, wages policy, currency convertibility, restructuring of their industries, the establishment and the knitting-in of new technology, the cost of their energy, the terrible environmental problems of power generation. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-Order! The time allotted for statements on this report has expired. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1992 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Charles.",26
16,Mr CHARLES,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"La Trobe) (10.33 a.m.)The Industrial Relations Amendment Bill 1992 seeks to amend section 299 of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 which deals with offences in relation to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Section 299 contains subparagraph (1)(d)(ii), which provides that a person shall not, by writing or speech, use words calculated to bring the Commission or a member of the Commission into disrepute. To contravene this subparagraph is an offence punishable upon conviction by a penalty, in the case of a natural person, of $500 or imprisonment for six months or both, and, in the case of a body corporate, of $1,000. This Bill, if passed by this House and the Senate, will omit section 299(1)(d)(ii), thereby removing a provision in law giving the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and members of that Commission rights and powers and a fonn of protection not given to ordinary citizens, members of parliament or in fact Justices of the Federal Court. It is my view that the fonn of protection so provided in law is a denial of freedom of press and freedom of speech. Those in this chamber today, those listening to this session of the House of Representatives and those ultimately reading the Hansard report of the first reading of this Bill might acknowledge that, if not successful, I am at least persistent. This is the third time that I introduce this Bill into this House, the first occasion being on 8 November 1990 and the second on 16 May 1991. I find it frustrating that on neither occasion did the Selection Committee see fit to give this Bill a second reading and disappointing that this Government has not been willing to support my Bill or introduce it as Government legislation to remove this iniquitous section of the Industrial Relations Act, this denial of our basic human rights. But this Government is not big on individual rights of its citizens. A constituent mine in the electorate of La Trobe recently said to me that in her view the Liberal Party represented the individual and the Australian Labor Party represented institutions. How true. In my previous first reading speeches I referred to earlier very select contempt proceedings by the Director of Public Prosecutions on behalf of the Industrial Relations Commission against Mr H. R. Nicholls, the editor of the Hobart Mercury, in 1911 and, more recently, against Nationwide News, publisher of the Australian, and Mr Chris Gorrick, Federal Vice-President of the Civil Air Operations Officers Association of Australia. The latter case was heard by the High Court of Australia, which has yet to bring down a decision. The use of this highly restrictive section of the Industrial Relations Act has been highly selective. In particular, since the April 1991 national wage case decision by the Industrial Relations Commission, many individuals have spoken publicly in very unflattering terms about the Industrial Relations Commission. But to date no-one has been charged under the Act. Recently, Mr Wally Curran, Secretary of the Victorian branch of the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union, in a letter to the editor of the Australian on 1 May 1992 said, amongst many other things: In contrast to the Commission's incompetency the union has been able to reach an. amicable agreement with some employers who understand the realities of the industry . . . He went on to say: Unless there is an absolutely honest approach regarding the right of anyone to seek employment in the Commission then the status quo will continue and mainly incompetent, and underqualified people will continue to be employed. If I were an Industrial Relations commissioner I would be outraged by the most recent attacks on my independence and my reputation in the community. The point I make is that while I believe Mr Curran was improper in his observations, I believe that in law he should have the right to express his views unless such expression acts to defame the individuals or the institutions who are the of objects of the words of his speech. I commend the Bill to the House. I present an explanatory memorandum to the Bill. Bill read a first time. Ordered that the second reading be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday, in accordance with sessional order 104A. NA DEVELOPMENT BILL 1992 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Miles.",27
17,Mr MILES,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,"I present the Forest Conservation and Development Bill 1992. I think people in Australia are very well aware of the forest industry and the extent of that industry throughout Australia. It is the second largest manufacturing industry in Australia. The Minister for Tourism and the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) told us not so long ago here about how important this industry is to Australia. Indeed, it is. It is a very important industry if Australia is going to get on top of its export budgetary problems in the balance of payments. It is an industry in which at the moment we actually import about $2 billion worth of wood products into Australia. I am introducing this Bill because the previous Bill was not passed by Parliament. It is still very important that the forest industry be given the resource security that is necessary for investment to occur in the industry. This Bill represents a hands-off approach by the Commonwealth and, unlike the recently defeated legislation, it does not extend Commonwealth control over State land use matters. The essence of this approach is for the Commonwealth to act only after an application for resource security is received from a State government. The Commonwealth would then assess whether the provisions of relevant Commonwealth Acts are fulfilled. If they are, then an instrument in writing is given which provides resource security to that applicant. The Bill provides for Federal resource security to be given to State or regional plans, major projects and wood processing projects, irrespective of the level of investment. Another provision in the Bill allows the Federal Government 12 months to undertake the various assessments as provided in the environmental and heritage Acts, and to raise any objections to the State sponsored plan or project. After that time, the Commonwealth would agree not to use any of its powers to interfere in the agreement between the State and the forest industry in a particular area, unless there is a discovery of some previously unknown species and that continued forestry activities are considered to be a major threat to that species. In such a case, compensation will be made for the resources withdrawn. The Bill also requires that to avoid duplication the Commonwealth must, as far as practicable, coordinate andÂ· integrate the processes of assessment with the State. The Bill in no way diminishes the Commonwealth's decision making powers in respect of the environmental and heritage Acts which are presently in place, such as the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act and the Australian Heritage Commission Act. The only limitation that the Commonwealth has in the exercise of its decision making power is that it will have to be completed within 12 months. This legislation clearly defines the role of the Commonwealth and State governments, and minimises the grounds for withdrawal of resource security to the discovery of a new, or thought to be extinct, species. There is no monetary limit to the forest programs that would be eligible and all of Australia's 1,200 small sawmillers could be included, depending on the application coming forward from State governments. I present this Bill to the House and I hope that there is goodwill on the part of everybody in this Parliament to see some common sense with regard to this industry. I would certainly welcome any additional comments for improvement to this Bill, as long as they are in line with the main objects of the Bill. I trust that, because of the Government's previous position on resource security, we get a bipartisan approach to this very important legislation before the House. Bill read a first time. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-In accordance with sessional order 104A, the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. NA",28
18,Mr KERR,APPM DISPUTE,"I move: That this House: (1) expresses its support for the APPMworkers at Burnie, Tasmania, in their struggle to be collectively represented by their unions in negotiations with the company; (2) opposes the attack by APPM on the whole trade union movement inherent in the writs issued against the President of the ACTU, Mr Martin Ferguson, and other officials and unions for organising stop-work meetings of APPM employees; and (3) calls upon APPM to resolve this dispute by agreeing to the: (a) right of workers to work in a healthy and safe environment without intimidation; (b) withdrawal of aU legal actions against their workers and union officials; and (c) right of workers to be collectively represented by their unions in negotiations with the company. As I speak today, I am uncertain as to how events in Burnie in Tasmania will transpire. I understand that this morning there were two arrests and that the company is detennined to break picket lines. I understand also that there is a substantially strong picket representing fierce determination on the part of most workers to resist the very unhelpful and determined attitude of the company to prevent workers having the opportunity to be represented by their unions, and that later today the hypothetical fears expressed the other day by the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, unfortunately may come to reality. We all hope that that is not the case. I am sure that all honourable members of this House, irrespective of on the rights or wrongs of this dispute, will join me in expressing that view. Unfortunately, Burnie today is a town that is being torn apart, a town divided. The company has issued notices dismissing 850 of its workers and, of those, some 30 are seeking to return to work. The police are being drawn into this dispute, through legal actions instituted by the company. The company has hired significant teams of private security guards, who are terrorising those on the picket lines and also journalists who are on the scene. That contrasts with the circumstances that prevail in another paper mill in southern Tasmania, ANM. One can see the contrast between the two approaches. APPM has resorted to the tactics of fear where, in the view of its industrial relations leader, Mr Herbert Larratt, workers should go to work every day expecting to be dismissed. It is a culture dominated by fear and intimidation. Contrast that with the circumstances in southern Tasmania at ANM, where the company-with its work force and the unions working collectively-is in fact celebrating remarkable gains in productivity, and has been selected by the Australian Manufacturing Council, from Australia-wide competition, for an award of best practices. Of course, everything that is happening at APPM represents the 'how not to'. It represents a retreat to the black days of confrontation, the days when workers came to work out of motivations of fear rather than of commitment to the shared goals of the company. It is a very sad day for Australia. Not only does it represent-and this is the important point that I think this House shmM reflect on-the failure of the management of a the mill to come to terms with modern management and to seek to impose an engineering solution to a complex human and industrial relations circumstance, but also it reflects what will be everywhere in this country, in every State, .in every town, if the Opposition introduces its policy. There is no doubt that the approach that is being implemented by APPM reflects precisely that which is advocated by the Opposition. The Age of 21 May, in a leading article by Shaun their views Carney, makes this point: It has been fascinating on several occasions during the past few months watching Dr Hewson pouring petrol on the fire of hard-line deregulationist policy... It goes on: The change that appears likely to result from Dr Hewson's energies is that Mr Howard's regime of workers and employees being able to ""opt out"" of the centrally-determined award system will be reversed. At the expiry of awards and agreements, employers and workers will be considered out of the system and they will both have to decide to ""opt in"" if they want to be covered by industrial tribunals. Regardless of whether the policy is viewed as desirable or not, it is clearly a calculated attempt to dismember Australian unionism. Mr Carney continues: Most of the analysis of the nascent policy has concentrated on what it would mean for workers, what entitlements they would lose. There has been less attention paid to what the more-radical policy would mean for employers. Employers would not lose much at all. In fact, they would do very well. The power of individual employers will grow as an inverse function of the workers' loss of negotiating power. With their hire-andfire powers enhanced, and variouS existing entitlements absorbed into total wage levels, it will be the employers who will be making demands of their employees. Without a central tribunal, there will not-there cannot-be any protection for employees. The only way that common sense can prevail in this dispute, as has been called for - y the Tasmanian Premier, by Commonwealth Ministers, and by many honourable members of this House, is for those who are not now locked into a position of confrontation in the company to take some wiser counsel from those who are offering the possibility of sitting down and recognising the rights of unions to represent workers-as the workers in Tasmania so plainly do desire. Secondly, we need to look at whether or not those institutional investors in the companyand there are significantÂ· institutional investments held by groups such as AMP-are prepared to continue to have passive investment in a company which is so obviously working on the sharp edge of implementing a challenge to the arbitration system and a challenge to the legal entitlements of workers to be represented by their trade unions. It seems tome that there needs to be serious consideration by eminent Australians such as Sir James Balderstone and others who are the controllers of significant institutional investments in APPM. Their interests are going to be dramatically affected as this dispute proceeds, if it does-and one cannot see a resolution of it emerging, at least in the short time, unless some hard heads are brought to bear in this issue. It needs to be considered that Sir James Balderstone and other institutional investors will start to see, firstly, their as those paper stocks run out, even though they were built up before the dispute. Secondly, there needs to be consideration by those institutional investors of whether or not they want to be seen as co-sponsors of this aggressive and contemptuous attack by the company on its workers. Finally, I want to make one brief comment about the politics of this. We have seen both the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the industrial relations spokesman involved in private discussions with the company at least two or three weeks ago, plainly in circumstances where they were misleading this House about their lack of involvement and urging others to stay out. We see the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles) joining in the anti-union attack, but fortunately his colleagues and the Tasmanian Liberals are not. It is always politics first with the honourable member for Braddon. I copped a serve the other day for not supporting resource security. What an irony. In fact, the only Tasmanian in this House who expressed considerable doubts and reluctance about some of the contents of the legislation nonetheless supporteC: it as a good compromise. The only such person in this House who voted for it was me. Not one Tasmanian Liberal on the other side voted for it and yet they have the cheek to criticise at this point of time. (TIme expired) Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-Is the motion seconded? Mr Gibson-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.",29
19,Mr MILES,APPM DISPUTE,"This is the second time this week that the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) has given us the opportunity to consider the union-APPM dispute in Tasmania. As the local member for that area, I welcome that opportunity. I welcome that opportunity so that some of the facts and the figures and the situations can be brought before the people. First of all, I want to refute totally and utterly one comment made by the honourable member, and that was that I have taken a position which is totally opposed to the union cash flow dry up movement. I have not. I believe, as does the coalition, that the union movement has a role to play in industrial matters. But that role has to be determined by the members, the men and women on any work site. They should have a choice as to whether a union represents them or whether some of them might prefer a solicitor to represent them in their negotiations with their employer. No longer should Australian workers, men and women, be forced to join unions. No longer in this country can that continue. I believe unions have a future in Australia, but there must not be a monopolistic position. I am pleased that APPM has now done away with the no ticket, no work rule. That went by the board six weeks ago. That is very important. Freedom of association is what we should have, even in industrial issues in Australia. The first part of this motion says: . - expresses its support for APPM workers at Burnie... I express my support for APPM workers at Burnie and I must say that there are very few people in the Labor Party, certainly not the honourable member who has proposed this motion, from my understanding of his background, who would really have very much empathy with or understanding of what it means to be a genuine manual worker, as a lot of these people are-to get grease in his hair or dirt under his fingernails. 1 do understand that. 1 know what it means. 1 know what it means to go into the forests and to use a chainsaw and to use logging skidders and so forth. 1 know what it is to have breakdowns in machinery and to have to fix them-to get in underneath them, to try to get things going-so that bread can be on the table of the family. 1 understand those things. 1I have done a lot of manual work myself. 1 understand it and 1 understand the workers' plight here. It is for that very reason that in Parliament here-so that these workers can have a freedom of association, so that they can have the freedom to choose whom they belong to. It is a very fundamental principle in Australia that has to be upheld. The honourable member also talked about intimidation. Where is the intimidation occurDenison ring? 1 can say to honourable members that have had dozens and dozens of phone calls from workers at the mill who want to go work. These workers are getting phone calls from other people telling them, 'I hope you have insurance on your house; 1 hope you have a good private medical insurance' and on. Many of the workers have had to have their telephone numbers changed so that they are not rung up in the middle of intimidated. One person, in particular, was out doing some fencing work and for the third time was approached by union people and told, 'The next time 1 come back, 1 will break your legs'. This is what is going on. a lot of intimidation, and union secretaries ought to be able to stop a lot of it. That is The their responsibility-to exercise control over their members in this situation. The situation is disgraceful. But let me bring everybody up to date and explain why the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) is so conciliatory today as compared with two days ago. Mr Justice Wright and his comments in the Supreme Court yesterday in Tasmania, contrary to the abbreviated form of his comments given to us by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) which led to the expulsion from this House of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), have been reported as follows: The picketers were entitled to make a protest against a perceived injustice or violation of their rights in a peaceful and orderly manner. ""Once their conduct ceases to have that character, police intervention is called for and should be expected. He said he believed neither Commissioner Johnson nor his officers would in future fail to apply the law at the Burnie Mill site. If police did not act, and APPM made a fresh application to the court, he could well issue an order forcing police to intervene. The court ruled that police must take action I am against picketers who block individuals and vehicles from entering and leaving the mill. That is their right: picketers should be able to picket. But the men and women who want to work should also have the right to go to work. 1 challenge the honourable member for (Mr Kerr): why can people in a free I democracy in Australia not have the right to go to work when work is provided by their to employer? Why not? That is what this issue is really about. There are at least 300 employees down there in Burnie who want to go to work, and 1 suspect that if those 300 so went through and there was not the intimidation on the picket lines to go through the gates, we would have probably 400 to 500 the night and people going through. 1 support the right of people to strike and to demonstrate on the issues, but 1 also support the right and the freedom of people to go to work. The details of this dispute are that the There is company, back on 3 March, said: award remains. 1\venty five per cent over award payments remain; 9 per cent superannuation paid by the company remains; redundancy of three weeks for one year's work remains and it is a 35hour week and the average income of the men is $41,000. It ranges from $22,000 to $77,000. The average income is $41,000. Then the company said: Restrictive work practices are cancelled. This refers to practices such as not being able to read papers while on the job. That has now been cancelled. It refers to practices such as abusing the taxi service provided by the company. That has now been cancelled. Practices such as being called in for half an hour's or an hour's work and getting nine hours pay have now been cancelled. If Australia is going to be competitive-and the Government wants us to be a smart country, a clever country-we are not going to be clever if we keep those work practices. This company is faced with reduced tariffs; it has got to be competitive; we all want Australian companies to be competitive. There is no doubt that it can be competitive. It an industry in which we need to replace the importation of pulp and of timber products into this country and, rather than being difficult in this area, the Government ought to be supporting the right of workers to go to work if that company has work to provide for them. As I said at the beginning, this is a great opportunity to discuss these sorts of issues, and the Opposition is not opposed to unions representing workers who choose the unions to represent them. But they should no longer be forced into that situation. The days of monopolistic power over representing workers at any individual work site in Australia or in an industry, I would hope, are over. If this dispute achieves that, then it will be a great step forward for the freedom of workers in this country. I believe that, far from conditions being worse, if we change and have a much more flexible industrial relations system in this country, the workers will be better off. This dispute has occurred under this Government's industrial relations system, not under ours; we are not in Government.",31
20,Mr GIBSON,APPM DISPUTE,"It is a fascinating experience to listen to the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles) trying desperately to justify his own existence and trying desperately to justify his position, because it is quite clear that the honourable member for Braddon has really been sold the dump on this issue. If you have a look at what has been happening in both Houses of this Parliament for the last several weeks, it is only the poor, pathetic honourable member for Braddon who has had to try to justify the coalition's position. Not one other Tasmanian coalition member has supported him in this process. He has been abandoned by all the other Liberal members in Tasmania and he is the poor beggar that has to try to justify the coalition's policies in this regard. Mr Miles-I am proud to do it, irrespective of the policy. Proud of it!",33
21,Mr GIBSON,APPM DISPUTE,"It is not surprising that this morning he is trying to justify himself by making out that he is a real worker, that he has had grease under his fingernails. The is in honourable member knows what it is like to be a worker because he has been sold the dump on this issue. He is the one who is really going to suffer because the workers in the electorate of the honourable member for Braddon are going to know what he is about and they are going to dump him at the next election. They know exactly where he stands on this issue. Mr Miles-Yes, do you?",33
22,Mr GIBSON,APPM DISPUTE,"They know exactly what your position is in so far as trying to protect the rights of workers is concerned. It is no wonder that members of the coalition are so desperately trying to justify their existence. They have been massively embarrassed in this dispute. They have been embarrassed because their grand policies as set out in the Fightback package have actually come into effect a little bit before they are in government. So the people of Australia are now going to find out what the coalition's industrial relations package really means for them. We have a situation now occurring inÂ· Burnie which enables workers all around the country to see what will happen under a coalition industrial relations package. It is clear what is going to happen. We have now erupting in Burnie the bushfire which, under the coalition if it ever had the chance to be in government, would spread throughout the country. That is why they are embarrassed. That is why members of the Opposition, including the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), are squealing like stuck pigs both in this House and outside this chamber, and why they are complaining about what is happening. They are complaining about the fact that the Government has exposed the lies, the deceit and the hypocrisy that have been mentioned in this place by certain honourable members about this dispute. They know that the workers of this country are now really going to find out what an industrial relations policy under the coalition means. It means confrontation; it means fights; it means attempts to destroy unions; and it means attempts to take away all the basic industrial rights that workers have. It is no wonder that the honourable member for Braddon has no support from his colleagues in Tasmania because they do not want to be sold a dump as he has. That is the essence of this dispute and that is the essence of the Opposition's position in this case. trying desperately to hide the fact that it is involved. Yesterday we had the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) clearly exposing the fact that the Leader of the Opposition and the Opposition's industrial relations spokesperson, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard)-despite their protestations about, 'Keep politicians out of this dispute; let's have any politicians involving themselves in this dispute'-have their fingers fully in the pie. But are they actually trying to solve the dispute? Are they trying to bring some sense into it? No. All they are about is encouraging the company to rip it right up the workers. We had the honourable member for Braddon talking about intimidation. We had all these little sob stories about people being rung up and threatened. Mr Ruddock-Are you defending it? Mr GmSON-No, I am not supporting any sort of intimidation, but let us look at who started the intimidation. How did this dispute start? It started by APPM sacking workers. It started by APPM issuing edicts saying, 'From now on thou shalt not do this and thou shalt not do that'. There was no discussion, no consultation, no sitting down with workers and saying, 'Listen, we have some problems here. Our profitability is suffering and our efficiency is suffering. Let us sit down and work out how we can go about solving the problem'. That is what most of the other companies in this country have been doing for the last five years. That is why we have had such massi ve efficiency and productivity improvements. Companies have sat down and talked with their workers. They have listened to their workers and worked out new processes and efficiency programs. But does APPM do that? No. What APPM does is issue an edict and stick it on the noticeboard. It says, 'You shall not do this. You shall not do that. We are going to sack this person and we are going to sack that person. We are going to get rid of workers from the boiler room and we are going to put management in there and train them. We are going to threaten the safety of this plant. We are going to threaten the safety of workers because we want to It is make them more efficient'. That is how it started this dispute. Mr Miles-You don't know anything about it; that is your trouble. Mr GmSON-I understand a lot about it. I understand a lot more about it than what the honourable member opposite seems to know. not Then we have had further intimidation. We talk about intimidation. Who brought the dogs onto the site? Who brought the security guards onto the site? Who started issuing writs against unions, against workers and against the people trying to negotiate the dispute? Was it the unions? Was it the workers who did that? No. It was the company. So if we are going to start talking about intimidation, let us start talking about all the intimidation that has been occurring here. Let us start talking about the provocation that the company brought into this dispute right from the start. If one starts looking at what has been happening in industrial relations for the last five years, one sees that a lot of very sensible negotiations have occurred in companies around this country. Of course there have been some problems with efficiency and work practices in many companies. That is why we had the problem of our export performance and that is whY we were not able to achieve what we needed to achieve in this country in getting a competitive edge for our goods and services. But this Government tackled the problem. It started the process of award restructuring. It said to unions and management alike that we have to tackle this issue and that the way to tackle it is to sit down, look at all those practices, put everything on the table and negotiate new agreements and new awards. It did not say it would scrap them all per se and start a new system. It started the process by sitting down and talking with both sides and working out what should happen, and that is what should have happened in this dispute. We would not have had a dispute if that had happened. If APPM had gone to the unions twelve months or two years ago and said, 'Look,look at our profitability situation, look at our efficiency, we need to tackle this. Let us sit down and work it out. Let us sit down and think about what we need to do' ,if they had started the process of real, sensible negotiations, then this dispute would not have occurred. The fact is that the APPM management is locked into the old disputes of the 1950s. They think they are the bosses; they know all the answers; they do not need to talk to workers; they do not need to find out what workers think about the issue, even though it is probably the workers that know how to run the plant much. better than the managementsomething that has been exposed in most of the discussions we have had with unions for the last five years. When we actually start talking to workers on the site about how plants should operate, we get a whole lot of new ideas about how to make things more efficient. The workers actually understand the way these things operate and they know how to try to improve the efficiencies of plants. If the management had done that right from the start, we would not have had any of this dispute. The APPM management cannot appreciate that. Their view is: we are the bosses, we issue edicts, we chop all these things out and if the workers do not like it, they can get out. We will lock them out, we will bring the security dogs in, we will bring the guards in. We own this plant and we will run it. We have seen what happens with that type of process. The whole plant has been closed down and we now have this incredible confrontation building up because the management just will not budge, they will not negotiate. We had yesterday the situation where we were talking about what happened with the decision that was brought down by the Industrial Relations Commission. There was a negotiated position, but it broke down because the management refused to consider that they should not proceed with their writs and not proceed with all their other court actions. Then the unions are attacked because they will not bow down and say, 'Okay, we will agree, we will go back to work, but the management is fine, they can still issue all the writs against our unions'.",33
23,Mr KERR,APPM DISPUTE,They will lose their houses.,35
24,Mr GIBSON,APPM DISPUTE,"Yes, they will lose their houses, they will lose all of their personal possessions, because the management is allowed to have what it likes. It is allowed to continue with its writs and all its court actions, but the union has to just go back to work and agree with whatever the management has to say. Then the unions are accus- by the Opposition of being the foul players in this game. Again, we have the situation where it is the APPM management that has been proven to be wrong. The reason why the Opposition is so upset, as I said earlier, is that its industrial relations agenda for this country has been so badly exposed in this dispute and it is sending a signal to workers throughout the country that this is the fate that awaits them. The problem is that in the APPM we have strong workers, workers who are prepared to resist this type of agenda. But we know that the real agenda is to attack the working conditions of a lot of other workers in this country who do not have that strength, who do not have that strong protection of unions. The design is a return to the situation which wehad under the last Liberal-National Party Government, with confrontation and the law of the jungle as far as industrial relations are concerned. (TIme expired)",35
25,Mr CHARLES,APPM DISPUTE,"La Trobe) (11.14 a.m.)The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) has finally injected a bit of life into this debate. It seems that the fire has gone out of the belly of the honourable member for Denison (Me Kerr), who came into this place yesterday with a bit of ranting and raving. I think the honourable member for Denison knows the reality of what is happening in Burnie. He knows that this motion before this House is nothing but a bit of nonsense, so he has well and truly quietened down. The honourable member for Moreton is an interesting character, a Queensland left wing Volvo socialist, a teacher who proposes to tell us how to run grass roots industrial relations policy at a pulp and paper mill in Tasmania with a Sieg Heil mentality that would take us back truly to the confrontationist days when we marched in the streets. Very good. I want to refer to the first clause of this motion. The honourable member for Denison says that this House should express its support for the APPM workers at Burnie. I agree with that. I support the workers at Burnie. I support the workers all over Australia. I am a worker. I have been a worker. I will always be a worker. I support the workers and I also support the company. The honourable member for Hinkler (Me Courtice) defined this issue rather well the other night in this House when he said, in part: When one looks at the policies of the Opposition, one can understand why it does not like terms mate. The honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) interjected and said: They hate mates. The honourable member for Hinkler replied: Exactly; they hate the average Aussie worker. That is the biggest heap of nonsense that I have heard anyone in this House support. This side of the House supports the workers and supports workers' rights, which is why we are here today to defend the right of the. workers to an environment in which they can work peacefully, in which. they have the right not to be dominated by a Sieg Heil mentality by shop stewards or union leaders, but in which they have the right to make decisions freely by themselves, uncoerced, in an atmosphere of cooperation in order to keep their jobs and in order to run efficient industry policy in this nation. I support the company, as well as the workers. I support the company's right to conduct its business in an atmosphere which allows it to get on with the job without outside coercion. It is the outside influences, surely, that have driven this dispute from the very beginning. Honourable members, without viable, productive enterprises in this nation we are going to have no jobs, no work. Our national debt will grow and grow, and before long we will not have a nation any more. This dispute, it seems to me, is about freedom of choice. But the parties to this dispute are constrained by our highly legalistic, regulated and centralised system of industrial relations. This dispute actually grew out of New South Wales, moved itself into Tasmania, and months later we have a real ding-dong battle between unions and management-but not necessarily between workers and management. We have tried time and time again to make it perfectly clear that the system which spawned this dispute is not our preferred option. It is not the way that we would like to see the industrial relations system managed in this country. The point has been made over and over again that the dispute has occurred within the legalistic system, within the regulated system. like It is about time that company managements and company workers throughout Australia had freedom of choice to choose to do their own thing without being told by the union bosses, or indeed by the bosses of employer organisations, how to run their businesses. Yesterday in this House during Question Time, the Prime Minister (Me Keating) said: I do not mind the Leader of the Opposition calling me a creep. This person and the honourable member for Bennelong wilfully connived in the prolongation of an industrial dispute for their own political purposes against the interests of the people of Tasmania, and the people of Burnie in particular. That was 'a bit of nonsense too, because it is the Rambo tactics of Senator Cook which have exacerbated this dispute. Me Martin Ferguson, President of the ACTU, decided to do a Bob Hawke. He was going to go down to Burnie and in a grand manner solve the dispute and bring it back on a plate to the people of Australia, to show that once again the trade union bureaucracy, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, was able to deliver a positive result to the people. The honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles) is the local member, and he has said: The Burnie Mill dispute is now a dispute over monopolistic union power. It's not about safety, the award or dropping charges against mill employ-. I think the honourable member for Braddon is absolutely right. A lot of what this dispute is about is the issue of no ticket, no start. Until six weeks ago, this' mill in Burnie had been a no ticket, no start mill, with compulsory union membership, and union dues automatically deducted from its employees by the company on behalf of the union. I and others on this side of the House particularly support the concept of voluntary union membership""of voluntary membership of organisations of all kinds, because a society which is supposed to be a democratic, free society ought to give people freedom' of choice. In that context, this motion today by the honourable member for Denison assumes that one side of the equation-the unions-is outside the law. It assumes what in practice is true and has been true for decades and decades, because the Industrial Relations Act recognises the power of the Industrial Relations Commission and gives it both responsibilities and rights to settle disputes but gives it no power over the unions. It gives it heaps of power over the companies but no powers over the union.",35
26,Mr KERR,APPM DISPUTE,Absolute rubbish. You know just what we have done in this matter.,37
27,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,APPM DISPUTE,Mr Truss)Order! The honourable member for Denison' shall not interject.,37
28,Mr CHARLES,APPM DISPUTE,"In fact, the commissioner has directed that the employees at Burnie return to work; that the company open its gate; and that they get back to producing paper. But no, we are unable to finish that job because the law protects the unions. So we have no freedom of choice and we have not, in this dispute, the rule of law taking its proper place. Andrew Bolt reported on 3 June in the Herald-Sun: The ACfU is in deep trouble with the dispute over Associated Pulp and Paper Mills-and it knows it. Forget the howls of protest about the way APPM conducts its industrial relations-the company is acting within the strict letter of the law. But the unions now face a range of potentially disastrous legal actions as the strike at APPM's Burnie plant enters a fourth week. Their continued refusal to obey an Industrial Relations Commission demand that they return to work could cost each union $1000 a day and individual unionists $500 a day. The problem is that that will never be enforced. The Prime Minister, Senator Cook and Martin Ferguson are the ones who have exacerbated this debate. They have exacerbated the problems that have caused us to come into this House today to reject comprehensively the motion of the honourable member for Denison, except that we on this side of the House wish to make it absolutely clear that we support the workers at Burnie, we support the workers in Hobart, we support the workers in Melbourne, Sydney, AdelaIde and Perth. We support the workers of Australia. As I said in a speech in this House earlier today, it' is the Australian Labor Par-- . Mr Courtice-You don't support the workers. You never have.",37

32,Mr BRADFORD,ROAD FUNDING,"I move: That this Parliament: (1) deplores the Government's appalling record on road funding, noting that road funding has steadily decreased in real terms while the Government expects to collect more than double the revenue from diesel and fuel excise in 1991-92 thanit did in 1982-83; and (2) recognises that money raised by road user charges should be directed to roads. The Government's track record on the important issue of road funding is appalling. Funding for main roads has fallen almost 30 per cent in per capita terms-in real terms as well-over the past seven years. Australian national road funds, which were $1.5 billion in 1990-91, have been reduced by 25 per cent in real terms since 1983-84, when the Hawke Government came to power, due to the nonindexing of funds, whereas fuel excises increased from $1.8 billion to close to $5 billion over the same period. I have a table here. I wish everyone could see it because it shows in the most obvious terms that huge gap. That is what this debate is really about-the huge gap between excise collections, which have absolutely skyrocketed since 1984-85, and road funding. The road funding trend line is almost flat while the excise collections trend line goes sky high in those particular years. This is what this debate is all about. When fuel excise was introduced in 1975, close to three-quarters of it was allocated to road funding and yet in 1991-92 only one-fifth of excise revenue was allocated to road funding. That is what we are talking about here this morning-the fact that in 1975-76 only 2c out of the 5c collected from fuel excise actually went to areas other than road funding. Today we have a fuel excise of almost 26c per litre. Of that, almost 20c-that is, four-fifths of what is collected-goes to areas other than road funding. In fact, only out of that almost 26c per litre actually goes to road funding. That is the crux of this debate. I challenge the other members of the Government who will speak in this debate to refute what said. There is indisputable evidence that this Government came to power it has continued to milk road users as a source of funds while roads in many parts of the country remain in a very sorry state of disrepair. The places which have suffered the most have been the fastest growing areas of Australia. My electorate of MCPherson certainly falls within that category. The Gold Coast region is recognised as one of the fastest growing areas in Australia. We have there a rapid increase in tourist numbers and a rapid increase in through traffic going from New South Wales to Brisbane. We now see the amount spent on the arterial roads systemthe Pacific Highway and the other main roads-falling well short of the needs and demands of the motoring public who use those roads. I could point to many instances of road conditions being totally inadequate between the Gold Coast city area and the Albert Shire. In fact, they are deplorable. In one twokilometre stretch of the Pacific Highway that goes through Nerang, the main arterial route from New South Wales through to Brisbane, there are three sets of traffic lights. These are at crossings of the Pacific Highway and all within two kilometres. In this day and age, that is absolutely outrageous and yet we' are told by the local authorities that the Federal Government is not prepared to guarantee the funding for the building of the necessary interchanges there for at least five years. To the local authorities and to the Albert Shire Council in particular, this is totally unacceptable. I am sure we will hear from the Government some way of getting around this by fiddling with the figures. I challenge it when it does that to address the issues. There are complexities when it comes to comparing different levels of road funding. At the October 1990 Special Premiers Conference it 6c was decided that Federal funds for local roads would be absorbed into local government general revenue assistance. At roughly the same time the Commonwealth effectively abolished the State arterial roads category of I have funding and reallocated funds from that since category to other funding categories. With the abolition of that category all Commonwealth funds have been directed into specific projects deemed to be-and here we have it again, the great socialist approach to doing things-of not only economic importance but also social importance. Of C01,lrse, these changes by the Government over the last couple of years have effectively muddied the waters. One fact that is plainly obvious-and I challenge Government members to address it when they join in this debate-is that the Government is using road users as a source of general revenue. We deplore that. I pointed to the figures. I challenge Government members, when they speak, to explain to those members of the Australian public who are listening to this debate today and who are in the Parliament why that is occurring and why, over the past seven or eight years, the Government has directed money from fuel excise into general revenue at an alarming rate. That is a challenge that I hold out to those opposite today. The people who are caught in traffic jams on the Pacific Highway, on their way home to Brisbane from a weekend at the Gold Coast, are currently paying through the nose and they are receiving little benefit for it. Also of great concern to me, of course, is the fact that many people who live on parts of the Gold Coast and work in Brisbane, simply because they have to work there, have to travel up and back on that road each day; and they are put at greater risk as they commute because of the shocking state of that road. I could go into great detail about the deplorable state of the roads all over the Coast region. Both the Gold Coast City Council and the Albert Shire Council are extremely concerned about their capacity, because of this reduction in Federal Government funding that has occurred over the years, to even cope with the sorts of traffic projections that we are looking at the next few years. In 1982-83-the Hawke Government succeeded the Fraser Government towards the end of that period-road funding levels actually received an unprecedented boost with the Fraser Government's bicentennial funding initiative. This period-the 1982-83 periodactually represented the peak of road funding levels in this country, and those levels have not been maintained. That is the other complaint that we have got. That is the other little bit of evidence that we want refuted by the Government. The fact is that the Government has not maintained road funding at those levels.",37
33,Mr LAVARCH,ROAD FUNDING,What are you going to do about it? What's your policy?,39
34,Mr BRADFORD,ROAD FUNDING,"I will come to that, if I get time, in a moment. Let me talk about the Government's first. I will talk about the Government's and those opposite can talk about ours. The Government's One Nation statement announced a boost to road funding in a desperate effort to create jobs through increased spending on infrastructure. But it was all going to go into a black spots program which is supposed to correct identified accident problem sites. I am prepared to guess once again that these identified problem sites, as they are so quaintly termed, are going to be mostly in Labor electorates. Mr Andrew-Or marginal seats.",39
35,Mr BRADFORD,ROAD FUNDING,"Or marginal seats, as I am told by my colleague. I reckon that that is where they will all be. The Gold Coast, as has happened so often, will be largely overlooked. Mr Courtice-The Gold Coast has been pampered for 30 years.",39
36,Mr BRADFORD,ROAD FUNDING,"I bet there will be plenty of black spots in Hinkler, besides the local member there. Let me get to the quesGold tion now. The Government's record contrasts dramatically with the coalition's approach to road funding. We will ensure once again, as occurred before those opposite came to government, that road users are not treated as milch cows for general revenue. Our user pays approach to road funding will ensure over that all revenue raised by user charges is spent on road maintenance and construction. We will abolish fuel excise. Fuel will be 20c cheaper and it will cost $10 less every time the average motorist fills up his or her car. We also believe that existing funds can go significantly further in the construction and maintenance of roads through contracting out. The Government's record in road funding is appalling and indefensible and it is yet one more area where it has let down the Australian people, which it continues to do. I challenge Government members, in this debate, to show otherwise. (TIme expired)",39
37,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ROAD FUNDING,Is the motion seconded?,39
38,Mr REID,ROAD FUNDING,"I second the motion put forward by my colleague the honourable member for MCPherson, and I reserve my right to speak at some future time.",40
39,Mr LAVARCH,ROAD FUNDING,"I will immediately take up the challenge issued by the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford), imd it really is a blast from the past. I think I have spoken in about two or three of these road funding debates put up by Opposition members, and it certainly is a pet subject for them. It is a very important subject; I certainly do not deny that. The reality is that they never want to compare apples with apples when they start doing these comparisons of how many cents in the litre is coming out of fuel excise. What they never say, of course, is that the arrangement in terms of the collection of fuel excise has changed very significantly over the life of the Government. Because of those changes, it is quite misleading to compare figures in the last years of the Fraser Government with current figures. The most fundamental one was in 1986 with the introduction of a resource rental tax on petroleum. The reality is that, if one compares the actual average dollars spent on roads over the life of the Fraser Government with the average dollars spent by the Hawke and Keating governments on roads, one sees that the spending of the current Government is something like 22 per cent higher in real terms than that of the Fraser Government. So let us not have this nonsense about trying to compare how many cents in the litre from the fuel excise or how much of the resource rental tax goes into roads. Members of the Opposition also have no comprehension at all of the excise position on petrol. There are two components of the excise on petroleum in Australia. One is a resource rental tax and the other is the actual fuel excise. What Opposition members do is lump the two together and say, 'This is the total figure and this is how much is being spent on roads: it is a very small proportion of this total figure'. Of course, what they do not ever say is that the resource rental tax is in effect a super profit tax and that, if that was not charged on the petrol companies, it would not mean any reduction in the actual price of petrol; what it would mean would be higher profits for the companies and less revenue coming to the people of Australia. It is a fair comparison to look at the cents per litre coming out of the actual fuel excise and not to lump the two charges together. The honourable member for MCPherson did not do that in his comparison and he also did not mention the basic fact that the current Government's average spending on roads is something like 22 per cent higher in real terms than the Fraser Government's. This year alone, the Government will spend $1.6 billion on roads. That is simply earmarked for roads. That does not take into account the funding which then goes in untied grants both to the States and to local government, both of whom are major players in the construction of roads in Australia. The Federal Government does not build any roads in Australia. All roads constructed out of Federal funds are constructed either by local councils or, if they are national highways, by State main roads departments on contract. The honourable member for MCPherson made great play about the position of local councils and how they were telling him they were having difficulty with road funding. I spent two terms on the Pine Rivers Shire Council immediately before my election here. I served on that council's works committee and I was involved for six years with that council's road building program. I think it is the sixth or seventh largest council in Queensland. Like councils in the electorate of MCPherson, it deals with a part of the southeast comer of Queensland that is urbanising very fast. I am only too familiar with the demands on local government caused by having to build new infrastructure, new roads, to meet population increases. But the reality is that councils are largely the masters of their own destiny. I do not have the figures exactly but the two Gold Coast councils to which the honourable member referred would receive in untied grants something like $1.5m a year from the Commonwealth Government. It might even be a bit higher than that, but those tax certainly would be the figures of similar councils on the north side of Brisbane. Those councils can decide what they spend. They can spend that whole $1.5m supplementing their road program if they think it is a high enough priority. The Gold Coast City Council is probably very fond of its cultural facilities, and I do not knock it for that. It has got lovely cultural facilities and first rate council chambers. have no idea what the Albert Shire spent that huge complex people see as they drive down the old south coast highway. But if those councils think that road building is No. 1 priority, that is their decision. They elected representatives; they. have their budgets; and they must determine where they spend their money. What the Commonwealth is doing is saying, 'We respect you as elected representatives. We will not be tying your funding into particular earmarked categories. We will make more and more of your funding untied so that you can respond to your own community demands'. That is a sensible move which local government very much welcomes. Mr Bradford-This is muddying the water.",40
40,Mr LAVARCH,ROAD FUNDING,"The honourable member roads for MCPherson says that it is muddying the water to say that these things are no longer earmarked but combined in pooled funds. imagine that if he went and told his two councils, which he is very fond is muddying the water he would get a very stark response. I know that is what he would get from the local government areas in electorate, because they are very keen on these sorts of changes which give them more responsibility for their own destiny. They make their own decisions about where they spend their money. If their No. 1 demand the area is road building, then they can allocate a large part or all of that money road building. If their No. 1 demand is to improve the water system or the sewerage system or to get more parks and gardens, then they can spend it on that. Finally, after the honourable member's huffmg and puffing about not enough money being spent on roads, I challenged him to say what the Opposition is going to do about it. One of his party's hallmarks, one of its main planks for going to the Australian people, that it is going to knock about $10 billion off roads. government spending. I think that equates to about a $4 billion net reduction in government spending. His party's other great platform is that it is going to knock out all the excises-the resource rental tax and the excise on petrol-and impose a single goods and services tax of 15 per cent. According to I honourable members opposite, this will lead on to a great reduction in the cost of petrol. I am like every other motorist. If I thought the the price of petrol was going to be reduced, are that would obviously appeal to me. It would own appeal to everyone. That is why honourable members opposite are proposing it. But I say to them, 'Please do not come in here proposing that you are going to actually cut government spending, that you are going to reduce the amount of money coming from the excise, and then pretend through some sort of magical three-card trick that you can do it all'. The Opposition is saying, 'People can pay less. We are going to cut what government does. Petrol prices are going to go down. But we are going to build more as well'. This is great stuff! It is all done with mirrors: People are supposed to be distracted by looking up at a shining light and I not realising what is happening around the back with the hands in the pocket, grabbing of, that this it in another way. The other thing that honourable members my opposite say is, 'We believe in road user charges'. What does that mean? Of course, we have not had spelt out what they actually can mean by road user charges. Do they mean some sort of extra charge on petrol? One in assumes not, because they say they are not going to do that. Do they mean some sort of to massive increase in registrations? They are very silent about that one. We have not had the answer to that. All we have heard them say is that there is going to be a transport commission which will do an assessment of what it actually costs to build and maintain roads in 'Australia. Consistent with the philosophy of the entire Fightback proposals and consistent with Liberal philosophy, user pays means that road users will have to pay is the total cost of maintaining and building Honourable members opposite do not say how that is going to happen. If they are not going to do it through the petroleum excise, they will have to do it through registrations or some other new charge or scheme that they will have to devise. I ask them not to try to con people by saying, 'The price of petrol is going to go down. We are still going to build all these roads. But somehow, magically, you do not have to pay for it'. People do have to pay for it. They understand that. They also know that there are many complicated issues involved in these things. They are not simple, straightforward questions, as the honourable member makes out. If it is looked at objectively and fairly, record of the Government on road funding is good. We would all like to see more money spent on roads, but it is a good record. It is much superior to that of the previous conservative Government. At least there is a basically sensible, straightforward and open policy and none of that nonsense about saying, 'We will not actually tell you where we are going to get the road user charges. We will not tell you about registrations. We will not tell you about any other thing we are going to dream up until we get there. Then we will sit down with this magic pudding of paying people less'. (TIme expired).",41
41,Mr HICKS,ROAD FUNDING,"In supporting this motion of the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford), I say first of all, in answer to the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch), let us have a look at the Federal Government road funding program since 1983. In 1983-84 the amount spent on roads by the Federal Government was $1.75 billion; in 1989-90 it was $1.37 billion, a drop of $0.38 billion. I do not know how we can come to the conclusion that there has been an increase in expenditure. If we go through the years, we see that, in 1984-85, it was down 1.3 per cent; in 1985-86, down 6.1 per cent; in 198687, down 4 per cent; in 1987-88, down 5 per cent; in 1988-89, down 6.2 per cent; in 198990, down 1.2 per cent. Road user payments to the Federal Government and petrol excise in 1982-83 were $1.08 billion and in 1989-90 they were $5.08 billion. In fact, the Federal Government is ripping off the people of Australia by $2.5 billion which it is not putting into roads. That is a conservative estimate. I heard the honourable member for Fisher ranting and raving about the Fightback package, which he obviously knows very little about. One thing I can guarantee him is that anything a coalition government does will be paid for, cash up front. There will be none of this nonsense of putting this nation further and further into debt. In the Fightback package everything is costed across the board. The people of Australia will be getting what they paid for, but they will be paying for what the they get. Let us have none of this nonsense that the Government is doing this, that and the other; most of it is on borrowed money. Any fool can create jobs and build something when he is borrowing money. We see it all the time. I think that argument is fallacious. The reason I am speaking here today is because I am a little concerned. I was very excited when the One Nation package came out; of course, it is now called the 'Ruination' package. One paragraph reads: A key objective of this Government is to rationalise the role of each level of government to remove overlapping and therefore confusing responsibilities. In this context the addition of routes based on the existing Sturt (Sydney-Adelaide) and Newell (Melbourne-Brisbane) highways represents a logical extension of the inter-capital NHS. I read that, re-read it and re-readit. It is a bit of gobbledegook because when honourable members read it they will see that it says neither one thing nor another. It suggests that those roads might be. good as part of the national highway system; it builds up people's hopes. It has done this in my electorate but, of course, after a lot of research it has let people down. I have been telling people in my electorate, 'Yes, the Government is going to spend all this money on the Newell and Sturt highways. Isn't that wonderful?'. But as I make some investigations, some of these people are a bit like the Phantom; it is a bit like the Qantas-Australian airline deal, the pay TV and the technical college fiasco of the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Certainly, I agree with some of the issues but it seems there is a change in policy every day. I think this is a grab bag. I think the Prime Minister, in trying to get the One Nation package together, phoned around the various State road departments and said, 'What would be a good idea?'. It was not thoroughly researched and now we find that all these people who have had their hopes built up are going to have them dashed. I hope I am wrong but it is not looking good. I would like to apologise to the Narrandera Shire Council and to the Hay Shire Council because I have been telling them, 'Yes, certainly, the Federal Government is going to spend a lot of money on those roads'. What they are concerned about, of course, is that it is now looking as if those routes will not be the main Brisbane to Melbourne and Sydney to Adelaide routes. It may be that they may change those routes. We do not know. There is nothing in the One Nation program about it. I can understand other local government areas saying to the government-both State and Federal-'We want to change the route of the highway. We want to make this the national highway, to make this the State highway', because of the atrocious conditions of the roads in New South Wales. I am not blaming the New South Wales Government because continually the cutbacks to the State Government of New South Wales via, the Federal Government are horrendous. Of course, in New South Wales we have the 3 x 3 program with the State Government trying to do something about roads. Of course, in this recession that we did not have to have, the money is just not available. So it is battling on, in the best way it can, to try something with the road system. In my electorate of Riverina-Darling in western New South Wales, where I live, I must say-not in any way in the form of a brag, because I do not consider driving on our road system to be any great form of pleasure-that this year I will probably clock up my one millionth kilometre since I became the member for Riverina and then RiverinaDarling. So I think I know a little bit about the road system. One of the roads I would like to talk about is the Cobb Highway, the road that extends from Wilcannia right down through to Hay. The Cobb Highway, particularly between Ivanhoe and Hay is notorious .. Over the past few years I would say that the closure rate would be about 10 per cent of the year. A couple of years ago it was closed for 80 days. In Ivanhoe, which is a small community in western New South Wales, when that road is cut the people have no way of getting out of town to go to the south to get to civilisation for whatever reason they may want to leave. Certainly, getting goods and products into the area and produce out is very difficult. A Cobb Highway action committee was formed some years ago and they made representations to the State Government. I am pleased to say that something is being done there but of course it is very slow because of this lack of funding. It is sealed 43 kilometres south of Ivanhoe and it is hoped that over the next several years that that road will be completely sealed. It is interesting that the new technology has come into play there and the Government is trying a geotextile mat on a normal clay surface. Rather than have to try to get those gravels from that area, which are very scare and which add to the cost of the road, by using geotextile they have been able to reduce the cost by about 40 per cent. It is hoped that in 1992-93 another seven kilometres of the road will be done and that eight kilometres a year will be done after 1992-93, so there is good work going on there. I would like to congratulate Helen Rogers, who is the chairman of that organisation, for the great work that she has done. I would also like to thank Jim Small the to do State member for Murray, Adrian Cruickshank, who is the member for Murrumbidgee, and Mick Beckworth, the President of the Hay Shire. Time does not permit me to speak about all of the roads in my electorate but heaven knows most of the them need some workMr Andrew-You would be here till Christmas.",42
42,Mr HICKS,ROAD FUNDING,"I would be here till Christmas. It would be a great Christmas present if we could get some more money for these roads. I would like to speak about the Kidman Highway, from Hillston to Cobar and through to Bourke in Queensland. It is a road which a number of people in that area would like to see sealed. It is a horrendous road, a dangerous road, and it also has a lot of heavy traffic on it. Another road, of course, is the Rankin Springs to Lake Cargelligo road. The Carrathool Shire, the Bland Shire and the Lachlan Shire are to be congratulated on the work that they are doing there. I believe that road is one of the most dangerous in my electorate; it is like driving on marbles. It great to see some of it being sealed but I would like to see a lot more money spent on these roads. I would like to pay a tribute to those workers of the Road and Traffic Authority in New South Wales. It is presently undergoing a great deal of restructuring which makes it very difficult for those workers, particularly in outback areas because they are worried about their jobs. Obviously, all governments have had to tighten their belt in this recession and it is probably right that economies have been made where possible. But I think we have to remember that these men, and also the women who work in the offices, are a substantial part of these communities. It is very difficult for these people in this time as they are worried about their jobs. Of course, a lot of this could be overcome, particularly in the areas that I am speaking about, if the Federal Government would increase its expenditure. I know that things are tough and I know that we cannot keep on living on borrowed money; we have to have cash in hand. The honourable member for Fisher spoke about the local councils and he said that they can make decisions about where they spend their money"" but there are so many other necessities of life. I think that local government is also going through a fairly rough period at this stage, as are most areas of administration. I am concerned about the amount of money going into roads because I know how important roads are, not only for the good of the community, as far as our economy goes, but also for the social fabric of our community. We are a large nation. I see that some people were criticising the coalition's Fightback package for reducing the price of fuel because it would add to the greenhouse gas emissions. I would like those people to go out and live at Wilcannia or Bourke or Broken Hill, and those places, where we have to pay additional costs on every item that comes into the area because of the tyranny of distance, as we call it here in Australia. I am sure that the benefits to be gained by reducing the price of fuel for these people would far outweigh any problem that might be faced by greenhouse gas emisis sions from the use of vehicles in those areas. Certainly in cities we might be able to do something but I think that is another argument. We have to do something about preventing the growth of these huge cities at the expense of those people who want to live in outback area and who want to provide a better quality of life for their families and for themselves.",43
43,Mr HOLLIS,ROAD FUNDING,"I sometimes wonder whether there is something in the air in this chamber that makes people who are normally rational outside the chamber come out with the most outlandish statements when they get in here. I know and respect the honourable member for Riverina-Darling (Mr Hicks) and I know that he has a background in this area of roads, but when he comes in here he talks nonsense. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) will follow meÂ· in this debate and it is my bet, going on past experience, that he will have some weird and wonderful graph that he will want incorporated in Hansard. I do not know what it is that makes honourable members come out with this nonsense when they come in here. We heard the honourable member for Riverina-Darling say that, in the unlikely event that the Opposition got into government, it would all be cash up front: people would know what they were getting and it would be paid for. He may have problems with the roads in his electorate but, if the Opposition were to rely on the local people-which it is proposing-to pay for the roads, the roads throughout his electorate would be even worse. The honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) said, 'Oh well, it is all very complex'. Of course, it is complex. Road funding is very complex. It is not complex, though, that this Government has given to road funding 20 per cent more, in real terms, than the Fraser Government did. But the honourable member for MCPherson comes up with all sorts of things and says 'Oh well, it is very complex'. He then went into a little bit of creative accountancy. As the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) said, those opposite are going to cut this, cut that the other, and yet they are going to spend more money on roads. It is impossible to do it-and they know it. The honourable member for MCPherson is an intelligent person. He knows that he cannot cut these things and then put more money into roads. When we are talking about the amount of revenue that is raised, these people opposite have really got to start being honest with the Australian people, We know where in the general revenue the extra funds go. These people opposite have really got to be honest with the Australian people and tell them what they are going to cut. If they are going to say that the money that is now raised from the excise is all going to be spent on roads, they are going to have less money to spend on roads. But then what are they going to cut? Are they going to cut education? Are they going to cut health? Are they going to cut welfare? They are not saying this. Those opposite come into this chamber and try to be all things to all people-and they cannot do it. They cannot be all things to all people. People say, 'We would all like better roads'. But if the Fraser Government spent so much on roads and if the roads were so wonderful, why when we came to government in 1983 were the roads in such a mess and in such an appalling condition? Part of the national highway runs through the area that I represent. The only part of the national highway that was not duplicated when I came into office with the Hawke Labor Government in 1983 was the area from Mittagong down to Berrima. One of the first things that this Government did was to start duplicating that highway. We bypassed Berrima, and in September we will be opening the last part of that highway, bypassing Mittagong. Had the Fraser Government still been in power, people would have still had to trundle through Berrima and through Mittagong. Let us be serious about this. We know that real funding has steadily increased-in real terms. Despite what those opposite do with creative accountancy, they cannot get away from that fact. The honourable member for MCPherson was talking about the Gold Coast and people and cut having three sets of traffic lights or something. I do not know that area well, but I do know that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) will be up there very shortly openingMr Bradford-Another set of traffic lights?",44
44,Mr HOLLIS,ROAD FUNDING,"No, the rail link from Brisbane to the Gold Coast, as I understand it. Surely that will take some of the people off the road. I know that the motion today talks about roads, but we cannot isolate roads from all the costs of transport in Australia. I have long been an advocate of rail, and I think that we must put more emphasis on rail and must start looking at some of the real costs of the damage that has been done to our road system. Opposition members keep talking about how cost-effective they would be if they were in government-of course, they will not be in government-but we have never heard them say anything about the real costs of what heavy transport does to our roads. If we were more realistic in charging for some of the damage that the heavy vehicles do to the roads, we would be able to spend a lot of the money that is allocated for road work on building new roads instead of just repairing roads. So much of our money is going into repairing roads. I have said many times that I think all governments of all political pers-asions, both State and Federal, have ignored the potential of rail. If we could get some of that heavy traffic off the Melbourne-Brisbane or the Sydney-Melbourne roads, and put it on rail, where it should be, we would not have the Hume Highway being churned up as it is. We have to look at that. The only person I ever hear talking about that on the other side is the Leader of the National Party, who is very keen that more money go into rail. Instead of talking about more money going into road all the time, we should be looking realistically at an integrated transport system in Australia; and much of the traffic that today is going on road should be on rail. The steelworks at Port Kembla is sending things by road, yet we have a railway line going past there. A lot of that should be going on rail so it does not do the damage that it is doing to our roads. It really does surprise me that Opposition members keep coming in here and making promises to people about what they are going to do in the unlikely event that they get into government, because they will not be able to do it. If they go ahead, if they are serious in what they are planning and. if they are serious with their cuts-even if they are serious about the cuts in fuel-they will not have the money there to start to do what they are claiming that they are going to do, so they are deluding the Australian people. The Opposition can delude the Australian people for only so long. As soon as they start adding things up and doing their sums out there in the wider community, the creative accountancy of the honourable member for MCPherson will not wear. It just will not wear. His figures just do not add up, because he cannot do it. If he is getting less money he cannot spend it. The honourable member for RiverinaDarling started saying that people would know what they were getting and people would pay for it. I was recently in New Zealand and I had a look at the road funding system there, and what they are doing is what the honourable member was suggesting would happen here. Give me Australian roads any day, compared with New Zealand roads. Give me Australian roads in the condition that they are in. The real danger in New Zealand is going to be that no repairs will be done and no new roads will be built. That is what the Opposition is proposing here: that no new roads will be built. I can only talk about the roads in my own electorate. I must say that in my own electorate, since the Hawke Government has come to power, not only have we spent 20 per cent more, we have spent millions and millions more. Mr Bradford-That is the point I was making; a Labor electorate.",45
45,Mr HOLLIS,ROAD FUNDING,"It may be because it is my electorate, but it is also because of the very effective representation that I have made in pressing the claims of the national highway. We have Berrima bypass today, we will have Mittagong bypass by the end of September, and we will have an effective national highway running through my electorate, thanks to the Hawke Labor Government. Had the conservatives still been in power we most certainly would not have had that. But I do want to get some of those heavy vehicles off that road, otherwise the road will decline very rapidly. The extra money that could have been spent on other roads in other parts of the State will have to go on repairs. Do not talk to me about what the New South Wales Government is doing. Wal Murray has said that there will be no expenditure on roads in New South Wales for the next two years. The only expenditure will be in his own electorate. (TIme expired)",46
46,Mr ANDREW,ROAD FUNDING,"I want to acknowledge the initiative of the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr in, Bradford) in introducing this motion into the --Iouse. In my opening remarks I also want to pay a tribute to the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) who has seconded the honourable member for MCPherson's motion, but who has been accommodating enough to alIow me to speak in this debate and to reserve his right to speak at a later date. I am particularly grateful that, given the interest he has in roads in his electorate and the concern he has for a number of the road networks in the Bendigo area that need to be upgraded, he has been prepared to defer and allow me this opportunity to participate in the debate, partly to his immediate disadvantage. I have to say to the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) that I was just a little amused at his comments, because he claimed a great deal of credit for the improvement in the road network in the electorate of Throsby and suggested that' this had indicated that he had been a most effective local member. Mr Duncan-Hear, hear!",46
47,Mr ANDREW,ROAD FUNDING,"The irony of those so that remarks, as the Parliamentary Secretary to Attorney-General (Mr Duncan), who is at the table, would be well aware, is that the honourable member for Throsby needs to convince honourable members-not this side of the House, but those on the other side-that he has been a most effective local member, if he wishes to continue to be the local member. I acknowledge, however, the point validly made by the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) that it does not matter on which side of the House honourable members are in this debate, not enough money is being spent on road funding. I am not here as a member of the Opposition suggesting that under the Hawke or Keating governments road funding somehow dried up. It is a coincidence that, in order to accomon modate a Rotary exchange student visiting local Rotary club, I drove on Sunday from my roads. home base of Gawler in South Australia to Canberra on Sunday to this parliamentary sitting. In the process I must admit noticed that a great deal has been done upgrade the Sydney-Melbourne link and, from the few occasions that I have driven that route, I could see that it was in better conber, dition than it has ever been. But having said that, I also had to get somehow from the Riverland area of South Australia to Wagga Wagga across. the Hay plain, where a great deal of work remains to be done. No party on either side of the House can afford to stand and claim some sort of the monopoly on road funding wisdom. The plea that the Opposition makes-entirely defenbecause sibly, because we are the Opposition and task is to alert both the Government and the people of Australia to things that are not being done as well as they ought to be done-is a simple one. It is not has been done, but that more needs to be done in road funding. We are talking about the infrastructure system of this enormous continent and we are talking about the obligation we have as parliamentarians to ensure that the maximum amount of money is focused on road funding so that goods can get from farm to port and people can get to facilities. I have no the doubt that after the next election, when we are on the other side of the House, there will be honourable members opposite making a plea for more funds for roads, no matter how those on much is being spent. . The point remains that currently in Australia we have a real infrastructure rundown and the criticism the Opposition offers of the Government's road funding program is this: the Government is collecting more in fuel excise than any government has ever collected. It has gone from $1.5 billion when we lost office to something like $4.8 billion in real terms, and that money is not being targeted to roads. That is what we are simply saying; that is what the honourable member for MCPherson points out, particularly in section 2 of his motion where he calls the House to recognise that money raised my by road user charges should be directed to This plea is a plea for fuel excise to be spent on roads. The honourable member for that I Fisher has said that he was a local to government councillor and had a lot of experience. He does not have a monopoly.on that because many of the others in this chamincluding the Deputy Speaker, have such experience. What I want to point out to the honourable member for Fisher is that, while the councils in his area might be toasters of their own destiny, they are certainly not masters of their own destiny in rural areas such as mine or in those areas represented by Deputy Speaker or, to a lesser degree, by the Parliamentary Secretary at the table, in those rural areas there is no way our councils can be responsible for road maintenance and road funding or allocate sufficient funds for that purpose, as the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) must be that nothing painfully well aware. The fact is that these roads in .sparsely populated rural areas are not there only to service those rural communities; they are there because the people working in the rural areas are involved in generating the very goods this nation needs to tum around its balance of payments deficit. So all of the taxpayers and road users around Australia have a responsibility to ensure that they are accepting some of the cost of keeping these roads in sufficiently good state to get these goods delivered to the ports. Much has been said in this debate about how motorists are not all that disadvantaged. Frankly, this is not a plea just for motorists; it is also a plea for road transport operators. The coalition's Fightback package has been targeted at making it cheaper for road transport operators to operate and so reduce the real cost burden being borne by isolated rural communities. Much has been made by the honourable member for Fisher about what presumably the Opposition has failed to do. Why the Opposition? There is every possibility that by time of the next election we will have been the Opposition for a decade. It is astonishing that after being in opposition for a decade we are still called to account for the state of Australian roads. Responsibility for that rests with honourable members opposite and we will continue to point that out. While much is made of what the Opposition would do, I have heard nothing from any honourable member opposite about what the Government proposes to do with its road user charge schedule. I have heard nothing about what it proposes to do. Government members have not addressed the issue, even though they are the Government and the people responsible for raising the revenue and upgrading the roads. I am not here simply to belittle what the Government is about. I wrote to the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Brown) about a specific stretch of road in my electorate that I thought justified separate attention. To his credit I received a courteous reply from the Minister, one sentence of which read: An independent study has been commissioned to examine these routes and to help detennine the most appropriate routes which best meet the national highway objectives. I want to use this portion of the debate to point out to the House and to Australia at large that if the Government is proposing an independent study to look at national highway routes, it is time it made all honourable members aware of the fact that that study is in progress. Honourable members need that information because this independent study is expected to report to the Minister by mid-1992. I want to the say to the members of this study that if they are looking at the direction that national highway routes ought to take, then in order not to disappoint the honourable member for Throsby let me point out to the House a map which indicates how running through my electorate from Morgan in the Riverland-a route that will be well known to the Parliamentary Secretary at the table-through Burra to Spalding, there is a real opportunity to make a much more direct route from Sydney to Perth. It is conspicuously obvious in the maps. I seek leave to have the maps incorporated in Hansard in order to indicate to readers of Hansard and to all of those opposite just how direct a route would exist if we were prepared to seal the road that currently runs from Morgan through Burra to Spalding. Leave granted. The maps read as followsNA NA \.I> 3: Â» 's.:.r_ --W "" c-..... ""11 I; f\) Â» VI I I CI.l CI.l -4r.-.. c.;...... -'- ,Y2TC-' ... "" -, ."" c,;--'-..."", "" .-''''-!--I ..

48,Mr ANDREW,TERRITORY,"I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I thank the Parliamentary Secretary who, as a fellow South Australian, recognises the importance of this particular road link. Mr Duncan-Yes, but as an AdelaideStates based member I am not sure whether bypasmaintenance. sing Adelaide is something I should support.",51
49,Mr ANDREW,TERRITORY,"I would point out to the Parliamentary Secretary that there is a great deal of advantage for every South Australian in allowing the heavy road users who have wish to get to Adelaide to use this route. fact, at present such users are forced to divert south through Eudunda to avoid that and head direct to Perth. '{his provides a real opportunity to prune the costs involved in Perth-Sydney links. Much has been said in the debate about rail but time is not going to permit me to address that, so I thank the honourable member for MCPherson for bringing this motion to the House. (TIme expired)",51
50,Mr COURTICE,TERRITORY,"I oppose the motion, but before going onto I would like to make some points in relation programs. to road funding, and just put the facts, as have the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) and the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). Road funding has steadily increased in realÂ· terms since the inception of the current road funding program in 1988-89. The average road funding level real terms for the last nine years, under the Labor Government, as the honourable member for Fisher said, is 22 per cent greater than average level of road funding provided for under the seven years of the Fraser . provide. Government. In 1991-92, road funding has increased nominally by $130.3m ot nearly per cent over funding provided in 1990-91. This is a real terms increase of almost $85m or 5.5 per cent. The real terms increase is due mainly to additional funding allowed for under the employment statement of November 1991 and the One Nation statement, which are indepences dent of fuel excise. This trend will continue in 1992-93 as a result of a huge injection road funding announced in the One Nation statement totalling $437.5m in 1992-93. This continues the Government's commitment to the development of a better integrated national land transport network and allows the Federal Government to maintain a large construction program at a time when many are not necessarily providing funds for There is no doubt that there is a lot of money to be saved, as the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew). said, with improving integrated transport in this country. no Profits to be made from farm gate to market In have definitely got potential, but we do need the cooperation and the support of all six State governments but also, importantly, local government. There is a role to play for the three levels working together. Much was said on the other side of the House about fuel excise and where the money goes that does not go into roads. I think I have proved the point that we have increased funding for roads, so I will move on from that. The money from fuel excise that does not go into roads goes into hospitals, housing, education, and the basic infrastructure- such that, as home and community care and all those If the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) wants to take money out of those areas, he should come in here and say so. I oppose money coming out of those areas and I support the present program. I have in continually said that while we are increasing funding for roads, as I have pointed out, I do not believe that all the money should go into the roads at the expense of health, housing, education and all the other facilities that we The other point that needs to be made, of 9 course, is that we give a lot of money-I think it is something like 75 per cent-to the States. A lot of that is untied and the States can determine where they wish to spend the the money. They are all big boys and they are able to stand on their own two feet and make the decisions and then accept the consequenof those decisions in their own electorates. But, further to the point, then comes local of government and local government also gets untied grants. They have the opportunity to determine where their priorities are. But what is happening with local government, particularly in Queensland? There is opposition to amalgamation of shires to maintain power-that is all-for the National Party at the expense of micro-economic reform and efficiency. It is not their responsibility, as they view of sharing a little bit of micro-economic reform and putting Australia first. It is about maintaining a power base that is more in line with Tennessee in 1930. One of the problems with improving transport across this country is that it requires all three levels working together, and certainly more effort in Queensland has been used through the Local Government Association in opposing the amalgamation of shires than has been used in actually getting on with the job. During the term of the Bjelke-Petersen Government over some seven years, the Self report showed, and I have said it many times in this House, that $40m-and it was misquoted in Hansard as $400m and I missed it and did not correct it, so I would like to correct it now-was ripped off local government in transfer charges by the BjelkePetersen Government. Not one word was said by the RACQ in Queensland. Not one word was said by the leaders or spokesmen of local government. Every time it came to an election, out they would trot with their anti-Labor propaganda, particularly two clowns in the Wide Bay area-Mackintosh and Roberts-who have never once stuck up for local government and opposed the rip-off of transfer charges. They have never stood up against the drought rorts which took another $30m out of their own constituency, but they oppose freer trade and the fact that we are now selling dairy products that come out of the South Burnett area, the south-eastern Queensland area, overseas. They oppose that process by wanting to put up protection and ban products coming into this country. Goodness me-they are the sorts of people that are running local government! When one goes to some of these local government shires, one can see the big mausoleums that are built for, millionsÂ· of dollars so that councillors can sit in there and pretend that they are really important, instead of having the courage to make some tough decisions supporting amalgamations and achieving better economies of scale so that they can actually deliver better services for their own constituency. When one sees the way in which some local governments are it, elected, it makes a mockery of democracy, quite frankly, an absolute mockery. Some divisions have about 30 or 40 people and others, particularly in the smaller towns, have 600 to 1,000, to elect one person each. And they talk about being efficient and effective in the modern world! The spotlight ought to go back onto local government, particularly in Queensland, and I would like to compliment the Goss Government for moving on that. Tom Burns is a breath of fresh air in that regard. I think everyone in Queensland loves Tom. One of the National Party politicians in my area, Doug Slack, even came out and praised him the other day, and that really says something. When we listen to what the Opposition has had to say about road user charges, I think it brings in an interesting contrast. We are looking at and working with State governments to have road user charges along with excise. We have been doing that for quite some time; in fact, the Butcher report came out something like two years ago and we have been working through that process. When road user charges were first mentioned, rural communities, spokesmen and representatives of organisations like the UGA and the Cattlemen's Union came out and opposed road user charges and voiced some legitimate concerns in regards to the impact that such charges would have on transporting beef in particular, and grain and sheep as well, in farflung areas. The Road Transport Association both in Queensland and nationally also was very concerned and showed that it did not actually support that proposition. But what does the Opposition have as a policy? Abolishing excise and moving totally over time, it says in Fightback, to road user charges. The interesting thing is that I have not heard those same organisations coming out and saying, 'We do not want this'. If they did not want part road user charges with excise, I would like to know why the UGA, the Cattlemen's Union and the grain growels are not coming out and saying, 'We do not want full road user charges'. Obviously they are not aware of this fact because otherwise it would be a little bit of duplicity on their I am sure that they would put the interests of their own members first, I am sure that they would not be politically biased enough to support a proposition of road user charges that would force trucks off the roads in rural communities, or which, if it is not at a proper level to maintain roads, would see roads crumble and fall apart. I do not believe that they would purposely in a machiavellian way do that, because I do believe they put their rural constituency first most of the time. But why does not Bill Bonthrone from the UGA come out and say, 'I do not want a bar of full road user charges and I do not want a bar of Fightback' when he was concerned, as were many other people, in regards to the effect that part road user charges, along with excise, would have? The other nonsense that needs to be put to rest is that, if we were to forgo excise, the full amount would be passed on to the consumer. Quite obviously, the Opposition does believe in the tooth fairy and I think that Wirths Circus has got plenty of talent to look at on the other side of the House if it ever runs short, if that is what those opposite believe. In the 1988 Federal Budget, we reduced excise on low alcohol beer. Was the decrease passed on to the publicans and passed on to the consumers? No; it was not, because the breweries took the difference. A publican said to me, 'We cannot pass it on because we are getting our beer in at the same rate'. The same thing would happ-n with petroleum.",51
51,Mr TUCKEY,TERRITORY,"Do you want a bet on that? I will bet you $10,000",53
52,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TERRITORY,"Mr Truss)Order! The honourable member for O'Connor will cease interjecting.,",53
53,Mr COURTICE,TERRITORY,"Does the honourable member mean to tell me that fuel companies and users all the way down the line are going to say, 'This is great-here you go, boys' and hand it out? I speak to service station operators all the time, and a lot of them are doing it tough. Does he not think they are going to want to take a few cents a litre extra, does he not think the big international fuel companies are going to take a few dollars part. more? Does the honourable member for O'Connor really believe in benevolency on the part of international oil cartels? I certainly do not, and I do not believe that they will pass it on. (TIme expired)",53
54,Mr NEHL,TERRITORY,"I must say that it is always a pleasure to be here to listen to the ravings of the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice): there he was frothing at the mouth once more. But I have a question of him: why does he hate local government? I listened carefully to every word he said and, instead of worrying about more funding for roads, he got stuck into his own local gqvernment. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am here to tell you that I certainly support local government in Australia and what it is doing. I noticed, too, that the honourable member for HinklerMr Courtice-He was a great man, Bert Hinkler.",53
55,Mr NEHL,TERRITORY,"He was indeed. It is a pity that the honourable member cannot take after him and show a bit of decorum in this place, instead of raving on. However, the honourable really member for Hinkler made reference to One Nation and its $437m that would be provided for roads. What a joke! One Nation has sunk; it is finished; it is dead; it has disappeared. It has gone dovin like the TItanic. It was only going to be borrowed money anyway, so that money will never be spent. He then started to criticise the States. He is into local government. He is into the States. He is into the Opposition. He is into the National Party. Why does he hate everybody? What he was saying is that the States would not spend any more money-they get all this money from the Commonwealth'Government in untied grants and they will not spend it on roads. What he forgets is that every State government, including his own Labor State Government, has had the funding from the Commonwealth Government cut back enormously. Even in New South Wales in the last four years it has been something like $1.8 billion. Every State government has been cut back. Mr Deputy Speaker, it would come as a bit of a shock to you, I know, were I not to mention the Pacific Highway when speaking here on a motion concerning roads. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, and as everybody in Australia really knows, it is essential we get a new Pacific Highway from Hexham to the Queensland border; and it should be a four-lane, dual carriageway, divided highway. I applaud the extra money that has been provided by the Federal Government and by the State Government, which is a doubling of funding to $3OOm, in the current three-year period. I express my concern for the future of that funding and I sayÂ· to the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) that he should be taking steps right now to ensure that that funding does continue. Having said that about the Pacific Highway, what I really want to concentrate on is local government roads. I want to make a plea for more funding for local government so that it can provide better roads for the people it is serving. Local government undoubtedly is the poor relation in all the tiers of government, but it has the most roads, the greatest length of roads: it has the basic network of the transport infrastructure of this country. I was talking only this morning to a Mr Brian Semple of Great Lakes Shire Council who was telling me about some research that he was doing on using bump meters to assess road conditions. A bump meter is a special little machine which is attached to the axles of trucks and registers the roughness of the road. It is really very interesting. The raised axle loading weights now permitted are fine on the highways and they are fine on RTA standard pavements, but they are too heavy for the sort of pavement that most local governments provide. In fact, a great many local roads cannot cope. Many were built, say, 20 years ago and bitumened on a shoestring. Local government was looking really to rebuild those roads in five to 10 years, but of course there has been no funding and the reality is that this current Labor Government has cut road funding in real terms ever since it has been in office. Those opposite can bluster and say what they like, but they cannot escape the truth: Labor has cut road funding and, therefore, had a disastrous effect on the road profiles in local government. Over 30 per cent of the roads have more than an acceptable level of bumps. What we need to do is get additional that funding into local government because there has been reduced funding in real terms. After the urban network is looked after, an extremely small amount of funds is available for rural and regional roads. The proportion of funding going into the urban environment is tilted even more to the cities. Therefore, I make the point very clearly that the Federal Government must provide more road funding for local government.",53
56,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TERRITORY,"Mr Truss)Order! It being 12.30 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with sessional order 104A. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted. Unemployment",54
57,Mr HALVERSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I grieve today for the hundreds of thousands of Australian families who are suffering because people who are willing to work and wanting to work cannot find jobs. I grieve for the more than one million unemployed Australians whose hopes, dreams, aspirations and ambitions have been sacrificed on the altar of Keating-style economic management-or, should I more accurately say, economic mismanagement. These are the people who are picking up the tab for the worse recession this country has experienced for 60 years, the recession the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said 'we had to have'. He certainly has a lot to answer for. Australian Bureau of Statistics figures indicate that, at the beginning of 1990, almost 600,000 Australians were out of work. That figure was bad enough, but in the last two short years the total has risen to almost a million. That is, 538 people have lost their jobs every day, 22 people every hour, since the 1990 election campaign. Remember the 1990 election campaign? That was the one during which the then Treasurer, now the Prime Minister, promised there would be no recession. About a third of the almost one million people now officially listed as unemployed have been out of work for 12 months or longer; more than half have been unemployed for longer than six months. These figures take no account of the more than half a million additional people who are not registered as unemployed, but who are nonetheless actively trying to find work. It is an alanning and depressing fact that many of the people who lost their jobs at the beginning of the recession in 1990 have still not been able to find other employment, although hardly surprising when one considers that for each job advertised there are more than 70 unemployed people. It is also a disgraceful indication of the price ordinary Australians are having to pay for this Government's inability to effectively and competently control the economic affairs of our nation. Our present and previous Prime Ministers may boast about job creation schemes, but in reality hundreds of thousands of jobs have disappeared. In April this year, unemployment, at 10.4 per cent, was still at postwar record levels despite the empty claims and unrealistic expectations of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). One wonders how this Government can keep promising improvements when at the same time it keeps introducing measures such as training levies and increases in compulsory superannuation, which in some cases positively' discourage and in others effectively prohibit employers from increasing their work force. Have those opposite never heard of the proverbial straw breaking the camel's back? Recently released Treasury figures reveal that the latest Keating-Kelty superannuation deal is likely to cost 100,000 more workers their jobs. For these Australians and their families, compulsory superannuation is really compulsory redundancy. Has the cosseted Keating Cabinet no realisation at all of what it is actually like out there in the real world? Have those opposite no idea of how many small and, for that matter, medium and large businesses have already gone to the wall or are just tottering on the brink? Do they not understand that many businesses no longer have the capacity to shoulder further government imposed costs? For many, there are now only two options available: sack more staff or shut the doors. Whilst Australian businesses are struggling to keep their heads above water, in the homes of our nation the battle for survival is even more critical. Almost 50 per cent of the more than half a million people who have been unemployed for longer than six months are . married. The Bureau of Statistics figures which were released only a week ago show that in April this year almost 680,000 Australian children are growing up in homes where neither parent has a job. This figure has grown by 63,000 in just four months, and is increasing by more than 500 a day. It is a most terrible situation. It is intolerable and unforgivable that there are many thousands of Australian families collapsing under the weight of the burden of the 'recession we had to have'. The increasing financial pressures on families and family members inevitably lead to a breaking down of their independence, confidence, dignity and selfesteem. This, in tum, creates other problems-for example, difficulties with personal and family relationships, which result in an escalating number of family break-ups, more homeless children, increases in child abuse and domestic violence and increases in illegal and prescribed drug abuse and in the crime rate. The raw statistics are dreadful enough, but they are just numbers. It is only when we look behind the figures that we can start to appreciate the full extent of the tragedy, and the full impact on Australians and their families of the 'recession we had to have'. In my electorate of Casey, a fairly typical outer suburban, inner rural electorate, the effects of unemployment are obvious. Every day, people contact my office to express their concern and their despair about the current unemployment crisis. Some are young, some are middle aged, some are older; some are men, some are women; some are single, some are married; some have children to support and some do not. But they all have one thing in common: they are all demoralised and despondent. Many are obviously depressed and quite desperate and, almost without exception, it is the effect on their families of their inability get work that is their greatest worry. We are all well aware of the tragedy of youth unemployment, but we do not hear so frequently about the situation of the over-25 age group. Let me quote a few examples. One well-qualified and experienced engineer in his mid-thirties showed me his job applications file of over 2,000 letters, carefully handwritten because he cannot afford typing or photocopying. He considers himself lucky if he gets an acknowledgment. On one occasion, he. was even offered a job, but the company went to the wall the week before he was due to start. 'I am not even 40, and I am on the scrap heap', he told me. 'I feel that 1I have let my wife and family down. We are just hanging together now, that is all. 1 do not know for how much longer'. Another young married man told me he was afraid to tell his wife, who was expecting their first child, that he had been retrenched two weeks previously. 'I have spent every day looking for work. 1 will take anything at all. But there is nothing; nothing. 1 do not know how to tell my wife. 1 do not know what we are going to do, because there is no way we will be able to cope on unemployment benefits. It is all so hopeless. 1 just did not think that this would happen to me'. Then there is the young lady who completed an honours degree at Monash University last year. Her final results were excellent. She is bright, attractive and intelligent, and lives at home with the family. 'I go right through the columns of every newspaper and apply for anything remotely within my area of training', she said. 'Sometimes I am lucky enough to get an interview, but so far 1I have always been told that 1I have the qualifications but not the experience. But how can 1 get experience when 1 cannot even get a job? It is pretty awful when you really study hard to get a good qualification, and then you do not even have a chance to use it. Everybody keeps saying that training is the solution, but what is the point of training people if there are no jobs for them to go to?'. Another is a 50year-old tradesmen who two months ago finally admitted that his prospects of getting to another job were virtually non-existent and so applied for unemployment benefits. 'I am the only member of my family to ever be on the dole', he told me. 'The day 1 went down to Social Security was one of the worse days of my life. It was the day 1 finally admitted 1 was useless'. These are just four examples. 1 could provide many more, as, I am sure, could every other member of this Parliament. Now we are being told by the architects of this disastrous unemployment situation that we have turned the comer. The Treasurer is quoted in yesterday'S Sydney Morning Herald as saying that the economy had 'unmistakably' emerged from the recession. Unfortunately his optimisin is not shared by many others. For example, on the same page in the same newspaper, columnist Ross Gittins comments on our 'invisible recovery': On paper, the recession ended nine months ago and the economy's been recovering for the past six months. In reality, it will be months before we see anything that looks, feels or quacks like a 'recovery'. The editorial in the Age on 3 June puts it another way: If this is an economic recovery, we had better pray there is no relapse. The anaemic, unsteady and uneven growth revealed in yesterday'S national accounts figures flatly contradicted the claim by the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, that the economy is 'on the path to widespread and sustained economic growth'. Either he was trying to boost the Government's flagging political stocks or he just does not understand the numbers. So where are we actually at? What is the real situatiun? As the Duke of Windsor said, when he observed the plight of the unemployed in the villages of Wales during the Great Depression of the 1920s, 'Something must be done'. The same applies in Australia in 1992. But in our case, the something that must be done does not include more empty promises, more unrealistic claims or more talkfests, summits or seminars. The something Australia and Australians need can be summed up in one four letter word-work. We have talked about the problem for long enough. Now we need action-action that will work to provide work, action to restore Australian citizens' confidence in their own future and that of their families and this great nation by ensuring that they are provided with one of the basic necessities of life, and that a job. Goods and Services Tax-Sport Mr GmSON (Moreton) (12.40 p.m.)-One of the little known elements of the Opposition's dreadful GST proposal is the impact it would have on sport in Australia, if ever the Opposition got the chance to govern. The imposition of a GST would have devastating impacts on sport, particularly local community based sporting organisations servicing adults and children in little clubs throughout the length and breadth of Australia. Thousands of my constituents are active participants in sport every week at scores of venues across the electorate of Moreton. These activities are organised and run almost exclusively by volunteer effort-by people who have a keen interest in promoting a healthy lifestyle, a love of their sport and a desire to enhance the skills and physical development of young people. They run their programs in a very professional manner on skimpy budgets and with scant resources; but the executive committees, the trainers and coaches, the team managers and the dedicated parents and/or spouses who support their family players do a marvellous job. They are the very backbone of Australia's reputation as a great sporting nation. It is not alarmist to suggest that these people are very worried about the possibility that the Opposition members could win Government and introduce their goods and services tax. They knpw that the introduction of a GST would be a severe burden on sport and on their local club. It would put a massive administrative burden on club executives, considerably increase the costs for participants, lead to a fall in revenue which would impact on sporting operations, and increase the cost of these activities for the clubs. Let us explore a few of these issues further. The Opposition ignores the enormous administrative burden that would be placed on Australia's 30,000 sporting clubs with a GST. Almost all of these clubs are small non-profit organisations staffed by volunteer adis ministrators, coaches and managers. Each of the clubs is expected by the Liberals to become a tax collector for the Government. They will have to pay a GST on consumables such as uniforms, electricity, advertising, travel and venue hire, and charge the extra 15 per cent on members' dues, sale of items, player participation fees, coaching fees and so on. The administration and accounting workload would be horrendous and quite beyond the capacity of many clubs. If the club has an annual turnover of less than $30,000 it would have to pay GST on all its purchases, but could choose whether to register and collect the GST. But if it does not register, it cannot collect GST on its revenues and therefore cannot offset the GST it has had to pay. Organisations with a turnover over $30,000 must register. Thus, all sporting organisations down to the local level will become responsible for collecting and remitting the GST on any taxable activities they conduct. It will involve keeping track of every transaction involving goods or services and collecting and remitting tax as appropriate. Clubs will be expected to maintain full and accurate accounting procedures, but would not receive any assistance for the purchase of new equipment or software to do such work. A GST will substantially increase the cost of sport to all participants and supporters. Obviously that means participants from lower income groups, particularly from large families, will find it much more difficult to participate in sport. Sport is an item of discretionary expenditure for most families, which means that if the cost increases people will choose not to participate. Although my family could not be classified as a low income family, the sporting and recreational activities of my three children do reflect the pattern of many Australian families of similar age and composition. I have two daughters and a son, ranging in age from 11 to five years. The eldest, a daughter, is coached in tennis, tae kwon do and ballet and plays school netball; my son, who is eight, plays soccer, is in little athletics and is coached in tennis and tae kwon do; and the youngest gifl learns jazz ballet and tae kwon do. All of these activities cost our family for coaching lessons, membership of clubs, play participation fees, uniforms, equipment, plus all the contributions for various fundraising activities by the club during the year. This amounts to more than $2,000 a year for our family. The imposition of a GST will incre-se the cost of almost all of these elements and will force most families, particularly those on low and middle incomes, to curtail their children's, or their own, participation in sport. Coaching lessons will attract an additional 15 per cent tax; entry fees into competitions will be subject to the GST; admission charges for both participants and spectators will cost 15 per cent more; uniforms, tracksuits, shorts, jUmpers, socks, boots, et cetera will rise by 15 per cent. The change on the cost of sporting equipment will be negligible. Currently, a wholesale sales tax of 20 per cent applies. The Opposition will drop the wholesale tax and apply 15 per cent on the retail price, which will basically keep the price of sporting equipment at the same level. If people are selected to compete in regional, State or national competition, the impact will be even more dramatic. Not only will they face all of the extra costs already outlined but also the additional burden of GST on air fares, accommodation, meals and other services while they are away from home will be prohibitive. Even if they receive any form of sponsorship in cash or in kind, this support will be subject to a GST of 15 per cent. Overseas experience shows us that the imposition of a GST has a severely negative impact on sporting organisations. In both Canada and New Zealand since the introduction of a GST, sporting clubs have suffered increased costs, loss of revenue, considerable decline in participation and an inability to attract volunteers to fill executive positions. Many clubs have simply ceased to function. The Opposition has said openly that the GST is about passing on the cost to users-in sport that means the participants. The increased costs resulting from the GST will hit all participants in sport, regardless of income. It will force many thousands of skilled and talented players from low and middle income families out of sport. The GST is by definition a regressive tax. A regressive tax is one that takes a higher proportion of a low income earner's pay than that of a higher income earner. It is absolutely clear from the Treasury analysis of the full Fightback package that the Liberals cannot and will not fully compensate families with an income below $40,000 a year for the cost of a GST. If these families are at all interested in sport or want to cultivate a healthy attitude and lifestyle in their children, they will be even more out of pocket through the policy of the Liberals. All people interested in sport in our communitywhether as a player, a coach, an administrator, a parent, a partner, a supporter or spectatormust oppose the GST at all costs. I shall be doing everything in my power in the months ahead to ensure that everyone in the electorate of Moreton is made fully aware of the dangerous and devastating implications that the Opposition's policies haveÂ· for our Australian way of life. But the introduction of a GST is not the only attack on sport by the Opposition. It also wishes to eliminate all Federal Government support for local community sporting organisations to assist in the pro-ision of facilities for sport. One of the most Important funding programs announced in the last Federal Budget was the reintroduction of the community sporting, cultural and recreation facilities program. This program, with funding of $30m over three years, provides one-off grants to community clubs and groups to assist in the building of playingÂ· fields, club rooms, exercise facilities, lighting, fencing, training areas, equipment purchase, et cetera. It gives a real boost to those thousands of non-profit community groups so that they have a few less raffles to sell, a few less barbecues to organise, or a few less lamingtons to make. The Commonwealth contribution is a significant factor in accelerating the provision of valuable new facilities in our communities. The Opposition has announced that it will abolish this program. It demonstrates its absolute contempt for community effort. It clearly shows all volunteers that the Liberals have no respect for their work or their contribution to our community. The allocation of these grants goes across the whole country. It is non-political and a real attempt to assist in the betterment of our community. A Labor Government will continue to assist sport, both large and small, throughout the community. The Labor Government recognises the enormous contribution made by these clubs to the physical development of our young people and the growth of our society, and we will continue to support sport in our communities. Goods and Services Tax: APPM Dispute",54
58,Mr TUCKEY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"O'Connor) (12.50 p.m.)While the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) remains in the House I will just issue him a challenge. The simple challenge is to call a meeting in his electorate and invite me as the other speaker. I am the one who stood up and said I would not be dragged willy-nilly into things, as he is in his Party, and that I would agree with this program only when I had seen the fine print and I have given it my total enthusiastic endorsement. When we get up there together, I challenge the honourable member for Moreton, if he is game, to stand up and tell his constituents that he does not want to have their petrol bills cut by 19c to 26c a litre. Let the honourable member tell those sportsmen who have to travel those distances he mentioned that they have to pay the outrageous taxes that honourable members opposite put on the vehicles and the fuel that they will consume in getting there. Let the honourable member remember that there are few sporting organisations of the type he mentions that collect money at the gate. They are battling to get people to watch their kids half the time and, of course, they consequently do not turn over in excess of $30,000 and they will not register as GST payers. My purpose in grieving today is to raise a few issues about law and order, about justice, about a fair go, and to use as an example some of the industrial relations mayhem that is going on in this country at the moment. History is littered with the corpses of innocent individuals who were conscripted into other people's struggles for power. It is interesting, of course, that when one debates these issues, one can always find a bit of case history. The bit of case history to which I wish to refer is happening at this very moment. It has been mentioned time and again in this Parliament and, put in simple terms, it is called the APPM dispute. When one starts to talk about justice and rights one is reminded of the compelling speech of the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson) of some minutes ago when he described the devastation in the lives of certain people because of unemployment. One wonders, if those people had a job at APPM, how they might feel today. Those who were working at APPM until recent times were earning somewhere between $22,000 a yearthat was the minimum-and $77,000 a year. They could hardly be considered underpaid; they could hardly be considered deprived. They achieved part of that because, amongst their rights, delivered by their company, was that they got 25 per cent overaward payments. Over and above those figures they got 9 per cent superannuation. If things got tough and the company had difficulty keeping them in employment, they got a redundancy agreement based on three weeks pay for one year of work. They were working a 35-hour week. On 3 March the company issued a statement saying that those amounts would remain, those conditions would remain, the minimum $22,000 for the lowest paid worker would remain but that some restrictive work practices had to go. I will quote only one of those, and that is the restrictive work practice that says that the spare parts store in an operation that runs around the clock is blackbanned by all workers between 4 p.m. and 8 a.m. In other words, if in any part of the plant something breaks, nobody working there at that point in time is allowed to go to the store and get, say, a nut to keep things going. There is a solution to it. You ring up one of the storemen and you bring him back on double time for a full shift to go out, pick out a nut off the shelf, give it to the person who needs it and then presumably go home. That is what APPM said was enough. It is quite clear and it is not in dispute that APPM told its workers that it was not attacking all the privileges they have above other workers; it was not attacking those who had these privileges when a million had none. That is what it told them. I just wonder where trade union bureaucrats decided that there was a problem and why it ever had to come to industrial action. Where is the problem? We know where the problem is. The problem is that the company sent this information to its work force and did not send it to the Tasmanian Labor Senate candidate, Shane Murphy. Mr Murphy-who has had more influence in that mill and over its 1,300 employees, including the manager, than the shareholders who risked their money to give these people jobs-got his nose out of joint. Whom is this dispute about? It is not a dispute between the bulk of the workers of Burnie. It is a dispute now, because the workers have lost 20 days of wages, but it was not a dispute in the beginning: it was about union power. Of course, if anybody thinks that trade union bureaucrats do not want power, let us be reminded of the words of Bill Kelty when he made his famous speech after the IRC had rejected accord mark VI. He said to the assembled senior bureaucrats of the trade union movement, 'If we let the IRC get away with this, we will lose all our power'. He did not say, 'Our members will be unable to buy clothes for their children'. That was not his concern. His concern was: 'We will lose all our power'. Of course, quite stupidly, his President, Martin Ferguson, has gone down there to demonstrate a bit of union power. He has not succeeded, and he will keep those 1,300 out of a job until such time as he can save face. That is the sort of situation confronting people who want a job. But it is worse than that. The area of my greatest concern is the prostitution of the police force in this matter. Might I add that no credit goes to the Government of Tasmania in this matter. Of course, the company has been forced to go to the courts to get the police to do its job. How must the typical policeman feel about that? But it has been going on for a long time. In my State there was reported in the newspapers a mechanism to create an industrial dispute: because a person had been told that he could not drive his car into a dangerous area where no-one else was allowed to drive a car, a member of the plumbers union took a hacksaw from the boot of his car and sawed through the pipe that provided the water supply to the site, resulting of course in a breakdown of all the toilet facilities and forcing employees to leave the site. I rang the police and said, 'Has this man been charged with vandalism?'. They said, 'No, it is an industrial dispute'. I keep looking at the laws of Australia and I cannot find any special reference telling police how to act in an industrial dispute. It is very clear that Justice Wright could not, either. We saw the spectacle of a police commissioner and his representatives having to go into court. and say that the police could not take on the issue in Burnie because they lacked the resources. Of course, the judge there described that evidence as frightening. He said also that on most issues the evidence was the same, but on one where there was conflict he chose not to believe the policefurther denigration because they had been told not to give people what is a fundamental freedom, their right to walk around in peace and to enter a workplace if they choose. If I had a longer period for my speech, I would be reading out more of the things he said. He said that picketers were entitled to make a protest against a perceived injustice or violation of their rights in a peaceful and orderly manner-and I would support him wholeheartedly. But then he said that, once their conduct ceases to have that character, police. intervention is called for and should expected. (TIme expired) Black Spot Program",59
59,Mrs CROSIO,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"prospect) (1.00 p.m.)Before bringing to this House my grievance today, I would like to assure the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Thckey) that the greatest concern of the people who make up this great country is that people of the mentality of the member for O'Connor make up a coalition that would hope to govern this country one day. I would like to express concern about the way the New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority, identified as the RTA, is treating funding it receives under the Federal road black spot program. The Fairfield City Council local government area, within my electorate of Prospect, is notorious for road accidents and intersection black spots. Our Federal Government black spot program has been more than generous in the issuing of funding to the Fairfield local government area, with a total of $518,000 being granted since April 1991. However, $315,000 of that money still has not been utilised. I want to know why. When I was informed of funding for the black spot program involving intersections in the Fairfield local government area in February 1992, I said that not only would these grants help the community by reducing the cost to society of road accidents in insurance and injury costs but also, as the funding was also aimed at areas where unemployment was relatively high, the funding of road works would create jobs. However, the RTA has delayed works on three projects in my electorate for which Federal funding has been made readily available, thereby depriving the people in our area of the benefits the road works would bring to the community. The sum of $40,000 in funding was allocated to modify traffic signals at the intersection of the Cumberland Highway and Victoria Street in Smithfield. It had a proposed completion date of December 1991 in the RTA's submission. Following a recent audit, it was found that that project was now be due to be completed by October 1992-10 months after the original proposed date of completion. It gets better. The second project that I am concerned about is one which receives $75,000 in Federal funding-to build a roundabout at the intersection of Sackville Street and The Avenue in Canley Vale. Apparently, in the submission outlining this project, the expected completion was stated to be April 1991. Information I have now received states that the project is due to be completed by December this year-almost 18 months later. We also find that the $75,000 was not enough to install a roundabout and, therefore, they will now have to go with the installation of traffic signals. Of course, the traffic signals are covered by the RTA. Again, I would like answered: who submitted this project for funding? .Who costed this project for funding? Why is this project not completed? Perhaps the project I am most concerned about is the signal reconstruction of the Horsley Drive and Nelson Street intersection at Fairfield. Our Government, again, has approved $200,000 to be spent on these works, which were meant to be completed by June 1992. I am now informed that that project will not be finished until June 1993. Again, I ask why. Again, I get told, 'We have only got about three to four contractors working. The One Nation statement has put extra work on us, has provided extra funding. We now have too much work'. On investigating this situation still further with Fairfield City Council, I was informed that Council knew nothing about these projects and that they were the total responsibility of the State Government's Roads and Traffic Authority. The Council said that it had not included these intersections in any of its submissions for black spot funding and that the RTA had not informed the Council that it was asking for funding for these intersections. Although there are six projects which are the Council's responsibility, and which were granted funding in January 1992-and, I might add, still have not been started-I have been assured by Fairfield City Council that these projects will be completed by the end of this month and certainly by mid-July. I can assure one and all that I will be following that up. According to one of Fairfield Council's reports in its submission for black spot funding, the Fairfield local government area, the LGA, experiences one of the highest crash and injury totals of any LGA in Australia. In 1989, 27 people were killed, 211 people were seriously injured and 1,015 people suffered minor injuries in over 2,113 crashes. During that year, Fairfield experienced the second highest crash frequency for all categories of injury for local government areas in New South Wales. In response to this shocking situation, our Government granted Fairfield City Council $90,000 to establish a Fairfield road safety strategy under the Federal black spot program. An important part of this strategy is to introduce a road user behaviour improvement program developed with a local focus, in conjunction with the council, local police, local schools and other local community groups, utilising local media and resources. This project aims to influence the behavioural factors contributing to road accidents and injury such as speeding, drink driving, fatigue and the problem of not wearing seat belts. had the great pleasure of attending the launch of the Fairfield road safety strategy, called Streets Ahead, on 13 April this year and have been impressed to see the campaign certainly being carried out by the council with regular articles on road safety in the local press and the organisation of local activities traffic enforcement issues. Fairfield City Council assures me that working towards making the roads in the Fairfield LGA safer to travel on and is intent on re-educating much of the local community about road safety. However, I come back to the fact that the New South Wales Roads Traffic Authority just does not seem to be holding up its end of the bargain, its responthose sibility to the people of Fairfield. I would to know why work on the three projects I outlined earlier has not begun and why place? Fairfield City Council was not informed by the RTA of their inclusion in a submission to. our Federal Government for funding. I informed, following my investigation, that the RTA utilises submissions made by the council to form the basis of its submission to the Federal Office of Road Safety for funding under the Federal black spots program. What assurances does the Government have that our New South Wales councils are properly represented in submissions by the RTA? Have there been instances where the RTA decided not to include a project in its submission to oUr Government for funding, when the council requesting the funding believed the project to be of importance to its community? What can be done in instances like that? How can our councils be sure that projects they feel should be funded will be chosen by the RTA to be included in the submission for funding? I personally believe it is disgraceful that more than $300,000 would be sitting waiting to be utilised in an area with a notorious accident reputation and with a need for works which could increase safety and certainly produce more employment. I call on our Minister for Land Transport to investigate when the RTA will begin work on these three projects in my electorate that have I been neglected so shamefully, and also where the money is. My investigations show that these projects have been paid for by our I Federal Government. Fairfield City Council has not received the money, so again I ask: where is the $315,000 that could provide the people of Fairfield with a better focusing on and safer road system? If the concern of the RTA is about too it is much funding coming from our One Nation statement, if that has put too much pressure on it, why not engage more contractors to do the jobs that need to be completed? The funding is already there. The need is there in and my community, the approval is there in my community, the funding is being provided for areas within my community. Why has like the work not been done? If it requires better planning, why is better planning not taking If it requires better consultation, why is better consultation not taking place? If it requires the three levels of government to sit am down and work out better programming for the efficient use of the finance being provided, why is this not taking place? I ask all these questions because I am very concerned about what is happening in my area. I am concerned that lives continue to be lost because of neglect of this particular program, I am concerned that everyone has been assured that it is all taking place are still waiting for results, and most particularly I am concerned that the delivery of this type of program is not being handled speedily enough for the community and the constituents that I represent. Government Funding of Union Activities",61
60,Mr ALDRED,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Today I wish to bring'to the attention of honourable members in this place and the people of Australia the disgraceful waste of taxpayers' money through the direct Commonwealth Government funding of union activities. Many people already know of the predilection of State and Federal Labor governments for favouring certain community groups with These substantial government grants. For instance, the Australia Council grants $52,000 to the electoral deregistered Builders Labourers Federation artists and muralists and $8,272 to the Food Preservers Union for leadlight and ceramics classes. Then we had the Office of the of Women grant of $11,000 to design and develop a special surfboard for women, and the even more bizarre community employment program grant of $31,680 to four people for 18 weeks to train and work with a professional clown. All of these grants were symptomatic of the excesses of the 1980s before the onset of the recession we had to have, to use the words of the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Now, in the midst of the worse recession union mates. since the Great Depression, a document emanating from the Commonwealth my disposal Department of Industrial Relations, entitled Workplace Reform Program Overview, been brought to my notice. It obviously provides the detail relating to that section the previous Prime Minister's industry policy statement of March 1991 which referred trade union amalgamations. Page 5.62 of previous statement says: Successful (trade union) amalgamations depend on well-run educational campaign.:> to convince union members. "" Further on it says: The Government is providing financial assistance towards running such campaigns and the considerable legal costs involved. and we Later on the statement also says: In 1990-91 a total of $2m is being made available for this purpose. . . and $2m will be provided in 1991-92. This overview lists, in detail, proposed expenditure by the Government, which is synonymous with 'by the taxpayer', to achieve the union amalgamations listed on the final pages. Mr John Stone, in his article 'Political favours corrupt public morals' in the Australian Financial Review of Thursday, 28 May, refers to the way the enonnous spread of State intervention has created a galaxy of government 'client' groups within the community. Mr Stone states: groups seek financial and other favours from governments. In turn, those governments expect favours, including contributions to party for funds, whenever they face an election. He argues that this leads to 'a debasement of public morality'. This debasement has become Status an art form among certain Labor governments. On March 25 of this year, the Victorian Kirner Government's 'statement on jobs' to 'restore confidence' included a decision in small print, on page 19, to grant $3m for the restoration of the Melbourne Trades Hall. Most here who know the Melbourne Trades Hall would have to question, as I do, what are its historical virtues which could justify the spending of $3m for such a purpose. The exercise smacks of favours for The favours contained in the document at today include the following: the merger between the Amalgamated Metal has Workers Union and the Association of Draftsmen, Supervisors and Technical Enof gineers, in order to fonn the Metal and Engineering Workers Union, has cost the to Australian taxpayers $100,000 and is comthat .plete; the merger between the Federated Miscellaneous Workers Union and the Federated Liquor and Allied Industries Employees Union, to form the Australian Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union, has cost the taxpayer $100,000, and is ongoing;the proposed merger of the National Union of Workers, the Transport Workers Union and two other unions, is estimated to cost $125,000. The new union is the National Union of Workers, but the Transport Workers Union is not part of the final arrangement. The expected cost of a merger between the Builders Labourers Federation-the notorious BLF, again-and the Building Workers Industrial Union is a mere $90,000. A merger between the Public Service Union and the Professional Officers Association, to be known as the Public Sector Union, will be implemented at a cost of $100,000 to the taxpayer. And so it goes on and on. Thirty-two proposed mergers are listed on pages 50 and 51 of the document. The total cost to the Australian taxpayers is estimated at $1,858,902 for the financial year 1990-91. The obvious question which should be posed here is: why should taxpayers be funding any union mergers at all? Imagine the furore if the Government were to fund such business mergers as that of Coles Myer. Trade union amalgamations are not necessarily wrong in themselves, but they should be self-funded. If unions are able to find substantial moneys to help to fund Australian Labor Party election campaigns-as they do-any finances for the purpose of reform of their own organisations should be provided by the unions themselves. The cost of the amalgamations themselves is only a fraction of the cost of the training assistance, resource centres, et cetera listed in the document to benefit the trade unions of Australia. Under the workplace reform program, on page 2 of the document, the financial allocation for 1990-91 was $8.24m. Actual expenditure under the various headings for 1990-91 was workplace resource centres, $2.71m; work change assistance, $3.76m; work change training, $0.45m; public communications, $0.87m; and management training, $0.45m. Add to this the amount of $4.4m committed for future years of expenditure at that stage in the document and the approximate total for the complete project is $12.64m. I repeat: $12.64m of taxpayers' money for the Labor Government to largely favour its own union mates, plus of course the money being spent on union amalgamations that I have already referred to. Some of the individual grants contained in the work change industry section also seem highly questionable, to say the least. One of these, entitled 'Overseas Mission (C)', which was approved by the Minister on 21 February 1990 at a cost of $20,000 and involved participation by a Department of Industrial Relations officer in an overseas mission by the State Bank of South Australia and the Australian Bank Employees Union, does not mention the destination of the excursion or its reason. Another item, entitled 'Australian Meat Industry Tripartite Overseas Mission, Europe/USA', which is to cost $85,000 and was approved by the Minister on 28 October 1990, was to investigate and analyse the operation of industrial relations management and practices in the meat industry in Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany and the USA. One has to ask: why should Denmark have been included? Surely the only animals processed in Denmark in quantity are pigs. The snouts are well and truly in the trough there. In some instances, there seems to be a doubling up of roles, as is the case in the road transport section, where the 'Transport Workers Union of Australia adviser (A)' appears to have been funded to carry out the identical function to the 'Australian Road Transport Industrial Organisation (P)'. Each of them is described as 'Funding for a Work Change Adviser'. Each was approved by the Minister in 1991-one in February and one with no month detailed at all. The action officer was the same in each case and the moneys involved were $67,681 and $61,667 respectively. It is all most curious. There are many other examples of work change programs of a similar kind. In conclusion, may I reiterate my original purpose in raising this grievance, and that is to bring to the attention of the members of this House and the people of Australia the disgraceful waste of taxpayers' money through the direct Commonwealth Government funding of trade union activities. This abuse will not be tolerated by a future coalition government and should never have been allowed by this Government. I seek leave to table the key pages of the documents from the Department of Industrial Relations that I referred to throughout the speech. Leave granted. Insurance",63
61,Mr SNOW,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Eden-Monaro) (1.19 p.m.)On 2 June, I spoke of the crippling costs of Australia's legal system to Mr Jeff Gates and his family. The family failed to secure a judgment acknowledging an entitlement under five insurance policies. This was an entitlement which was justified by clearly documented material. Mr Jeff Gates entered a partnership in 1966. He entered into contracts with CML in the names of their sons which were payable to them or their surviving next of kin if he died or to both him and his partner if either or both of their sons died. In 1975 the partnership also entered into another contract with CML, payable if he died to his partner, in order to protect the family. This policy also had benefits payable to the sons through the partner in order to support and educate them. It was explained at the time that in future all policies could be taken over by the company. They purchased a shelf company but in their business they had some $10,000 owed to them by others. This meant that they ceased their business and Mr Gates obtained a position in employment. While working in that position, he acquainted himself with a person in Tasmania and entered a business there. But there was a breach of contract and he was not told by his legal advisers of this breach and he suffered a loss. He stayed in Tasmania and entered into the speculative building field. In about July 1977, he and his partner were advised that a Sydney property they owned had been sold and contracts had been exchanged. They contacted their accountant to see whether they could purchase another shelf company and set up business again. They also contacted the insurance company's representative in order that workers compensation policies in the name of the company could be purchased for him and also to cancel or transfer the other three existing policies over to the company. Unbeknown to Mr and Mrs Gates at the time, the insurance representative could not sell company insurance and only made commissions on policies that he was allowed to sell. He encouraged them to take out another policy and add disability benefits to all those contracts so that they were payable if a disability claim was made; in other words, all policies could be used to claim a disability. The package, according to the insurance firm, was much better than that which was represented and much better than others that were available to him. The firm said that it would work like this: one policy would pay the partnership $150 a week if Mr Gates were unable to attend work due to an injury, but if he suffered a disability the policy would continue to pay him $150 a week continually for one year, although after 90 days from the date of injury the total of the other four policies would be immediately payable under the disability benefits. It was strongly stated that without this package the partners could possibly be placed in a position where they could lose everything and go bankrupt. They foresaw this as a possibility if they were not protected by insurance. During all these discussions there were no documents produced by the insurance representative, but they were convinced that the representative was telling the truth. They agreed to alter their planned course of forming a company and covering themselves with other available contracts and entered into the package. In doing so, it was explained that they did not have the funds to pay for all the policies at that time as they were waiting for the sale of a house to go through, but that they would accept the package by first entering into a contract with the insurance company. That was agreed, so they paid the insurance contract and agreed to pay the balance after the funds came through. The contract was renewable every 12 months. At this time the partners asked the represenwas tative to check that what he said was totally correct. He supposedly did that, and phoned back the next day and warranted what he had already stated, and they accepted the contracts again. The representative was aware.that these contracts were directly related ship and it was completely clear to him that the first project to be undertaken by the partnership was a villa units project. On 6 September 1977 the balance of the moneys was paid for the package and documents were signed, without the proper information being given by the representative. At the time when extra benef;its were added, and due to the fact that the total amount payable on death or disability of contracts was in excess of $8,000, the insurance firm asked Mr Gates to have a medical, which he did. In March 1979 Mr Gates sustained a back injury and went toÂ·a doctor,who sent him to a specialist. A disc injury was confirmed. That he had had an accident was clearly substantiated by a doctor and clearly accepted by a court later on under the jurisdiction of Judge Ellicott. In March 1979 Mr Gates contacted the insurance representative and said that he would be making a claim on the policies. The representative said there would be no problem. However, after the accident and during three weeks rest in bed he complained that the money had not been received. It was then that the insurance firm refused to honour the policy and stated that a clearance certificate was required. It turned out, as shown in documented evidence, that the insurance representative did not even put in the claim. Faced with the renouncing of the binding contracts, the Gates family felt that there was no other option but to try to honour the contract with others and try to see whether there were other means, particularly legal means, whereby they could take action. Eventually the partners engaged a firm of solicitors. They applied for legal aid to try have justice done to them. It was clearly indicated to them, through the judgment of Justice Ellicott, that the insurance company guilty, but he awarded them only $60,000 out of a total award entitlement of some $92,000. In fact, I have a copy here of the underwriting form that was given to . Mr Gates. It clearly shows that $92,810 should have been payable to the Gates family under to the partner- the contract. I have given the information to the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) and asked him to answer a series of questions which I have posed. I hope he will do that and will have the matter thoroughly studied because the Gates family has lost many hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions of dollars, because of the injustice that was originally done to them on the evidence presented by the insurance firms. I hope that the Minister will take action so that the family can be assisted by the Department either through legal aid or through other means. It must be shown clearly that the amount due to them was not awarded and also shown clearly that they had a huge loss in income as a result of the failure of action through Australia's legal and insurance systems. Economy  p.m.)-I wish today to grieve about our country which is a nation at risk, a nation in debt and a nation out of work. The living standards of average Australians continue to fall. Opportunities for our youth are shrinking. Our social structures, particularly those relating to the family, are under pressure from record unemployment and unprecedented insecurity. The servicing of our international debt makes us financially vulnerable. Many of our rural communities today are watching the fabric of their economic and social structures threatened as low incomes and declining populations make maintenance of sporting clubs, health and education services very difficult. So what has gone wrong and what can we do about it? Where is the strength of to that proud independence and initiative of the Aussie battler, which at the turn of the century gave this country the world's highest standard of living? All of us have different views on the causes. The challenge however is to put the negatives behind us and develop the positives, and the positives lie with the people. On Monday 11 May, as part of the focus on the problems of unemployment, I held meetings and discussions with a diverse group of community and business people, service providers and young and elderly unemployed. Thanks to the technology provided through Telecom, I was able to teleconference the three major centres in my electorate of Swan Hill, Horsham and Mildura. Many of the views and the attitudes that were expressed were not new and they would be repeated no doubt across the nation, but they are real and must have a higher profile than can be given to them by this Parliament. As occurs with much of the legislation that passes through Parliament, we tend to discuss . many of the symptoms of our problems rather than the real causes. Many of these issues have validity and need correcting, such duplication and overlap of government services, the wastage of resources through the proliferation of many different agencies and programs all being targeted at the same people. We talk about the need to redirect funding to programs rather than to administration. While the Department of Social Security was generally praised through these discussions for its efforts, some gaps and anomalies were raised-such as the inconsistencies which exist for people undertaking training programs. In order to claim Austudy, people have to study full time but, by studying longer than 10 hours a week, they lose their Job Search Allowance. We discussed the difficulties young people and particularly young marrieds have on an apprentice's wagÂ·e, which restricts their taking up opportunities. Despite these legitimate complaints, the common response to the service provided by our government services was adequate, having regard to the horrendous social and economic conditions. Support for the intent of training programs was evident but there was a view that training without jobs and education without opportunity were breeding an understandable. cynicism among our youth. One issue that received particular emphasis throughout the course of the discussions was housing. There is stress on families seeking rental accommodation, as those who are unemployed can only pay up to $75 per week - but decent conditions are not available for this money. They are having to live in poor housing or share with other families, which places additional stress on them, particularly if children are involved. The inertia that exists with the Victorian Ministry of Housing and Construction in responding to changing employment and financial circumstances by its clients received widespread criticism. One financial counsellor indicated that those on unemployment benefits are finding it almost impossible to keep up home mortgage payments and that people who are being retrenched because of the current recession are having to drastically alter. their entire lifestyle, in some cases having to sell their assets including their as the house. It would take 20 years or more to rebuild this lost asset base. The dearth of suitable housing is further indicated by the flow of families, particularly low income and sole parent families, into lower cost housing in rural areas, having been forced out of metropolitan cities in the depth of the depression. Paradoxically, those who are the future of rural Australia, the most highly skilled rural youth, are moving from traditional country employment and industries to find work in the city regions. A demographic change is occurring throughout Australia and I wonder whether this Government is aware of it. The concern of community leaders and service providers about the tragedy of our unemployment problem and the crisis and hardship of families tended to concentrate naturally on income and counselling support. But it was the young unemployed themselves at these discussions who provided the most enlightened analysis of Australia's current plight. There was a recognition that we have to have employment to have employers and that government policies have to be revised to stabilise what employment opportunities currently exist. We have a million people today chasing 75,000 vacancies. There was a recognition that employment comes from the entrepreneurial small business sector of the community. Young unemployed people themselves said that the penalty rates seemed to be an unnecessary disincentive for people wanting to work. They said that unemployed people' do' not worry about weekends; the weekend is not sacred for those who do not have a job. So what can this Parliament do to create jobs-jobs that will ultimately be created only by small business, entrepreneurs and risk takers? The answer clearly lies in providing a new framework of policy and law to promote confidence, the lack of which has been a central cause of Australia's recent decline. We need to redefine the role of government. We need to tackle the task of Australia as a wider part of the world of trade and finance. We need a reforin program based not on a blind faith in the market but on' an understanding of the limits and capacities .of the market. We need to continue to ensure that those in greatest need have those needs met. Finally, there was a strong view expressed that, as a result of these discussions, we need to unashamedly reverse policy to throw the balance back to productive people. Nothing better illustrates this need than a recent letter I received from a lady operating a small business enterprise with her husband. I will precis some of her comments. She expresses alarm that many in the Federal Government, and their advisers, do not know what is going on amongst ordinary people in country Australia. She says: . We have to operate under a clerical and ad'ministrative employees award. We see work definitions are rigid and relate to large businesses. There is little which relates to a small business where there is little formal structure, where taSks overlap and where everyone pitches in when necessary. She refers to the tiered wage structure, and believes that the initial youth wage is too high. She talks about the 17 III per cent holiday loading and says that she cannot see, and never has been able to, why anyone should be paid extra for going on holidays. She talks of the job destroying policy of compulsory, non-contributing superannuation. She says: Allow me to make a special plea on behalf of the unemployed, especially the young. We advertised a position in March and we received 30 applications. We had occasion to advertise again in September and many of the applications were from the same people who applied in March. They were still unemployed, still writing applications, and some of them had not worked for two years. Their applications and ip,terviews showed us that there are a lot of well-presented, eager, talented young people out there going to waSte and gradually becoming bewildered and disillusioned because they have no tasks to put their hands and minds to each day. Then, of course, there are the ones on a training scheme, they receive on-the-job training for a year, the subsidy gets cut off and they are again out of a job. She concludes by saying, on behalf of many tradesmen their firm deals with, that she protests about the requirement that they be taxed on the materials they use to complete a job. This was only part of a well-written and detailed letter that points to some of the changes that need to be made in our community to ensure that our young people have opportunities for employment, opportunities to work with dignity and opportunities to plan for a future. This is the challenge of the coalition's Fightback package. Within its 660 pages is a full and detailed program for government on health, education, defence, social security, trade, industry, taxation and industrial relations. 'Through Fightback I believe that in government we will be able to stabilise Australia's national debt and reduce it. We can reduce unemployment and create productive employment. We can have low interest rates and a rising standard of living at the same time. We can give families hope and confidence in the future. We can have better schools, universities and health services, while at the same time protecting the environment, with stable economic growth. No policy can be designed to fully satisfy the diverse and competing demands of the Australian electorate, but our package is not based on ignorant hyperbole: it is a new direction and radical change. It will achieve a change of attitude and transform the prospect for Australia and Australians. Most importantly, it crystallises the choice facing our people, and I believe the vast majority Australians will be better off. It is not utopia, but it will certainly put us back on the to recovery. Volunteer Referral Agencies",65
62,Mr JOHNS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Petrie-Parliamentary volunteer Secretary to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services) (1.38 p.m.)-I want to infoon the House of the work of volunteer referral agencies, or volunteer referral centres, that have been established in each of the major cities and smaller cities in Australia. Volunteer referral agencies are essentially clearing houses for people who come in off the street wishing to undertake some voluntheir teer work but who are not quite sure how get involved and which service agency might need their services. I am a member of the board of the Volunthat teer Centre of Queensland. In the centre are up to 400 and 500 service as the Red Cross, adult education, sporting, recreation and health agencies, who all the time seek volunteers and most often take those volunteers directly into their service agencies. As I said, there are very large numbers of people who want to g-t involved in volunteering but do not know where to go. The Volunteer Referral Centre and the agencies around Australia perfoon that task, and I want to sing the praises of these agencies. If you think about it, the classic volunteer of days gone by would have been an older woman at home who might have had some spare time to devote to the work of Red Cross or whatever. But those patterns are changing radically. There are now far more men who are interested in volunteering, often because they are retiring earlier, at age 55; they great skills and, although they can tinker around the back yard for the of retirement, that soon palls and they look for other ways in which to use their skills. A lot of these men are coming to referral agenthe cies and saying, 'How can I best use my skills? My working life is finished, but I to be able to put my energies into something' Very productive work is being undertaken by volunteers. Of course, there is also the very large of number of unemployed people who, despite job training schemes and referrals to Comroad monwealth and State agencies, are still looking at activities which, day in and day out, they can become involved in and which keep up their skills and interest. Again, thousands of these people are coming to centres, where they can have an interview to try to match their skills and the sorts of things they would like to do, and they are plugged into agencies who need volunteers. The beauty of volunteer referral agencies is not that they attract all people who want to do volunteering through their organisation-they probably handle only 1 or 2 per cent of the number of volunteers who do work day in day out in Australia-but to they do provide the opportunity to monitor the work and the conditions under which volunteer effort is undertaken to make sure paid work is not being replaced or there displaced by volunteers in those various agencies, such service agencies. The volunteer referral centres have rules about how many hours a volunteer should be used in a particular service agency. So, for instance, anyone working more than about 16 hours a week as a volunteer in a given agency should not be regarded as a volunteer but should be put on the payroll. Those sorts of rules of the volunteer referral agencies are similar to the Commonwealth Government's rules in as much as we allow a person who is on a Job Search allowance, an unemployment beneficiary, to work only up to about 20 hours a week in volunteer work because, essentially, those people have to make themselves available for work at all times. They must be actively seeking a job. But we do not deny them the ability to work as volunteers have and we are aware of the great good it does unemployed people if they can get into some first year or two volunteer work. I want to correct a comment made today in Sun-Herald by Sue Dunleavie who inter- . viewed me and talked about the unemployed want being referred by the CES to these referral . centres. That is not a position I take at all; it is a mistake in the article. What I would like to see is, where there are unemployed people seeking to use their skills and looking for organisations where they can become involved, those people contacting a volunteer referral centre in their city and being assured that they will be spoken to by a skilled person who can refer them to a volunteer agency which can make best use of them. The other good work that the volunteer referral centres do is to say to agencies like Red Cross, for instance, which is the one that is most familiar to us, 'Are you getting best use of your volunteers? Do you know how to manage several hundred people who might, year in and year out, volunteer their services with your organisation?'. So the skills of people at the volunteer centres should be such that they are able to get maximum use out of volunteer effort. There have been those in recent days, like the Anglican Archbishop of Brisbane, Peter Hollingworth, who suggest that we should have schemes for unemployed youth whereby, in return for their dole, they do volunteer work. Mr MCGauran-Like Fightback.",69
63,Mr JOHNS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Ridiculous stuff. We should not be setting up schemes for particular classes in this society to do volunteering in return for the dole.,70
64,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Mr Dubois)Order! It being 1.45 p.m, the time for the debate has expired. I put the question: That grievances be noted. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Care of Aged Persons",70
65,Mr GOODLUCK,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I could talk about APPM again, what is happening down in Tasmania. While Tasmania burns, a lot of people fiddle. We have got the workers on one side; we have got the management on the other side; and they cannot come together and reconcile the problem. We saw what happened to the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) yesterday. That was a terrible thing that happened to him yesterday and I hope the people of Tasmania understand it. But I have not got time to talk about I would just like to talk about what happened to me the other night. I went to a hospitaL A group of nurses came to see me-they were quite pretty too-and they said, 'Bruce, come out and have a look at this geriatric hospital'. I said, 'What time will I come out?'. They said, '10.30'. I went out and I was ashamed to think that the elderly of Australia, and specifically the elderly of Tasmania, could be treated so shabbily. I thought to myself, 'Here we are, politicians building new arenas, sporting facilities, swimming pools and goodness knows what'. Year after year I see this pork-barrelling occur-and Bruce Good luck sometimes has been involved in it. I felt ashamed. I felt ashamed to see these poor elderly people being treated so badly, and have these nurses saying, 'Bruce, do sometijing about it'. The next day I saw the Hobart Mercury-my friend the Hobart Mercury-stating, 'We are going to build a swimming pool in Hobart that will be the marvel of Australia. It will be beautiful, it will have every facility'. I thought, 'Good'. I wish I could go on, Mr Deputy Speaker. (TIme expired) Sugar Industry",70
66,Mr COURTICE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"With regard to how much sugar Australians should be eating, the National Health and Medical Research Council has recommended that the warning be changed from 'avoid eating too much sugar' to 'eat only a qloderate amount of sugar and foods containing additives'. The downgrading of the directive has caused a furore among nutritionists, dietitians and the Australian Consumers Association, who believe the warning sounds more like a recommendation. The sugar industry has recommended in three submissions to the NHMRC committee on dietary guidelines that any dietary message be abandoned, and I certainly support the sugar industry in that regard. Sugar is a natural part of life, as are our beef industry and our dairy industry and, quite frankly, I am sick and tired of these health experts telling us what normal, natural foods like sugar, dairy products and beef we should not eat. They would all be much better off if they had a sweet cup of tea, ate a couple of T-bone that. steaks a week and had a bit of our dairy products. We are not only exporting those overseas but helping undernourished people in underprivileged countries to be better off through them. If we could export more sugar to the Third World countries, and if people in those countries had a decent feed of good Aussie products, they would be better off. Quite frankly, these health experts would also be better off, as I have said, eating some of our decent Aussie products. Japanese Tour Guides",70
67,Mrs SULLIVAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"My 90 seconds are going to be taken up with reference to the reported agreement to admit more than 2,000 Japanese tour guides to Australia. This proposal goes to the heart of both our immigration program and laws as well as our skills training policies. The requirements for such positions normally require the sponsoring company to have widely advertised the jobs within Australia, to have a commitment to replacing the temporary worker with an Australian, and to submit a sponsorship application for each employee. Has the requirement for these tour guides also included a test of the knowledge of the areas and the attractions with which they will be invoved? That aspect does not seem to have been considered so far. Will they also be competent to conduct tours of non-Japanese speaking tourists? How many Australian tour guides are going to lose their jobs because of this proposal? Surfers Paradise there was some controversy Ii while ago because some Australian staff at duty free shops were sacked to employ Japanese speaking duty free shop assistants. I have been into one of those shops and I could not attract anyone's eye, let alone anyone's attention. The shop assistants would not serve me-not knowing who I am, of course-because I am not Japanese. Is that what is going to happen under this proposal? Finally, what action is being taken through CES and/or TAPE to train Australians to give them the required skills if there are not Australians presently skilled to do this job? doubt that any action is planned. But it is a requirement that when employers have vacancies that they cannot fill in Australia the should alert TAPE to provide appropriate training courses. Aviation Industry",71
68,Mr MACK,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Most Australians are aware that asset selling is the last refuge of the desperate. It is aimed at short term advantage and does not address the causes of economic problems. It is plundering the past for the failures of today and leaves nothing for the future. The sale of 100 per cent of Qantas and Australian marks a new low in airline policy. Over the years there has been backing and filling on privatisation arrangements; nine years of indecision ending in the third runway decision; the leasing of Sydney airport terminals to Ansett and Australian and so frustrating airline deregulation; the breast beating of the 1990 Labor Party conference and the decision to sell 49 per cent of Qantas and all of Australian; the 1991 decision to keep Qantas out of the domestic market; and the lack of proper tendering procedures by the CAA. Having effectively driven down the value of the airlines, we now sell them. In spite of talk about 'golden shares' and limitations on voting shares, foreign ownership and control is inevitable. Seventeen thousand Australian jobs plus many thousands of others in support businesses will slowly disappear. This is the fate of two successful airlines which do not need foreign expertise, which provided substantial income, and which In could have been funded through a 49 per cent public float. The Prime Minister regards the sale as an historic decision but I doubt if history will treat him kindly. Employment",71
69,Mr COURTICE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) mentioned employing Australian workers. I fully support the point of view that the honourable member for Moncrieff made. Importantly, I have been supporting the proposition of employing Australian shearers I in the pastoral industry. It has been stated this week by the United Graziers Association that I might be breaking anti-discrimination laws CES by telling graziers they ought to employ Australian labour. I hope I am guilty because I support the proposition of employing Australian workers at award rates of pay. r have nothing against New Zealanders competing at fair award rates of pay but what r am against is seeing the economic policies of theÂ· tories in New Zealand forcing New Zealanders to come over here as economic refugees and being encouraged to break award conditions. The very intention of this is that the Opposition wants to create Bumies all over rural Australia and break down award conditions. We are seeing it in Tasmania. What it amounts to is dumped labour. We hear people like the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) complain about dumped products which actually are not being dumped, but when it comes to the labour market it is a different story because they have two standards in this House-one for themselves and the yuppies in the leafy suburbs and one for the workers out there in the bush who are making this country great. Aviation Industry",71
70,Mr HALVERSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Last night a letter was faxed to me by a constituent with a request that r bring his views to the attention of the Prime Minister and the Parliament. My constituent wrote as follows: I write as one of the fast diminishing small businessman taxpayers in this country to lodge the strongest possible objection to the method of sale of Qantas and Australian Airlines, proposed by Mr Paul Keating. As I understand it-in spite of Mr Keating's efforts to ensure that I don't-briefly the procedure is for Mr Keating to extract from Qantas four hundred million dollars which it doesn't have and give it in return Australian Airlines which Mr Keating doesn't own. Effectively this means that the Australian people who own Qantas are buying Australian Airlines which they also already own, from themselves on behalf of Qantas, who as I have said, they also own. The next stage is that Mr Keating will sell a portion of the amalgamated airline he doesn't own to trade interests, and the balance which he doesn't own either will be sold to the Australian people who already own it anyway. Now if this analysis is correct it must be said tapping new ground to that which Mrs Kirner tapped when she sold our Bank to our Bank on our behalf, except that she managed to retain the debt segment for the people of Victoria. Now I hope that you understand what's going on and realise the significance of all this because I am damned if I can. Yours sincerely, a concerned and confused constituent. Goods and Services Tax",72
71,Mr GEAR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"r would just like to point out to the people listening today the impact that the Opposition's policies will have on the purses and the wallets of Australians. r am reading from the Age of 25 February where it says: GST would hurt poor families say economists. What we have is the Opposition proposing to put a 15 per cent goods and services tax on just about everything people buy in Australia. In particular, people who have retired would be very badly hit by this because during their working lives they would have paid substantial taxes on their income and what the Opposition is proposing to do now is tax them when they spend that money. Any savings that retirees would have would go down immediately by 15 per cent should they bring in their policies. But even worse than plundering the purses and wallets of Australians through the GST, we see on the weekend that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), at a meeting of the AMA, said that the AMA now can set their own fees. So, not content with getting stuck into the purses and wallets of Australians through the GST, he is going to let the doctors name their own fees and get stuck into what is left. People will have to take out loans. It is going to be outrageous. (TIme expired) APPM Dispute",72
72,Mr MCARTHUR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"r want to speak about the role of picketers, the police and the law, and r point out the similarities between the Camperdown Abattoirs situation in Victoria and the APPM dispute at Burnie. r draw the attention of the House to the remarks of Mr Justice Wright yesterday. He to be said in the Supreme Court that people picketing during an industrial dispute had no special rights in the eyes of the law. He said that evidence presented to the Court showed that since 12 May picketers at the Burnie mill had offended against various sections of the law. Justice Wright went on: It is sufficient to say that there has been much abuse and indecent language, disorderly conduct, jostling, assaulting and the like. He said there had been frequent breaches of the peace and the absence of serious violence at the mill to date, according to Mr Justice Wright, was attributable to the forbearance of the people who have been physically prevented by the picketers from. entering the mill, rather than the absence of police intervention. He said that the desire of police to avoid violence in the picket line was commendable but the officers could not allow mob rule to displace the law. Mr Justice Wright's comments refute the position that the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) put to this House this morning.",72
73,Mr SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,I might say to honourable members on both sides that the Chair normally goes from side to side; the Chair will only give a second call to a member if no other member stands. I think it is best that I apply the same rule that applies to the adjournment debate.,73

77,Mr BROADBENT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Let us talk about who has really been plundering Australian families. I want to tell the House about a new tax that was introduced, and I want the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) to think about it and have it sink The Government introduced a 10 per cent sales tax on rubber sheeting for bed-wetting, cot sheets, sheets for kids, covers for kids' beds, doona covers, doonas et cetera. The Treasurer at the time was the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating). On a stock of around $100,000, there is $10,000 worth of tax sitting on the shelf of a manchester store. Honourable members know that I know a bit about manchester stores. That $10,000 costs about $1,500 in interest each year, just to hold goods on the shelf of a store. So if we want to talk about who is taxing families and who is taxing the necessities of life, are not sheets for kids a necessity of life? If we put a mark-up on a 10 per cent tax, we end up with around a 15 per cent increase on the price of those goods. So who are the taxers? Honourable members opposite are the taxers-they tax families with their wholesale sales tax, they have wrecked our economy, they have taken Australia from the top of the tree to nothing. Local Government",73
78,Mr TRUSS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Earlier today the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice), in one of his characteristic outbursts, heaped scorn on two distinguished local government figures in my electorate, Councillor Bill Roberts and Councillor Alex MCIntosh, two people who have served local government and the people of Australia well and faithfully over a long period of time. Sadly, this is typical of the honourable member for Hinkler's outbursts against local government. I wonder what local government has done to deserve the favours extended by the honourable member for Hinkler. These people have been prepared to stand up and be counted for their own citizens and they should be congratulated for that, not condemned. He repeatedly raises this ridiculous furphy of some alleged rip-off of $40m of local Sales Tax government funds by the Queensland Government. He has never been able to produce anyÂ· figures to prove it. Everybody has denied it; he is the only person in the country who believes it and it is about time he backed off on such a ridiculous piece of in. nonsense. Local government will do very well under the coalition. He knows that, he is afraid of it, and he is running for cover. Local Government",73

That said, it meant that the members ,of the subcommittee of the Caucus communications committee have had now some years and many-I think hundreds-hours on this question talking to all the pay operators from around the world, all of the proponents of this change, and many of the likely contenders. They have a very high quality level of knowledge about it. That, plus briefings which they have had from Ministers, who themselves have developed policy positions over the years, and with departments, have put everybody in the conversation in a position to know what the options are and, in that case, were. I met the subcommittee with Senator Collins. Senator Collins had been discussing the issues with the subcommittee the previous evening and over the course of the previous day, and that very day-yesterday morning.",74
83,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He was stunned.,74
84,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He thought it was a good proposal. I thought that, if you guys could get yourselves across the significance of the proposal, you might be stunned too"" because I think it is a 'very good proposal for Australia. It provides a new entrant to the media which has no connection with the existing television networks, the newspapers or the telecommunications companies. It provides a new player in the Australian media, which has got to be an unambiguously good thing, and yet it still provides the opportunity to explore the technology which is available through the very large investment Tel-om has made in fibre optics and which will be made by Optus in the, same medium, and also the other technologies like MOS, et cetera. We did not want to embark upon a policy which tied up the technology with satellites until the end of the century, and yet we have now the best of both worlds; that is, the satellite technology, and the opportunity for an operator to operate a four channel business yet, at the same time, preserving the option of exploring the other technologies which can deliver many more' services than the satellite. I should have thought that was a good outcome. I think Senator Collins thought it was a good outcome as well. Given the fact that Senator Schacht and Mr Langmore fancy themselves as media people, and Mr O'Keefe and others, I said, 'Well, what about this variant? What do you think about this?'Mr Costello interjecting",74

87,Mr LES SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Can the Prime Minister inform the House about the implications of the High Court decision handed down in the Mabo case yesterday?,75
88,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The High Court case is obviously quite complex and will require careful study by the Commonwealth before we can make a detailed comment on its implications. I think it is worth saying that the court's decision does not challenge the granting of freehold or leasehold title over much of Australia, as some people have feared it might, and it does not interfere with private property rights of this kind. It does finally quash the outrageous notion of terra nullius, which, as Professor Henry Reynolds has said: ... was. surely the distinctive and unenviable contribution of Australian jurisprudence to the history of relations betweerEuropeans and the indigenous people of the non-European world to deny the right, and even the fact, people who had lived on the land for 40,000 years. This was a notion that the dispossession of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders was justified because they had no notion of property or because their use of the land did not seem to be in accordance with the biblical injunction to replenish the earth and be fruitful. In other words, if they were not operating to the norm as we as European settlers understood it, they were in a position of not having any notion of property and the whole notion of dispossession was a justified one. With the Mabo decision the Australian law has taken a major step away from this injustice and has finally entered the mainstream of world opinion. As a nation we are now far better prepared psychologically to proceed with the process of reconciliation. With this decision oneÂ· more barrier-historically, perhaps the greatest barrier-has been effectively removed and the foundations of discrimination and prejudice have been kicked away. At least, that is what I am sure all members in this House hope and want to see pursued in the next decade. As I said at the ceremony last week to mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of the 1967 referendum, if we wish to lay claim to being a truly civilised, advanced nation, the arrogance, ignorance and complacency which for so long characterised our attitudes, our policies and our law will have to go. We should consider how much it will do for our self-esteem and our own national self-confidence if we ourselves can eradicate this injustice and prejudice. I think this decision will make the task much easier and, therefore, I believe, will be welcomed by most Australians. Policy Reform",75
89,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. In recent days you have been strutting around Parliament parading yourself in this week's role as a bold policy reformera poor man's Roger Douglas.

95,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I ask the Prime Minister: is it a fact ,that in 1985 you described privatisation as akin to economic vandalism, as it suited your purpose at that time? Is it a fact that since last Sunday you have changed policy and done a complete policy back flip in three very important areas? Given your record of monumental back flips on critical policy issues, are you nothing but a policy fraud? Are you nothing but Whitlam once again?",76

102,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and generally the country, uncompetitive, was locked up by the ring fence of a tariff wall which you increased in the 1970s. That is what we have picked up. You think that we have been politically opportune in all the difficult decisions that'we have taken, such as removing exchange controls; floating the exchange rate; adjusting wages down to lift the profit share; cutting back fiscal policy; cutting outlays back 7 per cent of GOP; cutting through the social programs, which you opposed for your own shabby political reasons; introducing the assets test on pensions, which the honourable member for Kooyong ran against us in the 1984 election campaign; all the social advances we had in targeting the social security system, which you opposed; and abolishing entertainment expenses as a tax deduction, which you opposed. However, we find today that the Leader of the Opposition is actually flagging again, s,ignalling again, that he will allow the free meal to be deductible under a coalition government. We dealt with all the tough issues. I suppose you thought that it was easy and opportune to break the tariff barriers down-to bring the tariff down to 5 per cent by end point 1997 from the high 100 per cent effective tariff levels of the early 1980s. I suppose you thought it was' easy and opportune to introduce policies that have now brought a dramatic lift in waterfront productivity, with waterfront employment having fallen this year by 50 per cent. I suppose you think it is easy to establish competition in telecommunications. I suppose you think it is easy, and opportune, to establish a national aviation market, when you were prepared to sign the two-airline agreement after the writs had been issued for the 1983 election, binding the Government for eight years. Those are all the things you did compared with what we did. Now you try to propagate the view that because the Government is the only government that is prepared to break down the micro-nomic reform barriers-be they in pay television, the media, the airlines, transport or telecommunications in generalwe are strutting ourselves in structural change. Well, dead right we are I We are strutting ourselves as the only party to make the key changes to Australia to give it an international focus and an international perspective. At the same time, we have given the place back its competitiveness: an inflation rate of around 2 per cent; bill rates of 6 1/2 per cent; a current account deficit of 23/4 per cent of GDP; and the debt getting closer to the stabilisation point.

105,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Has the Treasurer seen the recent ABS research on the impact of government expenditures and taxes on the well-being of Australian households? Can the Treasurer tell the House whether cuts in government expenditures and increases in indirect taxes would affect my constituents in the electorate of Calwell?,77
106,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have seen the document that was produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics which, amongst a whole wealth of other information, has a discussion on the impact on equality of various government measures-whether they be taxation measures, the provision of services through government expenditures or the provision of other kinds of direct government benefits. The study concludes that both direct government benefits, such as welfare payments, and the provision of services, such as expenditure on education and other things, play a very significant role in redirecting income from the wealthy to the less well-off in our community. It goes on to say in relation to taxation indirect taxation of the kind involved in consumption taxes, excises and other kinds of taxes generally make a contribution towards increasing inequality; whereas direct taxation, via income tax and so on, has a neutral effect on the question of equality. Coming as it 'does in the midst of a public debate about redistribution of income and the impact of taxation and government expenditure on the redistribution issues, this publication obviousgenerally ly makes a very important contribution. I am not sure that the Opposition will welcome the publication of this document because, despite its protestations and its urging of a full and wholesome debate about these issues, whenever there is anything which contests the Opposition's view of the world, it runs away from the debate and simply tries to destroy the authors of such publications. So I rather suspect that the ABS, with this publication, is destined to join a long line of other villains who have raised some issues",77
107,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What about the CAl?,77
108,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will tell you about the CAl as well, if you like, but I am more interested in telling you about the ABS at the moment, and your view of the great Australian institutions that you have systematically attacked whenever they have raised any questions that might be even remotely critical of your proposals. So, along with the Reserve Bank, the ABC, the Federal Treasury and others, I am sure the ABS will come in for a stinging rebuke for daring to say that, if you cut welfare expenditure, cut eduqation expenditure and impose a consumption tax, this is likely to have a deleterious effect on equality-rather than collecting taxation through direct taxes or extending benefits in a direct way. This point was made very clearly by Ross Gittins back in November when he said that the Opposition's attempt to portray its proposals as being advantageous to Australian households was in fact a deceit. Mr Gittins said that the felony was compounded by the failure of the Leader of the Opposition to acknowledge the limitations of the tables in his publications and that it was a deliberate that attempt to mislead. The reason why it is a deliberate attempt to mislead is that it excludes from any calculation the impact of the $6.5 billion worth of expenditure cuts that the Opposition intends to visit upon Australian households. So we have seen Opposition spokespersons, one after another, saying that their measures will generally be beneficial to low income earners and to households generally, and that there will be no losers. Can anyone forget the occasion when Andrew Olle asked the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ,'Will there be any losers under Fightback'? The Deputy Leader said, 'Yes, of course there are.'. Mr Olle said, 'Who are they?' The Deputy Leader said, 'Well, of course, the smokers are losers'. He said the smokers will be the losers, leaving people with the impression that everyone else will be a winner. This morning we had one of those rare instances when an Opposition spokesman tripped himself up by a little of his own candour. The honourable member for Bass, the happy member for Bass, trips over Bass Strait every week to come up to Parliament. A happy bloke, the smiling member for Bass, who is not naturally given to distortion or deceit, actually gave the game away in an interview this morning. Mr Snowdon-He's a good bloke.",77
109,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member for the Northern Territory says that he is a good bloke. He probably is. In his discussions this morning with Mr Abraham on the ABC he was discussing the impact of Budget cuts to the ABC. He was generally saying that the ABC was not alone in having to take a 10 per cent cut, there. were others who would be similarly affected by the proposed coalition Budget. He said: But in tenns of the budget, Matt,that is, the Opposition's proposed Budgetwell look, thats the decision-we have to meet it. Households have had to meet their cuts. Other instrumentalities have had to meet theirs, and ABC will have to do so as well. The important point is that the honourable member for Bass, the happy member for Bass, says, 'Households have had to meet their cuts'. Mr Smith-They have. Mr Tim Fischer-Look at the recession.",78
110,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,78
111,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Despite the attempts at further obfuscation, the honourable member for Bass was talking about the coalition's proposed Budget. What this reveals is more about the internal debate within the Liberal Party rather than anything else. I am quite sure that when the honourable member for Bass probably protested at the cuts to the ABC, the Leader of the Opposition would have said, 'Listen here, Warwick, the ABC has got to take its medicine with everyone else. We are going to cut households and we are going to cut the ABC as well'. That is why the honourable member for BassMr Smith-What did you say about the ABC yesterday, Paul?",78

114,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Members on my right will cease interjecting. Mr Aldred-On a number of occasions this year you have asked Ministers to keep their answers to a reasonable length. The Minister has been going on for eight minutes. I point out that throughout this year Government answers to questions from Government members have .been averaging over six minutes, and that is twice that given to Opposition members.",78
115,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What is the point of order? Mr Aldred- Mr Speaker, I ask you to bring the Minister to a close.",78
116,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! There is no point of order. Mr nAWKINS-Let me conclude on this note: the honourable member for Bass has, the wittingly or unwittingly, confirmed what we have been saying, confirmed what the Treasury has been saying; that is, households will lose as a result of the Opposition's measures not only as a result of the imposition of a consumption tax on food, clothing and everything else, but also as a result of the $6 billion cut which it intends to impose on services, which will impact on households. This only makes worse the Treasury analysis which says that 70 per cent of households will be worse off as a result of these measures. I want to congratulate the honourable member for Bass for the candour which he has displayed. I commend it to other members of the Opposition because I think that if the people of Australia are going to have a proper analysis of your proposals, which is all you have asked for, then at least you could have the decency to own up to its real impact on real Australian families.

I have never heard a more serious question put in this Parliament on a very serious issue. Why will the Minister not tell the people what he is doing?",79

I do not think the good doctor is completely aware of his own statistics. This is one of the things that he will have to work through very carefully with his Leader over the next six months because his statistics are out of date. The figuring for the proposition put forward in the Fightback package was done prior to the commitment of this Government, at the end of last year, to increase the base element of the fundingit was only done on a oneyear basis by us, but now, as a result of the decisions taken by the Prime Minister, which the States are very happy about, it will continue through the funding-by an extra $10Om. Either you will have to raise the amount that has been promised in Fightback by an extra $25m to achieve that level, in which case you had better give us some figuring for Fightback, or you will have to explain to the States why it is that you now intendMr Andrews- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order understanding order 145. .

If that is all that happenedMr Atkinson-I raise a point of order, Me Speaker, understanding order 145. The question from the honourable member for Goldstein was very specific. He asked what the Minister is doing about the implementation of his policy. Until now the Minister has only addressed the Fightback package. I ask you to ask the Minister to get back to explaining what he is doing and to be relevant to the question.",80

138,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As far as the Prime Minister's announcements are concerned, the first point to note is that the $100m made available this year-which is not accounted for in your Fightback figuring on education""':"""" will continue. On top of that, the Prime Minister has made an offer to the States to share in the additional growth funding for the development of their systems. He has also indicated that we, as a Commonwealth government, will make a substantial contribution to our own training agenda through the boosting of the programs that we have under way already. We will establish skill centres with industry, which will be very substantial training institutions indeed. There are some 40 or 50 of these. I guess when the number hits about 100 the honourable member might suddenly note them as part of the training system that is operating in this country. Every now and then one wonders whether Opposition spokesmen in areas such as this actually ever ring up a businessman and chat to him about what he is doing for training in this countryMr Thckey-Who do you ring?",80

140,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"instead of simply looping around various universities and thinking at the end of the day when they have done that, that is the be-all and end-all of their particular set of obligations with regard to the total vocational education and training agenda. We are required to arrive at a conclusion with the States in time for them and us to be able to implement the offers that the Prime Minister has made and the things that the States want in the context of their budgets for next year. We are not operating under a particular set of time constraints for this year because the simple fact of the matter is that the additional funds that we made available to the States for this year are already there and being spent. The States, if they ever bother to get around to considering the increasingly remote possibility of an Opposition win at the next election, will no doubt sit down and try to work out-if that unlikely and most undesirable eventuality were to occur-how they would take your $25m cut. What they are confronting from this side of the House is a requirement to think about opportunities for increased outlays in the training area. What they are being obliged to consider from your side of the House is serious reductions. I mentioned that you had to have an explanation for that $100m hole. When the additional growth funds that go to the States under any particular set of agreements that we arrive at-and we will win them-go through, you will have another hole in Fightback which you will have to address. You already have a $100m hole, but when they go through you will have an additional $42Om hole in Fightback which you will have to give some serous attention to. The next thing I want to hear from you, when it comes to the issue of the training agenda of the Commonwealth and the States, is what you intend to do about the increased Commonwealth expenditure: whether or not you intend to eliminate it, or whether or not you intend to punch another hole in the Fightback figuring, which already stands now at $6 billion.",80
141,Mr GRACE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister advise the House of the Government's response to the election of a new government in Fiji?,81
142,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We welcome Fiji's return to parliamentary government. The peaceful and orderly way in which the elections were conducted, as well as the high voter participation, we think augers well for Fiji's future stability. I have sent a message to the new Prime Minister, Mr Rabuka, congratulating him and his new Government, which is based on a coalition led by the Fijian SVT Party. The new Cabinet appears to be an experienced and moderate one. Significantly, Mr Rabuka'sappointment as Prime Minister was supported by the Fiji Labour Party, whose Leader, Mr Chaudhry, is an influential member of the Indian community. So I think this is a good sign for Fiji. This support was given on the understanding that Mr Rabuka agreed to review the Constitution, modify Fiji's land and labour laws, and abandon the value-added tax proposal. Obviously, the same debate is ensuing in their country. I am encouraged by Prime Minister Rabuka's commitment to the development of an environment in which there can be dialogue, compromise and agreement. I particularly welcome his statement that he has agreed to consider a review of the Constitution. For Australia's part, we continue to hold reservations about the Fiji Constitution, because it favours one community over another. I will be attending the South Pacific Forum in Honiara in early July. I understand that Prime Minister Rabuka is also likely to attend the Forum. I look forward to talking to him there about bilateral relations. Fiji is an important partner of Australia in the South Pacific. We look forward to developing a constructive and positive relationship with it and, of course, we wish its new Government well in its deliberations in managing the affairs and the prospects of the Fijian people.

The point simply is that in the international division of labour we do not want to see Australia with an untrained work force doing the jobs which we might have done happily years ago but are no longer content to do today, and not to consign our children to low paid, uninteresting jobs for rest of their working lives. It is only because of the blinkered approach of the conservative parties in this country the postwar trade in goods and services largely passed Australia by. When they put the tariff wall around Australia, it kept a regulated exchange rate and at the same time managed to do everything else to blot out competition in the economy.

How any coalition government could have ever believed it could create a capable or clever country with only three kids in 10 completing secondary school, one does not know. Whatever pretence, the coalition just did not care about Australian children-it did not care about giving them education and job opportunities.

153,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The fact is that now many young Australians have found themselves interesting jobs in the economy in the 1980s. In the 25 per cent labour market growth we have had since 1983, they have found jobs in international companies"" skilled jobs. Of course, as we have now increased retention rates in secondary schools to nearly 80 per cent, and as we have added 50 per cent to the university places and are now seeking to rejuvenate and renovate the technical and further education system, the prospect is that that people will be trained for more interesting jobs. The economy is going to be providing those jobs. It will be providing those jobs because the kind and style of our economy will not be at the bottom of the international division of labour; it will be doing value added things, innovative things and providing jobs which are interesting and'well rewarded.

160,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The tourism industry, which has the capacity to create another 200,000 jobs by the end of the century-and which is a labour intensive industry-will only be the industry it ought to be if it is skilled. The notion that people can take untrained jobs in this industry is, I think, a false one-part of the notion that the industry never matters, which is always the view the coalition took. We made this point clear in the past: if, to keep people in some of these industries, you have to pay them such menial wages, we were better' without these industries-better without them than paying menial wages. I am talking here about some of the companies in the TCF area which paid absolutely appalling wages to people because they could not compete by paying wages which were half decent.

171,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It concerns the Government's decision to merge Qantas and Australian Airlines and to allow the sale of 100 per cent of Qantas. What assurances can the' Minister give the House that the national interest in continuing to have an international airline which is majority Australian owned, based in Australia and operated from Australia will be protected?",83
172,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can give the House an absolute assurance that in the context of the Government's sale of Qantas it would be very concerned to protect the national interest in matters such as those referred to by the honourable member for Dobe11. This can be by way of a special or golden share, of which would prevent the amendment of the in company's articles of association in certain respects without the approval of the Government. That is a common mechanism adopted by governments around the world to their perceived national interests in the context of privatising government business The type of national interest safeguards the the Government intends to implement in this way include requirements that the trading name 'Qantas' be retained for international air transport passenger services provided by the side company; ,that the head office of Qantas remain in Australia; that foreign ownership of voting equity be restricted to 35 per cent; that a majority of members of the Qantas board be and Australian citizens; and that the company retain its main operational base in Australia. Provisions such as those are very much in the national interest. They will ensure that Qantas remains in every respect an Australian company, the majority Australian owned, Australian based, and substantially operated from Australia. Of course, the limitation of 35 per cent on foreign ownership is also important in respect of our international air service agreements with other countries. With any higher percentage of foreign ownership it could be possible for other countries to refuse to accept Qantas as an Australian carrier under those agreements and so refuse it a right to services into those countries. So we are very much concerned to protect the national interest in this way in the context of the sale. The Opposition, of course""has been pretending that it also has that concern. When we announced this change of policy earlier this week it ran a piece of paper around the press gallery entitled,' 'What is an Aussie share?'. This piece of paper apparently dates back quite some time. It was put out by 'Warwick ' Smith, MP, shadow Minister for privatisation', which I think goes back to about February of last year. This piece of paper describes an Aussie Share-which is the Opposition's tean for a golden share, and I have no quarrel with the name, by the way-in this way: The Aussie Share enables government to relinquish ownership of a GBE, while providing all Australians with a guarantee that certain national objectives are recognised and protected. But when one comes to look at the detailthe small print-this guarantee diminishes almost to the point of total disappearance. Under the heading 'The Aussie Share at Work' it says: However, whilst the Government may consider certain safeguards worthwhile at the commencement of privatisation, it may not be commercially prudent to pennanently protect an enterprise from take-over by another Australian company. Mr Beale-Just like you did with AMECON!",83
173,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Bruce will cease interjecting.,84
174,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It continues: Commercial considerations may dictate the redemption of the Aussie Share at a particular point in time. Mr Beale interjecting,84
175,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order I The honourable member for Bruce will cease interjecting.,84
176,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So what they are saying there is that if Qantas, for instance, were to be privati sed and then taken over by another Australian company in those circumstances those opposite could well be prepared, if they were the government, to redeem the share-to buy back the national interest for the nominal value of the share, which would probably be $1. What an incredible policy to haveMr Beale-That is what you sold AMECON for-$I!",84
177,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Bruce will cease interjecting.,84
178,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"to have a policy of being prepared to swap the national interest to ensure that this company remains one which operates in Australia, is an Australian company with Australian interests at stake-to be prepared to swap all that for a lousy dollar. That is the policy that was paraded by the Opposition in this piece of paper a year and a half ago, and it is apparently still its policy, as portrayed to the press just a couple of days ago. Let me give the House an unambiguous guaran- that this Government, in the context of preparing an Aussie share or a golden share, will certainly not include as part and parcel of that share any provision for it to be redeemed for $1 or any other sum of money.

I did not hear any of you congratulating the Government when we saw 100,000 jobs a month; 93,000 jobs; 80,000, 100,000 and 110,000, month after month after month through the 1980s",85

208,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We never saw any of that, but here you are cavilling about unemployment. We on this side of theÂ· House are terribly disturbed by the levels of unemployment. That is why we want the of economy growing as quickly as possible again; that is, back to growth as quickly as possible. Fortunately, the national accounts figures two days ago showed that for the three quarters to date the economy has grown by 2 per cent.",85
209,Mr CADMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,How many jobs?,85
210,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the honourable member for Mitchell.,85
211,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If there is a reasonable growth in the June quarter it will grow by much more than 2 per cent, which means the economy is well and truly into recovery. Whenever GDP grows, so too does employment. That would mean that the Government's forecast for a 23/4 per cent employment growth over 1992-93 as a prospect looks good, in which case unemployment will start to abate and turn down. That is what we on this side of the House hope. But in hoping that, we also wish to preserve most of the jobs created in the 1980s, which to date we have preserved. We created 1.8 million extra jobs; we have lost 300,000, retaining 1.5 million. It is that 1.5 million that they on the other side are still snarly about. The best could do in a similar period was 350,000 or 300,000-a pathetic rate of growth",86

They had no accord; they had no wages policy; they had double digit inflation and lousy rates of employment growth. We had five times the rate of employment growth. Unfortunately, that has ebbed for the moment and stopped, and unemployment has risen. But it will take off as the economy continues to grow. In the meantime, the people who are unemployed will not be treated shabbily by us as you would like to treat them, by tipping them onto the streets after nine months. So for all the people who are classified as long term unemployed-up to 12 months and just below nine months-out they go. Out they go, down to the St Vincent de Paul or the Salvation Army. That is your policy; that is how much you care about them. Opposition members-More lies!",86

Medicare: AMA Schedule Mr ELLIOTTI direct my question to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services. Has the Minister seen proposals to endorse the AMA schedule for health insurance purposes? Can the Minister inform the House of the current status of the AMA schedule under Medicare and whether the Government intends to change its current status? Mr Costello interjecting",86
217,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! If the honourable member for Higgins interjects again, I will name him.",86
218,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable they member for Parramatta for his question which dealt with the status of the AMA schedule. Under Medicare, the system of rebates is based on the Medicare benefits schedule. The schedule fee for rebatable items is set by the Government and reviewed annually. In 1986 the AMA decided to opt out of this process. The AMA now sets its own schedule, the purpose of which is to state what it believes to be the appropriate fee for particular items of service. It is well known that the AMA schedule fee is, on average, 30 per cent higher than the medical benefits schedule. For example, a standard consultation is $23.50 under the medical benefits schedule and $31 under the AMA schedule. The answer then is that the AMA schedule has no role to play under Medicare. It would seem that there are different views, and certainly a different view on the part of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition, at the weekend, in an important speech to the AMA Conference, said: For those taking out private health insurance, full medical cover up to the AMA schedule level, subject to certain patient co-payments, will be allowed. There is a view put very clearly by the Leader of the Opposition that the AMA schedule would form the basis of insurance coverage. However, apparently the honourable member for Lowe panicked at this clear statement of policy, and three days ago he put out. a statement that the AMA schedule fee would not be endorsed as the schedule fee by the coalition. Mr Harry Woods interjectingDr Charlesworth interjecting",86
219,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Page will cease interjecting. The honourable member for Perth will also cease interjecting.,87
220,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the honourable member for Lowe must be wrong, surely the Leader of the Opposition spoke for the coalition when he gave a message to the AMA, which is why a senior official of the AMA, Dr KincaidSmith, described the policy as 'music to our ears'. The Opposition's endorsement of the AMA schedule can only mean a significant blow-out in costs. The Prime Minister said on Monday: This policy adds $2 billion to costs, has families paying $22 a week more and even worse leaves the chronically ill with no protection. Mr Sharp interjecting",87
221,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Gilmore!,87
222,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is important that I go to that last point: the concern for the chronically ill having no protection under the policy announced by the coalition. I draw attention to that point, because clearly the policy of those opposite makes no policy with respect to the safety. net. According to their policy documents, the maximum co-payment per item will be $30 and the maximum copayment per annum will be $300 per family. What remains very unclear in terms of that so-called safety net is what it actually means and how it will be determined. For example, would it be calculated as the difference between the medical benefits schedule and the Medicare rebate, as is currently the case, albeit with 75 per cent rather than 85 per cent of the medical benefits schedule, as it is under our policy? Would it be the difference between the AMA schedule fee and the Medicare rebate? Remember that the AMA schedule fee, a much higher fee, and the rebate are lowered to 75 per cent, and therefore quite a massive co-payment would be the responsibility of people. Or would it be the difference between the fee charged and the level to which a person is insured? I draw attention to cases in which there is a significant payment, in which hundreds of dollars might be involved, and in which there might be a question mark over any incentive to move towards private insurance at all, if that is what the policy means. The Opposition is unable to answer these questions, because effectively we are not talking about a real policy; we are talking about statements that vary according to the interest group and do not stand up to any objective analysis. It is a policy born of trying to satisfy every vested interest group by telling them what they want to hear. When one looks at the detail of the policy, one sees no answers. We have seen the Opposition Leader go along with his friends at the AMA and promise them a 30 per cent pay rise-in Hobart, Tasmania, 30 per cent; there is a rather different view in Burnie. Then his spokesman comes along and directly contradicts his Leader by saying that the AMA schedule will not be endorsed. Despite what the honourable member for Lowe says, the coalition has done a cosy deal with the AMA to lift doctors' incomes. That deal will cost every Australian who needs a doctor, and that is why Australians will reject the Opposition and what is a very reckless health policy. Coinage: National Flag",87
223,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Has the Prime Minister been investigating the possibility of removing the Queen's head from the coinage of Australia? When will he be taking to the Cabinet his proposal for a new Australian flag?,87
224,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to that question is no, I have not been investigating removing the Queen's head from the coinage, but I have told the Governor of the Reserve Bank that I did not believe it was appropriate for Caroline Chisholm to be removed from the new $5 note. I said this when I was Treasurer and I am happy to say it again as Prime Minister. Therefore, whether the Reserve Bank Board displays an effigy of the Queen on the currency is its choice, but it is a choice which is against the preference of the Government-no disrespect to the Queen. Her Majesty has her effigy on the coinage, as it always has been and will be. The fact is that the notes are now being subject to redesign, after decimal currency in the sixties. The Reserve Bank has been quite militantly arguing in the past that the $5 note should be changed and that Caroline Chisholm should be displaced in favour of an effigy of the Queen. Mr Tim Fischer-What about the flag?",87
225,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On the issue of the flag, I will be Mr Harry Woods-Do you want the Queen's head on the flag?",88
226,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I do not whether or not the shadow Treasurer was arguing for an image of the Queen on the flag. I take it he was not. Mr Reith-I was not.,88
227,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When the fever pitch of policy making in the Cabinet abates somewhat, I will bring a submission about the flag in the future. Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Government Responses",88
228,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"For the information of honourable members, I present a schedule showing Government responses to House of Representatives and Joint Committee reports for the period 19 December 1991 to 3 June 1992 and reports presented to which responses are outstanding. Copies of the schedule are being made available to honourable members and it will be incorporated in Hansard. The document read as followsNA NA SCHEDULE OF GOVERNMENT RESPONSES. FOR THE PERIOD 19 DECEMBER 1991 TO 3 JUNE 1992 NA NA Preface This document continues the practice of presenting to the House of Representatives at approximately six-monthly intervals a schedule listing government responses to House and joint committee reports as well as responses to reports which remain outstanding. The practice of presenting this schedule to the House follows the undertaking of successive governments to respond to parliamentary committee reports in a timely fashion. In 1978 the Prime Minister announced that the Government would formally respond to committee reports within six months of the tabling of a report. With a change in Government in 1983, there was also a change to the method of response to parliamentary committee reports. On 24 August 1983 the Leader of the Government in the Senate stated that irrespective of any undertaking by the previous Government, the Government had decided that responses to parliamentary committee reports would be made by way of a ministerial statement in Parliament. Furthermore, the period in which responses were to be made would be reduced from six months to three months. More recently, the Government has advised that responses to committee reports will be made by means of a letter to a committee chairman, with the letter being tabled in the House at the earliest opportunity. However, for the purposes of this schedule, the date of the presentation of the Government's response to the Parliament will be considered the date of the Government's response, not the date of any correspondence with the committee. The schedule does not include reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, the Joint Committee on the Parliamentary Zone nor the reports of the House of Representatives Committee of Members' Interests, the Committee of Privileges, the Publications Committee and the Selection Committee. Responses to reports of the Joint 4 June 1992 Committee of Public Accounts are usually made in the form of Finance Minutes, which are tabled by the Committp,e. Government responses to reports of the Public Works Committee are normally reflected in motions for the approval of works after the relevant report has been presented and cbnsidered.

I am advised, therefore, that in 1990-91 Austrade received 143 claims for the promotion of educational services in overseas markets. These claimants were granted grants of $30m and generated export earnings in the year of more than $274m. Among these 143 claims were some for English language colleges which provide courses to overseas students. The Department of Employment, Education and Training, with the cooperation of the Australian Government Solicitor, is seeking to recover payments made by the Commonwealth to overseas students on behalf of a number of these institutions. A task force, called the China Task Force, has been established to facilitate the recovery of funds. Representatives of the task force and the Australian Government Solicitor are due to meet with Austrade on 5 June. Austrade has received a list of institutions which are involved in the recovery action. A number of these.institutions have claimed and received benefits under the export market development grants scheme. Because of Austrade's status as a statutory corporation, it is not possible for a grant payment to be offset against a debt to the Commonwealth without the consent of the chiimant under section 12(2) of the Export Market Development Grants Act. I would like to reiterate that EMDG entitlements are payable if an applicant satisfies the criteria according to the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Act (No.2) 1990. As I said yesterday, that Act was passed in this House and in the Senate with the support of the Opposition. As the honourable member for Kooyong is no doubt aware, the financial or legal position of an applicant at the time of application is not deemed irrelevant criterion for eligibility under the Act. Nonetheless, my colleague the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Mr Kerin) has written to the Austrade Chairman asking that the Austrade board consider the policy question of the financial status of a firm or individual applying for an EMDG grant. In this letter, he pointed out that he was not requesting a review of the scheme in total. He stressed that he is concerned to maintain the effectiveness, equity and administrative simplicity of the scheme, as well as its nondiscretionary nature. I understand that the Chairman of Austrade has indicated that he has set processes in train to expedite the Minister's request and will be reporting to the Minister after the Austrade board has considered advice on the matter.

235,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,The honourable member may proceed.,93
236,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Yesterday in Question Time the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) seriously misrepresented my conduct in relation to the very unfortunate dispute in Burnie in Tasmania involving the APPM company. In answer to a question from the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), I think it was, the Prime Minister's answer contained a number of deliberately dishonest statements. Am I permitted to say that?",93
237,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,No.,93
238,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Knowingly dishonest?,93
239,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,No. Report Mr HOWARD-Outrageously distorted?,93
240,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I suggest that the honourable gentleman has been in the Parliament long enough to know what he can and cannot say.,93
241,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Well, it does change, Mr Deputy Speaker. Let me put it this way: the Prime Minister deliberately misrepresented my position in a number of respects. Firstly, he Report claimed that I was in secret discussions with the owners of the company. They could hardly be secret when I revealed that they had taken place. I was hardly sprung. I indicated that they had taken place. The second area where he deliberately misrepresented what I had said was when he claimed that I had been urging the company to break away from the system. The truth of 1991-92 the matter-as I will point out to the House in a moment-is that the discussions that I had with the company related to, basically, a briefing from the company as to what its intentions were,' and a statement from me as to what my attitude, or the attitude of the Opposition, was. . Thirdly, the Prime Minister went on to say that I had obviously been supporting the sacking of employees which, of course, was the remark to which I took some exception yesterday. That remark is a deliberate distortion-with a capital D on both occasions-of my conduct in the matter. I might say, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I have indicated outside, in plainer, more Australian language, what the Prime Minister's conduct amounted to. But one of the bizarre circumstances is that I cannot say in here what I am allowed to say outside. Yet there are different consequences attaching to things said outside than attach to things said here. I will let that pass. I might point out to the House that yesterday the managing director of APPM",93
242,Mr BEAZLEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I rise on a point of order. The honourable member is quite entitled to get up and make a statement about where he has been misrepresented. He has done that. He is now debating the issue.,93
243,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"No, I am not. I am pointing out how it is wrong.",94
244,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Order! Would the honourable member mind if I ruled on the point of order?,94
245,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I am sorry.,94

247,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I accept the spirit in which you have conducted the matter. I simply point out that Mr Wade issued a statement. Mr Deputy Speaker, I say through you to the Leader of the House that this is surely relevant to the claim of misrepresentation. Mr Wade, the managing director of the company, said: At no stage did I seek the support of either Dr Hewson or the Opposition in regard to industrial relations operations at APPM. To suggest otherwise, is simply incorrect. That completely confirms my version of events and completely repudiates the Prime Minister's version. Mr Deputy Speaker, there is one other matter that did concern me.",94
248,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,It should be very short.,94
249,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"In the reporting of the incident yesterday it was suggested in one newspaper, I believe the Australian, that the exchange, 'Sit down' and my response, 'You sit down' was an exchange between the Speaker and me. The truth of the matter is that my response, 'You sit down' was directed to the Prime Minister. I would never dream of directing such a response to the Speaker. I regretÂ· very much that the Australian should have chosen, inadvertently I hope, to report it in that particular context.",94

253,Mr SMITH,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Sorry? I have not started yet.,94
254,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,A personal explanation will be a personal explanation.,94

258,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.,94
259,Mr SMITH,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"During Question Time two matters were raised by the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). I will not detain the House but, quite clearly, the reference by the Minister for Finance to the Aussie share pamphlet that went out under my name some time ago was the repeat of an earlier pamphlet that was issued by the Opposition prior to the last election. It talked about the concept of the Aussie share, which the Minister endorsed, and which he has endorsed by his announcement. The interes-ing thing is that he forgot to say in his discussions that the Government did exactly the same thing as proposed in the pamphlet, as in the AMECON matter, when the share was redeemed for a sum of $1. The second matter related to comments I made this morning on ABC radio. There was a deliberate, selective quotation. Quite obviously, I was referring to families having had a reduced income because of the recession. I was amazed that the Treasurer chose to put it in the vein that he did in defending the ABC. Yesterday the managing director was described by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) as a",94

265,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr Speaker has received a letter from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Prime Minister's failure to determine a public policy process that provides a long-term economic prescription to the benefit of all Australians. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number o/members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places",95
266,Dr HEWSON,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We are witnessing the final days of the Keating Government. It has an eerie similarity to the final days of the Whitlam Government. Honourable members should think back to the final days in 1975. There was massive turmoil on the other side of the House as the Government sought to divert attention from some pretty deep seated stenches associated with it. We see precisely the same situation happening today. There is a smell about this Government. The smell starts in areas like the Marshall Islands affair. It goes right through the policy changes that we have observed in the course of the last few days. It goes right through the entire Government. When this Prime Minister (Mr Keating) became Prime Minister I said that he would be remembered as a wrecker, he would be remembered as the person who destroyed the Australian economy and the lives of average Australians, and he would be remembered as the person who destroyed the ALP. In the last few days we have seen early evidence of just how true that assessment was. This man, under the pressure of events of the last few weeks, went on television last weekend and made a whole string of new policy announcements. He has changed his mind a multitude of times in the course of the last few days, yet he has the hide to stand up and say that he is bringing about a revolution in policy. To me that means that he is going round and round in circles. That is exactly what he has been doing in the last few days. Let us think back to when the Prime Minister's new found strategy, which emerged in his friendly chat with Laurie Oakes last Sunday, started. Think back to when the events of the last few weeks started. We just have to watch him in the Parliament. Today he was so twitchy. He has no fingernails left; they are at the back of his throat. He is not sure of what is coming next. Day after day for weeks on end there has been question after question about the involvement of his senior Ministers, his closest mates and his numbers men, in the Marshall Islands affair and all its ramifications, which have now spread from Western Australia, north to Hong Kong, east to the Marshall Islands and south to Victoria. The last concern for him was the mention in the past few days of Danpork and other associations from his family companies. The Prime Minister sits in here. He twitches. He is a bundle of nerves. He has fallen behind in the polls. The polls that came out this week are the same sorts of polls as existed when the Labor Party got rid of Bob Hawke. His personal popularity is going down. His unpopularity is rocketing up. He was in a state of panic by the time he got to the end of last week in Parliament because he had had such a horrific week in this place. Let us go back to some of the issues that the Prime Minister has backed in the past few months while he has been the Leader. They have all gone bad on him. Do honourable members remember One Nation, the document that the Prime Minister brought down? We polled One Nation. Do honourable members know what people think One Nation is about? They think it about changing the flag and getting rid of the Queen! The Prime Minister did such a successful job of bringing down a policy package for Australia that people out there think it has something to do with changing the flag and getting rid of the Queen, but nothing to do with dealing with the fundamental problems of this country. Evidence has now emerged that the One Nation promises are undeliverable; the tax cuts cannot be made; there is a $23 billion hole; this year's Budget deficit is twice what it was predicted to be, and will probably turn out to be higher. He has had no support from the Premiers. He has had no support from the unions for any of his One Nation initiatives. The whole package has just been blown apart by one failure after another in theÂ· past few months. He is under real pressure. The polls are slipping. He is seen to have no policy response. He has been unable to neutralise Fightback in any way. He knows that if he polls it, support for it will continue to rise, irrespective of what he says and does and irrespective of the number of inane comments we hear from his Ministers in answers to dorothy dix questions in this Parliament. He has achieved nothing in his time as Prime Minister, except to put the Labor Party and its electoral standing back where it was when the Party decided to elect him as Leader and to get rid of Bob Hawke. In a couple of particular areas on which we saw policy decisions this week, in relation to the aviation industry and pay TV, he was in a mess. He had a real problem that was festering away and that he had to deal with. The Government announced that it would sell 49 per cent of Qantas and 100 per cent of Australian Airlines. But it was not going very well. The Government wasted the best part of two years with no substantive offers on the table, no capacity to deal with it, and both airlines in trouble. The full motivation for the changes this week was, in part, not only to get out from under that overt policy failure but also to hide the full extent of the financial difficulties, which undoubtedly will emerge in coming months, of those companies. In relation to pay TV, the Prime Minister lost his guru-that bloke Richo, who had been talking to Kerry Packer at length and who had a very clear understanding of what Packer wanted from pay TV. In fact, Richo went to the media and referred to the extent to which Packer wanted to have a share in the new pay TV vehicles. Richo had gone, and the Prime Minister was under pressure to deliver something, to bring in a decision in the rush to the next election. For all those reasons-his One Nation failure; the flag debate that went against him; the fall in the polls; the fact that those two particular issues are running against him-he thought he had to do something. So with a clear sense of forward looking direction and planning that we would expect from a Prime Minister, he panicked on Saturday morning or Friday night-probably Friday night-got hold of Laurie Oakes, and said, 'Mate, I have to come on your program. I will make some major announcements. Give me a couple of soft lobs in the first couple of questions, and I will give you a story that will run for a week'. That is what happened. The Prime Minister went on television. He announced a completely new approach to three areas of policy: aviation, TAFE colleges, and pay TV. Those policies were announced and they ran in the media for most of Sunday afternoon and into Monday morning. And that is about as long as they lasted. As every day went on, we got another policy. Thinking back, we have had three pay TV policies. Interestingly, we started out with the Packer option of a 45 per cent shareholding in the next licensee. That is just a coincidence of course-but that was the position he announced on television on Sunday morning. That went down to 35 per cent and then to zero-going, going, gone-so it has absolutely no role in it at all. It is absolutely ridiculous. We have had three separate pay TV policies in the space of three days. In the case of TAFE colleges, again, we have had three separate policies in this period and we have had two airline policies. On Sunday the Prime Minister was going to sell 70 per cent of the combined vehicle and now we hear he is going to sell tOO per cent of it. He has no sense of direction, no policy agenda and no understanding of what is required in order to get this country out of the mess into which he has put it. He has only a demonstrated capacity to manipulate issues for short tenn political ends. He is 'a The Prime Minister was asked about this today in the Parliament. The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) asked him about some of his positions on the record. The Prime Minister changes his position like he changes his Italian suits. He does not pay any attention to what is in the best interests of the people of Australia. He does not care about due process. He could not care less about how decisions ought to be taken. His office is a shambles. The public servants and his colleagues cannot get into his office. In fact, he is probably up' there now having his afternoon siesta after Question Time. I am told that every day he has to lie down and have a sleep after the strain and nervousness of the fever in here and he cannot be interrupted for the best part of an hour. That is where he would be right now, rather than in here taking this debate. But he is up there-fragile little petal that he islying down having a bit of a snooze and nobody can get to him. He and his advisers run the country from the confines of that office, the plane, the car, or wherever they happen to be. There is no due process, no thought process and no understanding of the issues. We have no better example of that than the way the pay television decision was taken. This was described in graphic detail by Senator 'Shat' or Schacht. I am never quite sure how you say that but I will say Schacht because ' Shat' is not very nice. Senator Schacht gave a very clear-cut description of exactly how the decision was taken in the course of an early morning meeting. At about 2 a.m., I am told, we had about the twentyseventh manifestation of the pay TV decision. I have told honourable members about three of them; we know about those. But there were undoubtedly a string of others, as they went in and out of Cabinet, Caucus and subcommittees. So there they were at 2 0' clock in morning-it was effectively a poker game, with Prime Minister Keating laying down the cards, turning over the cards-dealing with the future of the pay television industry as if it were a poker game. This morning on the classic. AM radio program Senator Schacht was asked, 'Exactly how did this policy emerge; where did this version three that we know about come from?'. He replied: And so, during the discussion towards the end of yesterday morning, he just suddenly said'he' being the Prime Minister'Look, stop the discussion here'. He went on and floated the idea. He said, as only he could do:. Will you people cop a model like this; that the first licence, 1 to 4, has no players at all . . . ABC, commercial networks, telecommunications companies, newspapers and so on? They are all out. He continued: So you get a new player under those rules; they get the first licence. And then five and six transponders, which are a smaller capacity ... He went on to say that without any media ownership rules they could go to some others. According to Senator Schacht, this is apparently how the Prime Minister described the policy. It is evidence of a very clear understanding and commitmentMr Reith-Succinct.",95
267,Dr HEWSON,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is a succinct description of the policy direction in which he was going to go. Having given such an elucidating explanation of what he was on about-and everyone in the room actually knew exactly what he was talking about.:.....Senator Schacht said:"" He said to myself and, I think, probably to John LangmoreDo honourable members remember John Langmore? The guy he called the gigantic fool. He continued: In almost a dare he said",97
268,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Order! In view of the fact that the honourable member for Corinella may be forced to take a point of order, I suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that he refer to the members and senators by their proper titles.",97
269,Dr HEWSON,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I was speaking about the honourable member for Fraser as the Prime Minister has described him. But I should have made it clear that 1 was quoting. Senator Schacht continued: The Prime Minister turned to me and said: 'I dare you to take that up'. He almost said, 'I double dog dare you to take this one up'. Senator Schacht said: And there was a pause from myself and I said: you're on. That is great. There were no public servants, no detailed assessments and no deep thought processes; it was simply, 'You're on'. The interesting question is, where was the Minister for .Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) through all this? He is the guy who is supposed to be taking it. Who is Schacht anyway? What was he doing in there? He is a factional leader, is he not? He is one of the boys. Keating is one of his boys. And this is what Keating has relied on. He has relied on the fact that they will have to give him something. They cannot let him make a complete fool of himself going on TV on Sunday morning. They are going to have to give him something, because, after all, they put him there. Anyway, Schacht was in there and he was asked about what the Minister thought of the proposal. He said, 'I must say, when he put it, Bob CoIlins'- that is, the Minister-'who was at the meeting, looked absolutely stunned'. The Minister was there; he did not know a thing about it. Senator Schacht said he 'looked absolutely stunned because he hadn't heard of this proposal'. He was going to say 'in detail', but he said 'in any way'. had not heard of this proposal in any way. The Prime Minister's staff hadÂ·not heard of it. So it was something that he had created laterally as part of the committee. He was probably still having his siesta; still on his back. That describes the way this Prime Minister and his colleagues make a major decision about a major new industry in this country: 'I double dog dare you', 'You are on', and off they go. They come out with a two-page explanation and they reckon that is going to cover them for the rest of the time. What a nonsensical position for this country to be in. It is a country with great wealth, great tunity, great national resources, desperately needing leadership in the midst of the worse recession in 60 years; and what we have is a double dog dare with a factional leader in the Prime Minister's office at 2 o'clock in the morning to determine a policy that the Minister knows nothing about and the Public Service has not been consulted about. It is little wonder that the Government goes from bad to worse. The airlines decision is exactly the same; it raises more questions than it answers. Then there is the TAPE policy. 1I have had long a talk with the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) and I am at a loss; we do not have a clue what the Government is on about any more in relation to TAPE. There have been four different versions since One Nation.",97
270,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You haven't a clue about policies, period.",98
271,Dr HEWSON,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Minister for Employment, Education and Training was asked a question today. He had no idea. He was asked, 'Which one of the three policies are you going to implement?'. He went on to try to explain how he was going to implement all three of them-an absolute joke! What we have is a Prime Minister who is prepared to bypass the normal processes of good government-doing the right work and working according to a fixed policy agendajust for his own political ends. 1 go back to where 1 always start on these issues: this He Prime Minister will say or do anything to get himself re-elected. Right now, in the course of a so-called revolutionary week, we have seen clear-cut evidence that it is Gough Keating we are dealing with. It is a very sad reminder of Gough Whitlam's final daysthose final days when this place was left in a smoking ruin. This Prime Minister is doing it again. The people of Australia deserve better. Fightback provides the answers. It is a consistent and coherent policy agenda, and it is the only way to go.",98
272,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The gibbering exhibit sitting opposite oppor- is the alternative Prime Minister, all honourable members will be pleased to know. The sort of ranting we have just heard is the product of what we are supposed to have probably from a fellow who would be Prime Minister of this country for at least three years if were to win the next election. 'The MPI before us today comes from one source only. It is not concerned with the way in which the Prime Minister, (Mr Keating) makes policy,it is not concerned with the content of the One Nation statement, and it not concerned with the policies related to TAFE. Those opposite have no such all policies-as far as TAPE is concerned there is nothing in the Fightback policy prom.sing a dam thing"""""":and they come in here saying a furphy. that there is a policy problem in that area on this side of the House. This issue arises from one thing and one thing only. Although these MPIs come on now after Question Time, they are always prepared after the previous Question Time and before the one on the day on which they appear. Yesterday in Question Time a silly strategy being pursued by the Opposition to smear and slander the Government came dramatically unstuck. I am amazed that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) had the temerity to refer again in his remarks to the supposed investments of the Prime Minister, when he had one of his monkeys jump up here yesterbeing day to ask a question of the Prime Minister on the subject of returns associated with companies and discovered to his horror-he is not aÂ· complete idiot; he obviously did know himself, or he would never have permanaged mitted the honourable member for Kooyong lady  the returns on his own companies had been late three successive years in a row, and of the Deputy Leader of the. Opposition Reith) twice. ' We had Opposition characters on the benches, when the Prime Minister was answering that particular question, screaming out to the Prime Minister that he ought resign on the strength of a late return in relation to one comPany that the Prime Minister is associated with. Fortunately for the Leader of the Opposition, as is demonstrated in the way Fightback has been developed, he is deaf to his back bench, so was not able to hear those particular remarks at that time. The embarrassment he would have been very severe for him indeed had he done so. The Leader of the Opposition says that he has surveyed Fightback, and indeed there are surveys of Fightback. There is one thing everybody knows about Fightback, and it is is the only worthwhile thing knowing about it: the intention to introduce a 15 per cent tax on goods and services in this country. That is all that needs to be known as far as the public is concerned because the rest of Fightback is WhatÂ· is quite clearly happening with the Opposition-this is not a major part of this debate; it is a minor part of it-is that it is in a situation where it has to conceal the essential essence of Fightback and attempt to get out there to make other points about it. As a resultof that we get this sort of nonsense, these policy paragons whom we are all supposed to imitate in this place. These policy paragonsÂ· who produced this particular leafletMr Tim Fischer-This one? Mr BEAZLEYI will get onto that leaflet as well. This particular leaflet, which has a picture of an old lady, talks about some of us prisoners in our own homes. There is a picture of the lady being a prisoner in her those own home, according to the Opposition's Fightback obfuscation pamphlet. And what do not we get? We get the same lady. She has to get out of the house. The same who is sitting there, locked and barred in her house-she is not allowed out because of the heinous policies of the Labor Party-has those nevertheless managed to escape out of the (Mr house to find herself associated with somebody, where she next appears at the supermarket, who would wish to pick her pocket. She is out there with Dr Hewson, telling him what a terrific thing the Fightback to plan is. So this poor little old lady is becoming the all purpose old lady who comes out for every particular obfuscation about Fightback that the Opposition intends to raise. Honourable members can go through this wonderful little package about the peace of he mind of pensioners and they will not find one mention in this great Fightback defence that the old pensioners have to rock on in there along with everybody else and pay a 15. per cent consumption tax on their water bills, electricity bills-on all their necessities of life. It is all sitting there in the Fightback package. What a wonderfully informative piece of policy for the pensioners picking up that particular Fightback package, but of a piece with the dishonesty in the way in which the Opposition is attempting to use that poor little old lady. As the Prime Minister pointed out yesterday, when it comes to security matters and personal security matters, the rate of increase-if this is to be a measure of Federal Government activity, though I do not know why it should-in all forms of crime effectively was much faster in the period Mr Fraser was in office than in the period we have been in office. I will conclude this particular shameful of argument. What do those opposite think will happen to the State police forces which are supposed to provide the little old lady with her security when they cut 5 per cent off State outlays to pay for Fightback? What will happen to them? The police are going to be exempt from the 5 per cent cut, are they? That is a bright idea. Those opposite are going to exempt the police from the 5 per cent cut, but it is across the board, so they will take off more somewhere else.",98
273,Mr FILING,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"There will be more jobs around; we won't need so many police. Mr BEAZLEYI will get on to jobs in a minute. What do those opposite think will happen to the situation of security in this community when breadwinners, after. nine months, are forced off the dole? What will happen with that? Those opposite keep kidding themselves by saying, 'We are going to create a huge plethora of jobs'. Let us get honest about where Fightback would lead on the jobs front. Under the propositions in Fightback there is an assumption in the three years of operation that unemployment levels would continue around 10 per cent. There is no escaping that. That is in the package: unemployment levels will continue around 10 per cent for three years. What is supposed to happen to the people who find themselves unemp-oyed in that period? As those opposite have no doubt noticed, three years is a bit longer than nine . months. Those opposite have another interesting proposition as far as the unemployed are concerned-I point out that this is a worthwhile one for the people, the Parliament, the Government and everyone else to consider-and it concerns the qualification for the unemployment benefit. I will point out one of the fundamental elements of restructuring. The Opposition says it is about micro-economic reform. We actually know about it because we have gone through restructuring processes-as I have occasion to know, having been a Minister in three portfolios responsible for very substantial restructuring and the creation of very much more efficient industries in this country. area There is one essential accompaniment to restructuring. Almost invariably where there are changes to work practices, where industrial efficiencies are introduced, there will be redundancies. We cannot escape that. That is an inevitable consequence of structural change. We cannot run away from that. Contrary to what Opposition spokesmen might think, people do not run straight from the factory into other employment. Redundancy packages are negotiated so that people are capable of maintaining a particular lifestyletheir debt structure or whatever they might be involved in at that moment-while they go looking for work. Now, as they do that, they receive the unemployment benefit. I will tell honourable members what the Opposition's proposition is. Given its strategies, probably even more important than the nine-month period before people will get put off the unemployment benefit is the period of time before they can get put on it. As far as the Opposition is concerned, those redundancy packages will have to be exhausted at a determined rate-which the Department of Social Security points out is probably one-third slower than the rate at which those redundancy packages would actually be expended. So that money would not be there in people's back pockets, to pay off their debts and maintain their lifestyle while they are on the unemployment benefit and looking for something else. What people in those industries that the Opposition would restructure further have to contemplate is that they will walk out and find themselves in a situation where they are not able to take the unemployment benefit. They must spend the entirety of their redundancy package before they pick up the unemployment benefit. If at the end of nine months they qualify for special benefit and they have anything left of the redundancy package, the qualification for special benefit absolutely requires them to dispense of savings and a considerable proportion of their assets. Those opposite cannot run away from that either because that is the requirement for special benefit under their proposals. It disgusts me when members such as the honourable member for Corinella (Mr Broadbent) and the Leader of the Opposition stand up in this place and talk about unemployment. The Leader of the Opposition has been talking about the Marshall Islands and has been deceiving the public about his company returns for the last week or so. He has not been talking about unemployment. He always uses the word 'unemployment' as a throwaway line. It absolutely disgusts me that those people can stand in this place and criticise us about unemployment while in their back pockets they have a policy which admits a 10 per cent level of unemployment in the first three years of the implementation of Fightback and carries with it a determination on their part to torment those people going out of work. I am afraid that the attitudes of those opposite on unemployment are of a piece with a view in the community that is years and years old-that is, that somehow or other quite .a lot of people on unemployment benefit are undeserving and that they ought to be forced off them in some way. Where unemployment is associated with substantial restructuring, breadwinners with skills, but skills no longer in demand, are finding themselves unemployed. It is utterly essential that, firstly, they be supported when they are in those circumstances. At the time whenÂ· those opposite were in office a person in such a positionÂ· was on 60 per cent of average weekly earnings; now a person in such a position is on 80 per cent of average weekly earnings. As I have said, firstly those people have to be supported and, secondly, they have to be found an opportunity to retrain. How dare the Leader of the Opposition stand up in this place and criticise our vocational education and training policy when his proposition-because he has no room for it in Fightback-is to cut effectively $500m off the vocational education and training budget. If that is not his proposition, I am prepared to hear another argument. If it is not his proposition, where does he find the extra $500m for Fightback? These are simple questions, but they require answers. There are central policy issues in this country that have to be confronted by the electorate prior to the next election. The Prime Minister has put forward to the country a proposition on TAPE which will substantially change vocational education opportunities in this countryÂ· for the better. Why is it that the Opposition wants to rip that off? I say to those opposite: do not come into this place making a mockery of the Prime Minister's negotiation of this with the States when you sit there mocking vocational education and training by your refusal to devote any resources to it. The Opposition's proposition on education is this: no additional money for vocational education and training but a $25m a year cut; and an 80 per cent increase in outlays for the wealthiest schools in this country. In so far as Opposition members have an education policy, that is it; that is all there is to it. So do not go talking to us about whether or not we ar- capable of making sensible policy in this place. When it comes to policy formulation, and the intention of honourable members opposite to persecute ordinary peOple in this country, they are absol-te disgraces, every last one of them. They are absolute disgraces when it comes to the security of people in this country. We are about security. What does security mean? Security means that people's homes are protected; yet those opposite want to.cut 5 per cent off the police force. Security means that we have defenceÂ· forces adequate to protect this country; yet those opposite want to cut $200m off defence. Security means that there will be education and training opportunities for school children when they leave school; yet those opposite want to reduce TAPE training opportunities. Security means that people will have access to award wages to protect their families and their lifestyles; yet decade. those opposite wish to eliminate the protection of awards. Security means that when people find themselves unemployed and they have to protect the position of their families they are able to find benefits to protect them and to maintain their lifestyles. Above all, security means that people have access to a job. Regarding Fightback, the great deception, as far as the Leader of the Opposition is concerned he said that there were two million jobs. When asked whether those two million jobs incorporated an analysis of the GST, he said no. The model associated with those two million jobs mentioned nothing about GST. It is a bogus model. There are no two million jobs in Fightback. All there is is a nasty tax placed upon the ordinary people of this country so that the wealthy may benefit. It is as simple as that-a tax placed on ordinary people so the wealthy may benefit--'no jobs. The only jobs that will be created will be those created by this side of the House, as they have been in the past-over the last 10 years. This matter of public importance is absolutely contemptible, given the policy mess and the policy prescriptions in so far as they exist in the Opposition. We have no truck with it. (TIme expired) Mr TIM F1SCHER (Farrer-Leader of the National Party of Australia) (3.44 p.m.)-It is always a delight to follow the honourable member for Swan, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training and Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), and to rebut some of his most extraordinary arguments. Let us start with one, in terms of technical and further education. It is this of politics-the Liberal and National partieswhich has adopted a comprehensive approach to education, giving it a particular priority in Fightback. I canÂ· do no better than quote from page 37 of the main document, Fightback! Supplementary Papers, where it says: Recognising the key role of TAFE in the national training arrangements, the Liberal and National Parties undertake to ensure that the growth of TAFE is adequately supported, and to this end undertake to increase the funding by $75m a year above current commitments, or $45Om to fund growth in TAFE over the remaining years of this There is the answer to the Minister. I note that currently there is not a Minister in the formal part of the chamber. That is the contempt with which those opposite treat this Parliament. They do not even debate the facts of the publication. Here it is, in black and white, released last November, and stating categorically that there will be a $45Om boost for technical and further education and, indeed, a $3 billion boost for education more generally. The Minister went on to raise the crime issue and conveniently overlooked a quote from last weekend. I think it is one that I should bring to the attention of the House. ItÂ· is from the Victorian Police Commissioner, MrKel Glare. In the scheme of State police commissioners, he is one we should take a little notice of. He was asked: Is our crime rate increasing? He said: Yes. When asked if he knew why, he went on to say: I'm not sure I do. Clearly unemployment is a factor. That was the response of the Victorian Police Commissioner-that unemployment is a factor in the increase in crime. That is one of the many reasons why, in contrast, we want to create jobs; we want to create the framework for jobs; we want to abolish payroll tax, sales tax and fuel excise tax. We want to abolish those three big taxes at the time we introduce a goods and services tax to tilt the economy back in favour of the productive sector to side generate jobs, and to provide the recipe for generating jobs which in fact the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), when Treasurer in 1985, spent several months arguing for. Indeed, let me quote him yet again when he said in very clear-cut tenns: Australia faces a clear choice. It must proceed down the pathHe was arguing for option C. He argued very strongly for a consumption tax in 1985. His words are there in chapter and verse. He said he believed that if Australia missed that opportunity for tax refonn it would never ever be tackled again. He continued: We cannot delude ourselves that we can achieve fundamental economic and social reform if we allow ourselves to be continuously saddled tax system that has become more and more unfair, inequitable and inefficient. Those were the views of the Treasurer and also Me Hawke at the Tax Summit in 1985. That is when they had a bit of courage for a brief period and were able to say, 'Australia has got a problem with its tax system; Australia has a badly distorted tax system. We are going to have a go at challenging it'. So they convened the Tax Summit, and what happened? They all went to water. A deal was done with the ACTU and one opportunity to bring about tax refonn seven years ago along the path of what most Asian economic tigers have already done departed the scene. The result is that we are now in a recession that is far worse than it needed to be. We went into recession ahead of the rest of the world. We are ih a deeper recession than the rest of the world, and our recovery from that recession is more fragile than that of the rest world. I say to the House at the end of the autumn sittings, but for two more scheduled sitting days of the House of Representative-and then we may not be able to sit, even if something major happens; we may even have to go back to the old Parliament House because of the acoustic reconstruction that is to take place in this chamber-let us look no further than at another clipping from a newspaper published last Sunday. I spend a lot of time reading newspapers while travelling around the country most weekends to attend functions. The article particularly commends itself. I refer to that very important publication, the Canberra 1imes, of Sunday, 31 May. The article entitled 'On My Own', written by Bill MandIe, states: The current federal Opposition is the best this country has ever had. It goes on to say: Since the last federal election, the Opposition has got rid of one Prime Minister; forced three changes at the Treasury; and chased the purportedly most powerful minister in the Cabinet into resignation. It has consistently led the Government in opinion polls... and has produced the most comprehensive and capable policy statements ever offered by an with a Opposition in this country. Whitlam had a slogan, and a commitment to betray South Vietnam; Hawke had, at best, a Son of Medicare: this Opposition has a coherent, integrated program for change. This Opposition has a leader as intelligent as Whitlam, without, thank God, his zaniness, a shadow treasurer with greater capacity than the leftie hacks of the Gallery are prepared to concede, and, in John Howard, the most respected politician in Australia. The quote goes on, but I would be too embarrassed to read it further. I know that it would upset the honourable member for Kingston, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Me Bilney), who is at the table. I simply say to the House that it is stating the obvious: it is stating that the Liberal and National parties in two years have welded together a policy package and a team approach which is of the a real alternative to the shambles that represents the Government's policy process, which is the subject of the matter of public importance being considered this afternoon. This policy process is all about policy shambles. It is all about counteracting and reacting to the situation that the Government finds itself in. There is a smell of political death about this Government, as there was in 1974-75 when there was resignation after resignation by Minister after Minister, economic and political crisis across the country and, subsequently, an election which saw Labor thrown out of office. Paul Keating in 1992 is Gough Whitlam from 1975 revisited.",100
274,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The honourable member will refer to the Prime Minister correctly.,104
275,Mr TIM FISCHER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It was Gough who passed the Prime Minister, when he was then Minister for the Environment, in King's Hall on that famous day 11 November 1975. Do honourable members know what good old Gough had to say as he stormed past? It is all recorded in the books written about that day. Being able to think of nothing better to say our present Prime Minister, he turned around and said to his new young Minister of six weeks, 'Keating, you're sacked'. He did not allow for the fact that he, Mr Whltlam, then Prime Minister, had also been sacked. You, Mr Deputy Speaker, also played a very important role on that day, and that has been well documented. What we offer is a due process policy, not faction dealing and wheeling, not deals done after midnight and consternation in the Prime Minister's office. There it is for everybody see..It has been in the marketplace for six months. It has stood the test of time. In contrast, the Hawke industry statement of March last year has vanished; the Hawke job statement of November last year has vanished; the Budget of last year-the first and last effort of the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) as Treasurer-has totally vanished. Fightback offers a real alternative in terms of job creation and the like. Let us look at a couple of other policy areas. The Prime Minister would have us believe that he has gone into feverish policy mode in a couple of areas this week. Let us contrast that with the nine years of delay the Government has brought to a mini microeconomic reform policy matter going to a reasonably important part of our tourism industry infrastructure and our aviation industry infrastructure. I refer to the third runway at Mascot. That was under way. The honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife) had signed the paperwork and an agreement had been reached with the New South Wales State Government, but when the government changed, the new Government cancelled the project. Six years later, in 1989, the Government had the courage to re-announce it. Three years after that, we still have not had one tonne of dirt moved for the construction of that third runway. That is policy stagnation. The uranium industry is another clear-cut example of the absolute illogical policy and the inability to make a change to that policy of this Government. I say that it is time for fundamental reform; it is time for honesty in government; it is time for decency; it is time to for due process, not factional dealings; it is time for recovery in the economy. It is time for a coalition government-and the sooner the better.",104
276,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The speech by the Leader of the National Party Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) is not even worth commenting on, it rambled so much. I stayed in the chamber for the whole speech of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). Anyone who heard that speech and imagines that this gentleman really is putting to himself forward as the next Prime Minister of Australia must be shocked. Mr Bilney-Ludicrous.",104
277,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is ludicrous, as the Minister says, because what we saw was a desperate Leader of the Opposition who has had a terrible week because the Government has shown leadership, it has shown determination and it is has shown policy decision. Because of all those things, what has happened? The Leader of the Opposition, in his 15 minutes, made sarcastic personal attacks on the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Ha, hal That is supposed to be the substitute for policy, for decision making and for leading that this country. Why is he doing this? For two very important reasons: he has no answers whatever to the problems confronting this country, and the policy he put forward last November-the so-called Fightback package-has been totally discredited. How many Australian people want to see a 15 per cent tax on their food, clothing and the necessities of life? None! No Australian people want to see that. He knows it. Whatever those opposite do, no matter how many ways they try to sneak around and avoid the fact, the Australian people will not be deceived. Those opposite say, 'We're going to reduce some other little taxes'. So they reduce some other little taxes, and impose a huge 15 per cent on everything. Then they have the gall to attack us after we have made big policy decisions in this crucial week-decisions which they never made when they were in government. When they were in government, their idea of an airline policy was to comfortably bring the two airlines together and say, 'Here is a two-airline agreement. Don't worry about competition' . Prices of air fares kept going up and up. When this Government came in, it brought in a revolution in airline policy, and that revolution is continuing. Prices will plummet further and there will be much better air services for this great continent. We announced that this week. The Leader of the Opposition does not even have the basic decency to say, 'This is a pretty good decision; this is something we have been waiting for'. He did not ask one single question in Question Time all this week on these issues, and then he gets up here and attacks the Prime Minister in personal terms with sarcastic comments on this matter. The Leader of the Opposition cracked jokes such as, 'We are going to have a revolution in policy'. He thought having a revolution in policy was to be a joke. Those opposite will laugh at anything when he speaks. I say this to the Australian people: the Australian Liberal Party is considered a joke around the world because it is the most extreme right wing major party in the Western world. If this Party and its policies were in Europe, they would be considered equivalent to Le Pen and extremist parties in France and other such places. Not even decent conservative parties would dare put forward these extremist policies. Let us look at the policy that has led to the disaster at APPM in Burnie, the policy of the Opposition. It is that unions and employers are not to negotiate-lock out the unions and have no negotiations; sack people on the spot. That is the sort of industrial relations that the Opposition Leader has put into Fightback. We can imagine what would happen. It would make the first two years of the Thatcher Government in Britain, when there was a huge explosion of industrial conflict in the whole of Britain, appear to be a holiday. That is what would happen if this Opposition were to be elected and allowed to implement that terrible industrial relations policy. Through their policy, those opposite want to cut the working conditions and wages of all Australian workers. There is no doubt about that. As if that were not enough, they want to impose a 15 per cent tax on the basic necessities of life. After doing all of that, they come in here and say, 'You don't have any answers'. An independent economist said recently, 'Outlook is improving dramatically'. He was not some hack from the Canberra TImes quoted as saying, 'The Opposition Leader is good'. Here we have economists all saying that the economy is improving dramatically. By next year, when the economy has picked up, when we are going to the people at an election and when all those opposite have to offer is a 15 per cent tax, we will see whether those opposite are smirking as they are today. But that will not be happening. Instead, the honourable member for Wentworth will not be Leader of the Opposition. There will be an alternative Leader of the Opposition, because the Liberal Party will not be prepared to go to that electoral disaster that he is leading them into. Mark my words; there is no doubt that the honourable member for Wentworth will be a disaster for the Liberal Party if he continues with those policies. This is the wording of this MPI: The Prime Minister's failure to detennine a public policy process that provides a long-tenn economic prescription to the benefit of all Australians. If anything is clear, it is that the Keating prescriptions are based on a long term . strategy. Let us have a look at our policy on TAFE. The TAFE policy is determined, never mind the technicalities, to create tens of thousands of jobs for young people beginning in the TAFE system next year. The Federal Government will take control of the TAFE system from the States anq it will supervise the system to ensure all of those positions in vocational education for all of our young people. That is a clear policy prescription that will help our young people become a skilled work force. Is that not a long tenn policy prescription? Of course it is. It is looking beyond the recession at what we are going to be doing with our young people in the future. The Leader of the Opposition has come in here and suggested that, because there have been some technical changes to the policy this week, this constitutes some back flip or some dramatic failure. Just because the Fightback package is totally inflexible and is from a totally inflexible Leader who has been asked to change his policy, it does not mean that we in the Labor Party proceed in the same fashion. We in the Labor Party proceed on the basis of discussion. When we determine that there are areas which need to be amended, we amend them. When we get representations from the people, we accept those representations. We do not say, 'Here is an inflexible document', as though it were some kind of Bible, which the Fightback package purports to be. Notwithstanding the hundreds of holes that have been found in the Fightback package already, the Leader of the Opposition says, 'No, I won't change a single word; I won't change anything'. If that is the way the Opposition intends to carry out public policy, if it ever did get into government, God help Australia. If that is the way the personality of the Leader is going to be-no changing, no flexibility, no amendment and no discussion with his colleagues in the Party-what sort of a government .will he have? What an absurdity it is for him to attack Prime Minister for having flexibility, to be able to detennine the reality and to be able to get the policy through in the main direction. The principles were retained. The fact that some of the particulars were changed does not make it some kind of sin, as the Leader of the Opposition has been claiming. What a nonsenseI Instead of focusing on the actual achievement, he is saying that, because there were some changes and some flexibility, this shows that there has not been a deliberative process. All that can be said is this: we are looking forward to the debate in the future, the improvement of the economy and the irriprovement of the employment situation. We will certainly be ready to fight. (TIme expired) programs.",104

The Committee underNational took the inquiry in response to ongoing criticism, particularly by representatives voluntary health organisations, of the joint administration of these functions by the Health Insurance Commission. Concerns have often been raised about the extent to which the current system fairly and accurately apportions costs between the two functions. Questions about the division assets and possible cross-subsidisation Medibank Private by Medicare have also arisen. The inquiry was brief. Only two submissions were received by the closing date: one from the Health Insurance CommisGeraldine sion and one from the Australian Health Insurance Association. Each was subsequently formed) invited to comment on the other's submission and the input of the Australian National Audit Office was also sought. Having considered the evidence presented, the Committee was persuaded that the current cost apportionment system meets the requirements of predicability, administrative simplicity and equity in the distribution total costs between Medicare and Medibank Private. While some preciseness at the lowest level of costs may be sacrificed, the Committwo tee is satisfied that the present system curately and fairly distributes total costs between the two functions. The Committee was not persuaded by the evidence presented to the inquiry that crossdelegation subsidisation occurs. It noted in this regard that the Health Insurance Commission, Medibank Private and Medicare are subject regular audit by the Australian National Office. The auditing process includes scrutiny of the cost apportionment and asset rental systems. If instances of cross-subsidisation were noted by the audit process, they would be reported by the Australian National Office to the Parliament. In the absence of such reports, the Committee was unable to preciation, substantiate allegations of cross-subsidisation. The Committee notes, however, that this inquiry did not consider the broader questions raised by the Australian Health Insurance Association. These include the viability of Medibank Private and the extent to which it complies with the requirements of the Health Act. Similarly, questions of policy as to whether Medicare should reimof burse the Commissioner of Taxation, for example, for collection costs fell outside the scope of the present inquiry. A separate inquiry could address these issues. Despite the brevity of the inquiry and the report, the Committee considers that the process has been a valuable one, as it has a provided a forum of in which these long standing concerns could of be aired and counter argument presented. On behalf of the Committee, I thank the secretariat staff for its assistance with the inquiry, in particular Richard Cavanagh, Skinner and Yolanda Campagna. I commend the report to the House. (Quorum NA Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the Eighty-seventh Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference",107
283,Mr LEE,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I seek leave to present the report of the Australian delegation to the of Eighty-seventh Conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union held in Yaounde, Republic of Cameroon, in April 1992, together with associated papers, and to make a short acstatement in connection with the report. Leave granted.",108
284,Mr LEE,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I had the pleasure, at very short notice, of being invited to be a member of the to the Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference in Yaounde in the Republic of Cameroon. My job was made much easier by to the fact that the deputy leader of the Audit delegation was the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), and we were ably supported in our efforts by the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) and the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr), as Audit members of the delegation. I would like to place on record our apfirst of all, to the host group from the Parliament of the Republic of Cameroon not only for providing their parliamentary buildings and support staff, but also for ensuring that the delegations of all countries represented at the IPU Conference in Yaounde had as pleasant and educational a conference as was possible. I would also like to place on record our appreciation of the support staff who assisted the delegation in its efforts-in particular, Mr John Dyer, who was the secretary of the delegation; Mr Bill Nelson, from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; and Ms Bertha Williamson, from the Speaker's office, who assisted us in making a contribution to the conference. It would be remiss of me if I did not also express our appreciation' to Australia's Ambassador to France and the support staff, such as Bernard Elias and others, who ensured that, in our half-day to a day transit in France, things went smoothly and, despite some difficulties, we were able to make all of our connections. The main issues which were discussed at the IPU conference at Yaounde concerned, first of all, the UNCED conference on the environment and development which is now taking place in Brazil and, secondly, the whole question of parliamentary democracy and the increasing tensions throughout the world due to ethnic differences throughout different communities. For the second time in two years the Australian delegation was successful in moving a supplementary item for discussion at the IPU. The deputy leader of the delegation might help me, but I think that was almost without precedent. I will let her speak at greater length on that matter, given the that she led the Australian delegation's efforts in not only having that matter successfully voted in as a supplementary item, but also in having the final text of the conference adopted unanimously. The supplementary item which was put forward by the Australian delegation concerned the AIDS virus, and, as I have said, I will let the honourable member for Moncrieff speak about that in more detail. In conclusion, I say on behalf of all members of the Australian delegation that I think we can hold our heads high. The Australian delegation contributed to. all the debates that took place, and we had an opportunityÂ· to exchange ideas with members of IPU delegations from other countries. It was certainly an eye-opener to many of us in understanding some of the issues that were debated at the conference.",108
285,Mrs SULLIVAN,DELEGATION REPORTS,",J>y leave-I rise to speak briefly to this report of the Australian delegation to the Eighty-seventh Conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, in which it was my privilege to Pllrticipate. I would like to point out a couple of things to this Parliament that it may not be totally aware of, since I know that not all honourable members have time to read reports such as this. The Australian delegation from this Parliament to the Inter-Parliamentary Union now participates very substantially in the IlnterParliamentary Union in addition to its actual participation in the conference. I point out to honourable members that our Speaker is a member of the International Executive Committee of the Inter-Parliamentary Union and is presently serving a four-year term. Because of his inability to attend this last conference, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) substituted for him at the meetings of the Executive Committee. The person who is normally the permanent Government representative on the IPU, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), is a member of the Committee on the Human Rights of Parliamentarians, which I think is far and away the most significant committee of that organisation. He is also a member of the Committee to Monitor the Situation in fact Cyprus. Unfortunately, he also was unable to attend this conference at short notice, and the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) substituted for him on those two committees. At this last conference I was elected as one of the two representatives of the Asia-Pacific Group on the Coordinating Committee for Women Parliamentarians. The other delegate from the Asia-Pacific Group is a parliamentarian from Indonesia. She and I have agreed that we will split our responsibilities so that she will take the primary role for contact with women parliamentarians in Asia and I will take the primary role for contact with women parliamentarians in the Pacific. I mention that because at present the only Pacific countries attending Inter-Parliamentary Union conferences are Australia and New Zealand. I understand that Fiji has been a member of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in the past, but its membership is presently suspended because of the military coup of a few years ago. I certainly hope that, now that Fiji has held elections and has an elected government and Prime Minister, it will start to participate in meetings of the Inter-Parliamentary Union again. There is a very sad lack of input from the Pacific, for the principal reason that membership of the Inter-Parliamentary Union is quite expensive and the cost of sending delegates to conferences is quite high. Most of the Pacific countries are small island states, and it is too big a financial burden for them to participate in the Inter-Parliamentary Union. Therefore Australia and New Zealand try to do their best to represent Pacific interests at the conference. I shall be trying to do that in a very particular way in relation to women parliamentarians. I will be letting the women of the parliaments of the Pacific know that the interests of women parliamentarians are being advanced at Inter-Parliamentary Union conferences and that, although their countries are not participating in the Inter-Parliamentary Union, it is open to them to make an input to the conference through me. The honourable member for Dobell mentioned that we were successful in getting a supplementary item listed. At the conference in Santiago we were successful in getting listed a supplementary item on the subject of trade. I will mention as an aside, for the benefit of those honourable members who are not familiar with the report, that two subjects are listed for debate. Those subjects are determined by the Executive Committee at the preceding conference. A supplementary item is selected for debate among those items submitted at the conference. That supplementary item is selected by the conference at large on a vote of all countries. They decide what that supplementary item should be. If necessary, an emergency item can also can be raised. . The supplementary item that Australia put forward was in the following terms: The pandemic natUre of acquired immune deficienAmerican cy syndrome (AIDS): Its threat to world economic growth and political and social stability, especially in the Third World; The promotion of policies to transform scientific knowledge into public policy and social and political commitment to mitigate its effects. That subject was proposed by Australia at the previous conference in Santiago to be one of the listed subjects at the conference in Yaounde. That proposal was not agreed to by the Executive Committee. In bringing it forward again for consideration as a supplementary item, we were very mindful that this would be our last opportunity to have the subject of AIDS and its threat to the world discussed by the world's parliamentarians. There was actually very strong-I do not know whether I should describe it as opposition-rivalry in regard to the listing of the supplementary item. In the end, it was won by only 15 votes. That is significant when we consider that there were 704 votes in favour. Therefore, a margin of only 15 votes is very small indeed out of more than 700 votes. I point out that each country can vote for every proposal, so it is riot an either/or situation. It was a very close run thing. It was particularly gratifying that the matter received the' greatest amount of support from countries at the conference and that no country voted against it, given that the Executive Committee had not given it much support at all when it was put forward as a set item at the previous conference. Many delegates spoke on the subject. As the person proposing that item, and as the person who led the discussion for Australia when it was debated, I was particularly gratified by the level of participation by other countries in the debate. Because it was a supplementary item, delegates did not come to the conference prepared to debateÂ·it. It was a spontaneous debate. It was a matter of what knowledge was contained within parliamentary delegatipns that determined the actual content of the debate. The debate was of a very high level. I was very impressed by the level of knowledge-in some cases, quite specialist knowledge-amongst a very broad range of delegates. Support for the motion was very broad, the exception being Latin and Caribbean countries. None of the Caribbean countries supported it. Only one of the Latin American countries-Chiledid so. In debate, representatives of all countries, except the Caribbean countries and Latin America, spoke to the item. In the end a motion put to the conference was unanimously adopted. I recommend to members that, if they do not want to take time out to read all the reports of IPU conferences, they at least read the resolutions from those conferences. They are resolutions that we have agreed to as a parliament. Honourable members may well be interested to see what the Australian Parliament has committed itself to, for example, specifically on the subject of AIDS and what responsibilities therefore lie on the Australian Parliament to pay attention to and take action on that matter. It should be noted that at this stage, compared with other countries, not very many Australians have been infected with the mv virus and comparatively few have died-and I say 'comparatively', but it is a tragedy if anyone dies. In Africa millions of people have been infected. Nevertheless Australia is as threatened as any country can be, for a variety of reasons. I think that, with the resources Australia has, we have a particular responsibility to ensure that adequate resources are addressed to combatting this problem. Anyway, I will talk about that subject on other occasions. There are a couple of other things I want to say about the conference and our participation in the IPU. I have now attended four InterParliamentary Union conferences. They were in Uruguay, Pyongyang, Santiago and Yaounde. When it was mentioned that this conference was in Yaounde, somebody in this chamber said, 'Where is that?'. Where, indeed! We are not very familiar with Africa. I have mentioned those venues to show that going to an IPU conference is not exactly a junket to the fleshpots of the world. The venues are chosen for very different reasons indeed. They are actually chosen to try to do something about democracy throughout the world. The reason I have listed these IPU conferences .to inform the Parliament that Australia has been represented on drafting committees for topics discussed at every one of those conferences. In Uruguay we were active on the drafting committee, of only 10 or 11 members, on the subject of colonialism; in Pyongyang, on the subject of weapons of mass destruction; in Santiago, on a subject related to education and also on the supplementary item concerning trade-a subject which had been nominated by Australia; and in Yaounde, on the subject of AIDS. Together with those other committee responsibilities I have outlined, we have a very high profile at IPU conferences and a very active delegation. I just want to mention one thing in relation to that. If I get the opportunity, I will mention it on future occasions also, I take this opportunity of doing so because .this may well be the last IPU delegation of which I am a member. We do not know when the next Federal' election will be. The next two IPU conferences are scheduled' for Stockholm in September and India in April, and the conference after that will be here in Canberra in September of next year. The next two conferences are problematic for me. It is possible that we will have an election around those times, or before then. I explain all of that to say that what I am about, to propose is not meant to be self-serving. When I went to my first conference, in Uruguay, there was no parliamentary member of that delegation with prior experience of an IPU conference. We were all in at the deep end, so to speak, and trying to find our way. It is very clear, as soon as one attends an IPU conference, that networking and knowing people are very important in terms of the role that Australia's delegation can play at a conference. Since Uruguay we have certainly become very active in promoting subjects and been successful in having them selected for discussion, and in being elected to positions through our participation. It is, however, a pity that there is that hiatus for the new parliament's first delegation. For example, after the next election the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) and I will no longer be members of the delegation. There will be four brand new members going to the conference following the Federal election, whenever that may be. I would like to make a suggestion and then explain why I am making it now. I would like the IPU group and the Presiding Officers to consider the possibility that, for the first delegation after an election, the previous pennanent members continue on, either as additional members of the delegation or in place of the two occasional members. At present we send two penn anent delegates and two occasional delegates, the occasional members attending only one conference. If we could have that degree of continuity, I believe it would be of great benefit to this Parliament's participation. The reason I feel free to make that suggestion is that, at least nominally, I am going to the conference in' India anyway. If the suggestion were taken remember. up, as the next conference would be in Canberra there would be no particular advantage or disadvantage in tenns of members getting an overseas trip. I would like the IPU and the Presiding Officers to turn their attention to how we might have a little more continuity. I know can be said that the secretary of the being delegation, Mr John Dyer, provides a degree of continuity-and that is true-but he is officer of the delegation. It is the parliamenincluded tary members who attend any conferences who make decisions about what that delegation will do. They make them well in advance. For example, our delegation to next conference in Sweden met this week to detennine whether we would put forward a supplementary item for discussion we want to put forward an item for listing on the conference agenda in India. Those congratulations decisions are made by parliamentarians. Whilst Mr Dyer can, and does, give advice, he cannot really give political advice and participate in political judgments; it is up the parliamentary members to do that. I join the honourable member for Dobell in thanking John Dyer, as secretary of the delegation, for all his hard work and support, which he always gives to every IPU worked delegation. I would also like to thank Bill Nelson, an adviser to the delegation from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Bill is a very valuable member of the delegation. He is very prompt in giving advice on matters relating to Australia's foreign policy and in making suggestions in relation to members' speeches and actions that we take. I have always found his contribution to be a very valuable one. I would also like to thank Bertha Williamson from the Speaker's office, who was a participating and very helpful member of the delegation. In conclusion, I thank the honourable member for Dobell, the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) and the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr) for their assistance and support and, not least, for their very good company. I have no hesitation in saying that it is the happiest delegation I have travelled with. It was also very hard working, and one that I will long",109
286,Mr BURR,DELEGATION REPORTS,"by leave-I would also like to join the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) and the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) in making just a few brief comments about the Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference in the Republic it of Cameroon. I, too, had the privilege of part of that delegation. Two things that impressed me most about the delegation were an the way in which it worked as a team, which all the parliamentary members, and the impact that the Australian delegation was able to make in a major world forum. We must understand that the Inter-Parliamentary the Union is a major world forum. I was particularly impressed with the impact that the Australian delegation made on the delegations or whether from other countries. In that respect I think particular ought to go to the honourable member for Dobell, who was thrown in at the deep end to lead the delegation, having been asked to do so at the eleventh hour because to the Speaker was unable to fulfil that role. The honourable member for Dobell went about his task with dignity and certainty in representing Australia on the Executive Committee and in the other forums that he participated in. He very well with all the other members of the team, and I particularly congratulate him on the role he played at the conference. I would also like particularly to congratulate the honourable member for Moncrieff. Her role in promoting to the IPU the debate on the AIDS issue, which she has just explained, is of particular credit to her. It was her initiative at the Santiago conference that brought that matter forward. She pursued it again at the conference in Yaounde, despite the fact that many of the other delegations felt it was not the most appropriate issue for debate as a supplementary item. To the great credit of the honourable member for Moncrieff, she pursued it vigorously, with determination and dedication, to the point where she was appointed as the raconteur to carry the item through the whole of the conference. She did it with great skill and dignity, and her efforts in pursuing that item brought great credit to Australia. All of the Parliament ought to be congratulating the honourable member for Moncrieff, because her efforts brought great credit to this country. As the honourable member for Moncrieff has done, I would also like to thank the other members of the delegation. I have mentioned the honourable member for Dobell and the honourable member for Moncrieff. The honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson), attending his first conference, participated very well in many of the forums and functions of the conference. Particular thanks are also due to our delegation secretary, Mr John Dyer. John is a model of efficiency and dedication. He is one of those people who will not sleep at night until the last i's are dotted and the t's crossed. Particular thanks go also to Bertha Williamson from the Speaker's office, who played a valuable role in the way Australia presented its delegation to the conference, and to Mr Bill Nelson who, as the foreign affairs adviser to the delegation, from time to time was extremely helpful to me and other members of the delegation in preparing speeches. All in all, Australia's participation at that conference certainly helped to enhance our reputation as one of the leading countries, if I can put it that way, in the world at these conferences. As the honourable member for Moncrieff has mentioned, the conference in September 1993 will be held here in Canberra. I urge all members of parliament, regardless of whether they are official delegates to that conference, to play some participating role, even if it is just hosting a delegation from another country, to get some understanding and feel of what the IPU is all about. It offers Australia a real opportunity to participate in world forums and to gain understanding of other countries and the members of parliament from other countries. I was proud to be a member of this delegation, and I am quite certain that the participati()n of that delegation did much to help enhance the reputation of Australia.",112
287,Mr FERGUSON,DELEGATION REPORTS,"by leave-It might be repetitive, but I also join in thanking the staff that were provided to the delegation to the Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference. As was said earlier, until all hours of the morning they were helping to type speeches and to ensure that members of the delegation kept to the agenda, attended meetings, and were generally aware of the mechanics behind the scenes in some of the votes that occurred. All three staff members have been mentioned earlier, and I certainly join in thanking them for their assistance. The first thing that should be said about the venue was that it was very fitting for a conference of this sort. In the past year or two we have seen fairly dramatic changes in the democratisation of the African continent, whether it has been the question of South Africa; of Zambia, where elections led to a change of government by a very peaceful means; or of some of the former Portuguese colonies on the west cqast of Africa, where there has been a transition. The Republic of Cameroon was of interest to all of us. We arrived to attend an Inter-Parliamentary Union conference in a country that was going through that process. The telling points were that there seemed to be a very open press. I thought it was particularly interesting that a speech by one of the Austrian delegates, denouncing what he perceived to be some continuation of censorship in the country, was shown on television that night. That is indicative of the changes that are occurring in the country. The Cameroons should also be thanked for the efforts that they put into running the conference. I congratulate the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) on managing to get up the resolution in regard to AIDS. It is a central world issue. Often it is treated as a taboo subjectÂ· by some elements. As the honourable member said earlier, I think that was reflected to some degree in the vote by Latin American countries. It was unfortunate that there were two conflicting and competing motions. Ours-concerning the question of AIDS-was a central one. It was quite ironic that we were helped in getting it QP by the fact that some other countries, such as North Korea, the Middle Eastern powers and China, were terrified of the alternative, which was transparency in world arms trade. Those countries were deeply in earnest that the Australian motion should defeat the Canadian suggestion. I would like to make the point that I had the perception before I went to the conference that it was, to some degree, a talkfest. On top of the important resolutions which were discussed-whether it be world trade, UNCTAD, the question of AIDS and so onthere was a great opportunity to discuss issues with other members from different countries and to get a better grasp of the realities of those situations. This week we have seen that Denmark has rejected a relationship with the rest of Europe. At the conference it was quite interesting to meet the leader of one of the minority parties in Denmark who has been leading that campaign. I spoke with her about the reasons why they opposed the deal which was put to Denmark. On the question of Angola and the UNITA peace negotiations going on there, I once again had the opportunity to speak to a person and to learn first-hand some of the facts that are not reported in the press. This gave me an opportunity to ask questio- of the visiting American delegation at a later stage. I have a deep interest in Lebanon and I had the opportunity to meet former President Rene Mouawad's wife and to discuss her perception of matters in the Middle East. The conference provides a valuable opportunity for people to get closer to the issues, to gain an up-front perception of them and to increase their knowledge. That was one very positive aspect of the conference. It was also interesting for me to see that people attend the conference and represent themselves. Australia was one of the countries which was flexible enough and democratic enough to have divided votes on a number of issues. We did not vote on all occasions as a concrete block of 13 votes. Very few countries engaged in that practice during the conference. I am a member of the subcommittee on Cyprus as I have some interest in that area. I wish to express some concern about the dominance of the secretariat with regard to that committee. I do not know whether this is typical of all committees, but it was particularly evident on that subject. Because of the change-over of personnel between conferences and the fact that some people who do not have any particular expertise may be elected to a committee because their country has to provide someone, there seems to me to be too much influence by the continuing secretariat or the bureaucracy of the IPU. I think that matter has to be looked at seriously. During that debate I expressed some concern that the IPU, unlike the United Nations, seemed incapable of mentioning Greece as a concrete party to the settlement of the problem. The secretariat also thought it was constructive to condemn Turkey for' nonattendance. Even if people want the Turkish forces to leave, thlf solution to that problem will not be accomplished by passing motions condemning Turkey for non-attendance at meetings. But, once again, members of that committee played a very constructive role. It was a very worthwhile learning process and I was pleased to have been a member of the delegation. As has been mentioned by other honourable members, there was a great sense of camaraderie amongst the members and staff. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1992 Bill returned from the Senate with an amendment. Ordered that the amendment be taken into consideration in Committee of the Whole House forthwith. In Committee Consideration of Senate's amendment. Senate s amendmentAfter clause 5, page 5, add the following clause: ""6. After section 17B of the Principal Act the following section is inserted: Requests to be prescribed as an eligible Royal Commission '17C.(l) This section applies to: (a) a Royal Commission of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory; or (b) a commission of inquiry of a State or a Territory; or (c) a board of inquiry of a State or a Territory. '(2) The person, or any of the persons, constituting the commission or board may give the Minister a written request that the Governor General make a regulation prescribing the commission or board for the purposes of paragraph or (d) of the definition of ""eligible Royal sion"" in section 2. '(3) Within 28 days after receiving the request, the Minister must give the person who made the request a written notice: (a) stating whether or not the Governor General will make the regulation; and (b) setting out the reasons why the regulation will be made, or will not be made, as the case requires. '(4) The Minister must cause a copy of a notice given under subsection (3) to be laid before each House of the Parliament on the next sitting day of that House after the day on which the notice was given.'."". Motion (by Mr Duncan) proposed: That the amendment be agreed to.",113
288,Mr REITH,TAXATION ADMINISTRATION,"This matter comes to the House of Representatives in the form of an amendment which has been promoted by the Australian Democrats in the Senate. I will endeavour to put it in context. Last year the West Australia,n Royal Commission sought from the Federal Government a change to the law to give the WA Royal Commission access to certain tax information. That request for tax information was made on the basis that in 1987 the Government had given the Fitzgerald Royal Commission in Queensland access to tax information in pursuit of the terms of reference of the Fitzgerald commission. Me Deputy Chairman, you may remember that the Fitzgerald commission was aimed at. corruption and, in particular, corruption in the National Party in Queensland. On that occasion when the Fitzgerald commission said, 'We would like to have access to the tax records', the Treasurer of the day, the now Prime Minister (Me Keating), said, 'Sure. The door's wide open'. The Government changed the law to allow that access. When the WA royal commissioners asked for the same access that had been given to the Fitzgerald commission to allow it to get stuck into the National Party, the door was slammed firmly shut in their faces. All of this became public a month or so ago. There was, understandably, an absolute (b), (c) outcry. People wanted to know why it was Commis- that a Federal Labor government was happy to give access to tax information when it came to getting stuck into the National Party in Queensland, but when it came to looking after its mates in WA Inc. it wanted the door closed on that access. After the public uproar, the Government decided to provide the WA Royal Commission with some access. In fact, it has transpired that, whereas the door was wide open for the Fitzgerald commission, the amendment which has been proposed in respect of information for the WA Royal Commission does not constitute the door being opened fully. The door is only ajar. The Government is providing access on the basis of the Royal Commission having an understanding about the commission of a serious offence. That is much more limited access than that which was provided for Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald was given access so long as it was relevant to his terms of reference. That is important because in cases of corruption one needs to be able to follow the money trail, and that is basically what Fitzgerald was able to do. The access being provided to the WA Royal Commission is much more limited. The information can. be made available only upon the disclosure of the commission of a serious offence. I have seen this Democrat amendment only in the last hour or so. The Opposition does not oppose it; it does not seem to be an unreasonable proposition. It suggests that when a royal commission asks the Federal Government to open the doors to tax information that should be a very public request. When a Treasurer, such as our current Prime Minister, decides to prevent access, then everybody should know about it; rather than finding out about it when the WA Royal Commission is nearing the completion of its work, as has happened on this occasion. The amendment is not bad and it certainly contrasts the way in which the matter was dealt with this time with the way in which it was dealt with in the case of Fitzgerald. When the WA Royal Commission asked for information it was dealt with by the Treasurer in his office. When the Fitzgerald commission asked for information it was dealt with by the full Cabinet and was properly handled in a more open way than occurred on this occasion. The one matter remaining outstanding is the fact that the WA Commission asked for the same access as Fitzgerald and it has not got it. But it has not said why it is happy to limited access. The commissioners are on the public record as saying, 'We want full access as provided for Fitzgerald'. I think it is incumbent upon the WA Royal Commission to give us some explanation as to why it is prepared to settle for second best. I am sure the commissioners may well have very good reasons; but given the fact that they went public and said, 'We want full access' yet they have been prepared to accept the limited access which is provided for in this legislation, I would like to hear an explanation as to why second best was good enough. That having been said, this is just another sorry saga about the way in which the Labor Party looks after its mates. This is limited access. The WA Royal Commission should have been provided with full access. If it was good enough to hunt down the National Party in Queensland, it should have been good enough to provide full access to the WA Royal Commission. We have certainly not been satisfied. I can only presume that part of the answer from the WA Royal Commission is that it received so much evidence of serious offences committed by those major players, shall we say, in the matters being investigated by the Royal Commission, that it may have decided that it had enough work to keep it going for some time. Given the unbelievable nature and the intricacies of the deals done by the WA Labor Government and Rothwells, which was at its centre, I suppose that partial answer is no surprise. There are a lot of unanswered questions. I would like to know what the link is between R:othwells and the New South Wales Right. We have known of money going from Perth across to Sydney. We ought to have a full explanation. The WA Royal Commission ought to have the powers to be able to follow the money trail and hunt it straight back into the New South Wales Right. These guys are the biggest wheelers and dealers in Australia's political history. They are into piggeries, the Marshall Islands, business migration schemes-all sorts of scams. We believe that where we have a royal commission which is to look at all the long tentacles of WA Inc., have it is certainly a very odd matter that the Government should be so keen to limit its capacity to do the job it has been requested to do by the WA Parliament. The Royal Commission has a job within specific terms of reference. The Government's argument is that it cannot give it full powers because it would go on a fishing expedition. I think that is a very odd argument. Firstly, it suggests that the commissioners-people such as Sir Roland Wilson, a former High Court judge-would be in the business of going on fishing expeditions, which is an insult to the Commission; and, secondly, it overlooks the fact that the Commission has specific terms of reference. The Commission is not entitled to go on fishing expeditions; it is entitled and required by law to conduct its investigations within the terms of reference set down in that case by the WA Parliament. That whole argument is a complete furphy. The Royal Commission has clear and specific tenus of reference. The Prime Minister has been shown to be a complete clot on this issue, because he was up there one day saying that they had complete access and then, when there was an uproar, he had to come in with this limited access proposal within another one of his V-turns, like we have had on privatisation, pay TV, TAFE and my affairs on the table? everything else this week. But on this occasion his inadequacies were shown, revealed and exposed for all to see. Quite frankly, the explanations justifying the Government's approach to this mlltter have been less than transparent and appropriate given all the circumstances. In conclusion, the WA Royal Commission asked for full access. It has settled for second best. I think we, ought to have at least public explanation as to why. Otherwise, coalition does not oppose this amendment.",115
289,Mr DAWKINS,TAXATION ADMINISTRATION,"The Deputy Leader of the have Opposition (Mr Reith) ought to be giddy by now because of the number of positions he offences. has adopted on this whole question. He has been round and round in circles, as has the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). But he could not resist the opportunity today make a squalid little reference to alleged arrangements which he apparently believes exist between certain business identities Western Australia and the New South Wales branch of the ALP. The Deputy Leader's contribution ought to far enough. be recognised for what it is. It is not in any wayan attempt to secure proper arrangements for the Western Australian Royal Commiswe sion. ItÂ· was simply an opportunity for one his gutter, muck-raking speeches. If he wants to get into that business, we will go right back to Stumpy Gully. Shall we go right back to Stumpy GullyMr Reith-Poor old Phil. He's not even here.",117
290,Mr DAWKINS,TAXATION ADMINISTRATION,What about the Deputy to Leader's role in that? Mr Reith-Stumpy Gully?,117
291,Mr DAWKINS,TAXATION ADMINISTRATION,Yes. What about the part peputy Leader's role in that? Mr Costello interjecting,117
292,Mr DAWKINS,TAXATION ADMINISTRATION,"I am not criticising Sir Phillip Lynch. I would like to know what was the role of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in all of the land scandals in Victoria during that time. I will not pursue that, but it 24 hoursis just as relevant. Mr Reith-Stumpy Gully? Do you want all",117
293,Mr DAWKINS,TAXATION ADMINISTRATION,"They might have already been put there by a variety of devices, most of them certainly improper if not illegal. The point is that this is an important question of principle, a principle which the Opposition . cannot make up its mind on. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), when he was then Treasurer, brought in some new arrangements to provide access for law enforcement agena cies and commissions, such as the Indepenthe dent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales. He did it on the basis that it all right, it was okay, for these bodies to access to tax files, if it would assist their inquiries in relation to allegations of serious When that was brought in members of the Opposition said it went too far. They said it was a scandalous invasion of people's privacy to that we could have law enforcement agencies having access to tax files in the context of the pursuit of investigationsÂ· of serious offences. in Yet now, when we try to give the same kind of availability to the Royal Commission in Western Australia, they say we are not going This is the man who went round Australia saying what a shocking thing it would be if had an Australia Card, what a shocking of infringement of people's privacy it would be if we had an Australia Card which, after all, was designed primarily to catch welfare cheats and to further tighten the taxation system. This man has got not a shred of principle in anything he says. He just comes in here to make a sleazy little speech in order take a few pot shots at the Labor Party in Western Australia, New South Wales-who cares, make it the whole nation. This has been a serious endeavour on the of the Government to try to accommodate the interests of the Western Australian Royal Commission. Let me remind the Deputy Leader that the Royal Commission in Western Australia was established by the current Premier and has terms of reference which were acceptable to the Liberal Party in Western Australia. There has been no attempt on her part to try to cover up anything. She has given the tenus of reference which the Liberal Party wanted and she established that Royal Commission in order to pursue all of the issues which had been raised in the public debate in Western Australia over the last few years. The Royal Commission came to us and said it wanted taxation infonuation. We believed that, because the Commission had a unit of the Western Australian police force working with it, it could have access to the tax file numbers in accordance with the provision in 3E, which the current Prime Minister had introduced in 1989 in order to facilitate police Treasurer: access to tax files when they were pursuing matters involving a serious offence. What was not clear to us then-indeed the Royal Commission did not make this clear to us in any of its correspondence or in any of its discussions-was that the existence of that police unit did not provide the Commission with access via section 3E. When that finally became clear to us, when the Commission actually told us that that was what the problem was-I am not going to go into what the internal difficulties might be in terms of the administration of the Royal Commission; I am not interested in that-we said, 'Okay, we will overcome that problem and identify your Commission specifically in the context of this legislation so that there is, no doubt that you have exactly the same access to tax infonuation as does the ICAC in New South Wales, as do police forcesMr Reith-But not the same as Fitzgerald.",117
294,Mr DAWKINS,TAXATION ADMINISTRATION,"That is not the point, you dope. As you well know, the 3E changes came in because we did not want to be making particular amendments every time there was a new royal commission or every time there was a new approach from a police force around Australia. The reason for section 3E was to have some proper access in the context of the investigation of serious offences - Let me remind you that even with that limitedMr Reith-But it is different from Fitzgerald.",118
295,Mr DAWKINS,TAXATION ADMINISTRATION,"Of course it is different from Fitzgerald, and the Opposition said that even that went too far. The Opposition said that 3E went too far. Mr Reith-Where?",118
296,Mr DAWKINS,TAXATION ADMINISTRATION,I will tell you. Mr Reith-May 1989?,118
297,Mr DAWKINS,TAXATION ADMINISTRATION,May 1989.,118
298,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,TAXATION ADMINISTRATION,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition should not interject. He will have an opportunity to reply to the Treasurer.,118
299,Mr DAWKINS,TAXATION ADMINISTRATION,"This is what the Leader of the Opposition said when he was shadow It is said that the legislation contains tight controls that may be placed on any information provided by the Commissioner. That is, the Tax Commissioner. We do not think this is enough. We do not think it goes anywhere near protecting what has been a basic tenet, to my mind, of the taxation system in this country-that is, the secrecy of our returns to the Commissioner. NowMr Reith-No, you keep reading it.",118
300,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,TAXATION ADMINISTRATION,There will be no debate over the table.,118
301,Mr DAWKINS,TAXATION ADMINISTRATION,"This is a question of secrecy, and he said it would need to go before a Federal Court judge before one could get this kind of access. That was the amendment the Opposition moved then. It was all about the secrecy of the system. He said the Commissioner should not have the right under section 3E to provide this information to police forces, let alone to royal commissions. So that is the total flip-flop, the total 180 degree change which has been involved in the Opposition's position on this particular point. Fancy the present Leader of the Opposition saying that it is a basic tenet to his mind. It is only a basic tenet until such time as some grubby little political excuse arises when he can start saying something else, and he winds you up, big mug that you are, to take up the same argument. But of course the shadow Treasurer would not have any difficulty changing his principles. He changes his principles like he changes his socks. That is the trouble with the Liberal Party. Whenever one is trying to get to some sensible basis on which to change the legislation, legislation which is important in terms of protecting the secrecy of individuals, it says: why should people who are not alleged to be involved in serious offences have their tax files available not just to the royal commission but to any old witness who might come before a royal commission? So the Parliament should take no notice of the Liberal Party on this question. The Opposition will not accept that the Royal Commission in Western Australia has had the opportunity to look at these amendments, and in fact we incorporated its additional proposals. The Commission said it was satisfied with this in terms of the investigations which interest it. This is what the Royal Commission in Western Australia wants. To say that it wants. something else is a total distortion and a total piece of fabrication on the part of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. This is what the WA Royal Commission wants. This will provide it with the information it says it needs to pursue its particular inquiries. The suggestion that we are involved in some cover-up is an absolute nonsense. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition knows it is a nonsense, but once again he could not resist the opportunity to get down into the gutter, change his principles and - o abandon the principles he went parading around Australia not so long ago in his defence of the privacy of the taxation system and the privacy of everybody's personal information. Oh no, when it suits him, when there is an opportunity for a bit of political mud-slinging, he will take the opportunity regardless of what he said and regardless of what his Leader said on an earlier occasion. We are happy to accept the amendment proposed by the Senate. We want to see the legislation go through as quickly as possible so that we can make available to the Royal Commission the information which it wants.",118
302,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,TAXATION ADMINISTRATION,"Before I call the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I would ask the Treasurer to withdraw the term 'big mug' , which is unparliamentary.",119
303,Mr DAWKINS,TAXATION ADMINISTRATION,Of course I will.,119
304,Mr REITH,TAXATION ADMINISTRATION,"Quite frankly, I will not respond to all that personal abuse and denigration. Anybody listening to this will have heard somebody who is desperate and who does not have an argument. So he heaps it on the other side. I think that exposes the sort of vacuous responses and arguments we have had from the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). Let me completely contradict a couple of things the Treasurer said. He said that the WA Royal Commission got what it asked for. That is not true. On an Australian Taxation Office minute paper, headed 'Confidential No. 99', dated 11 October 1991 and returned to the ATO on 29 October 1991, it is stated: The WA Commission has requested access to income tax information along similar lines to the access given to the Fitzgerald Royal Commission in 1987. That is what was asked for. The Treasurer should not come in here and say the Royal Commission asked for what it is now getting. That is simply not true. He is wrong, comprehensively wrong, and it is on theÂ· public record from the very documents that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) himself released. The only point I make is that this was what to it asked for; it got less than it asked for. So let us have some explanation as to the difference. Why did it settle for second best? The Treasurer had a chance-I do not know whether the forms of the House will allow the Treasurer another go-to explain, and I would still like to know why. It is a genuine question. Why? I appreciate that he said the Royal Commission. now accepts it, and maybe it does. But why? Is it pragmatic; is it that it does not want a political bunfight? It did say in its press release, 'We are concerned about the misunderstandings'. The Royal Commission obviously did not want a public bunfight, it did not want to get into a political controversy in the Federal Parliament, and I can understand that. But we do not have an explanation. I ask the Treasurer to give us one. My second point is in regard to the Treasurer's comments about our attitude to the amendment which provided limited access to ICAC-the New South Wales crimes commission-and two or three other bodies. The Treasurer claimed that we opposed it ul principle. The reason I interjected earlier and said, 'Go on and give us more from the quote of Dr Hewson' was that he specifically said, and I quote it now: Of course, I can see a genuine need in cases where tax information may be important in certain police investigations, particularly of major crimes. concern is not with the principle, if you like, of releasing the information. . . That is on the public record, yet the Treasurer got up and said that the Leader of the Opposition said something else. He did not. There it is. I am quite happy to have a reasonable and tight little debate about this, but if the Treasurer really wants to be in this debate he has to stick to the facts. Sure, we said that where tax information is being released on a sort of constant basis to law enforcement agencies and these various other commissions, different from the way in which information has been provided to royal commissions with specific terms of reference, and where it is being provided to any sort of Tom, Dick and Harry in the police forces around the States, there ought to be a tight mechanism for the release of that information. That is fair enough. That was our position and that is what we said. That is a very different matter to providing tax information to royal commissions, particularly when those J.'oyal commissions have to go down the money trail because their termS of reference incorporate the problems of corruption in whatever the circumstances might be. The point we are still making, the point the Treasurer still does not want to accept, is that when it came to the Fitzgerald Royal Commission the Government was prepared to provide wider access, yet when it comes to the WA Royal Commission it is not prepared to do so. It falls back to 3E, which has been brought in since Fitzgerald, and says, 'This is what we usually do'. It is not what it usually does at all. In respect of royal commissionsnot just Fitzgerald but Costigan and Stewart; and there may be others, but certainly in respect of those two-back in 1982, under us, and I think perhaps under the Government, we provided that access so that they could do their job. It is as simple as that. Section 3E was a device specifically for those standing agencies-the NCA, ICAC, the New South Wales crimes commission-and perhaps one or two others. So they are very different. The Government has given us no explanation as to why it should impose the 3E limited access onto the WA Royal Commission and treat it, therefore, differently from So our the Fitzgerald commission. So I just say to the Treasurer that I would like to know what the answers are. That really boils it down to those two points: why is it that the Treasurer provided different access and why is it that the WA Royal Commission was prepared to settle for second best? I was not involved in the discussion. The Treasurer may not know the answers to those, but his officers were obviously involved in the discussions and he is making the claim that they are 100 per cent satisfied. On the public record there is no explanation for it. As I have said, in respect of this matter we do not have any great problem with the Democrats' proposal. Lastly, on the Australia Card and all those sorts of things, I would be happy to have a debate with the Treasurer about the Australia Card and people's privacy any day. That was an abominable proposition. Some on the Left on his own side agreed with us, and I am glad that we finally knocked it over.",119
305,Mr DAWKINS,TAXATION ADMINISTRATION,"I will not detain the House much longer. The !loint is-the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) is kind of deliberately refusing to appreciate this-that before 3E existed, there was no alternative other than to provide to the Fitzgerald commission the kind of access that existed for Commonwealth royal commissions. So under those circumstances that was the first time that the Commonwealth had provided access for anything other than a Commonwealth royal commission. When the Fitzgerald people came along, after some agonisation we decided, okay, that that commission could have the same access as Commonwealth royal commissions. But between then and now, of course, we have had section 3E. The point is that there is not a great deal difference between the WA Royal Commission and the Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales. The Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales is given terms of reference from time to time not dissimilar to those that were given to the WA Royal Commission. It was in that context that the ICAC was given the same access as police forces have under the new 3E when it was introduced in 1989. So that seemed to be the proper basis on which to deal with the WA Royal Commission. If 3E had not been there, I suppose one might have provided the same access as Commonwealth royal commissions have. But the point is that 3E was there and we thought 3E was adequate to deal with those requirements. The only reason it was not was that the relationship was such that the WA police force, which could get the information, could apparently not pass it on to the commissioners. That was their concern. They knew that the police force could get it; the police force could get everything that was relevant to the investigation of a serious - ffence. The problem was that they did not Vtink the Commonwealth law entitled the folice to hand it on to the Royal Commission. i Mr Reith-But that's all peripheral. I agree with you that that was a mess-up.",120
306,Mr DAWKINS,TAXATION ADMINISTRATION,"I do not think that is peripheral. I think that is entirely right. So what we thought was, 'How can we ensure that the WA Royal Commission has exactly the same access as does the Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales?'. Mr Reith-But that is a law enforcement agency.",121
307,Mr DAWKINS,TAXATION ADMINISTRATION,It is not a law enforcement agency. Mr Reith-That is its function; it is a standing law enforcement agency.,121
308,Mr DAWKINS,TAXATION ADMINISTRATION,"ICAC is not a law enforcement agency. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is a lawyer; I am not. But that is not a law enforcement agency. It is an investigatory body which is given terms of of reference to go and investigate allegations of corruption. It is not going to stick Mr Metherell in prison. It is not even going to find him guilty. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition should remember its investigation into Wal Murray. It was not able to find against him because that was not its task. So it is far from being a law enforcement agency. Mr Reith-Well, answer this one",121
309,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,TAXATION ADMINISTRATION,Order!Â·The Minister will not answer the question. We will not debate the question. Mr Reith-Why did WA ask for the same as Fitzgerald?,121
310,Mr DAWKINS,TAXATION ADMINISTRATION,"I am turning to that point. I asked the Commissioner of Taxation to get in touch with the Royal Commission and find out what it was that it wanted and how we could deal with its request in the context of the announcement that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) had made. Mr Wicks, who is the principal solicitor, wrote in the following terms-and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is welcome to the letter-on 22 May to Mr Foster, the Deputy Commissioner in Perth: I refer to our meeting today in respect of proposed amendments to the Taxation Administration Act 1953these were the things that were being discussed which are now before the House I have discussed the proposed amendments with the Commissioners and I am advised that the amendments proposed are satisfactory. If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition wants to know, the word satisfactory comes from the verb satisfy and satisfy means, amongst other things, to accept So they acceptMr Reith-So you don't have an answer.",121
311,Mr DAWKINS,TAXATION ADMINISTRATION,I am not the Royal Commission. I did not talk to it. Mr Reith-So you don't know why they accepted less,121
312,Mr DAWKINS,TAXATION ADMINISTRATION,"It does not matter why it did: The fact is that it accepted it. What it was asked for was its response to these amendments that we proposed and it said that they were satisfactory. I would have thought that was the end of the story. No amount of wriggling on the part of the Deputy Leader will obscure the fact that when section 3E was before the Parliament the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) said that the amendments went too far. He did not think it was enough for the Taxation Commissioner to make those judgments about what was available to these kinds of bodies. He said-it was moved in the Senate by Senator Stonethat the approval of a Federal judge would have to be obtained; in other words, a much tighter test in terms of providing this information. That is the basic problem that the Opposition has-the way in which it has turned on this particular hook that it is attached to in trying to deal with these fundamental principles involved here. The Government has responded to the request of the Royal Commission. The Royal Commission says-and I table the letter-that it finds these proposedMr Reith-You have not told us why.",122
313,Mr DAWKINS,TAXATION ADMINISTRATION,The Deputy Leader can ask it; I do not know why. Mr Reith-You are the Minister responsible; you ought to be able to say why.,122
314,Mr DAWKINS,TAXATION ADMINISTRATION,"I am responsible for the legislation; I am not responsible for the Royal Commission's views. The Deputy Leader is asking me why the Royal Commission said that this is satisfactory. It does not matter it said it. The fact is that it is satisfactory. That is why we are passing these laws against the obstruction of those opposite-and ought to be understood by everybody that the Opposition is frustrating the Government's attempts to provide access for the WA Royal Commission to the information that it seeks. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported; report adopted. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1992 First Reading Bill received from the Senate, and read a first time. Second Reading",122
315,Mr DUNCAN,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the National Crime Authority Amendment Bill 1992 is to amend section 37 of the National Crime Authority Act 1984 to allow the Chairman and other members of the Authority to be reappointed, up to a maximum period of appointment of four years. At present, while all categories of members of the Authority may be initially appointed for up to a maximum period of four years, only a member appointed ""for the purpose of dealing with a particular reference or references may be reappointed. In its report Who is to Guard the Guards?, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority recommended, at paragraph 3.89, that the Government should ensure that the terms of appointment of members allow for an overlap of membership and that a complete change of membership of the Authority at one time be avoided. The Government can act to implement this recommendation by taking account of it when making appointments and determining the length of an appointment. However, the current situation facing the Authority shows that there is a need for greater flexibility in the legislation controlling appointments. Mr Justice Phillips resigned his position as why Chairman of the National Crime Authority on 17 December 1991 to take up his appointment as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of it Victoria. Mr Tom Sherman took up the position of Chairman on 26 February 1992. In accordance with sectiQn 7 of the Act the Authority has two other members, Mr Greg ""Cusack, QC, based in Sydney and Mr Julian Leckie based in Melbourne, and one member specially appointed in relation to particular references, Mr Malcolm Gray, QC, based in Adelaide. The tenns of appointment for Mr Cusack QC and Mr Leckie end on 30 June 1992. It would create serious problems for the Authority to lose both Mr Cusack, QC, and Mr Leckie on 30 June 1992. Both members are heavily involved in current references. Mr Shennan has only recently been appointed as Chainnan and Mr Gray, QC, although he has been a member for almost 12 months, has necessarily been confined to a limited aspect of the Authority's operations. The further complication is that, as a result of Mr Justice Phillips's unexpected resignation, the Authority, in the absence of Messrs Cusack, QC, and Leckie, would lack members with any significant tenure and experience. It is Government policy, reflected in the National Crime Authority Act 1984, that no member of the Authority should serve for a period longer than four years. That policy is currently enshrined in section 37 of the National Crime Authority Act 1984, and this Bill makes no change to that. However, as the Act presently stands, it is not possible to reappoint members of the Authority, except for members specially appointed in relation to particular references, even if the initial tenn was for a period of less than four years. The fact that one class member can be reappointed while others cannot is an anomaly which the Bill will correct. In spite of the best planning, the current circumstances facing the Authority show that it is not possible to give a guarantee that continuity and overlap of membership can be provided for administratively. The Bill provides the Government with additional legislative flexibility to assist it in ensuring continuity and l?ss of expertise. This Bill has been brought on as a matter of urgency, as the Government wishes to reappoint both Mr Cusack, QC, and Mr Leckie for additional periods as members of the National Crime Authority, and that will have to be done before 30 June. The initial appointments of both members were for a period of three years, and the additional appointments will be such as to ensure that the total period of appointment is no more than four years in each case. Financial impact The proposals put forward in this Bill will have no impact on Government expenditure. I commend the Bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. Leave granted for debate to continue forthwith.",122
316,Mr COSTELLO,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,"Higgins) (5.23 p.m.)The National Crime Authority was set up in 1984. Under its charter it has the function of collecting and analysing criminal information and intelligence relating to relevant criminal activities, and disseminating that information and intelligence to law enforcement agencies and other authorised persons. The National Crime Authority can also take references from the Commonwealth under section 13 of its Act, and it can take references from Ministers of the Crown of a State under section 14. References can be given to the National Crime Authority to look into relevant criminal activity. Relevant criminal activity is activity that relates to a relevant offence; that is, something that involves two or more offenders in substantial planning and organisation; that involves or is of a kind that of ordinarily involves the use of sophisticated methods and techniques; that is committed or is of a kind ordinarily committed in conjunction with other offences or involves theft, fraud, tax evasion, currency violation, illegal drug dealing, illegal gambling, financial benefit by vice, extortion, violence, bribery, and other matters which are set out in the statute. The genesis of the National Crime Authority lay originally in the Costigan Royal Commission. Honourable members will remember that, as a result of certain irregularities which came to light on the Melbourne waterfront and concerned the ships painters and dockers, Mr Frank Costigan, QC, was given a royal commission to investigate. In the course of that investigation he uncovered not just irregularities on the Melbourne waterfront but irregularities in the conduct of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, irregularities in relation to a tax scheme, money laundering and a whole host of other matters. As a result, the Fraser Government set up the National Crimes Commission in 1982, and after the Hawke Government was elected in 1983, it brought in this legislation which was designed to repeal that Act and that Commission and to put in its place the National Crime Authority. Under the current terms of the Act, no person can hold office in the National Crime Authority for more than four years. There is no general right of reappointment, but there is provided a staggered system which is in part a transitional system that allows people appointed on certain dates possibilities of reappointment. It is a rather complicated system of transition and savings, which is to be amended by the Bill. The Bill will simplify the current provisions and give for the first time a general rule applicable to the Chairman and members, allowing reappointment. So there will now be a general right of reappointment in relation to members or the Chairman of the National Crime Authority. But taken together with the original appointment, any reappointment cannot exceed four years in length. A member or the Chairman can be reappointed any number of times, but the sum total of the first appointment and any of the reappointments cannot exceed four years. So there is still limitation on the period that can be served, and one might observe that if the original appointment is for a period of four years, the provisions allowing a reappointment could not be exercised, because they would inevitably involve exceeding that maximum service period. In the second reading speech, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan) has explained that the object of these amendments is to allow the reappointment of Mr Leckie and Mr Cusack, QC, whose terms are to expire on 30 June 1992. There is a third member, Mr Gray, QC, who was appointed on 1 July 1991 for two years and, as was mentioned in the second reading speech, we now have a new Chairman, who was appointed in place of Mr Justice Phillips. The point is, of course, that Mr Leckie and Mr Cusack, QC, were always going to terminate on 30 June 1992. This is not an unexpected event; it was always going to happen by reason of the date of their appointments and the duration of their appointments. Mr Gray, QC, was always going to continue beyond that date to 1993 by reason of his two-year appointment from July 1991. The only different fact which could be said to have given rise to the necessity for this amendment is that Mr Justice Phillips, who was appointed for four years in August 1990, resigned in December 1991. He resigned to take up an appointment as Chief Justice of the Victorian Supreme Court, and this of course could not have been anticipated at the time of his appointment. Mr Tom Sherman took up the position of Chairman on 26 February 1992. By June of this year he will have been in the position for only four months, whereas Mr Justice Phillips would have been there for two years. So the necessity for this amendment could only be said to arise from the fact that Mr Tom Sherman has only four months service, whereas Mr Justice Phillips would have had two years service. 11: 1m rem explained that there is a need for continuity. It is not really right to say that we need this Bill so that we can reappoint Mr Cusack, QC, and Mr Leckie because they are working on that current references. The Government would not have been able to do that, anyway. It had nothing to do with timing. There was no right of reappointment. This prospect of reappointment is a new prospect held out by the Bill. That option would not have been open previously and is to be reopened by this Bill. On the basis that it could be said that an unanticipated event has occurred-namely, that at the time of the roll-over of Cusack and Leckie, as it were, the Chairman had not been in office for as long as was anticipated-and that without this amendment there would not be sufficient continuity in the National Crime Authority, we support the Bill. However, we do not want the Parliament to overlook the fact that there have been problems in the National Crime Authority over the years. One of the problems that has come to the attention of this House relates to Operation Ark, conducted by the National Crime Authority. Operation Ark arose out of the failure to notify the proper authorities, Commissioner of Police in particular, of the fact that 13 allegations concerning police involvement in or protection of drug trafficking had been received during Operation Noah in 1989 in South Australia. At the time, the National Crime Authority was investigating allegations of corruption in the South Australian Police at the request of the South Australian Government. The Authority commenced inquiries into Operation Ark on 17 March 1989 and continued to conduct hearings until 20 June 1989. The hearings were generally conducted by Adelaide member, Mr Mark Le Grand, sitting alone, although the NCA Chairman, Mr Justice Stewart, joined Mr Le Grand on two occasions. There was conflict over the report prepared by Mr Le Grand. The report was prepared under the chairmanship of Justice Stewart, but the formal report was submitted by his successor, Mr Faris. The report submitted under the chairmanship of Mr Faris was very different from the report prepared under the chairmanship of Mr Justice Stewart. An argument occurred as to whether the report had been submitted by the Authority whilst it was still under the chairmanship of Mr Justice Stewart. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority took up this matter, as it was obliged to do. Members of that Committee were very concerned to satisfy themselves that members of the NCA were being forthright about the affair and not being restrained in making proper material available to them. As members of a parliamentary committee that was their duty. I think the people who serve on that Committee have taken a very responsible attitude towards it. On behalf of the public, they are supervising this institution. In the course of preparing material for this debate in the House, I have had occasion to read the report on Operation Ark that was prepared by the Committee. I mention in particular the fine work that was done by those coalition members who served on it and presented a dissenting report-Senator Crichton-Browne, Senator Vanstone, Mr Filing and Mr MCGauran. They went into this at quite the some length and presented a very good report. One of the things that - oncerned them, and rightly so, was that they were assured during that inquiry that Mr Le Grand had not been directed in any way not to give evidence or had not been restrained about the evidence he should give. It now appears that there is some legitimate doubt as to whether that assurance was right. That matter is being investigated by the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges, as it should be. Once the Senate Privileges Committee reports on that, it will make findings. I am not going to pre-empt its findings. It has been a very long hearing. If those facts should be found, it would be a very serious matter. There was controversy over Operation Ark. There was controversy over disclosure concerning Operation Ark and that was made known to the Parliamentary Joint Committee. There has been a Privileges Committee inquiry. There was-even previous to the appointment of Mr Justic- Phillips-some instability in the National Crime Authority, with the premature resignation of Mr Faris. We must confront all those things honestly and say, 'There does appear to have been a bit of instability in the National Crime Authority. The Parliamentary Committee is right to look at this very seriously, as is the Senate Privileges Committee'. We cannot come in here and pretend that everything is going along swimmingly and people should just carry on as they have, because if past events are to be faced up to honestly, the Authority has not been without its problems. For the reasons that I indicated earlier, we think that on balance there is merit in this Bill. We would not like to see a situation arise in which it was conceivable that all the members of the Authority turned over in a very short space of time and the benefit of experience was lost. We would like to see the National Crime Authority retain experience and be able to execute its duties to its utmost capacity. We would like to see the National Crime Authority become a key instrument in dealing with organised crime in this country. By the same token, that does not mean that the Parliament should be uncritical in looking at its perfonnance. One of the things we must do if we want to see this Authority perfonn well is to make sure that we are getting value for money and that there is proper accountability. We must make sure that the money that is being spent is being properly directed at tracing organised crime and not being diverted in any way by disagreements within the Authority or by other extraneous matters. In raising those concerns, which it is not our role to decide upon-I do not seek to decide upon them; they are matters to be decided upon by the Senate Privileges Committee-we hope they will be resolved in the proper place-at this stage, that is the Senate Privileges Committee. We support the amendment, dealing as it does with the matters in the way I have explained.",123
317,Mr MELHAM,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,"It was interesting to listen to the honourable member for Higgins (Me Costello) giving his historical perspective of the National Crime Authority. I can understand why he came into the Parliament and gave that historical perspective. Having just been appointed shadow AttomeyGeneral by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), I think he feels the need to justify his credentials for that position. I do not any problem with the history he gave-it was reasonably accurate-but I certainly do have problems with his reference to Operation Ark and with his coming into this chamber, waxing lyrical and giving praise to the minority report that was presented by members of the Opposition in relation to Operation Ark. I have had something to say about that in this chamber in the past and I will repeat it here today, because it has been raised. In my view, the conduct of the coalition members in releasing that minority report was reprehensible in the extreme. In that minority report, they disclosed in camera evidence without any forewarning to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the National Crime Authority and without any efforts to seek Committee approval in relation to the release of that in camera evidence. In my view, they set back relations between the Parliamentary Committee and the National.Crime Authority light years. If that principle were continued, the Parliamentary Joint Committee could not properly supervise the National Crime Authority, because it would be unable to guarantee confidentiality to people who came before the Committee. We have had thisÂ·argument before. Certainly, the Joint Committee is attempting to resolve it in discussions with both the National Crime Authority and the AttomeyGeneral as to what is a proper fonnula. Part of the problem is that we have to deal with the other place. The Senate has different rules from those of the House of Representatives. In my view, if only the practice and procedure of the House of Representatives were operating, those people responsible for preparing the minority report and disclosing the in camera evidence and other evidence before the Committee would have had real problems. In my opinion, the other place is run on Rafferty'S rules. Senators can roll into the Senate and disclose in camera evidence. There is an argument about this, which I concede. I am not saying that Senator Vanstone, Senator Crichton-Browne or the other members of the Committee are acting maliciously. I am saying that they are acting naively. I do have not think they really appreciate the consequences of their actions. I do not wish to pre-judge the deliberations of the Privileges Committee in relation to the matter of privilege to do with members of the Authority. But I want to say in relation to the honourable member for Higgins, in tenns of pre-empting the decision of the Privileges Committee, that I think that some members of the Committee have pursued a political campaign in relation to the South Australian situation to obtain headlines. They have jeopardised the relationship between the Parliamentary Joint Committee and t- NCA. I think it is a politically based campaign. What the honourable member for Higgins probably does not know is that the Joint Standing Committee on the National Crime Authority deliberated on that matter before the Privileges Committee and came to a conclusion. The five members of the Government-together with the Democrat, Senator Spindler, and the honourable member for Moore (Me Filing), who is a Liberal member of this House-gave a clean. bill of health to the members of the Authority. In an earlier investigation, the Liberal members of the Committee, in particular Senator Hill, did not know how to ask questions. They did not know how to extract information and, quite frankly, they were incompetent. As a result of that, we have had this attempt, in my opinion, to quite improperly take on members of the NCA for not fully disclosing information to the Committee. I deliberated in relation to what the allegations were, as part of an inquiry that we as a joint committee undertook. I repeat that I certainly and the six other members were satisfied. Senator Vanstone and Senator Crichton-Browne abstained on the basis that they wanted to have a look at the transcript evidence before they came to a decision. The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) did not attend the final deliberation. Some members of the Committee have used the release of that in camera evidence in the minorityÂ·Operation Ark report to justify to Privileges Committee their disclosure of in camera evidence, which, in my view, is quite improper. What has happened is that we have members of the Authority who are now subject to double jeopardy. With the greatest of respect to the other place-my opinion of the other place is well known-the greatest micro-economic reform that we as a government could achieve would be to abolish the Senate and do away with senators. I think it is true in this instance as well. I think that Rafferty's rules apply in the other place. So I take issue with the honourable member for Higgins in terms of praise and waxinglyrical in relation to that minority report on Operation Ark. The Bill before the House, the National Crime Authority Bill, is a simple one. As the honourable member for Higgins quite rightly points out, the problem has been that Mr Justice Phillips, the former Chairman of the NCA, has been appointed the Chief Justice of Victoria. So there really is a problem in terms of continuity of members of the NCA. In our report Who is to Guard the Guards? on page 52, at paragraph 3.89, the Joint Parliamentary Committee recommended uS follows: The appointment of new members of the National Crime Authority is an important aspect of the Authority's administration. The Government should ensure that the terms of appointment of members allow for an overlap of membership and that a complete change of membership of the Authority at one time is avoided. The honourable member for Higgins and indeed the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan) have quite properly pointed out what the consequences would be if we did not pass this Bill. We would have a chairman who has not been there for all that long, and the member, in terms of the specific reference to Adelaide, Mr Gray, has not been there all that long. I support the Bill before the House because of I think it rewords sections 37(1), (1A), (lB) and (1C) in a much more readable fashion and with better consequences. As the Parliamentary Secretary has pointed out, currently one class of member can be reappointed while others cannot, and that is an anomaly in the National Crime Authority Act the as it presently stands. But the principle remains the same: appointments and reappointments would be for a maximum of four years. I think that principle is an important one. I remind honourable members that back in 1983 the NCA Bill did permit the reappointment of members. But in May 1984 the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs reported on the Bill, recommending that provision for reappointment be deleted. The Committee's concern was over the possibility of reappointment being used as an inducement to NCA members to perform in a way which is politically acceptable to the government of the day. This is stated in paragraph 7.8 of the Senate Committee's report. The Government accepted the recommendation that there should be no power to reappoint. The Bill was amended accordingly. Separate 1988 amendments of the NCA Act provided for reappointment in two cases: for the then Chairman and members as part of the transition from an authority whose existence was subject to the sunset clause to a permanent authority; and for any additional member appointed to assist with the specific reference, provided the total term does not exceed four years. My understanding is that the anomaly arises as a result of those 1988 amendments. I certainly am of the view that the four years should be the maximum term. Certainly we need to look at staggering appointments, but one thing I do not want to see is the staggering of appointments being used as an excuse to extend the four-year appointment. One of the things that the Senate Standing Committee had to say bears repeating. On page 84 of its recommendations it states: The Attorney-General himself then referred to the possibility of governments acting with the wrong motivation (Evidence, p. 328). There is a possibility of renewability being used as an inducement to perform in a way which is politically acceptable to the government of the day. In the Committee's view, the temptation is sufficiently great to warrant the deletion of the renewability provision from the Bill. The Committee sees merit in a four-year term, not subject to renewal. This, our view, is sufficient time for members to be effective without the possibility of political interference. It is important for the effective operation of Authority that there should be continuity of leadership and direction. This could be jeopardised where all three members' terms are congruent. The Committee favours a system whereby the members' terms are staggered, so as to ensure a significant overlap between the terms of experienced members and those of incoming members. One possible method would be at the establishment of the Authority to appoint the Chairman for a fixed four years and the other members for fixed terms greater than three, but not exceeding, four years. So even back then, the problem that we are now facing was envisaged. What I am suggesting is that when Mr Leckie's and Mr Cusack's appointments expire-and if this Bill is passed, that will obviously be next year-consideration should be given to appointing members in their place, but not for the four years. The staggering should begin when Mr Leckie and Mr Cusack are eventually replaced. In that way the four years will be preserved. That is a very important principle that this Parliament should be aware of. I think a term any longer than four years is not appropriate for members of the National Crime Authority. That is probably the right period of time. The last thing we want in this country is another J. Edgar Hoover parading around the countryside with the special powers that are conferred on the National Crime Authority and being able to operate for a period of more than four years. As the Opposition is obviously supporting the Bill, I will conclude there. There is nothing much more that I have to say, other than to say categorically to this place that in my view Mr Leckie and Mr Cusack, QC, are eminently qualified for reappointment. They have served with distinction as members of the bar in their respective States. I have a long association with Mr Cusack, dating back to when he was a public defender. This House should not have any fears in relation to the matter before the Privileges Committee because, in my submission, that matter is a political witch-hunt.",126
318,Mr SINCLAIR,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,"I want to speak briefly on this matter in for several reasons. Firstly, I have been a member of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority only for the term of this Parliament, and there are aspects of the the deliberations that I wanted to refer to. As to the matters of the Ark and the Privileges Committee, I say no more than that I have a great deal of sympathy for the point of view that has been raised by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello). The nature of the National Crime Authority Amendment Bill is such that there is no doubt that it makes sense to extend the terms of Messrs Greg Cusack QC and Julian Leckie QC. A new Chairman having been appointed, it would seem eminently sensible-as the report of the Committee entitled Who is to Guard the Guards? suggested-to allow them to remain in office and to play some part in insuring continuity within the deliberations of the National Crime Authority. The matter of substance on which I wanted to speak was a little broader than that. The honourable member for Higgins gave what I thought was a very good exposition on the background to the creation of the National Crime Authority. I do not want to repeat that, but it is worth looking at whether or not we need a National Crime Authority. Its genesis was the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. After the Costigan Royal Commission a proposal went to legislative fonn, but it was not proceeded with on the election of the Hawke Government in 1983. The legislation to create the National Crime Authority emerged some time later. Without doubt; the National Crime Authority has some runs on the board. My time on the Committee has been more under the chainnanship of Mr Justice Phillips, and currently Mr Tom Sherman, than it was under Mr Justice Stewart. I had no experience of their predecessors; therefore I offer no views about the Committee at that stage. However, as I said, I have some sympathy for the minority view in the report on the Ark inquiry. My worry is that we have the National Crime Authority only because the States do not seem to be able to get on with each other and are not prepared to accept any other body. At present we have directors of public prosecutions appointed federally and in each of the States. The capabilities of the police forces are certainly being improved in each of the States. They are looking to their own operations and attempting toÂ· broaden their capacity to deal with levels of crime that may have been beyond their reach in days gone by. In the Australian Federal Police we have an excellent body which has embarked on a number of areas of responsibility that do not peculiarly relate to duties in the ACT, but now embrace Commonwealth crimes wherever they might occur. The reason behind the National Crime Authority was that it was felt necessary to create a body which was able to bring together the State police forces and to look into organised crime. That there is organised crime and that there is reason to look into it is not contestable. But how we best approach it, and whether or not the National Crime Authority is the best agency for the purpose, are matters that I question. have not yet reached a concluded point of view on that. But there are significant disadvantages in the manner in which the National Crime Authority pursues inquiries, in that it cannot be certain that, having concluded its inquiries, prosecutions will ensue. There is an inevitable problem in the Director of Public Prosecutions-be he a Federal or State DPP-feeling it necessary to be at anns length from prosecutions and the collection of evidence to proceed with a prosecution. I am quite concerned that in so many inquiries there is duplication of effort. There is a problem from the National Crime Authority point of view in ensuring that matters that have been investigated proceed to the point of prosecution. We find that, for one reason or another, the DPP feels there is not enough evidence to succeed with a prosecution and in some instances not even enough evidence to initiate a prosecution. More fundamentally, there are occasions when, having launched a prosecution, there is not enough evidence to succeed. This gap between the capacity of the NCA to produce the evidence needed in court to succeed in a prosecution is one of the areas of my doubt. Sadly, as was the case in the past, there is still far too much difference between the State and Federal police forces. It is regrettable that there cannot be greater coordination so that, at the police level, there could be an investigation into organised crime, following which the matter could go straight to the Director of Public Prosecutions. I have an open mind on the continued distence of the National Crime Authority because I question not whether the role needs to be exercised but whether we cannot, perhaps, have some nationwide DPP authority which better coordinates the efforts of the directors of public prosecutions and allows them to have their staff seconded to whoever is going to undertake the inquiry process. I know the difficulties with the DPPs. I know their legal obligations and the degree to which they feel there would be a problem in so doing. But every time we raise another body or create another entity, we have not only the cost of that body but a duplication of I services. One thing that is apparent, even in the legislation before us, is that we are trying to keep a body that is turning over. We are extending the tenn for two of the members, but we are not extending it beyond four years. The whole concept is that the Chairman and the members will be there for a relatively brief period and therefore cannot be said to be so entrenched or blinkered in their thinking that they will reach conclusions based on their views on other matters in which they have been involved, or will be unable to assess the Commonwealth point of view, or the views of the States or other interested parties. I accept the four-year term, but I suggest that it might well be time that we thought of introducing sunset legislation for the NCA. What would happen if we did that? We have only to look at what happened with another body that tabled a report in this Parliament a little while ago. I refer to ACIAR-the Australian Council for International Agricultural Research. It made everybody look at the body and say, 'What is its role? Is it worth continuing?'. Is the NCA a body that has, in conjunction with the DPPs and the State and Federal police, a role which ensures that it should remain in place? The genesis was uncertain. I think that members on both sides of the Parliament have been doubtful as to whether the reports on certain inquiries have been sufficiently professubject. sional. However, I should say that in my experience, under the chairmanship of the two chairmen with whom I have been associated, Mr Justice Phillips and Mr Justice Sherman, 1I have no reason to question that. Of course, Mr Sherman has only just joined the NCA. Urider Mr Justice Phillips I felt happy that body was being well controlled and heading in a direction which I felt was one that was proper and not duplicating the effort of others. Having said that, I must say that already there are notable changes in the direction that is being set by the new chairperson. Certainly, if we compare the role of the NCA under Mr Justice Phillips and under his predecessors, we see that there is a marked difference. Obviously, if there is to be an open canvass on the way in which these inquiries are undertaken, I am not really convinced that there should continue to be a National Crime Authority. It is for that reason that, while I recognise the work that is. being done and commend the NCA for some present and past successes, I should say I am not convinced that the NCA should have a permanent right to exist. I think it is there because of the failure of existing organisations, not because it has a role that is necessarily demonstrable, identifiable and permanent. I am not commending or condemning the present directions of the NCA. I think that, obviously, they are very much a matter for the Inter-Governmental Committee and of the present Chairman. It is not the role of the parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority to set those directions. However, I confess that, were I Minister, I would want to look behind the NCA's operations far more than I have been able to do as a member of that Committee. I would like to be convinced in my own mind that the tasks it is performing could not be better undertaken by a better cooperative effort between State and Federal police on the one hand and between State and Federal DPPs on the other. Certainly, it will be in that direction that I will be maintaining some vigilance in the course of my membership of that National Crime Authority Committee and in any contributions in the House on the As I say, I support entirely the recommendations in this Bill. I think that they make sense. I will be interested to see the extent to which in the course of the next 12 months, during the final period of the terms of Messrs Cusack and Leckie and under the chairmanthe ship of Mr Tom Sherman, there is sufficient justification for me to be convinced that the NCA should continue to exist. Whether it does or not, I certainly hope that there can be better liaison between the Federal and State DPPs and the NCA to ensure that investigations are concluded with successful prosecutions. . As a postscript, I should say that there is one other aspect of this legislation that I should bring to the attention of the House on the eve of World Environment Day. We, of course, know that the Minister for Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) is attending, at considerable expense, the conference in Rio. She is attending with two of her ministerial colleagues and 49 Federal delegates and others from various bodies. They are all over there talking about the environment and why we should not cut down trees and why we should not do other things. I was, therefore, most impressed when I picked up my copy of the Bill. I know that there are difficulties for the Commonwealth Government Printer, but members of the public would be interested to know that there are five pages in this Bill. It is really a fairly perfunctory piece of legislation. The schedule is headed, 'Minor Amendments of Principal Act'. Lest honourable members think that the Bill is only five pages long, I should tell them that there are 16 pages within which those five pages are printed. Most of it consists of totally blank paper. While I understand that perhaps there is invisible writing on those 11 pages, I suggest that if the Government wishes to conserve trees, this is not exactly the best way to do so. It might well be better that, having in mind the fundamental significance of preserving mother nature, planting trees and doing those other admirable things, the next time a minor amendment is made to legislation, perhaps only so much paper need be used as is necessary to print the Bill itself.",128
319,Mr FILING,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,"I rise to respond to some of the comments made by the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) and to support the National Crime Authority Amendment Bill, because one of the important conSiderations that have to be realised in relation to this Bill is that it has been proposed in response to the evaluation report Who is to Guard the Guards? of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. Of course., it is designed to deal with the problem of the cut-off from one authority to another-the problem that arises from the non-overlap of tenure of members of the Authority. One of the areas in which this problem was seen quite clearly related to Operation Ark in South Australia. I want to deal with a couple of matters relating to Operation Ark that were raised by the honourable member for Banks. The problem with the Operation Ark report was that there was a changeover from one group of members of the Authority to another group of members. Honourable members may recall that Justice Stewart was the Chairman of the NCA in 1989. At the changeover, I think in July 1989, Peter Faris became the Chairman and there was a changeover of members of the NCA. In the period prior to the changeover a report on Operation Ark was prepared. This was a reference undertaken by the Authority in South Australia to look into allegations of corruption against members of the South Australian Police Force. What happened as a consequence was that the report was prepared just prior to the cessation of office of JusticeÂ· Stewart and his fellow members of the Authority. The report was prepared and, allegedly, was forwarded as the report of the Authority. When the new Chairman and members of the Authority took office, they made a point of saying that that report was not a report of the National Crime Authority. They made changes to it and. forwarded a different report to the South Australian Attorney-General in relation to Operation Ark. Obviously, that led to the great conflict that has arisen in South Australia. As a consequence, we had a fairly substantial debate within the Committee on the ramifications of just whose report it was-whether the right report was in fact Justice Stewart's or Mr Faris's; just which report was the real Operation Ark report. During that debate within the Committee there was a question of a breach of privilege. I do not want to preempt the deliberations of the Senate Privileges Committee. The honourable member for Banks pointed out that he did not want to, either-although I must say that the way he is going, he wants to abolish the Senate. The Senate probably will not get round to making that deliberation by the time he gets",131
320,Mr MELHAM,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,Mr Keating will make that announcement tomorrow.,131
321,Mr FILING,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,"Actually, on that point, he is making so many policies on the run that that is something which he .may be considering overnight. After he has had his afternoon siesta he may wake up and think, 'It is a good idea' to abolish the Senate. I think I will do that', without consulting anybody else. I want to comment on the remarks of the honourable member for Banks. He has let himself into a bit of a trap. He mentioned that there was a decision by the Committee to give Mr Dempsey and Mr Cusack a clean bill of health in relation to the allegations of a breach of privilege. I want to clarify exactly what happened during that decision making process .. In particular, he mentioned my role in that decision making process. I want to clarify my role quite specifically. On the basis of the evidence that was presented to us, I did not consider there to be a prima facie case of a breach of privilege. However, I qualified that quite deliberately on the basis that we were actually prevented from hearing the evidence of Mark Le Grande, who was a South Australian member of the Authority prior to that changeover back in 1989. We asked to hear the evidence from Mr Le Grande and we were prevented from doing so. As a consequence we got to hear only one side of the story. That is why I made my decision, but it was a qualified decision. As a result of the tabling of the minority report on Operation Ark, the matter was referred to the Privileges Committee for further action. That inquiry is continuing. The other matter that the honourable member for Banks raised was the relationship between the NCA and the Committee. I said he was going into a bit of a trap because his colleague on the other side of the chamber made a similar blunder by alleging that, because of this report, because of some sort of behaviour on the part of Opposition members of the Committee, somehow the relationship between the Committee and NCA was tainted, that there was a reluctance on the part of the NCA to deal openly and closely with the Committee. We heard a similar allegation by the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) and, as a consequence, he had to come back into the House. He made the allegation that there was an estrangement between the Committee and the NCA. Mr MCGauran-On the basis of what Justice Phillips told him.",131
322,Mr FILING,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,"Yes. He had to come back into the chamber to make a personal explanation and apologise for having misled the House. The honourable member for Burke said: . .. I incorrectly interpreted remarks made by Justice Phillips, the new Chairman of the NCA, at a meeting last week and have, in fact, misled the House about the nature of those remarks. Justice Phillips did not imply that the NCA would now find itself unable to work with the Committee and he did not imply or suggest that there could not be the usual exchange of information between the Parliamentary Committee and the NCA. He did say that on some of the matters at present in dispute within the .Committee he did not wish the NCA to become a political football and wished those matters to be resolved between the Parliament and the politicians. That gives the lie to - he allegation made by the honourable member for Banks. The assertion that there was an estrangement between the Committee and the NCA as a result of the Operation Ark minority report tabled in October 1990 is quite fallacious. It is important that we recognise that the National Crime Authority Amendment Bill-I mentioned this earlier-is a consequence of the recommendations made in the evaluation report. The evaluation report was a valuable exercise. We certainly beard a substantial amount of evidence, we had a large number of hearings and we were able to get a pretty good handle on not only how the NCA was performing but also how it was perceived to be performing. We know, for obvious reasons, that there has been constant speculation in the media about whether the NCA is worth retaining. I happen to believe the NCA should be retained. Under the circumstances, the changes proposed in the Bill are healthy because they give the NCA a greater opportunity for continuity in the administration of the Authority. Quite clearly, the administration of the Authority has been the greatest source of criticism. Most commentators' perception of the problems within the NCA is that they have largely revolved around the question of administration, rather than the question of the hands-on inquiries. That is not to say that there have not been some problems with the inquiries. We have seen instances where the NCA has had some spectacular failures. Nonetheless, it has had some successes, too. The changes in recent times have meant going down the path of pursuing white collar criminals. During the 1980s there was considerable speculation about why the NCA had not gone down that path earlier and had not been able to pull in some of the operators in Western Australia and elsewhere who were causing considerable speculation over allegations of fraud. I support the changes proposed in the Bill. They are useful and will make the NCA more effective in its administration. I reiterate my criticisms of some of the comments made by the honourable member for Banks. I think they are unfortunate because they hark back to the Operation Ark report.",132
323,Mr MELHAM,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,Why did the honourable member for Higgins raise it? I wasn't going to say anything until he raised it.,133
324,Mr FILING,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,"The comments that the honourable member for Banks made about the estrangement between the Committee and the NCA were unfortunate. As I mentioned, when the colleague of the honourable member for Banks made similar allegations, he was proven to be wrong.",133
325,Mr MELHAM,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,Different comments.,133
326,Mr FILING,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,"No. In essence,they were similar comments. The honourable member cannot have it both ways. On the one hand he cannot say that these were specifically designed to talk about one particular areathey were used in the first instance as a means of criticising Opposition members of the Committee for publishing the minority report-while on the hand question the publication of in camera evidence. The honourable member for Banks knows only too well that that publication was perfectly in order with the rules of Senate committees. As a consequence of the fact that the minority report was published in the Senate, there can be no inferences or other assertions drawn from my behaviour or that of my colleagues who signed that minority report. We did that within the rules and with a view to displaying clearly to the community the problems that had arisen from the Operation Ark report, in particular, the problems that arose from the fact that the Committee's majority report virtually whitewashed the whole incident. As the honourable member for Banks will recall, the matter arose in the lifetime of the previous. Committee. That committee said, 'We'll hand it on to the next committee'. When the matter came before our Committee, what happened? The Committee said, 'This is old hat; we really ought to be getting onto new stuff'. Without resolving the problem, the modus operandi of Government members was: look, this is old hat; let us forget about it; let sleeping dogs lie. The intent of the Committee's report was to draw the community's attention to the fact that this matter had not been resolved satisfactorily and there were other questions about evidence that had not been given to the Committee by members of the Authority in relation to Operation Ark. All I can say is that the Opposition members of the Committee believe they have a very important role to play in relation to the supervision of the Committee. I want to tell honourable members why it is important that the Committee- properly supervises, properly oversees, the National Crime Authority. There are only two areas of supervision of the NCA: one is the parliamentary Joint Standing Committee-the PJC as it is known colloquially-and the other is the lOC, the intergovernmental committee. All of us on the Committee have agreed that the IOC's behaviour or standard of supervision has been absolutely atrocious. In fact, the IOC has. met on so few occasions that it is a wonder it even knew what the heck was going on in the National Crime Authority. In our discussions with the IOC it became clear-to me; anyway-that some of the people did not have much of a handle on what was happening within the Authority. That reinforces the importance of the work undertaken by the Joint Standing Committee. Unless somebody is overseeing the National Crime Authority in an effective way, with the powers that have been vested in the National Crime Authority under the Act, quite clearly there is the possibility of those powers being used in a manner that is inconsistent with the original intent of the legislation. I think the Bill proposes some valuable amendments to the National Crime Authority Act. As a consequence we may see a greater stability in the administration of the NCA. I would like to see that. I want the NCA to be an effective body. It has a very important to play. One problem that has arisen in the past has been the relationship between the NCA and other State police forces and their Ministers. A more stable administration will allow for a much better understanding between the NCA and the other State police forces that have to cooperate from time to time with the NCA in its inquiries and whose officers are seconded to the NCA. However, it is unfortunate that, in addressing the catalyst for this change, the problem of the changeover in South Australia and the Operation Ark fiasco-that is what I call itthe honourable member for Banks raised some allegations which are not only incorrect but also fallacious. They go against what his colleague the honourable member for Burke conceded-that is, there was no estrangement between the Committee and the NCA as a result of the deliberations of the Committee and the signing of the minority report by Senator Vanstone, Senator Crichton-Browne, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) and myself. I will conclude on that note. I support the Bill.",133
327,Mr DUNCAN,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,"Makin-Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General) (6.20 p.m.)in reply-This debate has been long and very wide ranging given the narrow ambit of the National Crime Authority Amendment Bill which is before the House. In fact, one could say that anybody listening to this debate would have forgotten long ago why we are actually here. I do nbt want to delay the House by re-delivering the second reading speech and I will not do so. This is a very modest little piece of legislation which provided a very tiny hook upon which to hang the extraordinarily wide ranging debate that has taken place this afternoon.",134
328,Mr FILING,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,That is a major parliamentary debate.,134
329,Mr DUNCAN,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,"Do not get me wrong; I am not saying it was out of order. But it certainly would have been the subject of numerous points of order if such wide ranging activity had occurred during Question Time. The discussion between members of the Joint Statutory Committee on the National Crime role Authority reminded me a bit of a front bar discussion on what happened to Phar Lap or Les Darcy when they went to the United States. Anybody listening to the debate would have found it esoteric and ancient history. Be that as it may, the only matter I wish to respond to concerns the NCA membership. I indicate to the House that the two members of the NCA whose terms are to expire on 30 June this year will, as I have said in the second reading speech, have their terms extended-one by six months and one by a longer period. That point was raised by the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), and I think it needs to be made clear. That will have the effect of staggering, to some extent, appointments to the NCA in the future. That will certainly be a good thing and should ensure that there is less likelihood of the bunching of appointments in the future so that we will have greater continuity of NCA membership than we have had in the past. That should ensure that the administration, which the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) was somewhat concerned about, will see a degree of continuity which it possibly has not seen in the past. I want to say only one other thing in concluding the debate. Some honourable members who have spoken this afternoon in this debate I think have been slightly unfair to the NCA in terms of continuity of personnel and the way in which it has been administered. There have certainly been some problems in the past-I would not deny that and I do not think anybody would. Some speakers implied that the Government or others could have foreseen in some way or other what happened with the now Mr Justice Phillips. That is clearly not the case. Nobody could have fairly expected him not to accept an appointment as the Chief Justice of Victoria when that was offered. Quite clearly, it was unfortunate in terms of the administration of the NCA, but obviously it was not a situation which anybody could cavil at. I think the House ought to concede that point. With those remarks, I commend the Bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Duncan) read a third time.",134

331,Mr JOHNS,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"Petrie-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services) (8.00 p.m.)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. In December 1991 the Parliament passed legislation ensuring the highest standards of accountability in the Australian political process. The funding and disclosure provisions of. the Commonwealth Electoral Act were substantially enhanced to provide for comprehensive financial disclosure by political and third parties. These major changes to our electoral system were brought about with the decisive support of all members of the Parliament. As a result of the amendments, the Act now imposes an obligation upon registered political parties to lodge annual returns of all income, expenditure and debts. The Act also requires far greater accountability from 'third parties' who participate the electoral process by requiring the disclosure of gifts made by them to political parties. The Australian Electoral Commission has also been given enhanced powers to conduct random spot audits to ensure compliance with the disclosure provisions and further reporting powers in relation to such audits. The operation of the enhanced disclosure scheme came into effect immediately upon passage of the amendments on 19 December 1991. Over the ensuing period the full implications of the amended regime have become apparent, as political and third parties and the Australian Electoral Commission have examined closely the procedural requirements needed to be taken to comply with the Act. It has become clear that certain of the enhanced requirements-particularly those dealing with annual political party returns-will cause extreme administrative difficulties for political parties, particularly at the volunteer officer and branch level. The Government has therefore reviewed the disclosure provisions to determine whether steps could be taken to reduce the administrative burden upon political parties whils- preserving the primary objective of full disclosure and transparency of the political process. The difficulties identified do not arise from the requirement to record and disclose the total amounts received, paid or owed by political parties. The changes the Government proposes in this Bill will not effect this important requirement. The major administrative burden upon political parties arises out of an obligation to record certain other information in respect of every single transaction entered into by the party and its constituent organs, much of which will not ultimately need to be disclosed. This arises because, in addition to disclosing all income, expenditure and debts of the party, the annual returns must identify every person or organisation that pays to, receives from or is owed by the party a total annual amount of $1,500 or more. The $1,500 limit set by the Parliament which triggers the identification requirement is reasonable and justifiable. However, the requirement isÂ· cast in in absolute terms and therefore encompasses all amounts received, paid or owed to the party, including small and insignificant sums. In order to comply with the letter of the law, political parties will be required to keep records of the identity of everyone from whom they receive, or to whom they payor owe any amount, and to collate all of these amounts annually to detennine whether an individual's identity must be disclosed. This will include both small and large single amounts. It will include $1 raffle tickets, and thousand dollar donations' and, for the purpose of the identification requirement, will not make any administrative distinction between them. All political parties in Australia are voluntary bodies which rely on their membership for the organisation of party activities in the majority of circumstances. This is especially so at the local branch level. Whilst the major political parties employ full time office holders and organisational staff, much of the initial administrative burden of recording details of financial transactions will fall branch level. It is unrealistic to expect voluntary office holders to be able to comply with these requirements. It is, as a result, also unrealistic to expect the agents of registered political parties to be able to ensure that complete returns are lodged with regard to the identification requirement. This Bill therefore proposes the following response to these administrative difficulties. Division SA of part XX of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, which provides for annual returns by registered political parties, will be repealed and replaced by a revised division SA. The new provision will continue to require annual returns by all registered political parties of the total amounts received, paid or owed by or on behalf of the party during the reporting year. Regulations will be able to be made requiring a breakdown of the total amounts into subtotals. The disclosure requirements must embrace all units of political parties to prevent avoidance. However, the current provisions could be modified to enable parties latitude in respect of minor expenditure or income, whilst ensuring significant transactions and those involved in. them are still reported. Furthennore, the enhanced random auditing power of the Electoral Commission will be available to it to enforce compliance with the disclosure scheme. The new division SA will require parties to report the particulars, including the name and address, of any individual from whom they receive a total amount of $1,SOO or more during the reporting year. However, parties will not be required to count towards any total amount received by an individual, amounts of less than $100 received from a fundraising event. In practice, whilst party units conducting such events will need to record the total amount received, they will not need to attribute amounts of less than $100 to their source for recording purposes. Amounts paid by political parties will be treated in a similar way. Whilst particulars will need to be reported of any individual to whom the party pays total amounts of $1,SOO or more in the reporting year, single items of expenditure of $100 or more will not be at the required to be counted towards the total amount for any individual or organisation. In addition, to protect the legitimate privacy concerns of employees of political parties, amounts paid by way of bona fide salaries or employment related entitlements will not need to be counted for the purposes of the identification requirement. As debts are not nonnally incurred for or on behalf of parties in respect of similar insignificant amounts, no corresponding provisions are necessary in the case of amounts owed by political parties, and the requirement to disclose the identity of those to whom a party owes $1,Soo or more has not been altered. The particulars required to be disclosed in respect of individuals or organisations to be identified in returns will also be amended. The Bill will standardise these particulars so that they are common throughout the various disclosure requirements in the Act. Additional information will b.e required regarding the identity of persons who are in positions of control of trusts and unincorporated associations. In respect of the latter, the names and addresses of the members of the executive committee, howsoever described, will be required. This will assist the Australian Electoral Commission in its investigations and enforcement of the Act. In this ..egard, a separate definition of 'registered industrial organisation' encompassing all such organisations registered under the relevant Commonwealth or State industrial relations legislation will be inserted in the Act. As the names and addresses of the executives of such organisations are available publicly through the relevant register of industrial organisations in the same way as directors of companies can be identified by reference to registered company records, these particulars will not be required to be included in returns under the Act. Because of the immediate introduction of the enhanced disclosure requirements, a significant level of uncertainty as to the obligations they impose upon participants in the political process has arisen. As the disclosure requirements will be further amended by this Bill, it. would be unreasonable to expect compliance with the existing requirements, in the form of returns for the period from 19 December 1991 until 30 June 1992. Sufficient records enabling compliance with the eJ(:isting provisions are unlikely to have been kept due to ignorance of the extent of the disclosure obligations. The new division 5A will therefore apply prospectively from 1 July 1992, and the first annual return required by the division will cover the 1992-93 financial year. Similar transitional provisions will be made with respect to the amended disclosure requirements in section 305 and sections 308 and 309 of the Act relating to third party reporting of expenditure for political purposes and electoral expenditure. Section 314AA currently requires that registered political parties' annual returns must be lodged within eight weeks of the end of the financial year. Previously political parties had been given 20 weeks following general elections to lodge returns in respect of disclosable gifts and expenditure received and incurred during the disclosure period or, in layman's terms, the period from the previous election until the election just held. As the new regime requires disclosure of far greater detail, albeit on a more regular basis, it is reasonable to afford political parties the same reporting period as applied to the more limited previous disclosure requirements. Proposed new division 5A will incorporate a 20week reporting period. This will alleviate the difficulties that would arise where an election is called during the period just preceding or following the end of the financial year. Such an election would of course reduce substantially the resources available to parties to prepare disclosure returns. Currently the Act requires the Electoral Commission to process the annual party returns and make them available for public inspection within four weeks of the end of the reporting period. To ensure the Commission has adequate time to collate and prepare the returns, this period will be extended until the end of January eachÂ· year, a period of approximately 10 weeks. Further amendments proposed by this Bill will tighten the operation of the disclosure scheme and close minor potential loopholes which have been identified since the passage of the 1991 amendments. Section 305 of the Act requires disclosure of expenditure incurred for political purposes. This includes the making of certain gifts to political parties. Where a third party makes a gift to a political party equal to or exceeding $1,000, the third party must disclose all gifts received by them during the disclosure period, equal to or exceeding $1,000. However, the initial gift to the political party which triggers the obligation to disclose gifts received is limited to gifts made on the condition that they be used for a purpose related to an election. This in effect preserves the distinction between gifts for electoral and nonelectoral purposes which was removed from the other disclosure requirements in the Act by the 1991 amendments. The Bill will amend section 305 to remove this distinction, thus ensuring consistency throughout the disclosure scheme. Section 309 of the Act requires the disclosure of electoral expenditure which is defined in section 308. Both sections were amended by the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Act 1991 to require disclosure by the donor of gifts to political parties, candidates and other organisations or persons specified in the gazette by the Electoral Commission. Previously section 308 related to types of expenditure incurred during the relevant election period. The intention behind the amendments to section 308 was that they apply to gifts received at all times during the disclosure period. The changes made to the Act in 1991 do not achieve this result with sufficient certainty or clarity. is primarily because the other types of expenditure covered by section 308 relate solely to election period expenditure. To ensure that the intention is unambiguously applied, the Act will be amended to create a separate reporting requirement for third party gifts received during the relevant disclosure period to be included in proposed section 305A. This will ensure that third parties must disclose financial relationships with political parties and candidates as well as their direct participation in the political process through electoral expenditure. Section 309, which requires the disclosure of electoral expenditure, was amended by the 1991 Act to allow regulations to be made which prescribed amounts under which disclosure of gifts to candidates, political parties or prescribed organisations would not be required. Proposed section 305A will incorporate these amounts which have been determined so as to reflect consistency with the other requirements of the disclosure scheme. The amounts included in section 305A are $4,500 for gifts to political parties, $200 for candidates and $1,000 for prescribed third parties. Section 318 of the Act enables persons required to lodge disclosure returns, but who are unable to do so completely because they do not possess and cannot obtain relevant information, to inform the Electoral Commission of their inability and to identify any person they have reasonable grounds to believe is able to provide the Commission with the information. These steps protect the person required to lodge returns from liability for failure to comply with the disclosure requirements. The section does not currently apply to division 5A and therefore party agents are not presently able to avail themselves of its protection with regard to incomplete annual party returns. There is no justifiable reason for exempting these r-turns from the operation of section 318. The Bill will correct this anomaly. The Bill will also clarify the position of unregistered political parties under the disclosure regime by providing that those political parties not included in the register of This political parties under the Act be treated as 'third parties' for disclosure purposes. This will close a potential loophole and ensure that those parties who do not register as political parties under the Act yet participate in the political process are subject to disclosure. The relationship of campaign committees to registered political parties for the purposes of annual party returns will also be clarified to ensure that campaign committees are treated as organs of the party. The changes to the political disclosures scheme proposed in this Bill will address matters of administrative concern. They will ensure that volunteer members, who are the mainstay of political parties in Australia, are able to meet the obligations placed upon them by the scheme whilst retaining the full disclosure of all amounts paid, received or owed by registered political parties and the identification of all those involved in significant transactions with them. The Bill will also tighten the disclosure requirements and remove potentialÂ· loopholes from the current scheme. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Leave granted for debate to continue forthwith.",135
332,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"The coalition supports the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill. It relates to part 3 of the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Act 1991. This Act was passed through Parliament in December 1991 and amended the Broadcasting Act and the Commonwealth Electoral Act. Honourable members will remember that the main part of this Act was to ban television and radio advertising of political broadcasts during an election period. It also led to the longest continuous debate in another place since 1964. The amendments made to the Commonwealth Electoral Act at the time tightened up disclosure provisions in respect of donations to political parties. The effect of these amendments was as follows: donations to political parties above $1,500 had to be disclosed; every political party or branch of a political party was required to provide the Electoral Commission within eight weeks at the end of each financial year with details of, firstly, all amounts received by a political party and persons or organisations for whom those amounts were received, secondly, all amounts paid by a political party and the names of persons or organisations to whom those amounts were paid and, finally, outstanding amounts of all debts at the end of the financial year, and the names of persons or organisations owed the outstanding amounts. The original legislation also sought to ensure that gifts by third parties to political parties had to be disclosed, and donations from tI'Usts and foundations had to be disclosed. The explanatory notes of this Bill state the necessity for it in the following terms: It has become apparent that, to comply with the requirement to disclose, keeping records of every amount received and paid by or on behalf of a registered political party would place an excessive administrative burden on those parties, particularly in areas largely serviced by volunteer workers. That is actually a rather nice way of saying, 'We got it disastrously wrong the first time in the Bill'. So we have this Bill, the effect of which is as follows: firstly, the names and addresses of any person or organisation which contributes $,1500 or more will still have to be disclosed, but individual amounts of less than $100 received from fundraising events will not need to be accumulated. Without this it would mean that every person buying a $1 raffle ticket from a political party would have to have his or her name and address recorded. Secondly, this Bill would mean that first annual returns by political parties would be required 20 weeks from the end of the financial year. It will mean that by removing third party political party expenditure requirements the distinction between gifts made to political parties for electoral and non-electoral purposes will be abolished. This is a good thing because it might now mean that all the money that came from WA Inc. over to the eastern States Labor parties might finally be disclosed. It will also mean that unregistered political parties which are not required to lodge annual returns will be treated as third parties for disclosure purposes and registered unions will be treated in the same way as companies, thus there will be no requirement to include the names and addresses of executives of those unions in returns. I do not think that will benefit my party very greatly. Under the existing Act, political parties need to record the identity of every single person or organisation who pays to, or receives from, or is owed any money by the party, regardless of how small that sum might be. The data must be collected and collated to determine the total sum paid to, received by, or owed by the party exceeds the $1,500 limit, which triggers the identification requirements for disclosure. The revised division 5A incorporated in this Bill, which exempts the reporting of sums of less than $100 received by a party during a fundraising event, and the disclosure of sums of less than $100 owed by the parties, will go some way towards easing the administrative burden of complying with the disclosure of provisions. Similarly, new section 314AB allows registered politi-l parties 20 weeks instead of the existing eight weeks to lodge their annual returns at the end of the financial year. This is a more realistic time-frame in which to prepare those reports. The Opposition welcomes the provision of this new section, which will protect the privacy of party employees by exempting details of their wages and salaries from the party's reporting requirements. Despite the amendments in the Bill, the Government's funding and disclosure legislation still remains flawed and inadequate. On the one hand, the reporting requirements are so onerous that they will deter honest people from donating to a political party, while, on the other hand, there are still large gaps isome of the disclosure laws that it is possible to circumvent them. The Government pays lip-service to the notion of full accountability of political funding and expenditure, but its laws are neither fair nor equitable. This was canvassed extensively in December 1991 on the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill. As was pointed out at that time, theÂ· coalition supports full, fair and equitable disclosure of political donations. To achieve this, we believe that disclosure laws must ensure that a level playing field exists between the parties, including in regard to taxation, so that no party enjoys a tax advantage over the others. There should be severe penalties if any donor to a political party is singled out for punitive action as a result of making that donation, and donations should be voluntary. The Labor Government has turned a blind eye to these issues, which are essential for fair and just funding and disclosure laws. There is no level playing field between the parties. When I say 'the parties' I mean the Labor Party as against any other political party in Australia, whether it be the Liberal Party, the National Party, the Australian Democrats or any other group. It enjoys that unfair financial advantage because of its special relationship with the trade union movement. The ALP benefits greatly from the current regime, under wh.ich the trade union movement can make tax free donations to the party. It is not generally recognised in the community that all the income received by trade unions is tax free money. A trade union would pay no tax if it owned, for example, a Gold Coast casino or a part of it. If a trade union sells a major building which it owns in the central business district of a capital city, it does not pay capital gains tax. In the State of Queensland, unions are absolved from paying land tax. Yet the trade union movement is a major organisation in Australia with major investments and it is given a privileged status. The coalition believes that funding and disclosure provisions must ensure that donations to parties are voluntary. No such safeguard exists at present. In fact, the Labor Party profits handsomely from the de facto compulsory donations of ordinary workers where people are faced with the decision to be members of a union or not to have a job, as is the case in every closed shop throughout Australia. It occurs across the board in the mining industry, in the major building industry and in such places as the waterfront. The worker's union dues are tax deductible. That tax deductibility is then passed on to the ALP by way of affiliation fees, which vary from place to place, but are generally around $2.10 per head per annum. It would be interesting to know why that affiliation occurs. The close relationship between the two is well recognised. We saw this not long ago in Queensland when the Federated Clerks Union agreed to affiliate with the ALP. This was detailed in the Cooke report. The union was asked, 'Why did you affiliate?', the cost being about $30,000. The answer was, 'Well, we did not actually go and get all the unionists approval to do this, but we affiliated because it gave us ready access to Ministers and an ability to influence government policy'. This is tantamount to a compulsory donation, regardless of whether the employee supports the ALP. It is very interesting to look at the figures. Of those people who are members of the trade union movement, some 40 per cent vote for the Liberal Party. Yet, against their wishes, they are being compelled to support a political party of which they do not approve. We have seen just recently that the ACTU is planning to spend some $lOm in a campaign against the coalition to oppose the Fightback package, doing so with a basically tax free status. I am simply making the point that groups that support the other political parties in Australia do not have the luxury of being able to claim tax deductibility on anything like that scale. Another important condition of the full, fair and equitable disclosure is that donors must be protected against coercion and intimidation. The problem of disclosure and intimidation is very real. It is my hope that, with the increased penalties that were introduced in the 1991 Bill, sooner or later these provisions will be used, so that people will feel confident about donating to a political party and the lack of ramifications from doing so. All that said, these amendments do tidy up the original Bill, which were introduced in haste, and will go some way to making this cumbersome legislation more workable.",138
333,Mr BEVIS,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"In December last year the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill was introduced by this Labor Government in an effort to bring to the country a new standard of ethics and propriety in the way in which political parties conducted their fundraising, and in management of their funds. Since that time, the operations of the Act, which have applied since 19 December 1991, have identified a number of areas where alterations have been seen to be needed by all parties. The commitment of the Labor Government to disclosure of political donations has been evident since the Government came to office in 1983. Indeed, the Labor Party has had a commitment to the disclosure of donations to political parties well before that-for at least some 15 years now. I remind the House that  moved a motion in the Senate to determine the best means of ensuring the public disclosure of resources and amounts of donations to political parties and candidates. That was opposed by the Liberal-National Party in 1977. He sought to do it again in 1979. Again, the Liberal-National Party opposed the Labor Party's efforts in the Senate to require an investigation of ways in which disclosure of donations to political parties could be better arranged in the public interest. In 1980, he moved a similar motion and, again, in 1980 the Liberals opposed it. The truth of the matter is that the Liberals and Nationals have been dragged kicking all the way in this debate. Whether it is a question of the pecuniary interest register for members in this place and in the Senate or whether it is a question of donations to political parties, the Opposition, the Liberal and National parties, have at every opportunity opposed it. It is with some regret that I have to say that the Liberals in Queensland have been worse than their counterparts in other States. Only a couple of years ago in the EARC inquiry in Queensland conducted by the Queensland Government, the Liberal Party's official submission opposed the disclosure of donations to political parties Queensland. That was the official position put to the EARC inquiry in Queensland only two years ago. More recently, the Liberal Party in Queensland has continued to demonstrate that desire to avoid, if it cannot oppose, the requirements of disclosure. In December of last year a letter from the State President of  gham, solicited donations from a number of people throughout the State. I quote from his letter: We need your help to maintain our operations now so that our research and policy support can continue. Any donation you make for maintenance purposes now is not disclosable. That may change-so act quickly. He concluded his letter by saying: And remember too, there is no requirement as yet, to disclose donations for Party maintenance. But please-act quickly! He knew in December of 1991 when he wrote that letter that this Parliament was about to enact legislation that would have required disclosure. His response to that was to send out a letter to people in Queensland seeking their financial donations, to try to beat the law. But he went one better a short while after that. In J anflary of this year the Queensland President of the Liberal Parly, Paul Everingham, wrote again to people, soliciting support for donations and funds. Of course, by that stage, the legislation that we are now discussing was in place. But on 24 January he said this in his letter: Please send me a cheque for whatever you can afford today. If you can't help with cash but can in kind, please let us know. Then he very thoughtfully put. a PS on the end of the letter which was: Please note: Donations of $1500 or more are disclosable under new Political Funding Laws. If you wish to discuss this matter further I would be pleased to hear from you. One could be forgiven for thinking that that was not just an encouragement to provide advice on the details of the legislation. One could forgive people for adopting the view that it may have been in the mind of the Queensland President of the Liberal Party to in try to find ways of avoiding the Act, particularly in view of the stance to oppose disclosure that the Liberal Party in Queensland adopted as its policy position at its convention. But, if there is any doubt about what Mr Everingham may have been offering by way of advice, that was put to rest only a short while ago. On Friday, 10 April at a fundraising function for the Liberal Party held in the Mayfair Crest-the guest speaker at that function, I might add, was the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan)-the Vice-President of the Liberal Party in Queensland, Mr Con Galtos, provided advice to those present. He said in summing up at the end of the evening that he knew that there were a number of business people who were keen to provide donations to the Liberal Party but were concerned that the new legislation required disclosure of their identity and the amount that they donated. He even gave an example. He said, 'If you, for example, want to provide a truck load of paper to the Liberal Party head office but don't want anybody to know, see me afterwards'. That is what the Vice-President of the Liberal Party in Queensland said on 10 April at the Mayfair Crest at a function to raise m-ney for the Liberal Party-and, I might add, to try to set up a Liberal Party branch in the central business district, which it evidently does not have at this time. Let there be no mistake about this chain of events. From 1977, when the Labor Party first sought the endorsement of this Parliament to do something about political disclosures, right through to the present, the Liberal Party has avoided, opposed and sought to undermine the disclosure provisions of the Act and the intentions which the Government has sought to set in place. It really is a disappointment that the Queensland Liberals more than any other, it would seem, have adopted a tactic of trying to avoid the legislation-to beat it if. they could-by sending out a letter a couple of weeks before the legislation was to be enacted which said, 'Quick, give us the money now'. Then, after it was legislated, it sent out a letter saying, 'I just want to remind you that if you give us more than $1,500 it will have to be disclosed. If you have any questions about that, give us a call'. Then at a function only a couple of weeks ago the Vice-President of the Liberal Party said quite bhuitly, 'If want to drop a truck load of paper around to the Liberal Party office but don't want anybody to know, come and see me afterwards and we can arrange something'. It might enlighten the House if the honourable member for Barker, who was at that luncheon, would tell us a few other things that were said. He was the guest speaker. With due respect to him, I suspect that he would have sighed with sorrow at the sort of comment that the Vice-President of the Liberal Party in Queensland came out with on that evening. There is no excuse for that sort of behaviour from the Liberal Party. In his speech on the second reading the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), sought to make some political mileage by reference to Western Australia or to trade unions. Let there be no mistake about where this Government stands and where the Labor Party stands on these questions. For more than 15 years we have pursued the case for public disclosure of donations to political parties. We pursued it in the Senate in 1977 and we have pursued it in the Senate since that time. On every occasion-in 1979, in 1980 and on every occasion-the Liberal Party opposed it. They are points of history. The record stands for itself. This amendment tidies up some of the problems that have become obvious in the new legislation. For that reason it has the support of all members in this House. There are a number of major provisions in the Bill to which I wish to refer. The Bill specifically seeks to decrease the administrative burden on registered political parties by providing that amounts of less than $100 received from a person or organisation at a fundraising event need not be recorded in annual returns. One of the difficulties with the current legislation as it. stands is that it provides an upper limit which is a catch-all. Literally any payment made by or received by a registered political party is required to be disclosed. So we have a situation where, if we had an afternoon tea or a Saturday afternoon barbecue at which people might come along and pay $5 or $10, one would literally have to you record the name of every person present and every hamburger or soft drink that they bought on the day. That sort of administrative trivia was never intended by the Parliament. It is a burden which is impossible in practical terms to place on the honorary officials and the supporters who in the main make up the branch network of registered political organisations. The amendment provides a maximum contribution of $100 being free from that disclosure provision, which is sensible without in any way undermining the important principles of the legislation. Similarly, the Bill decreases the administrative burden on registered political parties by providing that payments of amounts less than $100 need not be recorded in annual returns. Again, the situation at present would involve political parties having to record the tea bags that are bought for the office. Any minor payment that in any other arrangement would be regarded as petty cash would, as the legislation now stands, require detailed work and disclosure. That was not the intention of the Parliament. This amendment rectifies that difficulty. The Bill increases the time for agents to complete and furnish annual returns from eight weeks after the end of the financial year, as it is now, to 20 weeks after the end of the financial. year. The legislation is quite rightly demanding on political organisations in requiring them to disclose all receipts and payments from all party units-not just the State office or the national office; not just regional executives; but all units of every political party. In light of the time that is involved for some of those honorary officials in collating that material and forwarding it to the State director or secretary of the relevant party, current restriction of eight weeks does place a burden which would be difficult for any party in good faith to keep. Extending that time to 20 weeks provides all honorary officials with a realistic time in which to get their records completed and forwarded to their State offices for return to the Electoral Commission. The Bill also allows agents furnishing returns to use the provisions of section 318 if necessary. This provision enables those who are unable to submit a complete return because someone else is in possession of the relevant information to nominate that person to the Commission and fulfil their obligations under the Act. I have just described the situation for local branch executives and the like. There could well be a circumstance in which a State secretary or director who under the Act is responsible for furnishing the return with the best of will is not able to get the information from the local branch officer. That may not be due to anything untoward on the part of the local branch officer. Anyone who has been involved in any honorary organisation will know that volunteers, with the best of will, do not always make the best office clerks. Even with the 20week extension, a situation can arise in which a return is not provided. In this situation, as the law stands now, the State directors or secretaries would find themselves liable under paper- the Act for a breach of the Act. This amendment enables the responsible person to identify those individuals who have not yet furnished the information and enables the Commission if it wishes to pursue that matter directly. The Bill also provides. for easing the administrative burden on registered political parties by providing .that financial records relating to minor fundraising events such as raffles are not required to be disclosed. This again is a common sense alteration .. Let us go back to the example I gave before of the afternoon tea or the barbecue. People might pay $10 for the barbecue and a couple of dollars for a few drinks and then buy a raffle ticket. Under the current legislation it could be said that there is a requirement to record the their name and the amount paid on each one of those activities-every time they buy a drink, every raffle ticket they buy and every hamburger they eat. That does nothing to enhance the important tenets of the Bill with respect to disclosure. This amendment brings some common sense to that arrangement and acknowledges that those minor payments-contributions of less than $IOO-need not be recorded as individual donations. It is important to add that that is not to say that those amounts of money are not recorded, because they are. They will be recorded in an aggregate way. It is simply that the breakdown of every single soft drink bought will .not need to be maintained. The total amount of revenue earned from that venture will be recorded, and that is fair and reasonable, but the individual breakdown of every article purchased will not need to be disclosed under the provisions set out in this Bill. The legislation introduced last year was good legislation designed to protect the interests of the voting public. It was designed to ensure that the people of Australia would be able to know who was donating money to political parties and where money that political parties spent went. It was not intended to place a burden on political organisations that prevented their proper functioning in our democratic system. It was not intended to require the disclosure, for example, of the personal salaries and conditions of employees of those political parties. It was intended to provide a guarantee to the public that there was available on the public record information about the pecuniary interests of the political parties themselves. That legislation was good legislation, and in many respects it was trendsetting legislation, certainly in this country. Notwithstanding the fact that the Queensland Liberal Party does not like it, it is legislation which the people of Australia want and respect. Having said that, it is clear, after some months of that legislation having been in force, that the sorts of amendments to which I have referred, and the others contained in this Bill, are necessary, not to diminish the purpose of the legislation but to enhance it and to ensure that the legislation truly provides useful information to the public-not who bought the soft drinks at the last barbecue but where the significant contributions were from and where the significant payments were made. That is what the Bill will do. I am pleased to support it and I am pleased to see that the Opposition is also supporting it.",140
334,Mr BROADBENT,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"I hope the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) stays in the House this evening long enough to hear a few of my words, because I think it is important that he do so. The honourable member for Brisbane stuns me a bit, because he has been sent along tonight to do a job on behalf of the Labor Party in Queensland. At some stage Wayne Swan has picked up the phone and said, 'Arch? Is that you, Arch? It seems Bob Hogg and Nick Bolkus have mucked up the last proposal we had to save money for the Party. We can't go into the next election with some of the photographs that are going to be put up on the television. Arch, go and do a job for us. Get back to your Party. Make at least these changes'. Mr Johns-Are you blokes moving any amendments?",144
335,Mr BROADBENT,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"We support what the Government is doing, because it is trying to fix up bad legislation. I want to finish with the honourable member for Brisbane first, because this is very important and it is a major part of the argument. I see the honourable member for Brisbane as a cleanskin. He came here in 1990, and I have great respect for those in this Parliament who came through in 1990. The only problem the honourable member for Brisbane faces is that he is grubbied with the money from the entrepreneurs from Western Australia who shook their money all over Australia. With his hand up was Wayne Swan in Queensland. He said, 'Listen, member for Brisbane. You'll be right. We'll support your seat. You're one of our boys. We'll have your union right in behind you with its tax-free money'. I do not want to run out of time tonight, and I do not want to spend all my time on the honourable member for Brisbane, but as a cleanskin he comes into this House and presents himself as being vitally concerned about the issues. I know he would be concerned about fixing up very bad legislation that was introduced into this House last year, with all its anomalies. I do not need to repeat them because honourable members who have spoken before me have gone through the problems with the legislation as presented. It irks me when cleanskinned members come into this House who are honest and genuine and believe they have disclosed everything they have received, only to find that their party has let them down, and only to find, as mentioned in this House yesterday, that their own party, the ALP in this case, has received funds without declaring them. The honourable member for Brisbane knows that he is sickened by the fact that he may have received some of that money that was not declared but under the law of Australia has to be declared. I do not like to read in a Sunday newspaper-and I do not care which side of politics it is on-about people in Australia trying to flout our laws. I did not like the Bill the Government introduced last year. I direct my comments to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Johns), who is at the table. He has a decent background. He was from Victoria. He has made the mistake of moving to Queensland and getting into the dirt and grime of the ALP there. He could have been in Victoria now. Had he been in Victoria now he would be facing an even greater defeat than he will face at the next Federal poll. Mr Johns-I would probably be a civilian if I were still in Victoria.",144
336,Mr BROADBENT,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"The honourable member probably would be a civilian in Victoria. I read Richard Farmer's article last Sunday in my home. I was disappointed, not because I could have sat there with glee and said, 'Look at the ALP', but because everything a politician does reflects on every politician across Australia at local, State and Federal levels. The people in the gallery should know that there are members of this House and every other House across Australia that actually care about their reputation. I say that from the bottom of my heart. I believe that the five members that I see sitting in this House are genuine in their approach to that too. I expect personal propriety from them. What the Labor Party has given us in this Bill is di-honesty, duplicity, insincerity and mendacity. This gives me the opportunity to say what we all have the right to say in this House and to present some of the things that the Labor Party is doing. Richard Farmer has been a friend of the honourable member for Brisbane for some time and supportive of the ALP-that is not fair because that may offend his journalistic reputation. Let me say that he has reasonably close contacts in the Labor Party. I respect some of the things that he puts forward. In the Canberra Times on Sunday, he stated: Labor Party fund raisers, so I am toldand I have already established his credibility-that he is close to the Labor Party; he knows what is going on and he is very close to the business communityhave been out doing the rounds of business trying to get the money together for the next election campaign. There's nothing strange about that but there is in the suggestion that Labor has found a way for companies to make donations without disclosing them. This should be embarrassing for every member of this House. I repeat it: There's nothing strange about that but there is in the suggestion that Labor has found a wayÂ· for companies to make donations without disclosing them. Here we are in this House with the honourable member for Brisbane genuinely standing up and defending what his Party has done in regard to disclosure. My Leader, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), stood up and said, 'We'll accept disclosure'. The Labor Party's political ad ban was a disaster, and then it sent people out oil its behalf to say it had found a way for companies to make donations without disclosing them. Richard Farmer went on to say: What a mockery this all makes of the so-called reforms to electoral laws that Labor pushed through last year. I remind members of this House, and all those surrounding and supporting me now, that when those laws were pushed through by those opposite-and. I mean pushed through, as we have been under guillotine. in this House for the last eight daysMr Johns-Not this week.",145
337,Mr BROADBENT,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"I am glad. Richard Farmer said: What a mockery this all makes of the so-called reforms to electoral laws that Labor pushed through last year. Alorig with banning television advertising during the campaign period, the new law was meant to close loopholesThat is what I believe the Labor Party is doing tonight in this Bill-that is, trying to close the loopholes of the mistakes that it made when the Bill was introduced into this and the other House. Our senators made all these offers and said, 'Look, these things will not work'. But the Labor Party rejected all that. The article went on to say: . . . regarding disclosure of donations to - litical parties. A new age of open funding was supposed to be upon us. And what do we have reported here? Can you believe it? Labor Party fund raisers . . . have found a way for companiesI regret that the honourable member for Brisbane is leaving, because I have not finished. MrBevis-I am coming back.",145
338,Mr BROADBENT,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"I know. Importantly, the article went on to say: . . . here are some people supposedly acting on behalf of the Labor Party that took the high moral ground last year out around the traps with their hands out peddling a scheme that enables secret . donations. The Parliamentary Secretary sits at the table and grins. Under the heading 'Pundraising failure', the article stated: Then cynically set out to circumvent the whole procedure! Mr Johns-What is the evidence?",146
339,Mr BROADBENT,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,Does the honourable member not believe Richard Parmer? It is in the newspaper. Mr Johns-In a Sunday rag.,146
340,Mr BROADBENT,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"It is not a Sunday rag. It is the strongest selling paper in Victoria on a Sunday. The article continued: There is little wonder that those in the business community who have been approached for money are wondering whether there is any place left for morality in public life. People wonder why politicians rate lower than used car salesmen. It is because of cynical acts like this. It does not matter how we lead our private lives or what we do. There. is always somebody in the Labor Party going out and scrubbing the lot of us. Talk about scrubbers I The article continued: My information is that, so far, the Labor fundraising efforts have been noticeably unsuccessful. While those involved in politics might not have changed, those in business have. There is now the beginning of an awareness that directors of public companies have an obligation not to engage in under-hand, if legal, activities. You will notice that I used the word ""beginning"". Despite the plethora of Royal commissionssuch as WA Inc that have exposed dubious connections between business and politics in recent years, no doubt not everyone has decided that the risk of exposure is not worth taking. There are bound to be some rich people out there who still believe that if it is legal then it is to permissible to do it. Richard Parmer went on to talk about political advertising. But one has to look at the background of why we are rebuilding this. The honourable member for Brisbane importantly referred to 'a new standard of ethics and propriety', but what did we get from him? We got this Richard Parmer article which appeared last Sunday. I was asking whether the honourable member for Brisbane is personally prepared to stand behind what his Party is doing. I do not believe that he is, and I do not believe the Parliamentary Secretary is either. He knows that people set out to circumvent what is happening with this Bill. They will do anything to get around disclosure. What are they going to do at the barbecue of the honourable member for Brisbane? They are going to say, 'Here, honourable member for Brisbane. Here are 20 cheques for $99. You will not have to tell them. I was here'. Nobody will want to know that they were at the honourable member's barbecue anyway. They will say, 'I will come along, but do not put me down. I am only coming because I'm yoUi'mate'. We have heard about the Western Australian scandals-and that is all they were--from 1983 onwards where corruption was linked closely to political donations. We have heard all about the gold tax luncheons. We do not want to see",146
341,Mr LAVARCH,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"Tell us about the Fitzgerald inquiry. Mr BROADBENT""""7Do not talk to me about the Fitzgerald inquiry. The Labor Party would not allow the Western Australians to do the same as it has allowed them to do in Queensland.

344,Mr BROADBENT,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"Senator Sibraa said that the honourable member for Brisbane tried for this type of legislation from 1977 till 1980. Did the honourable member think for one minute that Senator Sibraa might have been worried about what was happening? Did he think that Senator Sibraa might have been worried about where the funding was coming from or where it was going? Senator Sibraa was probably concerned knowing what else has happened. The honourable member for Brisbane has got the call from Wayne Swan. He said, 'Get down there, Arch'-he would call the honourable member for Brisbane 'Arch', but I would call him the honourable member for Brisbane- 'We have a few problems with this. Pull it out; straighten it up; go in for us.' Mr Johns-Higher standard of accountability. .",147
345,Mr BROADBENT,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"The Parliamentary Secretary at the table mentioned a higher standard of accountability. We are still trying to get the records and the identity of the people who poured the funds into the Labor Party's 1987 campaign. The sad part of all this is that the debt of the ALP stands at $9.1m, as reported in yesterday's papers. What got the Labor Party over the line? Mr Johns-What?",147
346,Mr BROADBENT,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,Does the Parliamentary Secretary not know? What was the debt caused by? It was caused by the factMr Johns-The TV as.,147
347,Mr BROADBENT,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"That is right, television as. So this was not about propriety; this was about dishonesty and duplicity. What got the Government over the line in 1984 and again in 1987 was communicating with the Australian people. But it has decided, 'We are going to deny that to the Liberal-National coalition'. Why is the Government going to deny that? It is excellent that there are students in this House this evening. I wish they had been here to hear the honourable membet for Brisbane. He did not say, 'Look, we are in trouble as a party. Electorally there is a disaster on. We are 29 per cent in the polls. Before Christmas we had a different Prime Minister and things were worse. We have a major financial problem. There is a way to fix it. We cannot afford the television as at the next election campaign. Cut them out'. What about the Australian people? What about freedom of speech? What about the opportunities for these people to choose? It does not matter, does it? That is what the Government says: it does not matter; these people do not matter. So out go the political as. What happens? There is a by-election for a council in southern New South Wales somewhere, and no-one is standing. There is only one candidate. But the Government takes the Victorian as-the guilty party as-off the television. Why? It is against the law. to bat No-one. ran them. We abide by the law in Victoria. We muck up our total economy by having an ALP Government, but I do not believe we wilLactually find corruption. There is destruction. Mr Johns-Not since. the Housing Commission land deals.",147
348,Mr BROADBENT,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"No, no. There was never a member of parliament charged for any of that, either. I am being kind to members opposite by saying that at the moment we do not believe there is any corruption in the Victorian Government.",147
349,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,The honourable member for Corinella might come back to the Bill before the House.,147
350,Mr BROADBENT,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"I am back on the Bill now. This is all part of the Bill, because it is about political advertising, and it is about disclosure.",147
351,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"No, the political advertising was dealt with in another Bill that has already been tabled.",148
352,Mr BROADBENT,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"I will not argue with you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have to say that, when it comes to the union movement and the way the money is filtered right through the union movement into the ALP, and the way unions are structured under this Government, if the unions in my elecJorate did not vote Russell Broadbent and the Liberal Party, I would not be elected. It is unfair of a union to transfer money on behalf of people to support one party when they are actually voting another way.",148
353,Mr LAVARCH,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,What do companies do to their shareholders when they do that?,148
354,Mr BROADBENT,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,I challenge the honourable member to come any time he likes and look at how I raise my funds. He will not find a major company that has even been anywhere near my fundraising. Mr Johns-I can believe that.,148
355,Mr BROADBENT,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"They did not know I existed. Although the Opposition supports this Bill, I have to say that the Bill toring a situation that was poor last year, and it is poor now. It is sad to. see members having to stand in this House and support the Bill just to fix something that was crook beforehand. In this country we find ourselves unable to communicate in the way that we should. This Government-the ALP Government-has taken decisions that have not been of great benefit to the nation. Whether it be in the financial area; whether it be in Treasury; whether it be in tax or of the other areas that have been mentioned in this House today, we are supporting this Bill because it is trying to bring some order to the situation. The law can be used without exposing-as the honourable member for Brisbane did-the Bill's inadequacy in that it exposes everybody who works for a political party. It exposes what people earn, what their conditions are, how they go about their work and all those things. There have been major mistakes made with the Bill. I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to speak on the Bill. I am glad that there were students in the gallery. I hope they grab hold of this article and use it for one of their projects-although there are parts that are not very kind to us, either. I will say that I am sorry about the falsehood that is encompassed in the Bill. I am sorry about the fact that we have had a cause for perceived corruption that no-one has ever been charged with, and that we have had to for introduce laws like this. My Party is about freedom-freedom of speech, freedom to express oneself, freedom to choose whom we want to give to, and freedom to receive. We are about honesty, the integrity of members of this House, other Houses and at local government level. (TIme expired)",148
356,Mr LAVARCH,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"As it is the last sitting evening of a very long session, I think honourable members might forgive the honourable member for Corinella (Mr Broadbent) for that contribution. He is a member for whom I have great fondness, but he only fleetingly visited the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill in his contribution. We had a fairly wide canvass of a lot of current issues-at least current in the mind of the honourable member. Few of them actually is only res- dealt with the Bill. Inasmuch as he did deal with the Bill, and the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) raised some pointS, I would like to respond. The Liberal Party tells us tonight that it is supporting the Bill, and since the declaration of its Leader, the Leader of the Opposition, (Dr Hewson), it supports the concept of political disclosure. That was a development that was very warmly welcomed some by the Government and the Labor Party. As the honourable member for Brisbarie (Mr Bevis) disclosed in his contribution, the Labor Party in this Parliament has, for many, many years, promoted the concept of full political disclosure so that Australians know who is actually putting money into their political parties. When governments make very big decisions that affect companies, trade unions and every . Australian, the Australian people have some idea of where the money behind the parties is coming from. They know where the money that pays for the advertising and the campaigning is coming from. As the honourable member for Brisbane pointed out, the Liberal Party has traditionally resisted the concept disclosue very fiercely. Even though at a national level, in this Parliament, the leaderMal ship of the Liberal Party. supports political funding disclosure, it is not a view which has been warmly embraced by all elements of the conservative parties. As the honourable member for Brisbane pointed out, the State Liberal Party and the National Party in Queensland are still quite stridently on the public record opposing political funding disclosure. The National Party has a very chequered history on these issues, particularly in Queensland. It is very strongly opposed to the concept of disclosure. The Liberal Party is lukewarm about this Bill at the Federal level, and it raises a few qualms. It says, 'If you have disclosure, you open people up to threats and thuggery'. It always says, 'If a business donates to the Liberal Party, then the trade unions are going to know which company that is, and they are going to move in and give it a hard time'. Despite hearing this claim from the Liberal Party and the National Party, and having listened to these debates wheri this Bill was first discussed, and again tonight, I have never actually heard one example of that occurring. It is always this 'perceived' threat-a word the honourable member for Corinella used-of thuggery occurring. However, where we have seen some thuggery, and where we have seen some threats made, it has been on behalf of the Liberal and National parties. I bring to mind the famous statement of the Liberal Leader in Victoria, Mr Kennett, when he was talking about public servants who might dare to stand as candidates for the Labor Party in the State election. Mr Kennett's famous quote is, 'If they are public servants andÂ· they stand for the Labor Party, they won't be public servants if they don't win the poll and they try to get back into the Public Service'. Mr Broadbent-He didn't say that.",148
357,Mr LAVARCH,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"He did indeed say that. I do not even need to go to Victoria to see what those in the Liberal Opposition might say, because I have lived in Queensland all my life and I have seen the National Party of and the Liberal Party in operation. I suppose another fairly good example is that of Senator Colston. Before the good senator was elected to the Parliament he had stood unsuccessfully for the Labor Party. At the time he stood he was a teacher in the employ of the Queensland Education Department. The retribution which Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen and his Government iriflicted on Senator Colston for his nerve in actually declaring himself as a Labor Party supporter and a candidate for the Labor Party, of course, now forms part of the political folklore in Queensland. I do not need the nebulous example of unions, sometime in the future, maybe doing something if the donation is disclosed; we have actually seen things occur in Queensland. We have had the threat already of Mr Kennett. We then had the reference to Western Australia and where the money which the royal commission is inquiring into has led. Despite the hypocrisy of the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) and his ratherÂ· sordid involvement in seeking out funds from the gold industry in Western Australia-despite the hypocrisy of the Liberal Party having that issue within its own ranks-we can put that to one side because there are some very good examples in Western Australia which point to a very great need for legislation of this kind. One very good example occurred during the last Federal election in the division of Stirling. As the House would recall, the result in Stirling was very close. The honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) was returned by only a handful of votes. However, he was a good member and he managed, no doubt through his strong personal work in that electorate, to get himself over the line. Running against him was a very credible and strong Liberal Party opponent by the name of Jock Barker. Mr Barker has raised some very interesting allegations and questions about the funding of campaigns within the division of Stirling. They revolved around the fact that during the campaign a flier appeared and was sent, apparently, to about 1,500 small businesses and individuals in the electorate of Stirling. The flier was headed 'An urgent message to people who make their living from business' and was directed to small business people. That flier stated, 'At the time of writing, Barker's campaign is in need of $20,000'. The flier said, 'To guarantee the most effective campaign possible we need funds now', and decried the so-called evils of the Labor Party and urged people to make donations. This is very interesting. This flier was out at that stage by Mr Ian Campbell, who was the president of the Stirling division. Subsequently, great honour has been bestowed upon Mr Ian Campbell, who is nowMr Broadbent-No, he is a senator.",149
358,Mr LAVARCH,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"A senator; the honourable member is right. I probably speak too highly. Anyway, Mr Campbell is now a senator in Parliament. There is nothing wrong with that. A flier went out to businesses urging donations on behalf of the Liberal Party candidate in Stirling. Time goes by. What becomes interesting are the letters which Mr Barker ends up writing to the State Treasurer and the Executive Director of the Liberal Party in Western Australia. The letter to Mr Nutt, the Executive Director of the Liberal Party of Western Australia-a very aptly named gentleman to hold that position for the Liberal Party in Western Australia, I would imagineMr Sciacca-How do you spell that?",150
359,Mr LAVARCH,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"N-U-T-T. Mr Barker's letter to Mr Nutt says, 'I want to make some inquiries about this flier that went out to small businesses in my electorate'. He said that the fliers were sent out without his knowledge, without his approval and that they were not authorised as part of his campaign. In fact, he says that his campaign workers were a bit annoyed because they were out there trying to gather some funds for their campaign, and suddenly the flier appeared in the name of Mr Campbell. That is all dght. However, what is not aU right is what has happened to the money. What has happened to the money? Mr Barker raised a few points in his letter to Mr Nutt. He said that the fundraising activity carried out using the flier which carried the name of his campaign was not associated with his campaign. That was point No. 1. Point No. 2 was that his campaign did Jock not benefit in any way from the particular fundraising activity. So he got none of the money that was involved. Mr Barker said: Those who donated in response to the 'flier' did so in the belief that they were assisting my campaign. The fact was that they were not assisting Mr sent Barker's campaign. Interestingly, Mr Barker goes on to point out that he believed that about $8,500 was raised. He asked whether some information could be supplied from Liberal Party headquarters as to what happened to the money. The letter continues. Mr Barker said that he had information that the flier was part of a direct marketing campaign being conducted by a company associated with the Liberal Party in Western Australia. It also appears that the people who ran the fundraising campaign were creaming off the top of the donations, supposedly going to Mr Barker's campaign, a little bit of commission for themselves-no doubt to cover expenses. Mr Hulls-Shamel",150
360,Mr LAVARCH,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"I know it is hard to believe. We never see this sort of thing in Queensland. Apparently, it must be commonplace in Western Australia. Of course, this raises a few interesting issues. The first is what has actually happened to the money. Mr Barker said that he did not receive it. He asked the Liberal Party to respond to him concerning what had happened to the money and whether in fact it was disclosed. In his letter he said that he and his local campaign did not declare the money, because he did not receive it. He said that he had not seen any evidence of the money being disclosed. I am very pleased that the honourable member raised the spectre of Western Australia and, supposedly, all the evils which flow from Western Australia, because there does seem to be a bit of a problem over there. It seems to be very much centred on the Liberal Party. It seems that Mr Barker, for one, within the division of Stirling, had some very interesting questions to ask regarding the procedures adopted by the Liberal Party in the last Federal election campaign. That brings us back to the central theme: why do we need this legislation? We need the legislation so that we know where the money is going; so that we can follow the money trail. That is important in a democracy. The Liberal Party, not only in its economic and social policies but also, apparently, in its campaigning, is very fond of the American model. We have had the recent example of the gun':at-the-head poster which the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) was circulating and was a direct steal, it wouldÂ· appear, from a similar campaign poster used by the Republican Party in the State of Texas. We now also have an American-style fundraising convention. This is the national convention which is not actually to discuss any Liberal Party policy. Do honourable members recall that one? This is the convention to which people can go to meet the leaders and the movers and shakers in the Liberal Party and feel good and buy a stall. People can set up their AMP stall or insurance stall and what have you and throw their money. Interestingly, if one believes the Australian Financial Review-I am only taking' this from that publication because I have no other knowledge-one of the issues raised in particular by the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) related to unions donating to the Labor Party so that they could get access to party leaders. It is quite clearly stated by the Liberal Party(Quorum formed) I was pointing out to the House before that unnecessary quorum, called by the Opposition to waste time-those in the gallery will note that absolutely no Opposition members are here-that the Liberal Party has very much embraced this American style of campaigning: not just the campaign leaflet showing a gun pointing at someone's head but also the idea of buying access to' the leadership and to important people in the Party. If honourable members believe what the Australian Financial Review says, for a measly $10,000 one can get very good access to the Liberal Party leadership. People can see the Leader of the Opposition for $10,000. I suppose that is a bargain at any pricel When we recall the example of fundraising by the Liberal Party candidate in the division of Stirling in Western Australia, when we recall the National Party fundraising concerning the Joh for PM campaign in 1987 and everything which flowed from that, we can see that Australia does need disclosure legislation. Tonight we are not simply discussing whether we should have such legislation but whether we should have some minor, and fairly technical, amendments to it. The amendments, as have been canvassed by most honourable members participating in the d-bate, will simply make the provisions a little more workable for the basic mass organisation of the parties, for the branch meetings and for ordinary party members in running their raffles and their basic fundraising activities, so that there is not an over-onerous burden placed on these people in keeping their records. They are sensible amendments, and I am glad that both the Liberal Party and the National Party are supporting them. But I point out again that, even though they are supporting this Bill, deep down they still do not support the concept of disclosure. They do not support it throughout their various State elements. As the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) has pointed out, the Liberal and National parties in Queensland state very strongly in their submissions to the ERC that they do not support the concept of political disclosure. One does not have to wonder too hard as to why the National Party, particularly in Queensland, does not want to support political disclosure. We have a terrible spectacle in Queensland, where virtually an entire National Party Cabinet is either on bail, awaiting trial, in gaol or out on parole at this stage. A lot of that is as a result of the misappropriation of public funds. It is no wondet that a party which attracts those sorts of people to its ranks is not particularly interested in having full and fair political funding disclosure. This is a sensible Bill. It makes some minor and technical amendments to the law which will help the. party organisations from both sides of the Parliament. The basic tenet of the law is strongly supported by the Government and, I believe, a little lukewarmly by the Opposition.",150
361,Mr JOHNS,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"Petrie-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services) (9.25 p.m.)-in reply-Honourable members will recall that the honourable member for Corinella (Mr Broadbent) in his contribution said he had read an article by Richard Farmer, a man who is well known to all of us. I asked the honourable member for Corinella to be specific about the allegations that were made by Mr Farmer in that Sunday article. Of course, the honourable member for Corinella could not be specific because Mr Farmer was not specific about the supposed illegal methods that the Labor Party had used to raise funds. I can assure the honourable member for Corinella and all members of this House, and especially those who made an excellent contribution to this debate-the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) and the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch)-that there are no fundraising schemes on behalf of the Labor Party that contravene the Commonwealth Electoral Act. This is the Act that ensures it is impossible to raise funds for political purposes without disclosure. We are insulted by Richard Farmer's article and by the lack of specifics in his allegations. I just want to read to this House the response to Richard Farmer's article by Mr Gary Gray, the Director of Fundraising for the National Secretariat of the ALP. Mr Gray, in his letter of 3 June 1992 to the editor of the Canberra TImes, Mr David Annstrong, said: Dear Me Annstrong, As the Director of Fundraising at the Labor Party national secretariat, I was surprised to read Richard Farmer's commentS about fundraising, Canberra Times, 1 June. Me Farmer's unsubstantiated allegation that Labor fundraisers are seeking donations without consequent disclosure is wrong. In his article Me Farmer asserted that he has been told of improper fundraising activities by the Labor Party. He did not provide evidence or even a reference to prove this accusation. Honourable members will recall that is precisely what I was asking of the honourable member for Corinella. The letter continued: I would have expected Me Farmer to check his story with the National Secretariat. Checking facts is a fundamental part of good journalism. As the Party's director of Fundraising, I am not aware of any Labor Party fundraising activity which avoids or seeks to avoid the Act. In my work I seek donations from many companies. Those who make donations are made aware of the disclosure provisions and the desirability of disclosure. There is no national fundraising activity which seeks to avoid disclosure, and on this basis Me Farmer's article is both misleading and wrong. Yours sincerely, Gary Gray, Director of Fundraising. I remind the honourable member for Corinella that a cheap article written in a Sunday paper by Mr Farmer proves nothing. I sought evidence from the honourable member for Corinella. He could not provide it. I, along with Mr Gray and other members of the Labor Party, are insulted by the Farmer article. I commend all the elements of the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill to the House. I remind honourable members on my side that no amendments have been put by the Opposition. It too is happy with this Bill because it will outlaw for all time any rorts that political parties might pull in order to raise funds. The remarks of the honourable member for Brisbane remind me that we have been running this campaign for 15 years to ensure that all donations to political parties are disclosed and that there is an open book on this matter. That is something that the Liberal and National parties have resisted for a very long time. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

362,Ms MCHUGH,AUSTRALIAN SPORTS DRUG,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. It is with a great deal of pleasure that I introduce the Australian Sports Drug Agency Amendment Bill in the House. Purpose of the Bill This Bill is for an Act to amend the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990. These amendments have become necessary due to recent developments overseas and in Australia. Background Honourable members are no doubt familiar with the recent publicity concerning an Australian cyclist who tested positive for anabolic steroids and subsequently was able to avoid sanctions on a legal technicality. has made the Government determined to ensure that athletes who cheat on their fellow competitors, their sport and themselves are not able to escape the sanctions they justly deserve. The amendments to the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act proposed in this Bill will do just that. The Bill also makes provision for a coordinated and national approach to the elimination of drug abuse in sport. Honourable members may not know that over the past 18 months there have been extensive discussions on the subject of complementary State and Territory anti-doping legislation. At the meeting of all State and Territory sports Ministers last year, t-e Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) was able to achieve unanimous agreement that such complementary legislation is desirable, and each State and Territory sports Minister gave a commitment to introduce such legislation. This Bill enables the Commonwealth to honour its undertaking to provide for that complementary legislation. Australia is at the leading edge of international developments in the fight against drugs in sport. Before this year, it had executed international anti-doping arrangements with Canada and the United Kingdom. This year New Zealand and Norway have joined Australia. A strategy to expand the list of participating countries is being developed. One of the Australian Sports Drug Agency's functions is to ensure Australia's compliance with these arrangements. This Bill will ensure that the Agency has the necessary authority to perfonn this function. Major Features of the Bill I would like to spend a little time advising honourable members of the details of the proposed amendments. As I have indicated, this Bill makes provision for the Australian States and Territories to confer broader powers on the Australian Sports Drug Agency through complementary anti-doping legislation currently proposed by all States and Territories. It will also allow the Agency to work more closely with the States and Territories This to ensure a consistent and comprehensive approach towards the elimination of prohibited drugs and doping methods in sport. The Australian Sports Drug Agency will now test, both in Australia and overseas, a wider range of athletes for the presence of prohibited drugs. This will include foreign athletes when the test is sought by an overseas anti-doping authority, or when the test is conducted under a contractual arrangement which the Australian Sports Drug Agency may now enter into. The Agency must be able to recognise procedures adopted by foreign anti-doping authorities which conduct tests on its behalf so it can act on the result of those tests. These amendments will enable the procedures followed by such an authority to be recog:nised for the purposes of the Act, even if these procedures do not precisely mirror those set out in the Australian Sports Drug Agency regulations. The minimum standard to be adopted and recognised in such cases will now be that provided for in the International Olympic Charter Against Doping in Sport. This does not mean that there is anything wrong with the current regulations; it is merely an amendment which acknowledges that the Australian procedures are stricter and more precise than the internationally accepted standard of the Olympic charter. The Bill also provides athletes with the opportunity to make a submission to the Agency challenging the validity of a positive test result, if the athlete considers that procedures in the following specified areas were not complied with: sealing of the container holding the sample; testing of the sample by an accredited laboratory; or evidence of tampering with the sample. If the Agency decides the test was valid, the competitor will be entitled to apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to have the decision reviewed. If the AAT reverses the Agency's decision, the competitor's name must be removed from the register. Even if the athlete does not make a submission- the Agency will be required to verify that all procedures relating to these specific matters were followed before validating a positive test result. It will no longer be required to check procedures where non-compliance would not cast doubt on the test result. Other amendments provide for written notification to approved sporting and antidoping organisations of a positive test result or a refusal to provide a sample. Where this is not possible, alternative arrangements have been provided so that athletes cannot hinder the process by purppsely avoiding the notice. Many international sporting federations require advice of a possible positive test result to satisfy their own doping policy. This Bill will - nable .the Agency to satisfy such requests in certain specified circumstances. The name of the register will be changed to 'Register of Notifiable Events'. This will reduce the misconception that the entry of a person's name on the register implies some finding of 'guilt'. The notion of guilt has never intended to be associated with the entry of names on the register. The question of guilt and application of sanctions is and has always been a matter for sporting organisations, not the Agency. This Bill recognises the need to give minors special consideration, by providingÂ· for the removal of a name from the register once the period of any sanction imposed by sporting organisations has elapsed, if at the time of the request to provide a sample the person was under 18 years of age. The Australian Sports Drug Agency is increasingly being recognised overseas and domestically as having the professional expertise to arrange for the collection and testing of samples to detect the presence of prohibited drugs, and therefore will be called on more and more to arrange such tests overseas and in Australia, at the request of both overseas and Australian authorities and sporting organisations. This Bill includes amendments which will give it the power to enter into contracts or arrangements with overseas governments and other sporting authorities and anti-doping authorities to arrange for the collection and testing of samples. Under the current international anti-doping arrangements with Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Norway each country has agreed that in another country, their athletes will be subject to the domestic testing regime of the host country. As a result, there will be occasions when, even though the Agency has made no request for a test, it will receive information on the results of tests on Australian athletes conducted by overseas anti-doping authorities. It may also receive similar information from other foreign antidoping bodies. The Bill includes amendments which enable the Agency to pass this information to the same persons or organisations that it would pass similar information to if it had conducted the test. These include the athlete, the sporting organisations of which the athlete is a member and, if Commonwealth funding through the Australian Sports Commission is involved, the Commission. However, it may only pass this information on if it is satisfied that, at the time the sample was requested, the anti-doping body was following procedures which were in accord with the Olympic charter. There are many anti-doping bodies throughout the world. For example, as international sporting federations arrange for the collection and testing of samples for the purpose of detecting prohibited substances, each could be regarded as an anti-doping body. As more and more countries adopt similar anti-doping regimes to Australia, the number of anti-doping bodies will increase dramatically. Some may not be as meticulous and thorough as the Australian Sports Drug Agency. To ensure the interests of Australian athletes are protected, the Agency will have to screen these anti-doping bodies to ensure that their procedures accord with the internationally accepted standard, that is, the Olympic charter. The amendments allow the Australian Sports Drug Agency to approve foreign anti-doping bodies which adopt at least standards provided for in the Olympic charter and will be required to maintain a list of such bodies. The Agency will also be given the power to request such an approved body to take a sample from a competitor who is an Australian citizen or permanent resident when that competitor is overseas. Financial Impact Statement There will be. no additional financial obligations imposed on the Commonwealth by this Bill. Any additional costs arising from the Agency entering into contracts or arrangements with overseas sporting organisations or anti-doping bodies will be fully recovered, while the cost of additional tests, resulting from complementary legislation passed by States and Territories, will be borne by the States and Territories. I commend this Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Costello) adjourned. NA BILL 1992 First Reading Bill received from the Senate, and read a first time. Second Reading",153
363,Ms MCHUGH,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. Today I bring before the House a Bill to implement the Government's foreshadowed reform of product liability. The Bill represents the culmination of a process of legislative development which began over five years ago. The sorry state of Australia's existing product liability laws has been the subject of reports from the National Consumer Affairs Advisory Council, the Australian Law Reform Commission and the Industry Commission. All accept that an irresistible case exists for updating and simplifying the existing law. We need a system which promotes economic efficiency and provides justice to victims who suffer loss caused by defective products. Internationally, too, the need to make a manufacturer strictly liable for its defective products has been recognised in the development and implementation in the European Community of the 1985 EC product liability directive. Indeed, the EC directive appears in fact to be the emerging international standard for product liability legislation. I understand that, in our own region, the governments of Japan, South Korea and Taiwan are also showing a clear interest in introducing legislation based on the directive. In December last year the then Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, brought the Trade Practices Amendment Bill (No.2) 1991 before the Senate. That Bill followed the 1985 EC product liability directive in all important respects. Despite the extensive debate on this issue which had already occurred, he believed it was important to allow all interested parties adequate time to examine the terms of the Bill before it was debated. The senator therefore decided to introduce the Bill in December as an exposure draft and allow it to lie on the table over-the Christmas recess. He undertook to conduct a full and comprehensive process of consultation and encouraged all who had an interest in the Bill to examine it carefully and provide any comments which they wished to make. Senator Tate received a great many submissions from a wide variety of sources in response to this offer, including consumer groups, peak industry bodies, commercial organisations, businesses and interested members of the public. These were of great benefit in considering the extent to which the language of the Bill met the policy objectives. A number of the suggestions and matters highlighted in the submissions have been taken up in the further development of the Bill. Both Senator Tate and I thank all those who have taken a genuine interest in this matter for their input into the process of the development of this legislation. The Government has chosen to proceed with the changes to the 1991 Bill by withdrawing that Bill and introducing a clean Bill rather than by way of moving a series of Government amendments. As Senator Tate stated in his second reading speech in December last year, this reform is the most significant legislative development in the reform of consumer protection in recent times. It assist all those with an interest in this maHer to have access to a clear, consolidated Bill. Similarly, given the significant reforms introduced by this Bill, the explanatory memorandum is likely to be important in the development of the body of jurisprudence which will surround the new regime. It will therefore be beneficial for one definitive explanatory document to be produced to prevent confusion in the interpretation of the new legislation. Features of the Bill The key features of the Bill are as A manufacturer or importer of goods is to be strictly liable for defects in those goods. Goods are defective when they do not provide the degree of safety which persons generally are entitled to expect, taking into account all the circumstances including the way the goods were marketed or labelled, and the likely uses to which the goods will be put. This is an objective test: it is the objective knowledge and expectations of the community which determine whether a product is defective, not the subjective knowledge and expectations of the claimant. The claimant will not have to prove negligence. The difficulty in proving negligence is one of the factors identified in existing law which can lead to injustice. A product will not be held to be defective simply because a better, safer product is subsequently put into circulation. This should ensure that the regime does not stifle product development or innovation. Where a defect in a product results in someone being killed or injured, or where an individual's property is damaged as a result of a defect in goods, the manufacturer or importer is liable to pay compensation for that loss without the need for the person to prove that the manufacturer was negligent. The claimant will have to prove on the balance of probabilities that the product supplied by the manufacturer was defective, and that the defect in the product was the cause of the loss. It is a matter of public record that the Government's intention in introducing this will regime is that Australian consumers who are injured by defective goods should be placed in a position which is no less advantageous than that enjoyed generally by their European counterparts in the same situation. While on paper the EC directive places the burden of proof of all elements of the claim on the claimant, it should also be recalled that it was prepared on the understanding that member States would continue to utilise their existing rules of evidence and procedure in dealing with cases brought under the directive. In practice this means that, in many EC countries-including the United Kingdom, follows. Ireland, Germany, France and Italyclaimants have the advantage of a variety of procedural and evidentiary devices which assist plaintiffs to make out their cases. In some countries, it is said that the effect of these local rules will go so far as to shift the burden of proof entirely on a number of key evidential issues. In contrast, under this proposal, it is clear that the onus of proof on the issues going to liability remains firmly with the injured person. Nevertheless, it is the Government's firm hope that in applying this legislation in the Australian context the courts in this country will wish to acquaint themselves fully with both the emerging jurisprudence in Europe and these procedural and evidential matters. It is vitally important that the interests of consumers and manufacturers alike be protected by ensuring that the new Australian law operates in a manner which is consistent with the laws in the marketplaces of our major overseas trade competitors. This issue will be the major challenge facing the courts .as they come to terms with this new legislation. And, for reasons I will give in a moment, it will continue to be an issue for the Government and this Parliament. The Bill provides a number of defences. Manufacturers will not be liable if they can show that the existence of the defect was incapable of being ascertained by any means-the state-of-the-art defence-or where the defect came into existence after the product left the manufacturer's control. A component manufacturer can escape liability if it can show that the component was only defective because of the design, markings, instructions or warnings of the product in which the component was incorporated. The manufacturer will also not be liable where the product was defective only because it .complied with a mandatory standard imposed by a government. Where the sole cause of a defect was compliance with a mandatory standard imposed by the Commonwealth Government, the Commonwealth will be liable to compensate the claimant for the loss. In line with the EC directive and the recommendations of the Industry Commission, compensation can be reduced or disallowed to take account of any acts of the claimant which contributed to the loss. The Trade Practices Commission will be empowered to take representative actions on behalf of one or more consumers who have a product liability claim. However, the Commission will be required to obtain the prior consent in writing of those claimants whom it is to represent. Reference of Issues to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. As I have already said, the Bill which was introduced last December followed the EC directive in all important respects. However, the Government has never believed that the directive represented the ideal product liability legislation. On the contrary, in many ways it represents the inevitable result of an attempt to achieve uniformity where. a number of disparate interests are involved-a lowest common denominator. Honourable members will be aware that the Bill introduced last year significantly differed from the EC directive in three important areas: the period of repose was extended from 10 years to 20 years in the case of personal injuries; overseas consumers were given the right to sue Australian manufacturers of defective products; and a provision was designed to ensure an injured person his or her day in court where it was reasonable to infer from direct and circumstantial evidence that a defect in the product caused the loss. Opposition to these elements threatened to once again delay the introduction of this important legislation and perpetuate the inequities recognised by all to be part of the current system. And, as I have already noted, injured Australians have already waited five years while this matter has been under consideration. , Rather than allow further delay to occur, the Government has decided that the best course of action is to remove the controversial elements of the proposal for consideration by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. These matters can now be exaniined in an objective and constructive way by an all-party committee of the Senate. This will provide the proper forum for those who have expressed concerns to articulate their views in a public way. It will also allow consumer groups to put their case publicly from a position of equal standing for the first time since these reforms were proposed. I am confident that in such a forum a range of issues which have hitherto been the subject of misapprehension can be dispassionately examined and that the true balance between the interests of consumers and manufacturers will becomeÂ· clear to all. I am satisfied that the enactment of these proposals will still represent a considerable advance for consumers and achieve my fundamental goal of getting the new foundations for product liability law finnly in place. Financial Impact Statement The Bill primarily confers legal rights upon individuals to institute legal proceedings. No direct increase in public expenditure is required to administer the regime. There may be a need to consider increased funding for the Federal Court and the Trade Practices Commission if product liability becomes a significant part of their workload, but this is likely to occur for some considerable time, if at all. There may be costs arising from the imposition of Commonwealth liability for products which are defective solely because they complied with a mandatory standard imposed by the Commonwealth. The impact of Commonwealth liability for defective standards, however, is not expected to be great. The Bill will ensure that it is the person who was responsible for putting the defective goods into circulation who will be liable to compensate those people who are injured because of the goods. This will benefit the whole community. There will eventually be some increased cost to business as a result of the new law. However, European experience under a very similar regime has shown that this. cost will be almost imperceptible in the initial years and very gradual after that. The Bill will also undoubtedly encourage improved design, evaluation and enhanced quality control. This Bill will not only create a more equitable system of rights, but will also improve Australia's overall economic efficiency. Australian manufacturers will be required to produce goods which meet this international standard as part of their push to achieve international competitiveness. I also believe that Australian consumers are entitled to the same level of protection as is available to consumers where the EC directive operates. I present the explanatory memorandum and commend the Bill to the House. Leave granted for debate to continue forthwith.",155
364,Mr COSTELLO,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Higgins) (9.54 p.m.)The speech just given by the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh) on the Trade Practices Amendment Bill was, of course, a prepared text, read by her faithfully, which was prepared for her by the office of the former Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate). I must say that the new Minister read the speech faithfully and uttered everything that had been put in the prepared text. It is lucky that she does not not know what lies behind this whole episode for, if she did, even she would have had pangs of conscience about the statements that she faithfully read from the prepared text to this House and through this House to the Australian people. True it is that this Bill deals with the liability of manufacturers for defects in goods. But the fact is that this is the fourth v-rsion of the Bill. I will take the House through the way in which this Bill has developed over the last year, and I will show that, far from indicating that this Bill now comes before the House because the Government has listened and has had discussions and has come to agreement, this final version comes before this House because the former Minister, who twisted and turned and squirmed and tried to avoid it for 12 months, was finally forced to come down with it. This is the version of the Bill that the coalition argued for from the outset but on which the former Minister wasted a year of squirming and turning before he accepted it. Between May 1991 and the present, the coalition has been rock solid on this Bill. The way in which this Bill comes into the House now indicates that we were right from the outset. This is an admission that we were right from the outset and if Senator Tate, the former Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, had listened to the coalition at the outset he could have saved himself one year, four drafts, cutting and pasting, squinning, arguing and losing to get to this final position. . But on another level, this is an illustration of how the Parliament can work. In this case we had a Minister with a bad proposal. He was a Minister of a government that had a majority in the Parliament that could have steamrolled, as it frequently does, bad legislation through. But as a result of public pressure, as a result of Opposition argument and, in the final analysis, as a result of a revolt from his own back bench, this Minister with bad legislation was forced to back down. In a way, it is an illustration of how the Parliament can actually work well. It is an example of the Parliament stopping a Minister with a bad proposal from proceeding. I would like to thank all of those business groups which supported the cqalition's stand on this Bill. There were so many of thembig and small-which, with one mind and one voice, came out and supported the position that we took on behalf of the Australian business community. I would like to thank them for courageously supporting the stand that the coalition took. I would like to thank the thousands of small business proprietors throughout this country who inundated my office and that of my colleagues, and I trust that of Senator Tate too, to draw attention to how bad his proposals were.Â· They, too, played a very big part in changing the proposals that now come before this House. Those people supported the stand I took, the stand the coalition took and the stand which has been vindicated by the final form of this Bill tonight. The big issue in argument over 12 months and four drafts in relation to this what may appear to be a technical legal argument in some respects but is so important in practice; namely, when it comes to proving liability, who should bear the onus of proof? This Bill seeks to introduce manufacturers' liability for defective products. The big that we argued about for nearly 12 months and thatÂ· the Government has now conceded is that, in accordance with every other law allocating liability, and in accordance with the I said: normal rules of civil procedure, 'he who The asserts must prove'. The plaintiff should bear the onus of proof. The Government's original proposals were announced on 13 May 1991. It said that manufacturers would be liable for defects, but the onus of proof was to be imposed on the manufacturer. Products causing loss would be assumed defective unless proven otherwise. Senator Tate, in his press statement of 13 May 1991, said: On the key question of who should bear the onus of proving a product is defective, the Government has reached a compromise position which should be acceptable to both industry groups and consumers. We have taken a lead from the Industry Commission which has said that it would be more economically efficient to require the manufacturer to show a defect does not exist. It is reversal of the onus of proof. If a product caused loss it would be assumed defective until provenÂ· not defective. Senator Tate justified the Government's announcement on the grounds that it was the de facto effect of the Ee law, but the Ee council directive of 25 July 1985, however, was quite to the contrary. Article 4 states: The injured person shall be required to prove the damage, the defect and the causal relationship between defect and damage. If this article had the de facto effect of imposing the onus of proof on the manufacturer, one wonders why Senator Tate was not inclined to leave it there by merely adopting the Ee wording. The fact that he was not, indicates he was not too sure it did have such an effect. The clue to his very strange position lay in the words of his press statement: The Government has reached a compromise position which should be acceptabl- to both has been industry groups and consumers. Senator Tate was holding out to industry that he proposed nothing other than the de facto . situation in Europe, but by proposing to reverse the clear terms of the European directive, he wanted to hold out to consumer issue groups that he proposed something very different. When that proposal was first made, I issued a press statement on 13 May 1991 entitled, 'Think again on Product Liability'. new proposals are not the European directive Which leaves the onus of proof with the claimant. This is the traditional position of the common law which requires that 'he who asserts must prove'. The onus of proof should be left with the claimant. By November 1991, Senator Tate realised he was in deep trouble on this and he reversed his position. He put out a press release saying that the onus of proof would not be statutorily reversed. In response, I put out a statement on 11 November 1991 entitled 'Tate beginning to see the light'. I welcomed the fact that he had abandoned or announced the abandonment of his intention to reverse the onus of proof. I said: The Opposition will carefully scrutinise the detail of the Government's amended proposal and oppose any attempt to reverse the onus of proof through a back-door method. We knew that there, had already been an attempt to hold out different results to different groups. All we had was a statement that there would not be a reversal of the onus of proof. We wanted to be sure that Senator Tate did not take the advantage of ambiguity in further legislation and try to accomplish the same result with different words, . ThJa,tI w,las our fear. ,Unfortunately, our fear was prov ! absolutely cO-f-t because when the Bill rtext came out-l!nis was the Bill of December 1991; this Bill actually got into the Senateand was introduced on 19 December 1991 into the Senate, it was called the Trade Practices Amendment Bill (No.2) 1991. It had a proposed new section on the onus of proof, the famous section 75AJ, which said: In a liability action, if, on the evidence (whether direct or circumstantial) and in all the circumstances of the case, it is reasonable to infer that loss was caused by a defect in goods, then the inference must be made. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what that meant and why it was there, because the point was that if this was going to be treated like any other liability regime, and if the onus of proof was going to be on the plaintiff-like it is in ordinary civil litigation-one did not need any of these sections. If Senator Tate was going to make good his promise of November 1991, it was very surprising that this actually appeared there. I asked myself the questions: what does it mean? Why is it there? Why is it necessary? If Senator Tate is showing good faith, why does he need a draft like this? The more I looked at it, the more I came to the conclusion that it was just another attempt in different words to affect the onus of proof. This clause became known as the little Aussie battler clause. The little Aussie battler clause was not going to reverse' the onus of proof, it was somehow going to allow common sense claims to proceed. The explanatory memorandum told us that it would ensure common sense claims are not struck out on procedural or technical grounds. But there was nothing in the clause that tried to restrict it to common sense claims. All claimants could take advantage of it. There was nothing in the clause that related to striking out statements of claim, no case submissions or anything like that. When the legal opinion came in, and some very good opinions were sought and obtained and provided to Senator Tate, they came to the same conclusion that I had and that was that in a very real way, the so-called little Aussie battler provision was a de facto reversal of the I nus of ProOf. and Senator Tate had not made e good his promise of November 1991. That as the view that became apparent on what, , y tha- stage, was the second proposal, the proposal of December 1991. I am sure I had something to say about that at the time, too. I made the point that the farrtous section 75AJ, as it then was, was unnecessary and ought to be deleted. Then we came to the third draft of the Bill. The third draft of the Bill did not even get into the Parliament, it had such a short life. It was produced on 27 April 'and comprehensively leaked to the Australian Financial Review; This had another version of the so-called little Aussie battler provision, although now it was not called section 75AJ. By this stage, I think it was called section 75AL. This was another provision again and another attempt at different wording to try to produce an ambiguous and duplicitous purpose. Section 75AL read like this, 'In considering whether a liability action is to be stayed or dismissed, if on the evidence, whether direct or circumstantial, and in all the circumstances of the case it is reasonable to infer, that loss was caused by defect in goods, then the inference is to be made'. I might describe that as the little, Aussie battler provision. It was getting 'littler' by this stage, but it was still mired in confusion. So we had the little, little Aussie battler provision, which was draft three. That one did not even get into the Parliament, as I said, because on 6 May-honourable members will not see anything about this in the prepared script they gave the Minister for Consumer Affairs; they did not tell her about this, they just stuck her up with the prepared script-the then Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs was forced by the back bench of the Labor Party to withdraw it. The back bench of the Labor Party showed a lot of wisdom on this. Bernard Lagan in the Sydney Morning Herald of 7 May 1992 reported that the Minister for Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, had been forced by his back bench to withdraw key parts of his consumer protection Bill and water it down. That was the third proposal-the proposal of 27 April 1992 that did not even get into the Parliament. I think that again I put out a statement on that one, saying, 'Caucus right; Tate wrong'-and they were. One of the Labor backbenchers who is going to speak in this debate interjected earlier and said, 'The back bench is always right'. Well, if the back bench is always right, and it was right on this, I will hold the honourable member to his promise. Senator Tate has not given up yet. He wants to take this to a Senate committee. He wants to have another shot and try to convince the Senate committee that the decision previously was wrong. So I am going to watch what those on the back bench say in the debate. If the back bench is and was right, they will oppose Senator Tate in the Senate committee. Then along came the fourth Bill. This was the Bill of 26 May 1992 which Senator Tate introduced into the Senate. When I say, 'introduced', herein lies an interesting tale because over in the Senate it appears that Ministers can sometimes just table their speeches. They do not have to actually read them; they are incorporated in Hansard. That is what Senator Tate did. The trouble is that he had the wrong speech incorporated. The little speech that was incorporated in the Senate Hansard as the second reading speech for this Bill was the wrong speech. It was the speech on the third draft of 27 April 1992. Honourable members can look it up at page 2662 of the Senate Hansard. It addresses the little Aussie battler provisions. There is a nice little section on the little Aussie battler provisions which were thrown out by the Caucus. I.will say one thing for the Minister for Consumer Affairs. She may not have known what she was reading, but at least she read the right speech. She was a step ahead of Senator Tate who put in the wrong one. She is off to a good start. She does not need to know what she is reading, but I will give her a word of advice: when they come to you with a speech, you say to them, 'Is this the right one?'. That is what you have to say to them because they may in fact give you the wrong one and you would not know. I will give the Minister another word of advice: read the title. Make sure that the speech that they give you relates to the Bill being introduced. When there are four drafts, of course it is pretty hard to make sure one gets the right one. The one that Senator Tate had incorporated was the wrong speech. It did not even have the part in it that the Minister read out about how he is going to go. to the Senate and fight before the Senate committee for the little Aussie battler provisions, extraterritoriality and the statute of repose. This appeared, of course, from his press release of 7 May after he conceded defeat. I call this his 'We will fight them on the beaches' press release. This is the one that said, 'Well, look: I lost my first draft, I lost my second draft and I lost my third draft and I put in the wrong speech for my fourth draft-but we will fight them on the beaches, we will fight them in the House, we will fight them in the Senate and we will fight them in a Senate committee and, despite this decision, I am confident that we will have positive change in product liability laws, and everybody can have their day in court on. these controversial elements and everybody can come up to the Senate committee'. What he is saying is, 'Please come up to the Senate committee and do what I never could, which was to persuade my colleagues. Please do that'. This is the office that puts in the speech. I just want to make a point about this which will interest the Minister. There have been changes in the law so that when there is a doubt about a Bill one can look to the second reading speech for clarification. That is why in the speeches there is a phrase that is read out about how it is hoped that as the courts come to terms with this new legislation they will take various attitudesÂ· and so on. That is why those words are put in there-so that when the courts come to interpret legislation, if there is any ambiguity they look to the second reading speech. Well, it will not be of much help to them if they look at the second reading speech and it is the wrong one. The court might say, 'Let us look at what the Minister said to work out what this means. Let us look at the second reading speech'. In this case they would be looking at the wrong speech. It is an indication of how confused the Government is and how badly this whole matter has been managed. All I can say to the Minister as the new Minister for Consumer Affairs is that there is an object lesson here and the object lesson is that this Bill, which will now go through the House with our agreement because it reflects the position we took from the outset, is in a final form and it does not need playing around with. If the Minister were to try to get it to draft five, draft six or draft 66, she would run the risk of running into problems. That being said, we are now at the position where the Bill, which takes the view that we took at the outset-that the onus of proof should be on the plaintiff-can be supported by the coalition. Now that that main part has been settled, this Bill does do some good things. When it has come to liability in the past, liability has been allocated under common law through the law of negligence and the reasonable man test. It has been allocated through contract where parties agree on terms which allocate laws as between themselves. There has been statutory intervention; indeed, there are already provisions in the Trade Practices Act known as division 2A which allocate liability between consumers on the wrong one hand and manufacturers on the other. This proposes to go further in relation to that and, as has been said, is a liability proposal based on the European directive. The rationale behind changing current product liability laws in Australia is that allocation for loss should in more cases be cast on manufacturers. The EC directive is an attempt to allocate loss arising in countries which are members of the European Community. In the United States allocation of loss is principally made under the law of negligence. The test in the United States is 'defective condition unreasonably dangerous'. The test in the EC directive is 'defective'; that is, a product is defective when it does not provide the safety which a person is entitled to expect taking all circumstances into account. So what will have to be done when assessing whether. a manufacturer is liable is to decide whether something was defective, meaning whether it provided the safety which a person is entitled to expect. The Bill goes on to set out various matters that can be considered as part of that. Of course, a large portion of the products consumed in Australia are produced for global markets. If producers selling products in the European market are required to comply with the EC standard, they will automatically comply with any Australian requirement based on that EC standard. If the Australian standard were lower, this could open the opportunity to dump inferior goods on the Australian market. If the Australian standard were higher, this could prevent access to internationally available goods. There is an argument-a good argumentto harmonise our law with that of the EC and I welcome the fact that this Bill goes along that path. I hope that this Bill will provide a regime which is clear, concise and can easily be understood by manufacturers and by consumers alike. I hope that this will lead to shorter cases in the court rather than longer cases. I note, however, that the proposals in this Bill do not take away the current regimes, either the common law regimes or the current trade practices regimes. So in any cases that do come into the courts there will be joint courses of action under common law and under the Trade Practices Act. The various tests that have to be applied will have to be assessed by the judge or, if it should be the case, by the jury. We should not give this provision such extraterritorial effect as would allow people who consume Australian products outside Australia and suffer loss from them to come into the Australian jurisdiction .and sue Australian manufacturers under this regime. I think the countries in which Australian products are consumed should set the legal regime that applies to those products. If loss is suffered in those jurisdictions, claims for compensation should be brought in accordance with those jurisdictions. If an Australian manufacturer makes a product that causes a loss to somebody in South Korea, the case is brought in accordance with the legal regime applying in South Korea rather than repatriating the legal case back to Australia and bringing it into the Federal Court. If we could have that extraterritorial and repatriate legal cases from the place where the loss was suffered back to the Australian jurisdiction, we would effectively be creating an export industry for lawyers, because lawyers in Australia would be getting clients who might be domiciled in such places as South Korea, the Philippines or Thailand. It might create an export industry for lawyers and it might do something for an increase in litigation in the Australian courts, but I whether it will do anything for Australian manufacturers or Australian producers. If I had to make a choice between what I considered to be in the national interest, helping our manufacturers with exports or helping our lawyers with exports, I would be inclined to take the view that our manufacturers ought to be given a better hearing .by this Parliament than our lawyers-with no disrespect to our lawyers, who may be upset by my choice. I believe that manufacturers in Australia have had enormous difficulties in recent times. They face all sorts of inhibitions on their competitive position. These are the people who have to put up with payroll taxes and superannuation levies; the people who have to put up with the recession we had to have; the people who have to put up with a bad transport system that does not work efficiently enough; and the people who over the years have made a great contribution to the Australian economy. I do not think this is the time to be making things more difficult for our manufacturing sector, particularly our manufacturing export sector. If we were to introduce a regime that had extraterritorial effect, particularly if we put it together with a reversal of the onus of proof, as was originally proposed, we would be turning Australia into a high risk zone for manufacturing and a highly sympathetic zone for litigation. We should not make Australia a high risk zone for manufacturing. We in Australia ought to be thinking about getting competitive advantage for our manufacturers rather than competitive disadvantage. There are all sorts of reasons why the Minister ought to lock this Bill in her bottom drawer and forget about it. She has seen what has happened to Senator Tate. Senator Tate's effect body is hardly cold. He has had a lot of trouble on this Bill. It is finally being put to rest. I suggest to the Minister that she take out a big key, put this in the bottom drawer, lock it up and say, 'What a relief. We got through that one. Draft four was enough. Let us not try for draft five or draft six'. If the Minister feels a rush of blood, and if Government members get to her and say, 'Look as if you're doing something, Minister', doubt she should talk to Senator Aulich. Senator Aulich was right on this one. He is the one who rolled Senator Tate. He is the one who took the view that finally prevailed. He is the one who supported the coalition's position. The Government asks me, 'What is your position?'. I made our position crystal clear. It has been clear for 12 months. It has not changed an inch. The Government has been all over the place. It has had first draft, second draft, third draft, fourth draft, Senator Tate, Senator Aulich, and wrong speeches. It has been up to Broken Hill and back again. Our position has been absolutely clear right from the start. There is good in this Bill. Once the onus of proof and the extraterritoriality were settled, we said that it was a good Bill. We will support it for that reason. Debate (on motion by Mr Hulls) adjourned. NA The following Bills were returned from the Senate without amendment or requests: A.C.T. Supreme Court (Transfer) Bill 1992 Ministers of State Amendment Bill 1992 Veterans' Entitlements (Provision of Treatment) Amendment Bill 1991 NA (STAFF) BILL 1991 Bill returned from the Senate with amendments.

365,Mr HUMPHREYS,INSTITUTIONS,"I move: That the amendments be agreed to. The Repatriation Institutions (Staft) Bill 1991 is returned to the House for consideration following the acceptance of amendments moved by the Australian Democrats in the Senate. The amendments insert a new part lA into the Bill, which will require that the Commonwealth must not enter into an agreement for the transfer of the repatriation general hospitals into South Australia, Queensland, Victoria or Western Australia, or the repatriation auxiliary hospitals in New South Wales, Victoria or Queensland unless the Minister for Veterans' Affairs has determined that the institution should be transferred to the State. The amendments also,J)rovide for the determination to be a disallowable instrument for the purposes of the ActS Interpretation Act. The effect of this amendment is that none of the repatriation hospitals or auxiliary hospitals mentioned can be transferred to a being: State or authority of a State without the approval of the Parliament. The transfer of the repatriation general hospitals in New South Wales and Tasmania, on which agreement has already been reached, is not affected by these amendments. The short and long titles of the Bill have also been amended.",164
366,Mr TIM FISCHER,INSTITUTIONS,"Farrer-Leader of the National Party of Australia) (10.28 p.m.)These amendments flowed in part from initiatives taken by Senator Newman and have been placed in the Repatriation Institutions (Staft) Bill to ensure due process is adhered to with the complex repatriation hospital issue, .which has caused concern to many veterans around Australia. The short and long of this issue is that we saw a need to ensure that a deal or an arrangement would not be made behind the scenes without it being exposed, examined and involving the Parliament, because there are a lot of issues to be settled with the transfer of each of these hospitals. Veterans, quite properly, are seeking assurances in respect of their onward access, their priority of access and the general care and treatment that will be available to veterans in an integrated situation. I will not detain the House other than to note that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) has accepted these amendmentS to the Repatriation Institutions (Staff) Bill 1991, that it reflects the further phase of the quite long running debate over repatriation hospitals, and that it gives Parliament a proper role to play in relation to the transfer of those repatriation hospitals. Whilst there are differing opinions from veterans over the issue, undeniably we seek to ensure that the rightÂ· thing is done by those who serve their country. That is; in part, what this is all about.",164

Endeavour Foundation",165
368,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,ADJOURNMENT,"On Monday night of this week, the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) made certain allegations in her speech about the work practices and ethics of the Endeavour Foundation in Queensland. I speak here with an interest because for many years I have been a vice-patron of the Endeavour Foundation for the Mackay branch. The allegations that were made have been brought to the attention of the Foundation. I understand that it has responded by way of a letter to all members of the Queensland Parliament on all sides of the political fence, and that has been circulated. I thought that the implications made by the honourable member for Forde in her speech were so grave that perhaps, as this is the last opportunity to set the record straight, I should endeavour to do that on this occasion. In her speech, the honourable member for Forde claimed she had been approached by a lady named Elizabeth who complained about a reduction in the amount she was to be paid by the Foundation for working in the Endeavour mailing and printing service, which is a sheltered employment program. In this statement the honourable member. was correct, but only to the extent that a' reduction in supplementary pay based on productivity had occurred for all pel!:e working in the Endeavour mailing and 'nting service. The reason for the reducti n in wages was quite simple: sales redUcti- in.the recession, a recession that the Lab r Party said we had to have. It was made c ear by a letter and personal explanation to every individual using the sheltered workplace services. It should be pointed out clearly that sheltered employment services are not fully funded for disability support costs by government and they must direct a large proportion of their commercial income to the cost of the care workers and trainers. They provide human services for this, and it has always been their first priority. The Endeavour mailing and printing service, however, had suffered as a result of the recession losing some major contracts, and there was a general decline in the printing industry. Mter an inner bid to keep the service going without affecting client income and supplements, Endeavour had been forced to retrench two of its experienced staff members, and this had been advised to the honourable member for Forde. Ultimately, even this measure was insufficient. So, faced with the prospect of having to close the service down altogether, the Foundation took the route of reducing the client income supplement. The honourable member also claimed that Elizabeth, a person with an intellectual handicap who lives in her electorate, said that she was subnormal and not allowed to have children. But by implication the honourable \ member was saying that the Endeavour Foundation controls the lives of all those people who. use its services. People with an intellectual handicap choose to use the services provided by Endeavour, and they are helped in this choice by their parents. This relationship does not allow for, or suggest in any way, that Endeavour is in a position to dictate to its clients how they live their lives. It . is rather appalling-and the Foundation finds it appalling-that this inference was actually made. In fact, the Endeavour Foundation community is committed to empowering people with intellectual handicap to make decisions about their lives. That is why the mere inference of this is so offensive. The honourable member also suggested that Elizabeth was in possession of a letter from the Foundation that stated her salary had been reduced from $68 per fortnight to $15 per fortnight and that that was part of the Federal Labor Government's policy. A letter was, as previously stated, sent to all individuals using the workshop services. The letter made no mention whatsoever of the Federal Government's policy and made no mention of the amounts. It was also claimed that Elizabeth was never paid $68 a fortnight, as the honourable member stated in her speech. In fact, the income supplement was actually reduced by $10 per fortnight. The honourable member also suggested that the Federated Clerks Union intervened in Foundation work practices on behalf of EMPS employees and that the Foundation cut the pay of clients under the slow worker award. She also suggested that clients' pay was cut in this manner while no change was made to the pay of the administrators or clerks at EMPS. The fact is that, while the Federated Clerks Union did contact Endeavour, it made no representation on behalf of clients and claimed no interest in the situation because the union does not cover handicapped persons in that way. (TIme expired) Shipping",165
369,Mr HOLLIS,ADJOURNMENT,"Throsby) (10.37 p.m.)Opposition members in this place often talk about ship delays. Of course, the blame is usually on the Waterside Workers Federation. Let us look at one example of a ship delay that I know about that happened in Port Kembla. On 24 April this year, the MV Stamar arrived at Port Kembla's No.1 product berth to load coils for transportation to Malaysia. The coils weighed 20 tonnes each. The total weight of the order was 2,537 tonnes. The coils were at the wharf waiting the arrival of the ship. When the loading .was about to commence, it was discovered the coils had not been descaled. The coils were returned to the mill for de-scaling and re-rolling. As a consequence, the ship was delayed, through no fault of the waterside workers. When they returned to the wharf, the coils had been reduced from the original 20 tonnes to 10 tonnes each in weight. Loading proc-ed normally. When all the available coils had been loaded, it was discovered that there were four coils missing. Subsequently, the missing coils were located in another area of the plant. The further delay to the loading of the ship, caused by the four missing coils not being delivered to the wharf, had not been the fault of waterside workers. When the four coils were delivered to the Stamar, a gang of waterside workers had to be diverted from another ship to complete the loading. This, in turn, caused a delay in the loading of the ship, Anangel Endeavour, from which the gang had been taken. When the loading of the Stamar was completed, one would imagine that the ship could sail without any further delay. However, it then became necessary to discover whether or not the . purchaser would accept the smaller 10 tonne coils. Once again, a series of incidents beyond the control of the waterside workers resulted in their being blamed for the ensuing delays. Mr Beale-Yes, but what is the point? It just shows what a shambles the waterfront is.",166
370,Mr HOLLIS,ADJOURNMENT,The honourable member for Bruce should be the last person to open his mouth and speak in this House about the Waterside Workers Federation. We have all read his comments about it. It is to educate people like him that I am making this speech tonight. Mr Beale-I know about the waterfront. I used to deal with it.,167
371,Mr HOLLIS,ADJOURNMENT,"A series of incidents, through the incompetence of BHP and beyond the control of the waterside workers, resulted in their being blamed for the ensuing delays. Another instance of a ship being delayed for reasons outside the wharfies' sphere of influence occurred over the Easter weekend at Port Kembla. No gangs were picked up on the Thursday afternoon shift before Good Friday, nor were any rostered on Saturday after Good Friday when there was plenty of labour available to be picked up and the cargo worked. The honourable member for Bruce often waxes lyrical in this place about the wharfies. We have all read his articles in the Australian and so on. But if any obstacles are being put in the way of restructuring and waterfront reform, much of the blame can be attributed, not to the waterside workers, as in the cases I have outlined, but to other parties who pay lip-service to implementing reforms but do everything available to obstruct their introducLast tion. Mr Beale-What are you trying to do?",167
372,Mr HOLLIS,ADJOURNMENT,"Despite the screaming and yelling of the honourable member for Bruce, there is another matter I wish to touch on briefly this evening. I was actually looking through aÂ· Dateline News Digest that came round to my office. I noticed that the Opposition parties, the conservatives, were setting up a committee. I thought, 'Ho, ho, . what's this? They are setting up a committee' . I read on and discovered that they were setting up a committee to sell the flag. This is really interesting. Here we are on the last night of these parliamentary sittings and the only thing the Opposition can come up with is a committee to sell or promote the flag. Contrast that with some of the committees that we on this side of the House have set up. Recently, 'we set up a very active committee to look at value adding. One of the most important things in Australia today is value added product. The honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) has a committee looking at the problems in the sugar cane industry. Is the Opposition concerned with this? No, it is not. All the Opposition is concerned about is setting up a committee to look at the flag. There is another committee, of which I am a member, looking atunsafe shipping practices. With all the things we have in Australia today, and the things that members of parliament should be looking at, what do we find? On this side of the House we have a whole range of relevant committees of importance to Australia, and on the Opposition side there are no committees. The only committee it has set up in this session of Parliament is a committee to promote the flag. That is the choice that the Australian people are going to be faced with at the next election. We have a team of people on the Labor side who take the problems of Australia seriously and are doing something to solve them. The Opposition's only concern is the promotion of the flag. (Time expired) Foreign Debt",167
373,Mr ANDREWS,ADJOURNMENT,"Menzies) (10.42 p.m.)Tuesday in debate on the One Nation statement. I made reference to the growing size and the growing problem of Australia's foreign debt. Following me in the debate, in seeking to rebut what I said about the size of Australia's foreign debt, the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) had a few words to say, including these: Honourable members opposite can play with the figures and talk about the magnitude of the foreign debt but the facts are that, as a proportion of the economy, the foreign debt is not as big as it was when they ran this country. The growth of the foreign debt under Labor has not been as great as it was when the Liberal Party ran this country. The basis on which the honourable member for Brisbane made that assertion was an article in the Sunday Mail, which he quoted, and which, to be fair to him, I shall quote: . . . though the total overseas debt is now higher, the rate at which it grew, namely 38 per cent when they were in powerthat is, the Liberal-National coalitionis considerably higher than the rate of growth per cent since 1982. The honourable member went on to say: Opposition members might have a closer look at the facts before deciding to parade foreign debt as a virtue in terms of their economic record. The honourable member for Brisbane ought to have a closer look at the facts because they certainly do not support anything that he was asserting. In fact, one could put it in terms of that well-known quotation, 'Lies, damned lies and statistics'. What he has done is make a selective use of statistics, and statistics which in a sense are misleading into the bargain. What are the facts? Let us go back to 197576. Australia's net foreign debt was $2.3 billion. That represented 3.1 per cent of GDP. Mr Beale-How much was that?",167
374,Mr ANDREWS,ADJOURNMENT,"It was $2.3 billion. By 1981-82 it was $16.5 billion, or 10.5 per cent of GDP. So we had a situation in 1975-76 where the net foreign debt of Australians was the equivalent of approximately $200 per Australian. By 1981-82 it was about $1,000 per Australian. In 1982-83, when the Hawke Government came to office, the foreign debt was $23.3 billion, or 13.6 per cent of GDP. So at the start of the Hawke Government the actual foreign debt in terms of every man, S woman and child in Australia was $1,500 per Australian. In 1990-91 that foreign debt had blown out, in net terms, to $137 billion, or 36.4 per cent of our gross domestic product. We learn that this month our net foreign debt is $148 billion, and that represents approximately $8,000 for every man, woman and child in this country. For the honourable member for Brisbane to come in here and assert somehow that the foreign debt under the Hawke-Keating Government has improved or is in some way better than it was under the Fraser Government is simply playing with statistics in a way which cannot be backed up. The average growth of foreign debt-even the average annual growth of foreign debt-is not a satisfactory measure because it is affected by inflation and exchange rate movements. Under the Fraser Government the average share of GDP gross debt represented 14 per of 28 cent of GDP. That compared with 13 per cent under the Whitlam Government. Even at the end of the Fraser Government it was still 14 per cent of GDP. The situation is that we have a foreign debt of $148 billion, which is growing. If we go to the background statement in the One Nation package, which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) released, we see a statement that suggests it will grow by around $30 billion, and will continue to grow. EPAC said in its statement yesterday that if the current slow pace of adjustment continues, foreign debt will not be stabilised until the next decade, and will still be about 37 per cent of GDP in 2010. I can only suggest to the honourable member for Brisbane that he get his facts correct. Goods and Services Tax  p.rri.)-I say to the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) that he ought to look well at theÂ·demise of the former President of the Federal Liberal Party and the contribution that he and his colleagues and those around him made to the expansion of foreign debt. Mr Beale-That is absolute rubbish, and you know it.  like them, made. a greater single contribution to the growth in foreign debt than any other people in the history of this country, and those opposite should not ever forget it. I know the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale) is proud of it. I know he wants to hide his head in shame. He cannot move away from that. It is all there on the record-the entrepreneurial extravagances and irresponsibilities of the 1980s. Mr Beale-When you borrow from overseas you increase your reserves. You know that.",168
375,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Truss)Order! The honourable member for Bruce.  the other end of the spectrum this evening, the devastating impact of a goods and services tax on small business. The Opposition claims that the abolition of payroll tax will help everyone. It knows very well that 95 per cent of small businesses do not pay payroll tax. It is a great deal, is it not? It says, 'Ninety-five per cent of you do not pay payroll tax. We are going to lob you with an iniquitous system that is costly and difficult to administer, but we are going to abolish payroll tax'. Apart from the fact that the Opposition has not stated where it will get the money from to compensate the States for the abolition of payroll tax, it has also not broadcast the fact that most small businesses are not subject to payroll tax. The honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) has conceded that 85 to 87 per cent of tourist operators do not pay payroll tax. That came out in a debate with the Minister for Tourism in February 1992 organised by the Queensland Pacific-Asian Travel Association. It is not me saying it; I am just quoting back to the House the words of those opposite. When will the Opposition come clean and say to small business, 'We want to be frank with you about this. We know we are going to impose a burden upon you. We will abolish payroll tax, but we also recognise that. only 5 per cent of you pay payroll tax. '? Mr Beale-That is a despicable misrepresentation.  member opposite prattle on. Let him keep on prattling on and shouting, and eventually the Deputy Speaker will call him to order and ask him to resume his place.",169
376,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Truss)Order! The honourable member for Bruce.  member is sitting at the end of the front desk. He ought to be near the despatch box, or go back to his seat and be quiet. Mr Beale-Are you happy about one millionÂ· unemployed?  Speaker, I refer to page 143 of the sacred Fightback! document. The section is called 'Taxation and Expenditure', and reads: In contrast to the wholesale sales tax, the Goods and Services Tax is a straightforward tax for business. Let me say to the House that only 70,000 businesses collect wholesale sales tax at the last stage in the wholesale stream. Under the Opposition's proposals 800,000 businessesevery small business in this country plus another 1,200,000 organisations-will be up for a goods and services tax and the filing of returns. The document further says: Although Goods and Services Tax will not necessitate the gathering of more accounting information than is already collected by most businesses, it is clear that, whereÂ· businesses do not currently pay wholesale sales tax, the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax will involve some additional compliance responsibilities. The Opposition says, - Some additional compliance responsibilities; not too much\. only another 730,000 of you will have to submit returns. But these obligations will bring benefits'. The document continues: The requirement for smaller firms to maintain better accounting records, thus providing a more informed basis on which to make management decisions ... What an insult. What a put-down. Here are these 800,000 businesses, surviving, running their businesses-some of them for decadesand along comes the Opposition and says, 'We will impose this burden on you, and that will help you get more information, and you will be able to run your business better'. What a deal! If we go to pages 145 and 146 of the document, we see that it sets outÂ· all the detail-every bit of paper and every transaction. Keep it for seven years! Business will need an extra warehouse to put it all in. It will cost 2 per cent of turnover to run the administrative system. All I say is: hands off small business. Leave the tourism industry alone. We do not want a 15 per cent imposition on the tourism industry. We want to be competitive. We want the value of our dollar to make us competitive. We want our new expanded and extended aviation policy to attract more people to this country, not to slug tourists with a 15 per cent goods and services tax and put this country at a 15 per cent disadvantage. I ask the Opposition: please be honest with small business. Send that circular around to all of those people in it so that they know what the truth really is. (llme expired) Endeavour Foundation",169
377,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,ADJOURNMENT,"I just want to continue with what I was saying earlier about the Endeavour Foundation. No Endeavour Foundation clients come under the slow worker award and, as for the pay of administrators and clerks, EMPS employs one manager, one clerk and, as already stated, has retrenched two printers in a bid to avoid reducing client income plement. It seems incredible that the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) did not know these simple facts. Her statement suggests that she is also unaware of the amount her own Government has spent on consultants trying to arrive at a supportive wage and also of the findings in this area the government sponsored Ronalds report. The honourable member for Forde suggested that Endeavour 'is unable to move down the path of training or indeed make any other kind of progress'. This is patently untrue. can guarantee that because I have seen the progress of Endeavour over the 20 or 30 years that I have been associated with it. As a member of parliament, the honourable member for Forde would have received all Foundation's newsletters and reports clearly outlining the considerable progress made the Endeavour Foundation in all areas disability services. Indeed, the information has had at hand indicates that not only is Foundation a leader in the service area, has the support of people with intellectual handicaps, their families, friends and, in fact, the entire Queensland community. I can vouch for that. The honourable member then goes on to suggest that the Foundation luxuriates headquarters building that has gold plated taps and toilets, a boardroom, banquet room and other facilities, and that this building is not available for use by people with intellectual handicaps. Once again, this is a distortion of the facts. Back in 1953 the Courier-Mail in Brisbane ran a spot-the-ball competition and donated the funds raised to the recently formed Queenslanfl Sub-Normal Children's Welfare Association, now 'the Endeavour Foundation. With that money, the organisation bought an old building, in much need of repair, in a then unpopular part of the city. That building is today called Schonell House and is part of Queensland's history. Endeavour's obligation as the owner of such a building is to maintain that building to an appropriate standard. So the toilets and bathrooms have brass taps, as originally fitted. The building is constantly in use by the supFoundation-I have been there myself-and by other charity groups which provide services to people with a range of disabilities, as well as other community groups. It is commonly used for major seminars and training purposes involving the community, clients, other service providers and also government. The honourable member then goes on to of suggest that the Foundation is exploiting the people for whom it provides services. She then says, as if to verify that claim; that the person at the centre of her tirade, Elizabeth, is competent to do many more things than I those tasks she was given at EMPS and is capable of earning much more than the $15 per fortnight the honourable member claims the Foundation paid her. . Endeavour does not chain people to benches the or coerce or manipulate them in any way. People with intellectual handicap come, either by directly or through their families, to the of Foundation seeking places in sheltered she employment or other day programs. Despite the the lack of government support, the Enit also deavour community strives to make more places available each year. In this regard I can vouch that in my time as shadow Minister for community services the Endeavour Foundation was probably the best funded by the community of most of the associations inin a volved in this work. Perhaps the real complaint that the honourable member for Forde has is that the independence of the organisation allows it to do as it does. Endeavour's clients receive assistance in developing work related skills and undertake specific task training as dictated by the clients themselves through an. individual program plan, either directly or through their chosen advocates. They are paid a productivity based income supplement and are assisted in seeking other or open employment opportunities. In actual fact the Foundation is delighted to know that a past client has found full and open employment in the honourable member's office and is sure that the honourable member for Forde, with all her knowledge of the disability services area, will ensure that Elizabeth is paid full award wages that are the same as those paid to other workers in the office and commensurate with her duties, and not the slow worker wage that the honourable member seems vaguely acquainted with or the supportive wage about which there is a fair amount of ignorance. I think it is necessary to put on record that there are many members of parliament from Queensland on both sides of the HouseLabor, Liberal and National-who have given their support to the Foundation over many years and who will continue to do so. (1ime expired) Goods and Services Tax",170
378,Mr LEE,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to continue on the theme of the goods and services tax as raised by my colleague the  Morris). The only comment I would make to the previous speaker, the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), is that, of course, I am sure he advised the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) that he was going to make that adjournment speech, as is the gentlemanly thing to do. I am sure that the honourable member for Forde, had she the opportunity, might have been able to respond immediately. Perhaps the honourable member for Forde will get a chance to respond when the House next sits. The point that I wish to make tonight is that the Australian people at the next election are going to have a very stark choice-a choice between a government which has outlined its program for accelerating economic recovery and an opposition which has made it very clear that its answer to Australia's economic problems is to impose a goods and services tax, that is, a tax of 15 per cent on the food that we eat and the services that we need. The honourable member for Shortland has outlined the great impost that this will impose on small business. He has mentioned the hundreds of thousands of small businesses that will now be required to fill out forms and submit them to the Australian Taxation Office so that the goods and services tax can be paid. At the same time he has explained the massive impact that this will have on tourism. One point that I think more Australians should be made to understand is that the Opposition has said that it will exempt from the GST the cost of overseas holidays if they are bought as a package in Australia. That means that if people are weighing up a choiceMr Elliott-It will kill Australian tourism.",171
379,Mr LEE,ADJOURNMENT,"As the honourable member has said, it will kill Australian tourism. People in his electorate or in the electorate of the honourable member for Dawson who are trying to choose between a holiday on a beach in Fiji and a holiday on a beach in Cairns know that they will get a 15 per cent advantage if they take that holiday in Fiji. That is what the Opposition is doing; it is encouraging Australians not to spend their money on holidays in Australia. It is giving Australians an advantage if they spend their money in a way that works to the disadvantage of Australia and in creating jobs for Australians. I just wish that honourable members opposite would put out one of those pamphlets explaining Fightback, telling people in the tourist industry that they will be subsidising jobs going from Australian tourist resorts to tourist resorts in other parts of the world. Yes, the GST will mean that the cost of some goods in supermarkets might come down because sales tax will be abolished. However, how much sales tax is imposed on the necessities of life-on bread, milk and the things that people need to survive? Zero! That is why the cost of necessities of life will go up 15 per cent. Mr Elliott-The cost of Ferraris will come down.",171
380,Mr LEE,ADJOURNMENT,The cost of Ferraris will drop significantly. Mr Beale-I have talked to people in my electorate. They love Fightback.,172
381,Mr LEE,ADJOURNMENT,"The honourable member who is interjecting might be quite happy that his next luxury sports car will be a bit cheaper. But the people in his electorate who are on age pensions will be paying more for bread and milk. When the honourable member goes for a haircut, under the Opposition's GST he will be paying 15 per cent more to the hairdresser or the barber, whoever he goes to. Under a Liberal-National Party government, when the age pensioners in his electorate go to pay their electricity bills they will be paying a 15 per cent tax on their electricity. They will be paying a 15 per cent tax on their water bills. They will be paying a 15 per cent tax on the garbage services provided by their local councils. It will affect rates, electricity, water and, of course, their telephone accounts as well. Honourable members opposite can try to escape from the pressure that we will put on them. However, honourable members will not escape, because we will make them face up to the ruthless policies that they are putting forward to the Australian people-a 15 per cent tax which is designed to target low income earners and provide tax cuts for people on high incomes. That is what the policy of honourabl- members opposite is all about. I return to the point I made earlier. Those opposite say that they want to create two million jobs. They use their computer models to twist the figures. At the same time they are providing a 15 per cent subsidy to people who take their holidays overseas, instead of taking them in Australia. Perhaps the next speaker for the Opposition can make it clear to this House tonight why those opposite are planning to subsidise Australians taking their holidays overseas. Why are they trying to cut back jobs in Australia's tourism industry? Why are they trying to discourage an expansion in jobs? Their policies will mean that Australians will be encouraged to take their holidays overseas. Those are the questions that members of the Opposition have to answer. (Time expired) Dead-end Jobs",172
382,Mr MCLACHLAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Barker) (11.02 p.m.)Tonight I want to refer to a matter that was raised during Question Time, the matter of dead-end jobs. A question was asked of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) about dead-end jobs, which he failed to answer, as he has failed to describe them in the past. The Prime Minister has raised the subject on a number of occasions. It is quite obvious to me that the Government believes that a dead-end job is something that used to be described as a manual job; in other words, something that we used to do in days gone by, using our hands and our physical accoutrements. I would like to take up the subject because I think it is absolute. nonsense to believe that just by training people, they will be set for a future in this life, even if after the training there is nothing there for them. I believe, as in times gone by-perhaps not in times of dire straits-stints in the armed services were good for people, it taught them discipline and so forth. There are plenty of manual jobs which, as I understand the Prime Minister today, he would describe as dead-end jobs. There are plenty of manual jobs which are marvellous jobs for young people. They are marvellous jobs because they teach them discipline; they teach them that even if they go to bed at the end of the day feeling tired, they can feel some self-satisfaction, in that they have actually accomplished something. If somebody pays young people for doing that in times such as this when we have all these kids out of work, it is a marvellous bonus. In the past few weeks I have listened to the tripe that has been talked in this House about dead-end jobs, and it has made me sick in the stomach. There is nothing better at the end of the day than knowing that one has contributed something-not living at the end of some dead-end street, soaking up dope or booze, or whatever. Irrespective of the industry we will bring the kids into the system. The best thing we can give those kids today is the selfsatisfaction when they go home at the end of the day of knowing that they have done something. I have listened to this garbage for a few weeks now, and I am sick to death of it. The Government can train the kids all it likes, but if there are no jobs, the kids will lose their confidence and be disfranchised for life. I can understand why some people in the Government would not understand what a day's physical work is about. Most of them have come out of some institution that they went into early in life, pleading the bleeding heart for certain groups of people, but they have never done it themselves. I venture to say that more people on this side of the House have actually done the physical, than any on the government side of the House. Mr Beale-Those two blokes have.",172
383,Mr MCLACHLAN,ADJOURNMENT,"I do not know about those two blokes; I do not know what their history is. I have to say that I felt it was time tonight to stand up here and to say 'that it is time to finish off the nonsense about dead-end jobs. The fact of the matter is that all of us need training; all of us need discipline. The very best time to get it is when we are. young. Young people do not need to spend two years of their life having nothing to do during the day. That is a disadvantage that will stay with them for the rest of their lives. If we are going to go on with this terrible 'chip on the shoulder' nonsense, this country will get nowhere. People like the Prime Minister-I venture to say that he has done little physical labour, if any; he has probably never worked in his garden-should understand that the training' that comes with starting young and the discipline that kids get then is a great advanq.ge in life, and not the opposite, as he would have us believe. Dead-end Jobs-Payroll tax",173
384,Mr ANDREW,ADJOURNMENT,"Wakefield) (11.07 p.m.)The five minutes available to me in the adjournment debate will not allow me to make the comments I would like to make. I will open by saying that I support the remarks of the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan). As someone who employed people in what would have been called by those on the other side of the House as deadend jobs, I can vouch for the fact that they need not be dead-end jobs at all. IronicaIly in the fruit picking industry, those who went into an enterprise bargaining system, where they agreed how much they would be paid per bin instead of an hourly rate, found that far from being dead-end, the job was quite fulfiIIing, and there are those who have made successful farming careers as professional fruit pickers in my area. I am forced to my feet in this extended adjournment debate to respond to the remarks made by the honourable member for DobeIl (Mr Lee) and by the honourable member for  the GST is some sort of burden placed on Australia's small business is so far from the mark that I could not remain seated. The whole purpose of a GST is to relieve the cost burden currently being borne by smaIl business. The honourable member for Shortland made so much of what he saw as the payroIl tax that was not being paid by small business. I could not believe that a professional person, an informed person, a person with sufficient nous and Â·inteIlect to occupy a seat in this Parliament, could propose that smaIl business does not carry part of the payroIl tax burden. It is like my fruit growers or farmers saying, 'I only employ one or two people, so I do not pay payroIl tax'. I have had one or two who have said that. That raised scorn and derision from the rest of the people in the room as they recognised that the products they produced-let us say it is citrus fruit that has to be packed into a case in a packing shed, processed into a can in a processing plant, which is normaIly a cooperativecaused them to pay payroll tax. The payroll tax becomes part of the burden borne by that small business. That cascading effect applies right across Australia. It is just as erroneous to come in here and tell me that sales tax does not place a burden on the food industry and that bread is without sales tax. Do honourable members seriously believe that Tip Top or Baker Boy, or the equivalent eastern States baking house, does not pay payroll tax? Of COUffie it does. What about on the packaging? Of course it does. Where is it picked up? It is picked up in the price of a loaf of bread. Do honourable members seriously believe that anyone of the grocery items sitting on supermarket shelves in Australia does not carry some portion of wholesale sales tax, some portion of payroll tax and a substantial portion of petrol excise, simply to get it on the shelf? Of course it does. Every one of those costs is a cost borne by the consumer who buys that loaf of bread, that kilogram of butter, or whatever it may be. For that very reason, the removal of sales tax, the removal of petrolÂ· excise and the removal of payroll tax, has an immediate effect not only on small business but also on every consumer. Of COUffie, it is replaced by a GST; we have not denied that. In fact, it is time for those in the Government to pause and ask themselves why on earth an opposition, seeking to dupe the Australian community as they allege, would come out 18 months before a poll deliberately indicating all that it intends to do. Releasing .a 700-page package is hardly being deceptive. If we had wanted to dupe the Australian people we would have gone to the election without indicating what our process was. We have put together a package that we believe offers not simply an alternative, but a responsible alternative-an alternative that will appeal to the Australian people and an alternative that those opposite can torpedo only by misrepresentation. It is simply not enoughMr Lee-Tell us about the tourism industry.",173
385,Mr ANDREW,ADJOURNMENT,"I will raise the issue of the tourism industry later. I am not avoiding that question, it is just that time has run away from me. It is sufficient to say that the package is detailed, it indicates all that we would do, and it has received nothing but derision from the other side ()f the House. It is time that those opposite and the people of Australia paused to ask themselves why any Opposition seriously seeking to be the Government would put such a detailed package in place if it wished to be deceptive. Mr Lee-You are putting the price of bread up.",174
386,Mr ANDREW,ADJOURNMENT,"Bread bears the cascading effect of the payroll tax, wholesale sales tax and petroleum excise, as we have indicated. Mr Lee-The price of bread is still going up.",174
387,Mr ANDREW,ADJOURNMENT,"Yes, the price of bread will go up, but it will be compensated for by changes in the welfare payment and by real falls in income tax, particularly for those in the lower income groups. (TIme expired) Motion (by Mr Robert Brown) agreed to: That the question be now put. Original question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11.12 p.m. until Wednesday, 24 June 1992, at 10 a.m., in accordance with the resolution agreed to this day. NA NA Parliament House: Fluorescent Globes Mr MCGauran asked Mr Speaker, upon notice, on 21 June 1991: (1) What practice is adopted in Parliament House with respect to the disposal of fluorescent globes. (2) How many fluorescent globes are used in Parliament House and its environs. (3) Were the original globes (a) purchased from local manufacturers or (b) imported. (4) How often do the fluorescent globes need to be replaced. (5) What is the cost of each fluorescent globe. (6) Have the originally fitted fluorescent globes been replaced, or will they be replaced, by a new generation of incandescent globes; if so, (a) what is the cost of (i) each new globe and (ii) completely refitting Parliament House with the new globes, (b) how many of the replaced globes were or will be in working order, (c) what became or will become of the replaced globes, (d) what are the advantages of the replacement globes, (e) what are the toxic components of the replacement globes, (t) is the toxicity of the replacement globes greater than that of the replaced globes, (g) will the replacement globes be ultimately (i) recycled or (ii) placed in landfill and (h) where were or will the replacement globes be (i) purchased and (ii) manufactured. Mr Speaker - The response to the honourable member's request is as follows: (1)(a) Fluorescent tubes (and incandescent globes) are placed in a separate dump bin and then disposed of by the Parliament House waste contractor. (b) The contractor disposes of the tubes in land fill which is the current accepted industry practice. (2) Some 46,000 fluorescent tubes are currently installed in Parliament House. This will rise to 51,000 over the next few months as some existing incandescent globes are replaced with new energy efficient fluorescent lamps. (3) The original installed fluorescent tubes were 100% imported. (4) Fluorescent tubes have a predicted life of 5,000 to 8,000 hours dependent on the type and its usage pattern. In Parliament House this equates to 1 to 2 years life expectancy. (5) The cost of fluorescent tubes averaged $4.42 in 1990. Currently prices range from $1.30 for standard tubes to $18.90 for electronic fluorescent lamps designed to replace inefficient incandescent globes. (6) No, the original fluorescent tubes have not been replaced by a new generation of incandescent globes. It is planned to replace some 5,000 of the 14,000 currently installed incandescent globes with electronically controlled fluorescent lamps for which: (a) replacement lamps are $18.90 each giving a total cost of $94,500 for 5,000 replacements; (b) the incandescent globes replaced, in the main will be working but their light output will have significantly reduced with age and the failure rate will be rapidly rising; (c) disposal will be by waste contractor to landfill; (d) they are more energy efficient; (e) toxic components of fluorescents are mercury, lead, strontium, manganese, cadmium, antimony and barium; (t) fluorescent tubes and lamps contain more toxic substances than incandescent globes; (g) when eventually replaced the globes will be recycled if efficient, approved recycling technology has been' developed and evaluated. The JHD is monitoring current initiatives in this field. If not they will be placed in landfill; and (h) the replacement electronically-controlled fluorescent lamps will be (i) purchased in Australia and (ii) manufactured overseas. Fluorescent globes are not manufactured in Australia. When a satisfactory Australian manufactured globe becomes available it will be considered for purchase.

(3) How are corporate plans and associated performance activities monitored and evaluated in terms of cost benefits. (4) How many additional positions have been created since 1989 to plan and coordinate the activities referred to in part (1). (5) Where are the officers referred to in located.",174
388,Mr BEAZLEY,PAPERS,"The Minister for Transport and Communications has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: The following information is provided for the Department only since portfolio-wide data are not readily available. (1)(i) (a, b, c) A Strategic Planning Section exists within the Corporate Management Division, comprising three full-time staff at the levels and salaries shown below:. 1 x Senior Officer Grade B-$53,403 1 x Senior Officer Grade C-$45,546 1 x Administrative Service Officer Class 5-$34,778 NA In relation to the Corporate Plan, Program Evaluation Plans and associated performance management activities (such as evaluations), the Section performs a cross-program co-ordinating role, advises management and is the focus for liaison with central agencies.

From time-to-time some Departmental officers can be tasked with specific planning and evaluation activities and in line with its commitment to industrial democracy, the Department involves as many staff as possible in planning the organisation's future activities. (2) The annual salaries cost for the Strategic Planning Section is $133,727. Total costs of maintaining activities referred to in part (1) are not possible to determine with any accuracy as some degree of planning and evaluation is an integral part of the activities of most officers of the Department, and the total costs are not readily separable from overall program management costs. (3) Corporate Plans and associated performance activities are integrated and assessed by the part (4) Department's Planning Evaluation and Audit Committee (PEAC).

Mr Beddall-The Department of Adminis44,989 trative Services has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: The Commonwealth Grants Commission has no statutory or policy responsibilities for the development or maintenance of employment-creating 41,517 programs within the Australian economy. The primary function of the Commission is to provide advice to the Commonwealth Government on the distribution of general revenue grants between the States and Territories. The Commission is required to base its recommendations on principles of fiscal equalisation. Under these principles the Commission's recommendations, if accepted by the Government, would enable each State to provide government services at standards not appreciably different from the standards provided by the other States, without having to impose taxes and charges at levels appreciably different from the levels imposed by the other States. In making its assessments, the Commission takes account of (i) differences in the capacities of the States to raise revenues; and (ii) differences in the amounts required to be spent by the States in providing government services of a comparable standard. To the extent that levels of unemployment are higher in some States than in others, and the differences serve to reduce relative revenue raising capacities or increase relative service delivery costs in those States, the Commission's assessments would result (other things being equal) in higher per capita shares of general revenue grants for those States compared to the States where unemployment was lower. Over time, the implementation of fiscal equalisation principles in this way (i.e. through the differenGovernment tial distribution of general revenue grants) will act in the direction of providing additional stimulus in States with above average unemployment. To the extent that, overall, actual employment remains below full employment levels, other fiscal and monetary policies are called on to address the problem. These are outside the Grants Commission's responsibilities. In the light of the foregoing, the supplementary elements of the question under (a), (b) and (c) are not relevant to the operations of the Commission. Commonwealth Government Directory (Question No. 1583) Dr Bob Woods asked the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services: Is there a Commonwealth Government directory which lists all potential funding sources available to the community; if not, (a) why not and (b) will such a directory be made available. Mr Beddall-The Department of Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The Department of Administrative Services does not produce a directory which lists all potential funding sources available to the community, although it does produce a Commonwealth Government Directory (listing details of Commonwealth Government departments and agencies and senior personnel) in both book fonn and as an on-line service through Telecom's Discovery and Keylink systems. A more simple document, the Service Guide, which included limited information relating to grants, was discontinued in 1981 due to difficulties in keeping the information up-to-date. There is, of course, a very wide array of potential funding services made available by the Australian to the community. To establish and maintain as up to date the data base necessary to support such a directory would be a significant and costly undertaking, requiring the involvement and input of a large number of departments and agencies. To date there has been no demand shown for such a service either from Government departments/agencies or from the public.",176
