Classification Ordinance 1983 Standards for Classification of Printed Materials, No. I-:-February 1984 passed by the Senate last Wednesday,removing from existing Commonwealth Law:(a) The power to prevent the importation and sale of hardcore pornography (e.g. X-rates videos). (b) The power to prevent the importation and sale of grossly obscene publications including those associated with blasphemy; (c) The power to require videos for non-commercial use to be registered before release from customs was a step in the wrong direction. It is the view of the religious community on the north side of Brisbane, of which we are a part, that the new laws should be amended immelliately to give protection to all Australians, particularly women and children from exploitation. , It is believed that those materials that come under Category 2 classification should not be allowed to be made available to all, and the knowledge that this kind of material described under Classification 2 is now lawful under the new regulations is nauseating. We believe it is the duty of the Government to protect society from those who would incite paedophilia, child pornography, terrorism and extreme cruelty. W"" believe this protection should be extended to cover items such as ' are currently listed under Category 2. We respectfully request that amending legislation be drafted accordingly.

12,Mr JOHN BROWN,INDUSTRIES ASSISTANCE,"Parramatta-Minister for Sport, Recreation and Tourism, Minister for Administrative Services and Minister Assisting the Minister for"" Industry and Commerce) (10.13)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill proposes amendments to the Industries Assistance Commission Act 1973 as a consequence of an independent review of the functions and operations of the Industries Assistance Commission. The Government's election platform included a commitment to review the role of the Industries Assistance Commission to ensure that its operations are directed towards the development and extension of industry. The independent review conducted by Mr John Uhrig was announced on 3 August 1983. Mr Uhrig presented his report to the Government on 16 December 1983. The Government's major concern in initiating the review was to maximise the effectiveness of the lAC as a provider of practical advice to Government on questions of industry assistance. In the past, the Commission has tended to focus on tariff and other related forms of protection, with the result that its recommendations have often been stereotyped,with lower levels of protection frequently being put forward as the sole solution.to an industry problem. In the Government's view, theÂ· restructuring and revitalising of Australia's industrial base require that there be a much greater emphasis the development and implementation of a wider range of positive industry assistance measures. agreeing with the thrust of the Uhrig report, the Government concurs that it is now time to make changes to the Commission so that it will be able to contribute more effectively to the formulation of the Government's industry policy. Changes are proposed to the Commission's approach to the quiry process and the nature of its advice, but to its basic independence. In proposing these changes the Government is conscious of the comments by Mr Uhrig that changes in legislation will not, on their own, ensure that more effective advice is forthcoming from the Commission. Mr Uhrig said that much will depend on the lAC being more responsive to the information needs of government. Government must in turn ensure that requeSts are framed in such a way as to permit the most effective use of the Commission's expertise. The Government agrees with these sentiments. The Uhrig report called for are-orientation Second Reading towards industry-wide references which specified in greater detail the information needs of the Government. In addition, it proposed that references should normally require that options be provided-including the Commission's recommended option-and that the Commission's advice should extend beyond its current somewhat narrow focus on barrier protection to cover other forms of assistance. The Government has accepted these recommendations and believes that they should lead to the Commission providing considered advice on a number of methods by which the Government can pursue policies to facilitate structural change and industrial development. The Government has also accepted the report's recommendation that, while no formal link should be established between the lAC and the industry councils, there is scope for increased use of the Commission by the industry councils. In particular, the' councils may find it useful to draw on the extensive information base built up by the Commission during the course of its inquiries. They may also see benefits in requesting the Commission, through the Minister, to undertake research tasks which complement the Commission's work schedule or requjre some of the special skills of the Commission's staff. The Government believes that its acceptance of the vast majority of the review's recommendations will result in an emergence of a new era in the industry assistance advisory process. In parwill ticular, the improved operations and procedures on .of the Commission should allow it to become more effective in meeting the Government's inIn dustry policy objectives and needs. These objectives stress the need for industry to become more internationally competitive, more flexible and better able to take advantage of technological developments. In. pursuit of these objectives, the Government wants' to shift the focus of industry inassistance away from the past concentration on not protection to more positiveÂ· forms of assistance which will actively assist industry to restructure. This includes measures designed to. stimulate investment, increase industrial research and develo.pment, provide mo.re and better training and retraining facilities, upgrade expo.rt suppo.rt services and provide industry with easier access to. develo.pment finance. It also. invo.lves develo.ping mechanisms which will ensure that the benefits o.f restructuring are realised, and the eco.no.mic and so.cial Co.sts o.f adjustment are no.t bo.rne dispropo.rtio.nately by the.se at the face o.f change. The Government has agreed that the Co.mmissio.n's po.licy guidelines sho.uld be simplified to. reflect widely suppo.rted industry po.licy o.bjectives. Acco.rdingly, the new guidelines, as set o.ut in clause 11 o.f the Bill, are cast in terms o.f facilitating adjustment and enco.uraging the gro.wth o.f efficient and internatio.nally co.mpetitive industries having regard to. the interests o.f o.ther industries and consumers. Clause 13 o.f the Bill proPo.ses to. implement the acceptance o.f the reco.mmendatio.n that the Co.mmissio.n's po.wer to. initiate its o.wn inquiries be revo.ked. Such decisio.ns are po.licy matters and are mo.re appropriately made by the Government itself. Ho.wever, the new arrangements will no.t prevent the Co.mmissio.n from suggesting to. the Government the need fo.r an inquiry where this is co.nsidered to. be warranted. A majo.r reco.mmendatio.n by Mr Uhrig was the abo.litio.n o.f the Tempo.rary Assistance Autho.rity and that the lAC be respo.nsible fo.radvising o.n all tempo.rary and sho.rt term assistance matters. The Government has agreed to. this and to. the related reco.mmendatio.n that a separate set o.f guidelines be develo.ped to. apply to. all tempo.rary assistance matters. The guidelines pro.po.sed in clause 17 o.f the Bill are based upo.n the.se pro.po.sed by Mr Uhrig. The Government's decisio.n to. alter the tempo.rary assistance arrangements reflects its co.ncern that the current provisio.ns pro.vide o.ppo.rtunities fo.r assistance to. be granted where the underlying problems are no.t tempo.rary but o.f a lo.ng term structural nature, o.r reflect an eco.no.my-wide problem which is impacting adversely acro.ss all secto.rs. We have therefo.re decided to. make tempo.rary assistance available o.nly in cases' where serio.us injury is o.ccurring o.r threatened to. an industry by circumstances largely o.utside its co.ntrol, and where the circumstances are peculiar to. the industry o.r are impacting with particular severity o.n the industry. Further, the fo.rm o.f such assistance is no.t to. serio.usly disadvantage o.ther Australian industries. The Government has also. decided that where tempo.rary assistance is reco.mmended by the lAC it is to. be limited to. a maximum o.f 12 mo.nths and the Co.mmissio.n will be required to. report <;>n whether circumstances warrant a subsequent inquiry into. ,lo.nger term assistance. The Co.mmissio.n is also. to. repo.rt o.n whether in its view an inquiry into the need fo.r further tempo.rarY assistance wo.uld be likely to. be required prio.r to. the expiry o.f any tempo.rary assistance already granted. This pro.vision is to. co.ver the.se situatio.ns where 'tempo.rary' problems may exist fo.r lo.nger than a 12 mo.nth perio.d. In additio.n, the Commissio.n shall repo.rt o.n what actio.ns it co.nsiders the industry sho.uld undertake during the perio.d o.f tempo.rary assistance. A fUIther reco.mmendatio.n accepted by the Government is to. make specific reference to. tertiary and service industries in the Industries Assistance Co.mmissio.n Act. This reflects the impo.rtance o.f this secto.r to. the Australian eco.no.my and the higher prio.rity the Government will be placing o.n examining issues which may be facing tertiary industries in Australia. By also. agreeing to. eliminate, in mo.st instances, first ro.und public hearings as i pro.po.sed by clauses 23 and 24 of the BiII the Government is seeking to. impro.ve the efficiency o.f the Co.mmissio.n'so.peratio.ns and reduce the Co.sts incurred by many interested parties in presenting evidence. In line with its o.bjective o.f increased co.nsultatio.n in the decisio.n making pro cess, the Government has further agreed that, in mo.st cases, final repo.rts will be published prio.r to. a Government decisio.n being taken. The o.nly exceptio.n to. this will be the.se o.ccasio.ns when significant commercial gain co.uld ensue, or where internatio.nal nego.tiating po.sitio.ns might be jeo.pardised. The Government is co.nfident that the changes to. the lAC's charter and o.peratio.ns as propo.sed by this BiII will enable the Co.mmissio.n to. provide a mo.re valuable input to. industry develo.pment in Australia. To.gether with o.ther changes occurring in the adviso.ry and co.nsultative pro.cess, these changes further reflect the Government's co.nsensus-based approach to. industry po.licy fo.rmulatio.n and eco.nomic po.licy generally. Financial Impact Statement The measures co.ntained in this Bill have no. direct financial implicatio.ns. I co.mmend the Bill to. the Ho.use. Debate (o.n mo.tio.n by Mr Braithwaite) adjo.urned. . NURSING HOME FEESÂ· DETERMINATION PRINCIPLES 1984 Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders Mo.tio.n (by Mr Young)-'by leave--'--agreedto.: .That so much of the Standing and Sessional Orders be suspended as would prevent Notice No. 643, General Business, being called on forthwith. Motion for Disallowance MrCARLTON (Mackellar) (10.24)-I move: That the Nursing Homes Fees Determination Principles 1984, formulated under sub-section 40AA (7) of the National Health Act 1953, be disallowed. I raise this matter in the House, it having been discussed in the Senate and not proceeded with by the Senate basically becauseÂ· the Australian Democrats did not meet an undertaking they gave to the Opposition and to nursing home industry representatives that they would supportuson this disallowance motion. Consequently, the pisallowance motion was not carried by the Senate. This is an important matter relating to the care of the aged and the disabled in nursing home!! and ,it affects the financial viability of privately operated nursing homes. It is a.matter of subordinat- legisc lation and IS something that this House has the opportunity to deal with by way of disallowance. Indeed, today is the last day on which it can be dealt with. The Opposition iSl1eeking the support of the House of Representatives to disallow a thoroughly unjust set of principles which have been determined under the National Health Act 1953. Let me say something about this nursing home business in general. The Opposition will not claim that it is totally without some blame-'-in fact, considerable, blame-for the difficulties faced by the nursing home industry. Over many years this was an area of. considerable administrative and political difficulty. The original method of setting fees for nursing homes goes back to legislation formulated by the MCMahon Government but passed by the Whitlam Government in .1973. Various fee setting mechanisms have continued more or less unchange<;l for the succeeding 11 years. At the time. I was appointed Minister for Health in 1982 1 regarded this area of administration as one th.!\t presented the most difficulties for the Departm-nt of Health and for the Executive. In conjunction with the then Minister for Social Security, Senator Chaney, and the then Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator Messner, I set up a )'Iorkingparty under the head of the Social Welfare Policy Secretariat, Mr Daryl Dixon, to examine the ,whole question of nursing homes, their administration and' fee setting principles. I also took on a private external consultant, an Â·economic consilltant to.the Department of Health, to aSsist in this work. On it number ofoccasiohs when I was Minister I expressed my ,very, grave concern about the state of this industry, about the way in which the people who were running nursing homes were being treated by the Government and by the Department and the difficulties which public servants within the Department of Health, both in the Federal area and in the State offices, were experiencing in administering an almost impossible scheme. I also expressed my concern about the fact that the subsidies for beds in private nursing homes were quite different State byState because the costs were different in each of the States; the State governments, of course, having the responsibility for setting standards in nursirig homes and for negotiating industrial awards but not bearing the financial responsibility, which was borne by the Commonwealth. It was a matter of some concern, certainly to States such as Western Australia and Queensland where the bed day subsidy was considerably less than in such States, for example, as Victoria. Indeed, the amounts were SO per cent or more higher for the same service, in effect, in Victoria than they were in Western J\ustralia. All that is acknowkdged. I know that the Minister will make a great meal of the fact that this was an inherited problem. He will go over his usual complaints about what was left to him. I merely say that this problem was very clearly acknowledged by me publicly and privately, and everybody knows that. I indicated during the last six months or so in which I was in that chair that I regarded it as the biggest single policy problem that I had to address. I did this in conjunction with my fellow Ministers in the Senate. That is the background of the matter. Certainly, if we were still in office, had we had the further 18 months that has elapsed since the time that we actually went out, as has the Minister for Health (Dr Blewett), who is sitting opposite, we expect that we would have gone a long way in sorting out these problems. Unfortunately, I have to report to the House that not only has the Minister opposite failed to do anything about this to this point but also, with the kind of principles that have been brought in under the National Health Act and for which I am seeking disallowance, he is making the situation worse. Firstly, the Government did not meet and has not met its promise to set up an office of aged care. This was a bipartisan policy proposaL Both the then Government, nOw the Opposition, and the Australian Labor Party promised to set up an office of aged care: I inform the House that Senator Chaney, Senator Messner and I had already; before we left office,Â· worked out the administrative arrangements for this office of aged care. The whole thing was ready to go immedi. ately after the election. We were holding off only to have discussions with various groups before we made a decision as to whether the office would go into the Department of Social Security or the Department of Health. The Labor Party promised to set it up when it came to office and to put it into the Department of Health.",19
13,Mr HUNT,INDUSTRIES ASSISTANCE,Why haven't they done it?,22
14,Mr CARLTON,INDUSTRIES ASSISTANCE,"That was a promise. Why has not the Government done it, as the Deputy Leader of the National Party so correctly asks? I do not know. I can only assume that there. has been an outbreak of bureaucratic in-fighting, which certainly Senator Chaney and I would not allow. I presume that the Minister and his counterpart in the Serate, the Minister for Social Security, Senator Grimes, have not been able to come to an agreement on what should be done and have not been able to give instructions to the Public Service Board to proceed with this office. I think it is a disgrace that 18 months down the line we still d- not have this co-ordination of policy which is essential to bring the various elements of aged care into the one administrative unit. Secondly, I simply do not know what the Government has been doing with the work that was prepared by Mr Daryl Dixon and his working party or what it has done with the work that was prepared by the private consultant whom I appointed but who was asked to leave the Department's work when the present Minister took over. No particular reason was given to him for his departure. That work having been done, 18 months down the line we wonder why there is no clear nursing home funding and fee setting policy. Thirdly, the whole area of nursing homes has been put under very considerable stress because of the changes made under the Medicare legislation to the rule governing long stay patients in private or public hospitals. I dealt with this matter earliÂ«r this week in the House. In short, what it means is that after 35 days in a hospital, public or private, unless a doctor is able to sign a certificate, called section 3B certificate, which states that the patient needs continuing acute care, that patient loses the private hospital benefits. If he is lic hospital he will have to pay immediately $12.40 a day from his own resources to the hospital. So a p.atient cannot get a free bed under Medicare if he happens to miss out on a section 3B certificate. If he is in a private hospital he is in much worse standing because he will lose benefits which can make him liable to payments of at least $50 a day. The amount increases depending on the cost of the private hospital. The 35-day period was previously 60 days under our administration. Also, the certificates that were signed had four different criteria under which a patient could be allowed to stay in hospital-for example, for continuing care of a condition, not just acute care. This was a much more reasonable way of dealing with people who were elderly and classed as long term sick. It allowed them,in their own time and in a reasonable and decent fashion, to find alternative accommodation or to recover in a hospital and go home. Under this cruel and harsh 35-day rule introduced by the Minister there is immense pressure on nursing home beds, which are simply not available. There are waiting lists for nursing home beds all over the country. There is an additional demand, because of this 35-day rule. It is squeezing people out of private hospitals and they simply have nowhere to go. In addition, the Minister has not approved any new nursing home beds since the Government came into office 18 months ago. The Minister in response to this assertion always says: 'Yes, but there are various beds coming on stream'. These, of course, are as a result of approvals given during my period of administration or that of my predecessor, the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar). The Minister imposed a complete freeze on nursing home bed approvals for 15 months. Following that he introduced new guidelines for nursing home beds which make it almost impossible for anybody to get new nursing home beds approved. What has he done? He has increased the pressure and thÂ« flow of patients to nursing homes through his 35-day rule. He has not brought in any satisfactory domiciliary care services. Again, that is another promise which has been broken. Nothing has been done in that area.",22
15,Mr HUNT,INDUSTRIES ASSISTANCE,Have the benefits been increased?,22
16,Mr CARLTON,INDUSTRIES ASSISTANCE,"The benefits have been removed under this 35-day rule. That is a disgraceful thing. This whole industry is in a state of very considerable stress. The final point I want to make a about the general situation is that the Minister has a determined attitude of opposition to private nursing home opÂ¥ration. Indeed, earlier this week, in a pubon Tuesday or Wednesday, he made an unprincipled attack on a nursing home operator, a Mr D. B. Moran, who had placed an advertisement in the Brisbane newspapers drawing attention to some of these problems. The Minister attacked Mr Moran on the basis that he had run a profitable business and had become a wealthy man as a result of his business activities. This was a disgraceful attack. It seems that under this Government it is a sin to run a profitable business. I am not aware-certainly nobody has given me any evidence-that the person who the other day was attacked so viciously by the Minister runs bad nursing homes. All the evidence I have had has been to the contrary. I also understand that Mr Moran has given advice and assistance to religious and charitable bodies in the setting up of their nursing homes and that he is widely respected by those bodies. I am not in possession of all of the in- unfair formation regarding his activities in that area, but I have been told by religious and charitable groups that they value the work he has done and much of it has been done on a donated basis. That is just an example of the attitude the Minister has towards the private enterprise operators of nursing homes. No doubt not all operators run good homes and not everybody does the right thing all the time. However, by and large the private nursing home proprietors are the ones who do a lot of innovative things in this area, and it is essential that the industry be allowed to operate profitably. I return to the motion for disallowance. A Case brought by the Alexandra Private Nursing Home was heard in Melbourne before Mr Justice Woodward. As background to that case, I point out that over several years in a number of Federal Court of Australia and High Court of Australia judgments it has been found that the Federa1 Department of Health applied guidelines for the determination of nursing home fees in breach of section 40AA (7) of the National Health Act. That section requires the Department of Health to have regard to costs necessarily incurred when it sets fees. Rather than comply with that section of the National Health Act and rather than proceed down the road of making determinations having proper regard to costs, the response of theÂ· Department was to amend the Act to remove that section and the requirementto have regard to costs necessarily incurred. In its place the Department substituted a requirement to have regard to what were called principles which were to embody established departmental practice. In other words, the Government, instead oflistenhlg to what the courts had said and continuing to apply the requirement to have due regard to costs, decided to alter the rules of the game to validate what the Departmenthad done and to do so by means of introducing some new principles. As a result of these actions the Alexandra pdvate Nursing Home challenged the Department in co.urt on the basis of the old provisions of the National Health Act. Mr Justice Woodward found that, because. of the passageÂ· of the new legislation, the. Department had acted technically within the law. There is no complaint about that. Mr Justice Woodward went to some lengths to make it clear that the decision, to use his word, was a hard decision. He went further and said that the Department's decision was unfair-again Mr Justice Woodward's word. He said that the Department seemed to be squeezing the profits of private nursing homes just short of the point causing the enterprise to fail. His Honour stated: I agree that it is from the applicant's point of view quite that it should have to accept a profit in 1984 that is little different from that which it was accepting in 1972 . .. . In the light of this evidence there can be little doubt that the Department is taking a hard line with the proprietors of established nursing homes. He went on: I do not believe that the use of historic costs by the delegate-that is the Department-- . is 'so unreasonable that no reasonable person could have so exercised the power' to fix fees in such a way. With the passage of time, and depending on the levels of inflation, the situation may eventually be reached where such a'decision could be so described, but the wording of the ADJR Act-that is, the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act-on this point, which I have just quoted, is very restrictive. I have already said that I think the applicant is entitled to regard the decision as quite unfair. That is what Mr Justice Woodward said. I also quote from an earlier judgment of Mr Justice Northrop in respect of Nagrad Nominees Pty Ltd. He talked about the departmental guidelines that preceded the principles. They. are virtually the same set of rules we are looking at now. Mr Justice Northrop said: As a result, no person properly advised would consider purchasing an approved nursing home business. As a corollary, existing proprietors are saddled with a business producing a diminishing financial return and are unable to sell that business for anything like its current value; Likewise, no account is taken of capital actually invested by a proprietor in a nursing home business, but profitability is determined on an artificial amount of capital expended at an earlier and irrelevant time by the proprietor of premises in which a nursing hqme business is conducted. In simple terms, what this means is that the fees are determined on the basis of assets which were valued, say in the case of the Alexandra Private Nursing Home in 1972, at $140,000. If one allows a 10 per cent nominal profit on $140,000, the nursing home is allowed to have $14,000 profit. However, if one updates the asset to the current day, one finds that it is worth $760,000. Allowing 14 per cent or 15 per cent these days to service debts, one can see that a profit of the same amount, $14,000 on a capital value of $760,000, is absurd. So what happens under these principles is that if one has an asset which is valued historically at some certain point, at that time one gets a reasonable return on it, but as the value of the asset rises and, as inflation, interest rates and goodness knows what else rise over a period, one is allowed to have only the same dollar amount of - <. profit year by year on an increasing asset; therefore, one is gradually, determinedly, going broke. That is the effect of the principles that the Minister has introduced.",22
17,Mr WHITE,INDUSTRIES ASSISTANCE,That is what he wants.,24
18,Mr CARLTON,INDUSTRIES ASSISTANCE,"Yes; he wants to squeeze them out of business. That is the only interpretation that I can make of these principles and why he is bringing them in. They were bad principles or bad guidelines that were being applied by the Department under my administration. I make that quite clear; under my administration these are the guidelines that were being used. The Minister knows that. I said that they were bad at the time, and we were doing something about them. . Mr HUNT - But we were building nursing homes too at that time.",24
19,Mr CARLTON,INDUSTRIES ASSISTANCE,"Yes-and this Minister is closing down the nursing home business, building no new nursing homes, and squeezing existing proprietors out of business, too. What the Minister says is this: 'All right; you can have only the same amount of dollar profit, virtually, year by year, on an asset that is increasing in value, and you cannot sell it to anyone else because no one would want to buy it under those cirpumstances'. This means that year by year, inexorably, these b-sinesses become unprofitable. The logic of these principles is absolutely clear. That is their intent, and It is not just the Opposition that is saying this; it is Mr Justice Woodward, in the Alexandra case; and Mr Justice Northrop in the earlier Nagrad Nominees case. Both judges made it absolutely clear that they regarded this situation as nonsensical. Let us be clear about what the Government has done. Instead of taking the advice prepared by the working party of Mr Daryl Dixon and the private consultant that I prought in and, instead of proceeding with the setting up of the proposed Office of Aged Care, the Government has allowed these old guidelines to continue under new legislative force. It has entrenched a provision whose intention is to make privately operated nursing homes gradually go broke. Given the Minister's vicious attack on one of these private operators earlier this weekÂ· in this lIouse-a quite dreadful personal attack-it is clear that. the Minister is following his usual socialist path, as he is with Medicare, and determinedly trying .to put the private nursing homes out of business. The people who will suffer will be those. .who are, already suffering dreadfully under this Minister-the aged, the sick and the infirm. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Child)Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Is the motion seconded? .",24
20,Mr WHITE,INDUSTRIES ASSISTANCE,"I second the motion, Madam Deputy Speaker, and reserve the right to speak. Dr BLEWETT"" (Bonython-MiIilster for Health) (10.44)-'the honourable, member for Mackellar (Mr Cai'lton) began by lamenting the fact that the Australian Demodats had not. supported this motiori in the Senate. If his colleagues in the Senate presented the same miserablec611ection of arguments as he has done, I am not surprised that thepemocrats did not support it.. The honourable member's arguments essentially consisted of, first, a series of irrelevancies which have nothing whatsoever to do with the principles which he is seeking to disallow. I shall not deal with all of those irrelevancies, except to repeat that there is a simple and clear answer to the argument that this Government is somehow not providing nursing home beds. That answer is that since we have been in government 2,452 beds have come on stream, which is much the same number of beds coming on stream as in past periods, and that another 3,316 beds are approved. It is true that they were approved under the previous Government, but this has enabled us to have a pause in new approvals so thatÂ·we can have a properly planned policy. But there has . been no squeezjng in the provision of beds. As I say, since we have been in government, 2,452 beds have come on stream. ... . I do not want to go on dealing with irrelevancies. I want to tackle what little . argument ,the honourable member for Mackellar present<;d, In essence, it was an. argument that we are to be attacked because in 18 months we have nQl.dealt with issues with which the 'previous Govermnent failed to deal over eight years. It is argue\i that we have not yet put our Office of Aged Care.inpla<;e. Opposition members had eight years to put: .an aged care office in place. They knew .tl).e pressure for it; nothing was done. Again, the honourable member claimed that we have not clarified theseÂ· very difficult ,issues inrelation to nursing homes. Opposition members had seven or eight years during which these problems were before them,and they were not tackleo.We have had 18 months. The only thing that e,merged from the honourable gentleman's speech Which I welcome was the kind of confessio-al-pol()gy for the performance for those' 'seven ye!irs. \VÂ« certainly accept that. . . , . . . The chaotic and quite contradictory nature of the Opposition's health policies has qeverbeen more in evidence,than it is in the m6tioribefore the House, because it must rate as one of the great about-faces of all time. What the Opposition has done this morning is to move to disallow a set of fees determination principles which do no more than codify a scheme wRich it introduced in 1972 and which was administered by honourable members opposite unchanged for eight of the past 12 years. The honourable member for Mackellar, to give him some justice, confesses to the fact that they are procedures introduced by his Party when in government and administered by his Farty for eight of the last 12 years. The current arrangements Were developed and enacted under the Liberal-Country. Party Government in 1972. They provided foqignificant increases in nursing home benefits; they also provided for the introduction of controls ov-r the numbers of nursing home beds that attracted benefits, over the patients admitted to these beqs and over the maximum fees charged. From the inception of the fees. control arrangements, fees were increased to reflect increases in. costs, .but there was no general provision for profitability levels to be increased .. However, reasonable increases in rent were reflected in fees of homes where leases are at ll-rm's length, so such homes . hilve received prqfit increases. Further, proprietors could appeal to the Minister if they considered that in their particular case an increase in profitability was warranted. Throughout the time that the present Opposition was in government it maintained this policy. It became increasingly clear during this period that the whole question of nursing home profi. tability needed to be examined and anomalies redressed. The ex-Minister confessed to his recogni.tion of that. But the problem in those seven years proved all too hard for the' previous Government. The matter was examined by adiJisory'committees and successive consultancieswere 'let, but all this led to nothing in those seven years. The Liberal and National parties didn<it know where to go with the nursing home profitability question, and had no real policy on aged' care. By contrast, this Government came to office with a clear aged care policy, but it also inherited the problems in nursing home funding that had been exacerbated by the inactivity of its predecessor: The Government's policy objectives in relation to nursing home funding were clearly stated by me in the second reading speech on the National Health Amendment BiII 1983. I stated: Existjngnursing home benefits rangements will be' replaced by program grants paid to nursing homes. These program grants will be based on standard costs for the services delivered less the income received by the homes through standard patient contributions. The program grant system will take some time to develop. In. the meantime the existing funding arrangements for nursing homes will be maintained. I further stated: .In summary, the proposed changes will ensure that the Government is able to continue the application of policies and practices in nursing homes fees. control, establis-ed and supported by successive Governments, pending the introduction of the present Government's resIdential care program. The. partic:ular change which .would enable the continuation of the' existing arrangements was the provision, for the Minister to make the fee determination principles which are now the subject of the Opposition disallowance motion. It. was the objective of the Government at the time that legislation was enacted, and it remains the intention of the Govermrient, that there should be orderly transition fr-m the prelfent funding arrange-ents to program grants. .. The principles which the ()pposition seeks to disallow. were developed in consultation with interested bodies, including the Australian Nursing Homes Association, and there is substantial agreements that they reflect existing policy. I should add that the Australian Nursing Homes Association did nQtendorse the approach to profitability rellected in the principles but I will say a little more about that matter later. The need for nursing home fees to be determined in an orderly . manner was recognised by Mr Justice Woodward of the Federal Court of Australia in the recent case involving Alexandra Private Nursing Home, from which judgment the honourable member quoted. His Honour stated:' . .' In the area as important as the calculation of profits for nursing homes there must necessarily be a substantial degree of uniformity of approach at questions of principle, or injustice as between nursing homes could.become rife. It wOj.lld create \>by,ious difficulties if different delegates were to adopt different criteria in deciding - hen to, depart froll) historic costs in order to allow much larger profits based on current valuations. There is much to be said for the view that exceptions to such a general rule should be made in a consistent and 'co-ordinated way by the Minister who is responsible to the Parliament for both the economic and equitable administration of the legislation. The fee control principles which the Opposition is now trying to disallow will provide the basis for the high degree of conformity and the equitable administration Of the legislation which Mr Justice . Woodward said was needed. They will also go some waytowai'ds satisfying one of the long standing complaints of the industry-again never addressed by the previous Government in its and deficit funding <lrseven years of office that there is no consistency or . uniformity in the setting of fees either between or within states. . This need for an orderly approach in taking nursing home financing decisions is of particular significance as nursing home fees have to be met either by taxpayers or patients. Expenditure by the Government on nursing homes is estimated at some $1,OOOm in 1984-85, so it is vital the Government responsibly consider the interests of patients and taxpayers as well as those of nursing home proprietors. To give the industry overly generous profitability would result in an enormous extra cost to the community, but that is not to say that the legitimate profit aspirations of the industry should be ignored. While it is certainly true that the interests of the patients and taxpayers must be protected, it is equally true that proprietors have a right to earn a profit from their business. But the reasons why people invest in a business and their expectations of what they want out of the business are very complex, particularly in the nursing home industry. Investors may choose the nursing home industry for no other reason than the profit the business generates. Alternatively, they may seek the sec,urity of the investment which government regulation brings to the industry. They may also seek the capital gain on the asset, the business or both. Some enter the industry out of a sense of altruism, but even then it could be, argued that they deserve a fair level of profit on their investment. Against this background, it is very difficult to determine exactly what a fair level of profit is for the industry. The industry is very protected and is virtually riskless. Proprietors are almost guaranteed 100 per cent occupancy because of the limitations on bed numbers by successive govern. ments. Proprietors' are assured of minimal bad debts and regular cash flow because the majority of their income comes from either government lost benefits or payments from patients' pensions. In"" vestment in the industry provides a source of ployment for many proprietors or their families of and there are intangible benefits which flow from owning and operating your own business. There are a number of other factors which may influrangements ence the level of profitability of a nursing home, su,ch as the capital gearing or whether the home freehold or leased. But the fact that the problem complex does not mean that we should igQore it altogether as the Opposition did for eight years. As I said earlier, there were a number of halfposition's hearted attempts, half-finished half-baked ideas which came from the previous Government, but. there was, n,eve, any real attempt to address the difficQltquestion of nursing home profitability. By contrast, this Governremain ment has, within the first half of its te,rm in office, set up a working party of industry and departmental representatives to examine this complex question of profitability. I am advised that the.r- is a good spirit o(co-operation in the working pl;lrty, and I am sure, that the Australian Nursing t1OlT1es Association representatives would agree that significant progress has been made. I expect to re,ceive the report of the working party this month. The fact that this Government took the initiative in setting up the working party on profitability clearly came as a surprise to the indQstry. After years of distrust and suspicion ,in their, dealings with the previous Government, it approached the working party ..yith some caution and scepticism, and understandably so, given the trea,tment it had received previously. Overcoming this legacy and putting the negotiations between government and the, industry on a more productive and trQstlng basis is a major undertaking. Undoubtedly, there have been some constraintS <m profitability, particularly in Victoria in recent years, but even in Victoria these constraints are much ef'aggerated. Thery are still many people'seeking appro,val to, build new homes, and propriet-rs are a-le to sell their businesses at prices which include large Com"" ponents for goodwill. The amounts paid are known for 16 transactions completed in Victoria ' since I July 1983. The goodwill 'pet' nursing home bed ranged from $2,144 to $8,500, and only in four cases was the goodwill figure below, $-,500 an per bed. This is hardly a description of ind\lstry which it has been alleged has been driven to the vergt;: of bankruptcy. The real question is: What does the Oppositi(m seek to gain by disallowing the principles? There are nearly 50 principles providing for the setting of fees on a consistent basis, and all these will be because of concern over the one principle, important though it b(:, relating to return on investemment. The disallowance of the principles will not itselfresult in ,any change in profitabil-ty policy, but it willresulUn more energy being devoted to disputation within the, existing finan-ing arand to greater scope for inconsistent' decision-making. Uncertainty for both ,the prois prietors arid the patients will be incre-sed;enÂ­ is deavours to introduce the new program grants ar-Â· rangements will be made all the hard-,r. Yet it seems that the simple motive lying behind the Opmotion is simply to make all these tasks consultancies and more difficult. I emphasise that the, Government intrgduced ,the principles only to enable existing policieS to in place while the program grants arrange..; ments are being developed. It is obvious, t11at the' complexities of the indust-y are such that we cannot move to a new system overnight. Some developmental work is already underway in relation to nursing home and hostel costs, and we will shortly commence a study into standards of Care. But while thIs work is being done, we need to continue the exi-ting scheme on a fair and equitable basis, and on'li consistent and underst-ndable basis. The fee. control principles hold out the only hope of allowing substantial progress' towards residential care grants and an orderly change over from one system to another. The position is that! exp-t to receive this month the report of the working party on profitability to which I have referred. The,mattet will then be corlsidered by Cabinet as soon as practicable;' I am well aware of the position of nursing homes which have experienced significant erosion Of profitability, such as the AlexandraPrivate Nursing Home referred to by the honourable niembe- for Mackellar, and will draw their positiori to the attention of Cabinet. The Governmentaccepts that some modification of the principle on profitability may be required. But to' disallow all of the principles because one requires amendment is counter-productive and puts us that much further away from a better systeni.

(MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) BILL (No.2) 1984 Second Reading 36 Debate resumed from 13 September, on motion 61 by Mr Duffy: That the Bill be now read a second time. 25 Mr SPENDER (North Sydney) (11.12)-The Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill (No. 2) is a Bill.containing a number of housekeeping measures, as well as some measures that are not housekeeping. I understand that in addition to the Bill in its present form there are two amendments to the Bill to be moved by the Government, to MACKellar, M. J. R, MCVeigh, D, T. which the Opposition assents. Without going into detail on all those provisions, many of which are extremely t-chnical and would also be correspondingly boring, I will touch on a few provisions. Firstly, there are certain amendments in the Bill to'the Aboriginal Councils and' Associations. Act. One of the amendments provides that for certain purposes an Aboriginal spOuse includes a person who is living on a permanent and bona fide domestic basis with the other person. Of course; special cultural 'circumstances apply to some sections of the Aboriginal community. As well, of course, a very large part of the Aboriginal community is very much part of the Australian com. munity, although we all recognise the special difficulties which have afflicted the' Aboriginal community. These are difficulties which very largely are. imposed on Aborigines from outside and which result from the history' of European settlement of Australia. In relation to that extended definition of spouse, I say that it appears to be characteristic of the progressive devaluation of the status and institution of marriage and of the traditional family unit engaged in by this Government since it came to power. We all have a right to elect to do what we wish, subject to the laws, to live with whom we want to live and to engage in whatever relationships we wish. However, we should not seek to give equal status and recognition to other kinds relationships that are not included in the ditional concept of family and marriage. I refer briefly also to the amendment to section 49A of the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act which allows white Europeans or, to put it differently, non-Aboriginals, to become members of an Aboriginal association, although without rights to vote at a meeting of the association.or to stand for election to the governing committee of the association. I looked at the second reading speech for some explanation of 'this provision but not a word was to be found concerning it. Also, nothing in the explanatory memorandum explains the reasons for this provision. lask whether this is the white agitators support clause. Perhaps the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Lionel Bowen), who is sitting at the table, can answer that. There may be very good reasons for it, although I do not know of any. I refer also to the amendments made to the Copyright Act, covering n pages in the Bill. person Whilst the Opposition does not oppose the to amendments I think it is perfectly plain that these ame,ndments could not beÂ· described as housecome. keeping amendments. Not only is their length such that they could not be so described but also they contain particular provisions portant enough to be brought forward by the ordinary process of amendments of law and not through the omnibus process which the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) BilI (No.2) allows by bringing a whole' collection of amendpose, ments through the House in one hit. For example, certain specific protections giVen for the copying of material in the. Parliamentary' Library effectively allow a complete defence for anything done for the sole purpose o(providing brary services. for members of, parliament. Members of.parliament will be glad that the Library has that protection. It means that, so long what is done is done for the sole purpose of assistis ing a person who is a member of parliament in the' performance of that person's duties, anything goeS. Of course, that is a very wide exemption. I believe-without having checked the detail-that it is far wider than the other exemptions given under the Copyright Act. We see that amendments to section 203D add particular defences to the Copyright Act. Ordinarily, defences which are to be inserted into an Act should be dealt with in legislation for that purpose and not by means of the omnibus legislation which we haye here. The. very detailed amendments made.to the Copyright Act which, as I said, cannot really be called housekeeping measures, can be contrasted of . with the amendment to the Acts Interpretation traAmendment Act 1984. Section 19 is amendlfd as follows: Omit."" 'made' "",substitute"" 'made,' "". Unquestionably that is a housekeeping amendment but I am just a little puzzled at the reason for it. It may be that the comma or inverted ;commas got themselves wrongly placed in the original Act. It is notÂ· a contentious matter; it is' ju-t a rather puzzling matter.",24
21,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PAIRS,Minor.,28
22,Mr SPENDER,PAIRS,"Yes, most certainly they - re minor. I comment briefly on one or two other provisions in the BilI. Provision is made for interest on judgments of the Federal Court and the High Court. That is certainly necessary. Amendments are made to the National Crime Authority Act. The amendments highlight two matters. One is the Government's failure to think through the implications of the original legislation and the other is the difficulties the Authority may face when a wishes to test the capacity of the Authority question him on certain matters. Only time will tell us just how great these difficulties will beIt is perfectly apparent that there is great . room for technical arguments to impede both the speed' and the effectiveness of the. operations of which are imthe Authority. Amendments are proposed to the Trade Practices Act, and these amendments are described in the Minister's second reading speech. Their pureffectively, is to remove doubt as to the ap. ' plication of section 52 of the Trade Practices Act to newspapers if they contain inaccurate information. I simply raise the question of whether the amendments go far enough to exempt from the application of that section newspapers and other limedia organisations engaged in the bona fide dissemination of what they consider to be news, re. gardless of whether the Australian public would as . consider it to be news and regardless of whether it factual. That again is something, I suppose, which can be determined only through time and through examination by the courts, if it arises, of the pn;>visionswhich are now to be inserted iIi the Trade Practices AGt. The last specific area on which I shall comment is an amendment proposed to be moved in the Committee stage by the Deputy Prime Minister to insert a new offehce into the Crimes Act. It is a surprising omission thus far. 1 will reserve what 1I have to say on that subject until the Deputy Prime Minister moves the amendment. Subject to the comIpents,that have been made, we support the legislation bijt we reiterate the need for this kind of :Bill to be truly a Bill which deals with housekeepilJ.gmatters or matters of a non-controversial nature. Major amendments, such as those which are to be made to the Copyright Act, should not appear in a Bill of this kind.",28
23,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PAIRS,"1 thank the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) for his comments on the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill (No.2). He properly said that no detailed explanation had been, given of the amendment to the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act 1976. I am advised that members of a number of Aboriginal associations have expressed Ii desire to confer membership on the nonAboriginal ,spouses of Aboriginal members and specified membership rights on other nonAboriginals. The amendments to the membership provisions of the Act will enable Aboriginal corporations to include such a provision in their rules should their members so desire. Non-Aboriginal spou-es will be able to vote and stand for office but other non-Aboriginals with specified rights will not; This will ensure that the decision-making function remains the responsibility of the Aboriginal members and their spouses.",29
24,Mr SPENDER,PAIRS,"What about the comma? 1\11LIONEL BOWEN-That matter has left a us without defence. We do not know exactly what has ,happened to the comma but we will have it looked at'. We will see whether we can make;or'unm-ke it and whether it was made or not. The honourable gentlemari has left us without a'defence at this stage. Ido not know why We wanted a'comtna removed and then replaced.

The Crimes Act amendment relates to the report tabled by Mr Gyles, QC, in which he pointed out a defect in that an attempt to defraud by an individual did not appear to be covered. The amendment we will move will deal with that. The honourable gentleman raised another matter relating to a provision under the Copyright Act. We propose to move an amendment to that Act. 1 thank the honourable gentleman for his support. I have already indicated to him the amendments we propose to move. Question resolved in the affirmative.

25,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PAIRS,"by leave-I move: (1) Schedule l,page 15, insert "", or an undertaking within a body administering an educational institution of a kind referred to in a preceding paragraph of this definition, being an institution or undertaking"" after ""an institution"" in proposed paragraph U) of the definition of ""educational institution"" in sub-section 10 (1) of the Copyright Act 1968; , (2) Schedule I, page 16, proposed sub-section lOA (6) of the Copyright Act 1968, omit '-education institution"", substitute ""educational institution"". Schedule I, page 25, after the amendments to 'the Crimes Act 1914, insert the following amendments of that Act: ""After section 29cInsert the following section: Fraud '29D. A person who defrauds the Commonwealth or a public authority under the Commonwealth is guilty of an indictable offence. Penalty: $50,000 or imprisonment for 5 years, or both.'. Paragraph 86 (1) (c)Add at the end thereof 'or'. Paragraph 86 (1) (d)Omit 'Commonwealth; or', substitute 'Commonwealth. '. Paragraph 86 (1) (e)Omit the paragraph. After section 86Insert the following section: CODsp,iracy to defraud '86A. A person who conspires with another persOn to defraud the Commonwealth or a public authority under the Commonwealth is guilty of an indictable offence. Penalty: $50,000 or imprisonment for 5 years, or both.'.... I think the explanation of these amendments has already been given in the remarks made in the second reading debate.",29
26,Mr SPENDER,PAIRS,"The amendment to the Crimes Act pr<?poses the introduction of a substantive offence of defrauding the Commonwealth. The reason this offence does not appear in the original Act can be found if one goes back to 1915. It was provided by the Crimes Act 1915 that conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth was an offence. It had been a common law offence and the High Court of Australia, in the case of the King v. Kidman in 1915, determined that the offence in the Act could have a retrospective effect, the argument being put that retrospectivity was not open to the'Commonwealth.'We have had a great deal of debate on that subject in the House. The amendment adds to the Act the substantive offence of defrauding the Commonwealth and increases the penalties, I think correctly. That now fits in with the existing offence conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth., It is a drafting oversight which has not surfaced for some 70 years.",30
27,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PAIRS,"--'--1 thank the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender). What he says is right. The proposed amendments will cure this defect which apparently has existed since 1914. The existing Act did not contain a substantive offence and this may result in needless conspiracy charges. The other point I would like to mention is that the penalty for conspiracy to defraud is inadequate. The amendments propose an increase in the penalty that may be imposed. So the proposed new section provides that a person who defrauds the Commonwealth, or a public authority under the Commonwealth, is guilty of an indictable offence. The penalty is $50,000 or imprisonment for five years or both. The offence of conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth, set out in section 86 (1) (e), is omittedand replaced with a proposed new section 86A. In similar terms, it prescribes a penalty onment for five years or both. I am reminded that the amendment to the Copyright Act is a drafting matter. I thank the honourable gentleman for his co-operation. Amendments agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Bill reported with amendments; report-by leave-adopted. Third Reading Bill (on. motion by Mr Lionel Bo\yen)-by leave-read a third time. NA SERVICE AGREEMENT BILL 1984' Second Reading Debate resumed from 13 September, on motion  That the Bill be now read a second time. (Quorum formed)",30
28,Mr HODGMAN,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,"Even laryngitis would not prevent me from commenting on this important legislation introduced into the Parliament as a result of negotiations, which extended over a period, between the Federal Min Tasmanian State Government, represented by the Tasmanian Minister, the Hon. Roger Groom, with reference to an agreement between the Federal and Tasmanian governments for the future of the Bass Strait sea passenger service. I agree with the Minister for Transport that this agreement is a of milestone because it should mark the ,beginning of an improved Bass Strait sea passenger service. I believe that this not only will be of great benefit to the people of Tasmania but also is ;lbsolutely essential nationally. The fact that the agreement was reached is indeed commendable. It would be fair to say that there have been difficulties and differences between Tasmania and Federal governments-I mean Federal governments of both political persuasions-on the question of maintaining our sea link, which essentially is the fundamental link between our State and the north island of Australia. Under the agreement Tasmania will acquire the vessel Nils Holgersson. On all reports available to me, that vessel is indeed an appropriate one. Whilst the Minister's own advisers have not accepted any responsibility or given any undertaking that the Nils Holgersson will operate successfully commercially, it is my understanding, from discussions with officers in Transport Tasmania, which is the departmental arm responsible, that it looks as though it will be a 'successful of $50,000 or impris- operation. There are matters, though, which do concern me. I hope that the Minister will not take this as a criticism in that I am expressing a vie"", that probably would not be the view of the Tasmanian State Government. Whilst I see the advantages of Tasma-is having autonomy in relation to this service, I express some concern as to what the situation might be if, in therun!Iown, for one reason or another, the proposed service is not the success which it is hoped it will be. Effectively,the Commonwealth's obligations-the Minister will cor-, rect me if I am wrong but this is what I understand the Commonwealth's obligations to be-will cease in relation to the operation of the service. It will be operated by the State of Tasmania. I would hope that we could put on the record in the Parliament today the fact that a future Federal government which found itself in a situation where the Tasmanian Government was having difficulty in maintaining the service under the terms of the agreement would be prepared to hear and respond to any representations which might be put by Tasmania for assistance. One cannot ignore the fact that the Australian National Line services operating to and from Tasmania have been able to operate only because there has been a subvention or subsidy in relation to the maintenance of that service. In short, notwithstanding the provisions of the legislation which place upon the Australian National Line under the Australian Coastal Commission Shipping Act an obligation to run the service economically and to maintain it as such, I think the plain fact is, and has to be stated, that, without the subsidy which has existed since the time ofÂ· the Whitlam Government, which was increased during the Fr.aser Government and which has been maintained by the Hawke Government, that service frankly could not operate. From time to time, politicians on both sides of this House raise the question of preferred treatment to Tasmania in relation to the maintenance of our transport links both by sea and by air. I think it is appropriate to make two fundamental points in relation to these matters. The first is that Tasmania as an original State of the Commonwealth is entitled, both in law and as of right, to exactly the same privileges as those enjoyed by other States. We know of rail links between Victoria lind South Australia and through to Western Australia; we know of rail links between New South Wales and your home state of Queensland, Madam Deputy Speaker. There is not and can. never be any rail link between the State of Victoria and other States in the north island of Australia and the State of Tasmania. Effectively, our sea link is our rail link. it is very significant that under. governments of both political persuasions the formula in relation to the freight equalisation scheme, which has operated principally as the result of representations made by Tasmanian members in this Parliament to the Fraser Government and the honouring of a commitment given to the member for Denison, the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Good luck), the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Burr), the honourable member for Bass (Mr Newman) and the honourable' member for Braddon (Mr Groom)-Mr Groom-What will happen to it?",30
29,Mr HODGMAN,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,I will come to the honourable member's point in a moment.,31
30,Mr GOODLUCK,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,What about the rumours concerningme?,31
31,Mr HODGMAN,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,I will deal with that too. The freight equalisation scheme was originally based on the tonne-kilometre rate in respect of rail freight.,31
32,Unknown,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,Honourable members interjecting,31
33,Mr HODGMAN,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,"Madam Deputy Speaker, would you prevent the Minister for Transport from persecuting the honourable member for Franklin? Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! Will honourable members, including the Minister, cease interjecting.",31
34,Mr HODGMAN,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,I have had 15 years as a State referee in amateur boxing and I just want to keep the Minister a.nd the honourable member for Franklin apart for the moment. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! The honourable member will come back to the point.,31
35,Mr HODGMAN,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,"Yes. Would the Minister be good enough to withdraw the last remark about the honourable member?  endorsed the remark. He does not object to it; he has agreed with it. I have no intention of withdrawing it. Mr ,HODGMAN-Madam Deputy Speaker, for the sake of Hansard, the Minister asked the honourable member for Franklin to tell the truth. The implication-Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Would the honourable member for Denison please proceed.",31
36,Mr HODGMAN,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,"I will leave it to the honourable member for Franklin to defend himself. I was making the point that in the original freight equalisatiori scheme the greatest thing ever done for Tasmania by any Federal government-let it never be forgotten-was done by the Fraser Government; that is, the manner in which the compensation was assessed was by equating the tonne-kilometre rate for rail travel as between Victoria and South Australia and Victoria and New South Wales. The second point I want to make for those who criticise the scheme is that no public transport that I am aware of operates as a rule at a profit. It is basically public transport because private enterprise is not prepared to operate that particular service and the government, be it State or Federal, feels duty bound to provide the service. I do not know of any railways in Australia which operate at a profit. It is true that some sections of some services do. I remember a former chief of the Australian National Railways saying: 'If it does not move, freight it by rail'. In other words, moving' stock, including human beings, is not a profit maker for the railways, but non-moving cargo is. I have heard it said that there is not a single metropolitan bus service in Australia which operates at a profit. I have further heard it said that there is not a single government operated shipping line which has operated at a profit. So whim honourable members on both sides of the House are inclined to ridicule the assistance provided for Tasmania, let me simply say that $31m, which was the highest appropriation under the Tasmanian freight equalisation scheme in the Budget appropriation of 1982-83, is a drop in the ocean in a Budget which that year had an appropriation in excess of $53 billion. The honourable members who will foIlow me in this debate will point out that, in the two Budgets that have come down since the Hawke socialist Government came to power, the amount approthe priated under the Tasmanian freight equalisation scheme has been reduced. I repeat: It has been reduced. It was reduced in the 1983-84 Budget. is further reduced in this year's Budget. It is down to $28m compared with $31m. Mr Groom-With no account for inflation.",31
37,Mr HODGMAN,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,"The honourable member be that has pointed out that that does not even take into account inflation. In real terms we have looked a massive reduction in freight equalisation ments. That is why many Tasmanians in primary industry, secondary industry and tertiary industry are expressing very grave concern. It is no good the Minister trying to blame the honourabk rational member for Franklin or anyone else in, this matwhich ter. The plain fact is that the word is abroad Tasmariia that if the Hawke socialist Government is re-elected one of the first items on its be the Tasmanian freight equalisation scheme. I know that the Government is saying that it is able simply going to be reviewed. We know from past experience that when it is reviewed this in-vitably means either a cutback or a cutout. I ask the Minto attack' me. T havetfied to keep ister to give a clear and unequivocal assurance to this House that the Tasmanian freight equalisbe ation scheme will not be scrapped if the Governdown ment is, by some grotesque misfortune, elected a further term in office. I ask the Minister to further firm undertaking that it will not be cut tations'from Tasmania: back under the guise of the review, ;' To enable' my colleagues thehonburable tre-tedasa member for Franklin, the honourable member for Braddon and the honourable member for Wilmot! to speak in this matter I will conclude .my re-, marks. Across partylinesJ express appreCiation', that the Tasmanian Minister, the Hon. Roger Groom, MHA, and the Federal Minister, the Hon. Peter Morril), MP, WCfre able to bri'ng this agreement to fulfilment. We look forward to the arrival of the Nils Holgersson. From the material I have seen, it is a most attractive looking vessel. I am told by those who have traveIled' on itTasmanian officers and Federal officers have actually seen it-that it is an extremely pleasant vessel. It carl be operated with a lesser' complement than comparable vessels operating in Australian waters. It will boost dramaticaIly the OF"" portunity of Australians to visit our State. Madam Deputy Speaker, as you WQuld know, theinain problem in' the past has been the waiting' time. The service has been so popular that people have had to wait and have had to book 12 to 18 months in advance. My final point is t-at the ANI. has anno-nced, . following the signing of this agreemel1t and before introduction of this Bill into the Parliament, that . it may weIl compete against' the Nils Holgersson which will be operated by the State of It Tasrriania. The ANL' did notÂ· seem' to meÂ· to be now very concerned, on some of its statemehts- ab\,ut getting a neW vessel and really building up the Bass Strait trade. Having been fairly low key, it has suddenly become more interested. It may well we will have it 'situation similar to the Ansett Airlines of Australia and Trans Australia at Airlines situation, with one Federal government payoperated service competing with one State government oP,erated service,----not quit- private enterprise, but quasi privllte Cfnterprise. I do not , fear competition, providing the competition is . and providing we ha\ie' asit'uation in the one'service which is to be operated by in the State of Tasmania and with the co-operation of private enterprise; namely, the Nils Holgersson hit list will . service, is not put to death. I.think it would be an outrage if the.ANL was to use its resources to kill this s-rvice before it got off the' ground. I hope that the Minister for Transport will riot use his reSponse iii'this debate my, remarks' reasonably moderate. I hope that the MiriiSter will prepared to accept that, ifthere are problems the track, it will be the duty of a Federal for government, be it this' or aÂ· subsequent governgive a ment, to r-pond sYll1pathetically to represen. ! I, I"" I do not believe that this m-,tter should .be political one. We are tlj.1kingabout thlifeblood link of our State and that puts it above, one would hope, the realm of party politics. I have certainly not been politicaUn my remarks today. I purposes, wish the new service every success. I look forward the to travelling on the Nils Hoigersson at the earliest opportunity. I hope that this will open up a new chapter in better links between Tasmania and its Treasurer sister States and better opportunities for the depropriations velopment of Tasmania's most impressive tourism amount industry.",32
38,Mr CHYNOWETH,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,"My desire to speak on the Bass Strait Sea Passenger Service Agreement Bill 1984 stems from the fact that my electorate of Flinders borders Bass Strait and therefore has a common border with Tasable mania. I feel that Tasmanians deserve at least one member in this place to speak for them j so I have nominated myself to be that person. The Labor Government has provided over $25m for the purgive chase of the Nils Hoigersson to provide sea pass"" enger services to the beautiful State of Tasmania. It is one of the nicest States in the Commonassistance wealth. I have visited the island many times know that Tasmanians can be justly proud of their fine island. They have the right to good representation in this House. However, I am sorry say that in March 1983 they seem to have elected the wrong people,people who are in conflict with their coalition partners. Let me read some very notable quotations from the shadow Minister and from Tasmanian members. This is from the Oppoas sition shadow Minister for Transport: I ask the Treasurer whether it is necessary, for defence purposes, that some Australians-",33
39,Mr GOODLUCK,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,I warn the member that the die is cast. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs honourable Darliog)-Order! You do not have the call.,33
40,Mr GOODLUCK,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,If he is going to make this a political exercise it will be on for young and old. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Would the honourable member for Franklin be seated?,33
41,Mr GOODLUCK,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,",--I warn him that there will be no peace movement. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! I warn the honourable member for Franklin. He does not have the call. Please do not get up and shout across the House without addressing the Chair.",33
42,Mr GOODLUCK,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,'-I have warned the Minister at the table. He has been dishing it up for a few years. He is going to get a bit back today. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Would the honourable member for Flinders like to continue?,33
43,Mr CHYNOWETH,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,"This is what the honourable !Dember for Hume (Mr Lusher) said: I ask the Treasurer whether it is necessary, for defence that some Australians occupy Tasmania. Is this only reason some Australians live in that State? Will the Treasurer table a cost-benefit study indicating how much mainland Australian taxpayers contribute to the maintenance of the population of Tasmania? Will the consider transferring all Tasmanian subsidy apto the defence vote? Failing this, can the be transferred to the social welfare vote? Failing that, can the sovereignty of Tasmania be transferred to New Zealand and, if any subsidies are still required, can they be paid under the foreign aid vote? Mr Miltoo-Who said that?",33
44,Mr CHYNOWETH,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,"That was the honourmember for Hume. That surprises me. I am quite certain that the people of Tasmania will be appalled when they hear that their coalition partners represented here in Canberra are trying to away the beautiful island of Tasmania to New Zealand. It is a disgrace. The majority of . Australian people realise that they must receive and those of us in the Labor Party are and I very pleased to support and assist Tasmania. Even as late as 12 o'clock last night the honourto able member for Maranoa (Mr Ian Cameron) was complaining that moneys given to Tasmania for assistance should be removed. The Liberal and National parties have no policies to assist Tasmania. The division within the coalition is as deep the waters of Bass Strait, and they are saying these things in public. It is indeed a shame that infighting in the coalition should effect all Tasmanians. I would like to bring to the notice of the listening public some of the assistance that the Hawke Government has given. Before I do so, I remind people in Tasmania of something that the member for Franklin (Mr Good luck) said: We in Tasmania realise that we have to be sensible and have to realise, once and for all, that we cannot be continually propped up by the mainland. Obviously he does not want the Tasmanian freight equalisation scheme to continue. That is a disgrace.",33
45,Mr GOODLUCK,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,"I raise a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. I would like that removed from the record. It is totally untrue. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Darliog)-There is no point of order.",33
46,Mr CHYNOWETH,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,I would like to remind the people of what Bruce did say and where it actually came from. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! Would the honourable member please refer to honourable members by their title?,33
47,Mr CHYNOWETH,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,"I am sorry. I would like to remind the people of what the honourable member for Franklin said: ' We in Tasmania realise that we have to be sensible have to realise, once and for all,that we cannot tinually propped up by the mainland. This is in Hansard for 2 November 1983, at page 2229. I would like to bring to the notice of those listening some of the' assistance that we in' the Hawke Labor Government have given to Tasmania. Federal transport assistance to Tasmania in 1984-85: Roads, $5Im; rail, $21m; Tasmanian freight equalisation scheme, $29m; Empress of Australia subsidy-",34
48,Mr HODGMAN,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,"On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker: The honourable member has just misled the House. It was Do not say that it has gone up. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER':"":'That is not a point of order. I call the honourable member for Flinders.",34
49,Mr CHYNOWETH,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,"I am talking about the that 1984-85 assistance. The Empress of Australia subsidy comes to about $2m. The total is approxitralian mately $103m, or $2m a week. That is a huge intends amount. I am quite certain that the voters of Tasof mania will remember that in the coming months. The Hawke Government has shown a genuine doubt concern for the State of Tasmania that no other past government has shown. I am sure that the this people of Tasmania will wish to be represented this House after the next election by Labor ' pose members who will truly represent them in the next Hawke Labor Government.",34
50,Mr BURR,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,"1 think the cynithe cal and sarcastic speech that we have just heard from the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Chynoweth) will put paid to any chance that the Australian Labor Party may have thought it had of winning seats in Tasmania. I am quite certain that people in Tasmania listening to this broadlaw cast and hearing the cynicism that has just been put forward by the honourable member and his colleagues would have no doubt as to where votes should go at this coming election. In that regard I thank the honourable member for his tribution, having put paid to any chances that candidate colleagues may have thought they had in Tasmania. The Bass Strait Sea Passenger Service Agreeconj'unction ment Bill 1984, which has been outlined by colleague the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman), provides essentially for an agreement between the Tasmanian and Federal unions governments to provide $26m for the purchase the vessel Nils Holgersson as ostensibly a replacement for the Empress of Australia to conduct the passenger service across Bass Strait. The intention' and of this agreement is for the Tasmanian Govern-' be conment, having received that money from the Federal Government, to purchase the vessel and operate the service. I give credit to the Minister for  for having shown sufficient confidenct(in the Tasmanian Government's ability to operate that service more efficiently and more effectively than the Australian National Line has done in the past. I share that confidence in the capacity of the Tas' { manian Government to operate that service in a way that will best suit the interests of Tasmania. I am quite certain that Mr Gray andÂ· his Government will be able to provide that service very reduced in 1983-84. effectively. While I compliment the Minister and the Government on providing $26m for the purchase of what will, I believe, be a very good and very capable ship for that service, I must admit that I have some reservations about subsequent matters have occurred. My colleague the honourable member for Denison mentioned that the AusNational Line has now given notice that it . to continue the operations of the Empress "" Australia on the Bass Strait run. As I read the ' Minister's second reading speech, there is little in my mind that the $26m being granted to the Tasmanian Government for' the purchase of new vessel was at all times intended to be used in for a replacement for the Empress of Australia. I this question to the Minister: If it was the intention of the Minister and the Federal Government to use this specifically for a replacement for Empress of Australia, what is the Federal Government's attitude towards the. ANL maintaining the Empress of Australia on the existing run? Is it the intention of the Federal Government to spend a huge amount of money refitting the Empress of Australia, which un-er Federal must be refitted by 1985, so that it can continue its operations? If that is so, that amount Of money will have to be spent in addition to the their $26m that is presently being granted. . I wonder what involvement the Federal conGovernment may have had in causing the Aushis tralian National Line to come to the conclusion that it should maintain the Empress of Australia. I wonder whether that conclusion was reached in with the Federal Government or my whether the Australian ,National Line reached that conclusion in conjunction with the unions. The involvement of the combined maritime on Bass Strait shipping gives me great of cause for concern. The honourable member for Flinders in his contribution mentioned that successive Federal governments have provided a sub,stantial amount of money for Bass Strait shipping by .way of subsidies to. the Australian National Line. But what the honourable member did not mention was the reason for that subsidy. 1 remind him that the major reason that subsidy is necessary is the unrealistic demands by the combined maritime unions over such things as staffing levels, maintaining manning levels on the vessels, the amount that these people are paid, their amount of time off and all the rest of it. These things, which cause exorbitant running costs for these vessels, are the reasons why we have to have taxpayers' funds subsidising the Bass Strait operations. It is not because of any factors in Tasmania, or any lack of passengers or freight; it is simply because of the unrealistic demands by unions and their ever avaricious demands for more and more pay and better and better conditions. That is why Bass Strait shipping is so expensive. The other thing that concerns me about the involvement of the unions-I can vouch for this from my own involvement with shipping prior to my entry into this Parliament because 1 worked as an executive with a shipping operator in Tasmania-Dr Everingbam-Were you on an award?",34
51,Mr BURR,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,"No, I do not want an award. I just happened to work for the Holyman line, which has had many years of experience of shipping to Tasmania. We found from our experience on that operation that it was always the combined maritjme unions' intention that the Australia'n National Line should have a complete monopoly of shipping across Bass Strait. They made absolutely no bones about it. They pursued that objective with great. vigour and never let up on it. It worries me greatly that at the moment the Federal Government is making $26mavailable to the Tasmanian Government to purchase a new vessel. That, we assume, has been done in conjunction with and with the co-operation of the Australian National Line. But suddenly we find the Australian National Line reversing its apparent co-operation in this matter and announcing that it intends to maintain the Empress of Australia, which will effectively be in competition with this new ve.-sel. I am concerned that that may have been done with the provocation of the combined maritime unions because it may well be the intention of those unions to cause such industrial disruption for this new vessel that it will be unable to compete economically with an old and outdated ship such as the .Empress of Australia. I will be very interested to learn what involvement the Minister and the Federal Government.may have had in that decision to retain the Empress of Australia. Madam Deputy Speaker, I do not wish to detain the House for overly long. My colleague the honourable member 'for Denison has already mentioned the freight equalisation scheme. We are conscious that the Tasmanian freight equalisation scheme is at present under investigation by Mr Justice-Mr Groom-It is under threat.",35
52,Mr BURR,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,"Yes, as my colleague from Braddon said, it may well be under threat, but it is also under investigation by Mr Justice Everett. Mr Groom-And the Inter-State Commission.",35
53,Mr BURR,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,"And the Inter-State Commission; the honourable member is quite right. While we accept the proposition that the freight equalisation scheme should be regularly reviewed and we have every confidence in Mr Justice Everett to conduct that review very fairly and to come up a with most adequate report, we still feel that there is some reason to be concerned in Tasmania that it may well be the first stage of the freight equalisation scheme being scrapped. 1 remind the Minister that the freight equalisation scheme is extremely important for the Tasmanian economy because it has enabled Tasmanian producers to compete on the mainland markets on a fair and ' equitable basis, and not to be constantly impeded by the cost of Bass Strait shipping. 1 thank the Minister for the allocation of $26m that has been made available for the purchase of the Nils Holgersson. I am sure the Tasmanian Minister, Mr Groom, and the Tasmanian ,Premier, Mr Gray, would also want to pass on their thanks to the Minister. I express my confidence in the capacity of the Tasmanian Government to operate this service very efficiently and very effectively. I am sure that in the long term, provided that it is given a fair opportunity to show its worth by the union movement, this vessel and the way in which it is operated by the Tasmanian Government will prove very beneficial to Tasmania.",35
54,Mr MILDREN,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,"I wish just to correct a couple of items before commenting on the Bass Strait Sea Passenger Service Agreement Bill. Earlier, the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) indicated that Tasmania is en- ; titled to exactly the same privileges as are enjoyed by every other State. Isuggest that if that were the caSe it would rapidly become a terrible backwater. Tasmania requires more than that and it always ' has done. I also wish to comment on the Tasmanian freight equalisation scheme. It is true that the scheme has been referred to the Inter-State Commission, which is examining it to see whether it is doing what it was intended to do. I do not believe that it is proper to adopt the rather paranoid approach indicated on the other side of the House by impiying that somehow or other this will result in a deliberate disadvantage to Tasmania. That is quite appalling. It' is an appalling indictment of the Commission and of the Minister and I do not think those sorts of implications sit very well with the other side of the House. The third matter is that of the Australian National Line challenge, as it was put. I would have thought that, as the upholders of the private enterprise system, members of the Opposition would have clamoured for the challenge. It is course, interesting that the Ho!>art Mercury and the Launceston Examiner both accept as desirable the possible continuation of a competing AI'lL, especially for those times during the year when ferry services are extremely important. We cannot have a socialised private enterprise remaining a private enterprise. It is a case of competition, and that is fair enough. This is Hobart Mercury stated in an editorial on WednesChynoweth) day, 3 October: The Tasmanian Government, which purports to port free enterprise, can only welcome the news that Australian National Line is considering challenging rights to rule the tourist waves ferry, the Nils Holgersson. I think that is extremely good. The Examiner made this comment: What the ANL is now considering is exactly what the State Government was begging of the Federal GovernPeter ment last yearto provide another ferry for the Bass Strait crossing during the hectic six months when prevents thousands of would be tourists from making trip. That is true; it has. Tourism is a tremendous into dustry to Tasmania. I also believe that tourism tremendous industry to my electorate of Ballarat. I have great faith in the development of the tourappear ist industry. Tasmania requires as much as get. It requires as many berths across Bass Strait as it can possibly get. It has been stated purpose of the Bill is to approve an agreement tween the Commonwealth and the State of mania to provide a grant in excess of $25m to able the Tasmanian Government to acquire German ferry, the Nils Holgersson. In the. long term the ferry will replace the Empress Australia and will provide the opportunity for a much improved Bass Strait sea passenger service and freight service between Tasmania and the mainland. The grant will enable the State Government to purchase the ferry and to make necessary; modifications to it and to terminal facilities in both Melbourne and Devonport. The Tasmanian Government has given an assurance that it will accept all the responsibility for the operation of the vessel for a period of not less than 10 years. The Government is quite certain that the ferry will run profitably. That statement by the Tal/manian Minister for Transport, Mr Groom, was . reported in the Hobart Mercury on 31 August. In addition, he is reported as stating that the financial viability was such that it would withstand competition, provided that ANL contil1ued to operate the EmPt:ess of Australia. He realiybelieves that it will be a financial success and, of we wish the venture well. It will be a great boon to Tasmania to have the Nils Holgersson. It will also enable Tasmania to adjust the serviCe ship for across the Strait as it sees fit. The Tasmanian Liberal Party members of this House say that the Hawke Government neglects their State. That is nonsensical. My colleague the what the honourable member for Flinders (Mr detailed the sorts of assistance we have given and will continue to give, and that statement could not be further from the truth. supThe problem of a modern and adequate passenger the transport service between Victoria and Tasmania its has existed for years. It was obvious long ago that on Bass Strait with its new the Empress of Australia could no longer meet the demand on its own and provide the level of comfort and convenience required by modern tourists. I congratulate the Minister for Transport (Mr Morris) on his concern for the welfare of TasmaniansÂ· and his willingness to come to grips space with this problem of the inadequate Bass Strait the passenger service. The fact that little was done over the syven years of the previous Government speed up the response to the needs of tourists is is a an indictment of that Government and also of the Tasmanian members. The Opposition does not to have a uniform policy on the welfare of it can Tasmania, and my colleague the honourable member for Flinders has pointed that out. The that the anti-Tasmanian statements of a number of bemembers of the National Party of Australia over Tasthe past few months-that includes the Oppoensition's spokesperson on transport, the honour the able member for Hume (Mr Lusher)-probably partly explains why Tasmania did so badly during of the seven years of the Fraser Government. I commend the Tasmanian Government for taking over the responsibility for the ferry. As we know, the ANL is moving out of this enterprise until such time as it determines whether. it will maintain a service. It could not have done it alone. The assistance of the Commonwealth Government was essential, even though not all Tasmllnian politicians will accept that. For instance, many people do not recognise that the honourable member for Franklin-I must repeat this because I think that Tasmanians certainly need to understand it-sometimes speaks without giving sufficient thought to the consequences of his statements, arid I am being kind to him. I repeat what he has said: We in Tasmania realise that we have to be sensible and have to realise, once and for all, that we cannot tinually propped up by the mainland. I believe the words 'propped up' are most inappropriate and inexact. Of course the service constantly require subsidisation. We know that, so let us not get ourselves lost in thatÂ· maze fiction. I believe that the service will require eral assistance for many years to come, and I debating? suggest that the island State would become a very sad social and economic backwater if it did not receive assistance. This action by State governments will help to avert that fate for Tasmania. According to the advice the Federal Minister from his counterpart in Tasmania, the ferry should commence operations March 1985. I hope that that time schedule is kept. The 900 passengers and 440 cars capacity of the ferry is twice the capacity of the Empress of Australia and should greatly assist the country. I must say that had this debate been held last night the only Opposition representative on the speakers list was the shadow Minister for bate Transport,the honourable member for Hume, for Franklin. who is not here today. Not one Tasmanian politician was prepared to make one comment in support of this cross-strait ferry. Mr Groom-Madam Deputy Speaker, I raise aÂ· point of order. In fact on our list on this side there were three Tasmanian speakers. I am happy to talk today if the honourable member wants to he hear me. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs the Australian Darling)-Order! There is no point of would like to make a comment regarding the frivolous points of order which Opposition members have been taking this morning. I refer honourable members to Standing Orders and ask them not abuse them. The form of a point of order is to raise a legitimate mistake by an honourable member who is not sticking to the Standing Orders. They are being abused and I ask honouruse able members to cease abusing them or the Chair will have to take action.",35
55,Mr MILDREN,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,"I will bring my speech to a close. There will be good representation from Tasmania following the next election. The new members will be Vicky Buchanan in Bass, Greg Peart in Braddon, David Llewellyn in Lyons, John Devereux in Franklin, and Kaye Spurr in Denison. Mr Groom-Madam Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The honourable member has now sat down but what was the relevance-Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-That is not a point of order. Will the honourable member be con- please be seated and in future take note of the comments of the Chair. Mr Groom-Madam Deputy Speaker, may I will make my point? My point was that the honourable member who has just sat down read out the of names of the Labor candidates in Tasmania. I ask Fedyou: Was that relevant to the Bill We are Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order!

Mr Groom-What an absurd ruling! Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! The honourable member for Braddon will not reflect on the Chair. I ask him to act maturely, observe the courtesies of the House, and not act in such a kindergarten manner. It reduces the level of dein this. House. I call the honO\.-rable member",37
56,Mr GOODLUCK,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,-'-1 was going to thank the Minister for Transport (Mr Peter Morris) for doing a good job in negotiating with the Tasmanian Minister for Transport. I will not do that because he has turned this debate into a cynical political exercise. Time and time again has deliberately tried to take the mickey out of me. Today I reckon he has things Organised in his file to talk about what B. J. Goodhickdid about Trader. There may also be someorder. I thing about the Tasman Limited. Mr Chynoweth-Pardon?,37
57,Mr GOODLUCK,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,"I tell it straight to the to honourable member for Flinders: I am not ashamed of anything that I have said about Tasmania. I love it; I live and breathe for it. Even Dorian Gray, the Prime Minister, will probably the suggestion during the next election campaign that Bruce Good luck was ashamed to be a Tasmanian. I was ashamed to be a Tasmanian when the great white god went down there and stupid Tasmanian people flung their arms around him after he had got rid of the dam. That is why I said it. Mr Chynoweth-You have said it again.",37
58,Mr GOODLUCK,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,"I am not ashamed to repeat anything that I have said about Tasmania. I shall go into the next election campaign and do my best to represent Tasmania. This is a great thing for Tasmania. The honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Leo MCLeay), prompted by the Minister, brought out a notice of motion during the week to the effect that Tasmanian members were frightened, too timid, to say anything about the National Party and the honourable memb-r for Hume (Mr Lusher). We are not a bit responsible for him. He, tongue-in-cheek, can say what he likes about Tasmania. We work with him. We are not ashamed of what he has been saying, because he probably said it tongue-in-cheek. What prompted my notice of motion was the suggestion by the honourable member for Grayndler that we were t06 timid to resurrect it. My notice of motion has probably upset the Minister. I am not a promoter of rumours in Tasmania about the freight equalisation scheme. I have not said a word about it in public. It is everywhere in Tasmania. I am afraid that it has been referred to the Inter-State Commission. Of course people talk-but let it not be said that it came from me or from the other Tasmanian inembers, because it did not. We cannot help it. If honourable members opposite want a political fight on this issue, we are quite prepared to give it to them, at any time and in any place or forum. None of the five of us can be ashamed of what we have tried to do. Admittedly, we have not always got our own way, but we have done fairly well for the people of Tasmania, and they know it. It all started with Billy Snedden. He was the arTasmania; chitect of a plan for Tasmania. We have tried to the best of our ability-Mr Burr;-And we have been successful, too.",38
59,Mr GOODLUCK,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,"Yes, but we do not talk about that. It is silly for Government members to try to be cynical about certain things that we have said and done, such as my talking about whether Tasmania needs to be propped up. Mr Milton-You did say it.",38
60,Mr GOODLUCK,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,"Of course I said it. We want to be independent of the crowd over here. We do not want to be dependent on the greenies and the other trendies that walk Australia. We want to make our own decisions. We want to be on our own two feet. I repeat: If we in Tasmania could survive without some of the subsidies, we would love to do so. We would like to be independent. We did not want the interference in the dam matter. Government members know that they made a bad mistake with that, because they have re-elected five members in Tasmania. We shall get elected again, because the people of Tasmania will not allow them to forget that they trod on our rights and interfered with what we wanted to do. We shall remember. That is why I said what I said. We want to be independent and to try to make our own way. That is all that we ask. It is only automalic that we fight for a slice of the cake.. We are normal politicians representing our electors to the best of our ability, and we want what we can get from the cake. I come now to the ship. We are depending on that ship. It will be a great advantage to Tasmania. We are a tourist isle. Thank goodness the Tasmanian Government and the tourism authorities have woken up to themselves in Tasmania and are using the hook once again-the apple. We are the Apple Isle. We shall always remain that. It does not matter what some trendy journalists and socialists say ab()ut things, that we should be this or that; we want to have the heart of Tasmania, once again, as the Apple Isle. We shall attract tourists. We can talk about the lovely parts of Tasmania. As a result of that, people from the mainland will visit Tasmania. The ferry is very interesting. I refer to today's Hobart Mercury. ot course, my name is not mentioned in it, again. Mr Chynoweth-Oh, bad luck!",38
61,Mr GOODLUCK,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,"That is absolutely right. The more that one tries in this world, the less one is thought of. Does the honourable member not agree? The Hobart Mercury has given Steedman two articles, two full pages. He has had more publicity than I have had all the year. I have tried for I try, try, try. But that fellow is brought down and is given all the publicity. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Child)Order! I ask the honourable gentleman to return to the terms of the Bill.",38
62,Mr GOODLUCK,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,"Certainly, Madam Deputy Speaker. But that is what it is about really. Anyway, the Hobart Mercury has written avery good . article. It states: The new Bass Strait ferry, Nils Holgersson, will have to carry 150,000 passengers in the first year of operation to make a profit. Last year the Empress of Australia carried 125,000 peqpJe and had to have a multi-million dollar Commonwealth subsidy. I think that it ran at a loss of about $2.3m, from memory; so it needed assistance. It could not survive by itself. It will save the taxpayers of Australia X amount of dollars if the ferry can run economically and efficiently and be self-sufficient. That is our hope. We need people to visit Tasmania, Because of the downturn in our industries, we definitely need tourism. We need the spin-off that comes from people visiting Tasmania. They buy local products and stay. inÂ· the hotels there, and we are geared for that. They are essentiaL For that reason, I welcome the ferry to Tasmania. I am sure that it will be successful. We in Tasmania will give it all the support that we can. Some of the tourist officers do not seem to promote Tasmania as I should like them to do. Even the air hostesses put on their overcoats on arrival in Hobart and say: 'My word, it's cold'. It is a lot, colder in Melbourne and in Canberra.",38
63,Mr HODGMAN,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,My word it is.,39
64,Mr GOODLUCK,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,Yes. That is a factor. We must be absolutely positive about Tasmania. We must. talk about it; about the beauty and about what people can get when they go there. We must talk about the tranquillity. That is what we want. Mr Milton-Sunburn.,39
65,Mr GOODLUCK,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,"One can get sunburnt in Tasmania, too, in summer. The beaches are the best in the world. Tasmania has everything going for it. Mr Chynoweth-Oh! Mr Groom-He has never been to Tasmania.",39
66,Mr GOODLUCK,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,The honourable member has never been to Tasmania? Mr Chynoweth-I have been to Tasmania sevconsideration eral times. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! The believe honourable gentleman will speak through the Chair. The honourable member on my right will not speak at all.,39
67,Mr GOODLUCK,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,"I hope that the Minist-r has a tab on everything that I have said. I hope assistance. that you tell the people of Tasmania what a bad boy Bruce Good luck is, what he has done for Tasmania, what he has said about the ferry and what he has said about the Tasman Limited. I see he has got it already. ",39
68,Mr GOODLUCK,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,I do not cry. I never cry in spect public. ,39

70,Mr GOODLUCK,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,"Sure, I froth at the mouth. Anyway, I think that I have said enough about the ferry. I hope that I have defused the Minister's political onslaught. The Minister's advisers can smile. They have probably docked everything about me. If they have, bad luck-it is Good luck. We welcome the ferry.

71,Mr GOODLUCK,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,Perhaps the Minister will give us a few answers about the Australian National Line. ,39
72,Mr GOODLUCK,BASS STRAIT SEA PASSENGER,"The Minister indicates th-t the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman), has already asked the questions. We need to know what the ANL will be doing in the future so that we can be prepared to support as much as possible the advent of this ferry, which will be of great advantage to the people of Tasmania.  for Transport) (l2.28)-in reply-I thank the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman), ' the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Chynoweth), the honourable member for Wilmot (MrBurr), the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Mildren) imd the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Good luck) for their contributiorls to the debate and for the kind remarks expressed by a number of them. I shall take on board for the serious parts of the contribution by the honourable member for Franklin. I do not the belly-aching and the bleating do anything to advance the cause of Tasmania. Tasmania has serious transport disabilities. We have sought to address those positively and constructively. The belly-aching and the bleating do not do Tasmania any justice; nqr do they provide any ' The honourable member for Denison raised the question: 'What if the service is not a success?' Let that me repeat that the agreement provides for independence and control of the new vessel by the Tasmanian Government. The financial responsibility is that of the Tasmanian Government in reof the operations of the vessel for a p'eriod of 10 years, which is its expected economic life. As to whether the service is not a success, that is the view being put by the honourable member for On the basis of the information provided by the Tasmanian Government, and in its judgthe service should be a great success and a financial success. In respect of the Tasmania,n freight equalisation scheme, I deplore the rumour-mongering coming from the Tasmanian members of the Liberal Party in this place on that issue. It is doing serious harm and damage. It is being spread around Tasmania only by the Federal Liberal Party members in this chamber; let there be no mistake about that. The honourable member for Bass (Mr Newman) is missing. If it continues, all it will do is create instability and undermine confiwould dence in a State that needs every assistance it can get and every strengthening of confidence it can get. This Government is determined to give it that confidence. We will not have a bar of the rumourmongering and mischief that are coming from Opposition members. The Inter-State Commission which is carrying out the review of the Tasmanian freight equalisation scheme is led by an eminent Tasmanian, Mr Justice Mervyn Everett. Are the members of the Liberal Party opposite suggesting that the Commission is not doing its job, that there is some competence or irresponsibility? I hope they are not suggesting that. I know that they will be rejected by the Tasmanian people if they are suggesting that. The Government is putting to the Tasmanian people and to Tasmanian industry the following question: Please tell uS your views, your aspirations, and what you see as the needs of a freight equalisation service .or a freight subsidy. That cOurse has to be followed. It has had wide, suppor't in Tasmania; it has had a positive effect that people have a forum in which to ,put the fa-ts. Having watched the Press coverage .it has received in Tasmania, I know that the work of the Inter-State Commission is being supported by the mass of Tasmanians and cettainlyby Tasmanian industry. It will report tome by 31 MarchMr Burr-I can see the honourable member for Herbert laughing behind you. He knows what happens in these matters.  member for Wilmot wants to throw cold water and be negative about everything related to Tasmania, then no doubt he will go ahead, but I hope that ,he will stand up and be counted. We are doing something positive for Tasmania. There is a concern about the Tasmanian freight equalisation scheme expressed by members of the Opposition, and it comes from the National Party. I deplore the attacks made on that subsidy and subsidies in general for Tasmania which are coming from the National Party, particularly, the hO,nourable member fcir Dawson (Mr Braithwaite). As I have said on a number of previous occasioijs, i think it is time those member- who presently, represent Tasmania stood up in this place and put a case for Tasmania and did something about. the denigration of those subsidies and, assistance th;lt is coming from the National Party in thispla-e. Let it not be suggested to me that the Government is , not acting positively on the freight equalisl\tion scheme. The present Government is doing sQmething that the previous Government did not do. The previous Government could not ge- its act tOl:\ether; it would .not review the scheme and not update the application of the apprqpriate provisions to Tasmania. I do not know what the objective of the honourable member forÂ· Wilmot (Mr Burr) was ih seeking to attack the Australian National Line and its intentions for the Empress of Australia after it comes out of service. The legislation under which the ANL operates had the unanimous support of. this chamber and the other chamber. It gives ANL greater, responsibili-y and greater independence in its operations. It requires ANL to exercise a much greater degree of commercial judg- ' in- ment in the operation of its services.Â· The Australia:n National Line, like any other shipping operator, is looking at the services it provides:It will. exercise its own commercial judgment in what it does in respect of services across Bass Strait. Let it be clear that the provision of services across the Strait is unrestricted. Section 92 of the Constitution prevents the regulation of services across the Strait. It is simply a matter for the commercial judgment of a firm or organisation or the in judgment of a government as t,o \Vhat - ervices might be operated or withdrawn and what are to be the prices of those services. Opposition members should not do Tasmania a disservice by confusing the picture. I want to look at the matter from a much more positive angle.' The Government appreciates the co-operation that has been received from the Tasmanian Minister for Transport in the negotiation ' "" of this arrangement. Between, that Minister ,and me there has been straight dealing arid forthright- , ness and we have reached a satisfactory conclusion. Th;lt is to the benefit of both Tasmania and this nation. Under' this arrangeinent this Government has given Tasmania its 'greatest, chance in history to develOp its tourist, industry and to provide a better quality of sea passenger service across the Strait. We havegiven theTasman Ian Government the freedom and' independence to determine what the frequency of service should be, what the charges should be-and along with that goes the responsibility of bea,ring the, costs and earning the profits that wilt derive from that service. ' That commitment, the proVision' of$26m Ilnd ' the passage of this legislation are evidence of the positive commitment of this Government to the people of Tasmania. In addition, I remind the House that there is Federal transport assistance to Tasmania of $2m per week for road and rail. Added to that sum of $2m per week in terms of road and rail and the freight equalisation subsidy is this additional amount of $26m to put the Tasmanian sea passenger service on a proper footing and give Tasmania the independence and the commitment to carry out the services that Tasmanians most need. I hold strongly to the view that who better knows the potential of the Tasm.anian tourist industry than the Tasmanians themselves. Who is in a better position to develop that potential, and who is in a better position to know the transport needs of Tasmanians generally across the Strait than the Tasmanians themselves. We have accepted that proposition during the.negotiations, and we wholeheartedly support it. The vessel is being provided with the goodwill of this ,Government and with our determination to give Ii. better service to the people of Tasmania. I appreciate the kind remarks expressed by some honourable members. I hope that there will be an end to the rumour-mongering in regard to the freight equalisation service and the actions by the National Party against the subsidy rather than the service. I am sure I speak on behalf of all members of this chamber when I wish the vessel well in service and. wish all those who work in it and who travel in the vessel a safe journey. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mf Peter Morris) read a third time. NA (REMUNERATION AND ALLOWANCES) Message from the Administrator recommending appropriation announ-ed. Bill returned from the Senate with a request. Ordered that the request be taken into consideration in Committee of the Whole House forthwith. Senate's requested amendmentPage 6, after clause 6, insert the following new clause: Allowance payable to Solicitor-General ""6A. (I) On and after I January 1985, there is payable toaperson(a) who holds the office of Solicitor-General of the Commonwealth; (b) whose principal place of residence was, at the time when the person's appointment, or first appointment, as the case may be, to that office took effect, at a place outside, but not in a part of New South Wales that is adjacent to or in the vicinity of, the Australian Capital Territory; and (c) whose headquarters for the purposes of payment of travelling allowance are in the Australian Capital Territory and who, in accordance with a requirement made upoh the appointment of the person to th<lt office, has established the person's principal place of residence in the Australian Capital TerritOrY or in a part of New South Wales that is adjacent to or in the vicinity of the Australian Capital Territory, an allowance at such rate as is determined by the Remuneration Tribunal for the period in which the person maintains the principal place of residence established as mentioned in paragraph (c). ""(2) An allowance payable by virtue of sub-section (I) shall be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which is appropriated accordingly."".",39
73,Mr YOUNG,JUDICIAL AND STATUTORY OFFICERS,"I move: That the new clause requested to be inserted be so inserted. The purpose of the amendment is to authorise the payment to the Solicitor-General of a Canberra allowance to assist him in making his working headquarters in Canberra. At present this type of allowance is given to High Court justices. The arrangement with the previous Solicitor-General was that the Solicitor-General should retain his principal place of residence in Sydney and comThird Reading mute to Canberra three days a week. Conservatively, this arrangement involved expeJ;lditure in the order of $20,000per annum and was subject to parliamentary criticism. The proposed Canberra allowance for the present Solicitor-General ' is proposed to be determined by the Remuneration Tribunal, but the rate which is currently determined for justices of the High Court is $9,900 BILL 1984' per annum. Given that the present Solicitor General lives in Melbourne and, were he not to shift to Canberra, would have to be paid travel allowance expenses for approximately 40 trips per annum of four days each, a saving, as I said, of over $20,000 would be involved. A number of movements in the Solicitor General's entitlements approved by Parliament indicate a clear intention to equate the SolicitorIn Committee General with judges of Federal courts. The most recent was the amendment to the Law Officers Act last year which gave the Solicitor-General the , same entitlement to salary, in lieu of long service leave, as High Court and other Federal judges have. I commend the amendment.",41
74,Mr STEELE HALL,JUDICIAL AND STATUTORY OFFICERS,"Any remarks I have to put to the Committee on this clause are not, of course, to be construed as being any criticism of Dr Griffith who is the new appointee to this important position in the structure of government. However, the matter is not nearly as reasonable as it is made out to be by the Special Minister of State (Mr Young) because this amendment proposes to re-establish, by way of payment of special allowances, a form of disability allowance for living in Canberra. That seems to revive the old system which used to operate, I understand, some time ago when it was considered to be an enormous disadvantage to live in Australia's capital city. In an age when Canberra has developed to the. stage where half a billion dollars is being spent on Capital Hill to provide new Parliament House, one would think of Canberra as one of the finest cities in Australia and n9t deserving of being regarded as part of an underdeveloped Territory. Therefore, it seems to me and to the Opposition that we ought not be in the business of providing special allowances to enable people who occupy top positions to live in Canberra as though they were suffering a disadvantage by so doing. This amendment is not the same as the amendments made to provide the $9,900 per annum allowance for justices of the High Court of Australia. This situation is not the same at all. In the latter cast; a specific allowance was given to enable justices of the High Court to live outside Canberra on the basis that they ought not to become separate from the general Australian community.",42
75,Mr HODGMAN,JUDICIAL AND STATUTORY OFFICERS,Centralised.,42
76,Mr STEELE HALL,JUDICIAL AND STATUTORY OFFICERS,"It was designed to enable them to continue to know of and to partake in the activities of normal citizens in the community so that in their adjudication as justices of the highest appeal court in the land and in interpreting the Constitution they would be subject to normal public opinion and attitudes. That allowance was given on the basis that they could live away from Canberra. The $9,900 was to be paid to them in lieu of travelling allowances. This allowance is quite the reverse. It is an allowance in prospect to be worked out by the Remuneration Tribunal to enable' the Solicitor General to live in Canberra where .he is performing his job. That situation is quite different. As I understand it, and I think it is quite certain, High Court justices whQ live in Canberra do not receive that $9,900. I think one or two of them do live here but most of them choose not to, yet fulfil their role. They do not receive a sum for living in Canberra.",42
77,Mr YOUNG,JUDICIAL AND STATUTORY OFFICERS,"But it is absolutely essential, in our opinion, that the Solicitor-General live in Canberra.",42
78,Mr STEELE HALL,JUDICIAL AND STATUTORY OFFICERS,"That is fair t;nough. 'I am not quarrelling with the Minister's direction. It mayor may not be necessary for the, Solicitor General to live. in Canberra. If the employer wants him here that is fair enough. That can be stipulated in the arrangements. But I believe that the error in the Government's appointment lies in its negotiation of the conditions' of that appointment. a When this matter was raised in the Senate in response to Senator Durack's protest at the return to the old method of regarding Canberra as a second rate city and meeting that view with speCial allowances, the Attorney-General (Senator Gareth Evans) responded to a refererice aboutthe way in which the new Solicitor-General was appointed by saying that Dr Griffith was delighted to be appointed Solicitor-General but the trouble wasÂ· that he just woke up the next morning to what was involved. It appears that these matters were in no way settled by - he Gove-nment in its discussions with the new Solicitor-General. It seems to me that the Government has made' a mess of the arrangements. That is the basis of the problem. The Government should have discussed the situation with Dr Griffith. and looked at all aspects of it. It should have look at his relocation and, because of the requirement that he live in Canberra, established a salary package On the basis of a normal attitude that Dr Griffith is an Australian citizen and is looking forward,Â· no doubt, to a long term in his high position in Canberra. He should do that in a normal Way, with a normal salary, as most other people do, aIidhe should not have to rely on a yearly paymentfrom the Remuneration Tr-bunal, especially for the purpose of relocation. If relocatioll is a consi4eration, it should be included in his salary. Inthat way the situation would be' normalised. Therefore, the Opposition does not view this amendment with high regard at all. As I have said, it believes that the Government has muffed it. It has simply failed to negotiate properly the con4itions of Dr Griffith's appointment. . .""",42
79,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,JUDICIAL AND STATUTORY OFFICERS,I ask the honourable member whether he has much more to say. If he does!' will have to interrupt the debate.,42
80,Mr STEELE HALL,JUDICIAL AND STATUTORY OFFICERS,"Acknowledging that the pressure of time is somewhat great I will not repeat myself as some of us are apt to do when time is more freely available to us. I make the point that this situation is not at all the same as that of High Court justices. It re-establishes an old prin, ciple .. I do not believe that a special payment should be made which will then be demanded, and quite rightly demanded if it exists, by other appointees to senior positions. It will open up a bottomless pit in the future. The protests made in the Senate are also valid in this House. The Opposition will not move to try to defeat this motion in some symbolic way in this chamber with its inferior numbers. To do so would seem to be an attack on a person for whom I am sure all of us have the highest respect. There is no way that we intend to be involved in such action. However we want to protest emphatically that this amendme-t, if agreed to, will lead to most undesirable practices in the future, by a distortion of salary packages, and to a false expectation by future appointees to the office.

Thaqhis House 'congratulates the Australian team who ,successfully completed their ascent of the north face of Mount Everest and ,commends the dedication, courage andiniiiative of those involved. All Australians should indeed be very proud of the achievements of the Australian mountaineers who,conquered Mount Everest on Wednesday. As ,we ,all 'appreciate, Tim Macartney-Snape and Greg Mortimer were the first Australians to achieve this feat'. Their success, quite tremendous in itself, was magnified by the fact that they were the first climbers of any nation to scale the north face in the post-monsoon period and that they were the first to climb the face without oxygen. There is no need to speak at length on this because I know that we are all at one. As Australians we can take pride in this achievement in yet another area of endeavour by an Australian team. It adds yet another accomplishment to the long list of Australian triumphs in sport and other fields of endeavour in recent times. I suppose the other one which comes very much to mind is the achievement, just a year ago, of the Australian team in Australia II. As patron of the expedition and one who has been kept in touch through correspondence from that intrepid journalist and correspondent, Simon Balderstone, I take particular satisfaction from this demonstration by an Australian team of its capacity to meet this great challenge. There are so many differences of opinion across the House but I know that this is an occasion when we are at one, when I speak for every member in this Houseindeed, I believe I speak for all Australians-in congratulating not only those who were involved directly in this magnificent achievement but also the sponsors, the Channel 9 Wide World o/Sport, and all who in any way contributed to a truly magnificent achievement. '  position) (2.03)-The Opposition joins the ASCENT TEAM Government in congratulating the Australian team on what I think the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has described, certainly in words akin to it, as a history making assault on Mount Everest. On Wednesday, through the courage, skill and daring of Tim Macartney-Snape, Geoff Bartram, Greg Mortimer, Andrew Henderson and Lincoln Hall, Australia reached the top of the world. Tim Macartney-Snape and Greg Mortimer joined one of the most exclusive groups in the world, those who have stood on the summit of Everest. This feat was achieved with a minimum of backup personnel, but a wealth of careful planning. Of course, it is a testament to these five young Australians. As the Prime Minister implied, it is cause for national celebration and reflection on what extraordinary individual 'effort can achieve. These are the first Australians to reach the top of Mount Everest. As I understand it, they reached the top in lightning fashion, without oxygen and without great support-a feat which must be the envy of all those who dare to climb the world's great mountains. I also congratulate Simon Balderstone of the Age who acted as a member of the small support team along with two Sherpas. Australia's first conquerors of Everest (;>vercame severe weather difficulties while blazing a neW route to the top via the treacherous north face of Everest. I know that I speak for all Australians when I say to the Australian Everest team members, their families, friends and supporters: 'Well done on your magnificent achievement'. May I say in the same spirit as the Prime Minister that it is unfortunate that it is only on great occasions such as these that the House comes together. I am pleased to join with the Prime Minister and I commend him on bringing this motion forward.",43
82,Mr SINCLAIR,AUSTRALIAN MOUNT EVEREST,"On behalf of the members of the National Party I support those mountaineers who with such distinction have been able to climb to the roof of the world. All of us who cast our minds back on recently recorded achievements of man remember the climb of Sir Edmund Hillary and the great pride it gave to all of us in this part of the world that somebody from' the southern hemisphere and from our sister nation across - he Tasman had been the first to make that great ascent. Since then we have had the pioneers into space. However, I think in terms of physical achievement there are few who reach the distinction of climbing Mount Everest, the highest of all the mountains of the world. To those who participated in the expedition I think we all owe not just our congratulations but also commendation for showing that face of Australians that so many might do well to aspire to. There is little doubt that the achievements of Tim Macartney-Snape and Greg Mortimer who actually reached the summit, 'and those others, Andrew Henderson, Lincoln Hall and Geoff Bartram who accompanied them, were really outstanding in every way. Mountaineering is ateam sport. It requires an incredible amount of physical endurance. To achieve, as they have, the climb of the north face of a 8,848-metre mountain without oxygen is a tremendous tribute to their own initiative, enthusiasm, determination and coordination. To the support crew-small as it was-of, as I understand it, two Nepalese cooks, four film crew of the Channel 9 Wide World of Sport and journalist Simon - alderstone of the Age, I also extend my commendation. All members of the House would realise that Simon Balderstone received his training as a wombat on Doug Anthony's 1983 election campaign. No doubt it was from there that he achieved much of the distinction that saw him to the top of the world in I 984-as I have no doubt we on this side of the House will when we rise in the election polls within the nextfew weeks.

84,Mr CARLTON,CONTRACTS,Did the Minister for Health base his case for Federal control over doctors' contracts with public hospitals under section 17 of the Health Insurance Act on the allegedly rapid rise of costs of diagnostic services? Did he attempt to back up - his claims for such an increase with figures submitted by the Department of Health to the Penington Committee of Inquiry into Rights of Private Practice in Public Hospitals? Has he now been informed by the Penington Committee that his figures were false and that there had been no rapid increase in the use of diagnostic services? Does the Minister acknowledge that the dispute that led to the first doctors' strike in Australia's history was caused by his failure to establish the facts in the first place? Will he immediately table the report of the Penington Committee to enable the matter to be debated before the House rises next week?,44
85,Dr BLEWETT,CONTRACTS,"Even the honourable member for Mackellar knows that the dispute over section 17 of the Health Insurance Act was based on a much more wide-ranging set, of issues than were invol,ved merely in the question of to what extent doctors using public hospital facilities should be accountable for the services they deliver to private patients. That is not an issue which is related to a single set of figures. Taking up the particular issue raised by the honourable member, the figures provided were not incorrect. However,it is true that the whole series of issues about the interpretation and implications of those figures have been argued by all sides appearing before the Penington Committee.

88,Mr TICKNER,CONTRACTS,"I ask the Prime Minister: What is, the Government's attitude to suggestions ,that the National. Crime Authority Act ought to be aqtended?",45
89,Mr HAWKE,CONTRACTS,"I am indebted to the honourable member for Hughes for this question because it is very timely. The Government has indicated that it will respond sympathetically to any suggestions that may come from the National Crime Authority for any changes to or strengthening of the Act. In the House on Tuesday I said: The attitude of the Government to the Authority's powers and to any necessary extension of those powers has been made abundantly clear. But ,in case there should be the slightest doubt on t\lis taking tei the House that I will respond quickly a'nd sympathetically to a request for any such extensions from Mr Justice Stewart and his fellow members of the National , Crime Authority should they feel it necessary. The NCA has already raised two matters at an official level- not at a' ministerial level, about am-nding the NCA Act; The two amendments suggested by the NCA were, firstly, for, the InterGovernment-1 Committee to give reasons to the NCA where it does not approve a reference sought by it and, secondly, to provide Commonwealth agencies exempted under section 20 of the NCA Ac't from providing certain restricted information with a discretion to refer to the Authority evidenc'e disclosing the commission of relevant offences. The Government is giving urgent and sympathetic attention to the proposed amendments to the NCA Act. Having repeated the clear position of the Government, I say that we have also noted the amendments moved by the Opposition in the House yesterday. This will come as a matter very great interest, not only to all members House but also to the people of Australia, faced with the clear, incisive, knowledgeable involvement and interest on the part of the Opposition. Some very strange things happened yesterday. The Government finds it difficult in the circum'stanceS to take seriously any aspect of the Oppo. sition's position <;>n fighting organised crime. Our attitude,in this respect was reinforced yesterday by the fact that the, Opposition sought to amend a two sections of the Act which do not exist. That not bad achi'evement-to seek to amend two sections of the Act which do not exist! It pounded the matter further by moving an amendment, ment to a different, section, the effect of would have been to render that ,section meaningh(-s. , In those circumstances we find it impossible, as does the Australian public, to take the Opposition seriously, particularly, as I remind the House, in view of the fact that when the legislation was originally before this place the Leader of the Opposition exhibited his intense interest by failing to speak. NA",45
90,Mr CADMAN,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,"I follow up that question by addressing a question to the Leader of the Opposition. I ask the Leader of the Opposition a question relating to the Bill he introduced yesterday to amend the National Crime Authority Act 1984. Can he give the House any further information regarding his proposed amendment to section 11 of the principal Act,contained in clause 5 of the Bill? point I give a formal under member for his question. I shall try to be as brief as the Prime Minister is when he is questioned about any matter other than the deliberate and systematic destruction of effective crime fighting agencies in this country, which has had the effect of protecting, criminals. Before touching on, the honourable member's specific question, I might say that the Prime Minister referred to amendments moved by me yesterday that did not even relate to the Act. That shows how much time the prime Minister spends in the Parliament. That was the first draft by a staffer. I looked at the principal Act, saw that there was an error, changed it, and when I came into the House those proposed amendments were not even moved. In answering my question, let ine therefore be direct. I will be somewhat more direct and straightforward than the Prime Minister has been when he has been asked questions inside and outside this House about why Costigan was premaof , turely terminated and why he has backed away of this from his original call for a tough Authority.",45
91,Mr SPEAKER,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,"Order! The Leader of the Opposition should come to the answer to the question. I remind honourable members that in questions of this nature there are restrictions. They are a matter of House of Representatives practice. The Leader of the Opposition has a right to answer the question. I ask him to proceed.  is to in the question by the honourable member for Mitchell, goes a considerable way to creating an comeffective body, which we do not have at themofree from political ,interference and free which from, interference from any State government, which would be, willillg to take effective action ' and work in the way in which the Prime Minister's rhetoric indicates it ought to work, but for which it is not empowered. Without a reference the National Crime Authhowever, ority is confined only to its general non-coercive powers .. By this amendment we are breaking the dichotomy between general and special investimation gations. At present the Authority, without any that ruling. references before it, cannot hold a hearing, cannot call for documents, cannot summons witnesses, cannot execute search warrants or cannot compel answers to questions. This is the Authority presently functioning. It cannot do any of those things. If the Government were to support my amendment, which has been referred to by the jority honourable member for Mitchell, the National Crime Authority could start immediately, and gave with the sort of coercive powers to which referred. It would be able to hold a hearing, call for documents, summons witnesses, execute search warrants, or compel answers to questions. For the life of me, I really cannot understand the Government can argue that the Crime Authlaw, ority is effective if it cannot at this stage do those sorts of things. Because of an amendment to the Act by Government, members of the Authority or its staff-unless they are police officers, which none of them are-cannot even interview suspects. major feature of the Bill presented on behalf the Opposition yesterday, if it were enacted, would enable the Authority to act of its own ition to investigate any organised ties arising from breaches of Federal law. The powers we are seeking in our amendments, in parof ticular the breaking of the dichotomy from the clause referred to by the honourable member, would establish this Authority as an effective body. The fact that the Bill is not supported by the Government renders as a lie the claim that the Authority is effective. The opportunity is before the Government now to amend this toothless Act by supporting our amendments and giving the Authority the sorts of powers which I have referred. The Bill, particularly clause referred to by the honourable member, designed to ensure that organised crime involving a breach ofFederallaw-",45

93,Mr SPEAKER,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,"There is no point of order. With these matters, when questions are asked on private members' Bills, we have been down this path before. There are restrictions.

In conclusion, ,the section referred to by the honourable member is designed to ensure that how organised crime involving a breach of Federal for example, in New South Wales, cannot be protected by bureaucratic or political obstruction. I think it is relevant at present to bear that in the mind. This Government, the Hawke Government, has never been willing to act on this problem.

The Prime Minister may hate organised crime ,as he has said; but he loves and, until recently at least, has needed Neville Wran even more. The Bill that I have introduced into this House hopefully will play a part in putting a stop to what has become a political alliance which has had the effect of protecting the current major criminals in this country and the drug pushers and pedlars of New South Wales. MINI-BUDGET",46
94,Mr ONEIL,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. Is the Government plaiming a mini-Budget early next year involving a repudiation of promises it will make in the forthcoming election context?,46
95,Mr DA WKINS,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,"I have seen suggestions to this effect which have ranged from the fatuous to the .ill-informed. I am delighted to have the opportumty that this question provides to nail this furphy once and for all. What is drawn on in making this suggestion is some further continuing reforms which we are making to the Budget process. These are .two-fold. I should say, first of all, that we recogmse that the system we inherited, whilst we have be-n doing a. very good job with it, does have some madequacles. We have, as revealed in the Budget reform paper and through other decisions, embarked on a program of reform of the Budget process. The most recent decision that has been taken is to require an enhancement of the Forward Estimates for the next three years. These Forward Estimates have always been produced at the end of the calendar year, as they will be on this occasion. But they will be enhanced so that the Government will be in a better position to look earlier at the Budget process and the prospects for 1985-86. As well as that, we are requiring that staffing mates for; 1985-86 be made available to the Government in early 1985 so that again we can take decisions about next year's Budget in a proper context. We recognise that it is important to commence the planning for 1985-86 as early as possible and with the most up to date information that is available to Us. This suggestion is particularly baseless and particularly hard to understand when we look at the record .of this Government and compare it with the record 'of our predecessors. We find from the record of our first Budget in 1983-84, the results of which are well known and publicised, that outlays were $21m below those estimated at Budget time: If we 'Compare that with the record of our predecessors-the discredited former for Treasurer might like to ponder on these the figures-we find that our predecessors overshot their expenditures by $244m in 1980-81 and by $463m in the .following year. In their last year their piece de resistance, they exceeded their bud- . icy for next year. geted outlays by nearly $2 billion. The further they went the worse they got. So on the basis of our record we not only brought in our outlays below that which was predicted at Budget time but also were able to bring in a deficit which was below that predicted at Budget time. It is interesting that members of the Opposition and others shquld be spending so much time conleap-frogging centrating on next year's Budget because know that not only that year's Budget but also the Budgets well into the future will be something over which this Party will have a monopoly. I suggest that the next year and future years will provide us with even greater opportunities for the Treasurer to win more international awards as the greatest finance Minister in the world. PRIVATE HOSPITALS: REPORT OF NA",47
96,Mr CARLTON,TASK FORCE,"My question, once again, is directed to the Minister for Health. When did the Minister receive the report of the task force on the categorisation of private hospitals? Why has the Minister refused to keep his promise to make the report available to the Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association of Australia? Is it true that the report questions the whole basis of the categorisation system? In order to lay at rest suspicions that the Minister is covering up his embarrassment in this matter, will he table the report in this House? . Dr BLEWETTI received the report from the task force some time in September but offband I cannot say on what date. That task force report esti- was designed to suggest ways in which we could improve the categorisation system which we use in relation to private hospitals. I say again to the honourable member that, whatever leaks he has managed to get, the report does not challenge the fun.damental basis of the categorisation system which has been approved by the responsible private hospital organisations and the private health funds. But we are, and always have been, prepared to say that if we can improve and refine these measures we will do so. That report makes a number of suggestions' as to how we can have a better categorisation system our for private hospitals. Again let me assure the honourable member that we have given consideration to that report. I will be releasing that report public discussion next week. It will be sent to private funds and to the private hospital associations and it will be released to this Parliament. We will get a response frpm th-m so that we can work out a refined private categorisation pol' LEAP-FROGGING: DEAFNESS NA",47
97,Mr STEEDMAN,AWARENESS WEEK,"Can the Minister for Sport, Recrelltion andtourism inform the House whether he is under extreme pressure to introduce leap-frogging as an Australian national sport? Has the Minister also been under pressure to have introduced into the next Olympic they Games? Can the Minister inform the House whether he has made a decision on this matter? If so, when will he be making an announcement?",47
98,Mr JOHN BROWN,AWARENESS WEEK,"It is a well known fact that this Government, in its short period in office, has revolutionised the funding of sport in Australia. I will not go into the details, exc-pt say that funding has increased from about to about $60m in two years, which says something about how we have used sport as a social welfare matter. It is not generally known that we have also funded the recreation area very generously for the first time ever in Australia, So that have Australians involved in all sorts of useful recreational pursuits, such as playing chess or bridge, being members of marching baton twirling or bush walking, getting funding from the Government. I am sad to say that we have never considered the subject of leap-frog, which is a great Australian tradition. I think it is quite impo'rtant that we recognise why the honourable member for Casey asked this question. The honourable member happens to recognised as probably one of the greatest , froggers this nation has ever produced. In fact, skill in this House is unmatched, with the possible exception of the honourable member for Kennedy and the honourable member for Boothby, who have exhibited great skills in leap-frogging from one political party to another over their long colourful careers. The more important aspect this question is that the honourable member for Casey has also had a long and abiding interest the affliction of deafness. He has asked this tion for me to bring attention to .the fact that 15 November, the Victorian leap-frogging chamGovernment pionships will be held with all funds being donated to the Victorian Deafness Foundation. think it is one of the understated qualities honourable member for Casey that he does have a very strong and compassionate view about the affliction of deafness, which is probably the afflic- , understood tion which is least sympathetically treated Australians who do not suffer from' hearing impairment. The week before last was Deafness Awareness Week in Australia. The Prin:te Minister's wife, Mrs Hazel Hawke,lent her services to a campaign to make Australians aware of this great affliction of hearing impairment. In fact, the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, John Howard, has a very severe hearing impairment,lent himself to that advertising campaign, as did the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who suffers does the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. It is an affliction which is spread right across the Australian community and is - ery rarely recog!1ised and very little sympathy is applied. I was glad that the honourable member asked this question so I could make the House aware of the problems of deafness and some of the things that are being done not only to bring attention to it but also to provide some funds. To this extent, to the honourable member for Casey will be having $12m an Australian leap-frogging team in Canberra next week-a group of very attractive young women called the Leapettes who will be giving demonstrations of leap-frogging. We will be asking some members of the House to join in. We we now hope that the media will look sympathetically upon this as a way of exposing to the - us-ralian public the great problem of deafness which IS very girls teams, rarely recognised. NA  the Special Minister of State. I refer the Minister to recent allegations made by Stephen Bazley and to statements by the Acting Premier of New South Wales that Federal police have supplied be New South Wales police with material covering leapthe alleged involvement of New South Wales his police in drug dealing. Have Federal police expressed concern to the Minister or his sta- th-t co-operation with the New South Wales police In matters related to the Bazley allegations and drug dealings is complicated by the fact that sections of and the New, South Wales police are allegedly corof rupt? Has the Minister taken any action to cope with this problem of possible corruption when the in Australian Federal police is dealing with sections quesof the New South Wales police? Has the Minister on expressed any concern to the New South Wales about the problem of police corruption in New South Wales and the failure to resolve I the allegations contained in the tapes passed to of the New South Wales police over IS months ago? '",48
99,Mr YOUNG,DRUG DEALING,"Firstly, it should be clearly that I am not responsible for the New by South Wales police, nor for the police force of Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania, Western Australia or the Northern Territory. It is implicit in the, question that we take responsibility for the police forces of the States. Constitutionally we cannot take this responsibility; Certainly the States do not want us to take this resporisibility. We have a responsibility for the Federal police. If the - eader of the Opposition is making allegations who about malpractices or corruption in the Au-Â­ tralian Federal Police, we do have a responsIbility. I take it from the question that he does not from deafness, as do that. MrPeacock-N(), that is not what I asked.",48
100,Mr YOUNG,DRUG DEALING,"No. Let me tell the Leader of the Opposition that Mr Bazleydid appro,ach the Federal Police, as has been reported, on 28 March 1983, saying that he was in a position to provide certain information on organised crime. A proviso which he attached as a prerequisite to supplying information was confidentiality regarding his identity. An AFP investigation into the matter concluded on 30 May Â·1983 that all guarantees which Mr Bazley sought should not be met and, in the light of general allegations which he made that New South Wales police officers were implicated in corruption, it was appropriate that information be passed on to the New South Wales Police Commissioner. That was done on 7 June 1983. NA",48
101,Mr SIMMONS,SPECIAL MINISTER OF STATE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Yesterday the claim was made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that some departmental papers relevant to the Black Inquiry into Circumstances Surrounding the Making of a Customs Declaration by the Special Minister of State were not tabled. Is this correct? Will the Prime Minister agree to table any remaining departmental papers?,49
102,Mr HAWKE,SPECIAL MINISTER OF STATE,"I am indebted to the honourable member for his question. I regret that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has gone down the same path of misrepresentation so ingloriously blazed by the leader he so loves. The Government has been completely open about this matter from the start. Opposition members-Ha, hal",49
103,Mr HAWKE,SPECIAL MINISTER OF STATE,"We always get the hyena laugh, but it is very interesting that Opposition members have not learnt yet who laughs last in these matters. As is well known, the report of the Black Inquiry was published as soon as it was received and at an early opportunity all the supporting papers relevant to the Black Inquiry were tabled. Mr Speaker, I want to remind you and the House of what I said on 5 September in regard to the documents relating to the inquiry. I stated: . . . transcripts of the inquiry conferences, documents listed in appendices E and F of the inquiry and departmental papers concerning the making of the declaration and leading to the establishment of the inquiry . . . That is very specific. They were all tabled. It should come as no surprise-I know it would not to you, Mr SPEAKER - that there exists other departmental papers which could be described as relating to what the Deputy LeaderÂ· of the Opposition more broadly called the Young affair. For example, in various departments there are letters I wrote to the Governor General and Ministers about Mr Young's overseas trip and the administrative questions concerning the running of the Black inquiry. I am also informed that there are even papers in one department on the riveting issue of who should meet Mr Young on his return. When faced with the vaguely defined request submitted by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, my Department examined the various documents it had and made decisions in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act. As I said yesterday and as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is aware, he may appeal on that decision if he wishes. Always wanting to be of assistance to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, to help him to decide whether to make that appeal I mention to him that the document to which he was refused access primarily comprises a departmental analysis of the Moore-MACKellar colour television affair. The preparation of this analysis was requested by me to refresh my memory of the extent and nature of the conspiracy engaged in then by the two Ministers to cover up a clear breach of the law.",49
104,Mr SPEAKER,SPECIAL MINISTER OF STATE,I think it might be wise if the Prime Minister withdrew the word 'conspiracy'. It does engender an imputation.,49
105,Mr HAWKE,SPECIAL MINISTER OF STATE,"I am quite happy to withdraw it, of course, Mr Speaker. I am happy to provide the Deputy Leader of the Opposition with a copy of the document. I do not think he would be silly enough to want me to table it. NA NA NA  with a question to the Prime Minister. It relates to the matter just mentioned by the Prime Minister. Yesterday he.felt that the question impugned his integrity, and this does not. The answer raises a very important question of conventions in this country. In the matter referred to by the Prime Minister, I assume that the Prime Minister simply had a document produced by public servants. His reference to elements such as getting the details of a conspiracy by previous Ministers raises a question as to whether documents that relate to the previous Administration or any other previous administrations are not available to an incoming government. That is something that we scrupulously adhered to when in government ourselves. I would like to know-",49

I was pointing.out the contrast because, in fairness, the Prime Minister had said 'a document'-,----",49
108,Mr SPEAKER,ADMINISTRATIONS,"Order! Of course, the Leader of the Opposition was entitled to that preamble, but he should get to the question.  Prime Minister that material relating to matters pertaining to the previous Administration are not called for by him frequently or at all. . Mr HAWKE-I think the members of this House, at the end of proceedings last Tuesday, had come to the conclusion that it was literally impossible for the Leader of the Opposition in this House to do any worse than he had done on that day. But we find that here today our expectations in that regard have again been shattered. Added to the incompetence then displayed is apparently a total incapacity to understand the simplest of propositions. He seeks, in the simplest of matters, to raise questions of impropriety where no impropriety on any reasonable basis can be seen to exist. Mr Groom-You just made an allegation yourself.",50
109,Mr HAWKE,ADMINISTRATIONS,"The honourable member's . shouting will do him no good because the facts simply are that anyone who listened to what I have just said in this House will understand quite clearly what I said. There was no suggestion or implication that I or anyone else involved in this matter had sought to go into the documents of the previous Government. I suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that afterwards he get' the Hansard greens and calmly read what I said. He will see that there is not a vestige of a basis upon which he could have started to go down this track again. There is no suggestion in this instance that that was done. This Government at all times has adhered to the proprieties of government. We have done it at all points to the present and we will do it in the considerable number of years into the fQture that we remain in government. I suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that he will do himself and the people behind him a very great service if at last he can get himself . gutter mentality and understand that this Government, as distinct from himself and those behind him, acts at all times with propriety. AUSTRALIAN TOURISTÂ· COMMISSION NA",50
110,Mr KEOGH,ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN,"The Minister for Sport, Recreation and'Tourism will be aware no doubt of the importance of the tourist industry to my electorate which includes the Moreton Bay islands and the Redlands Shire. Is it a fact that the Australian Tourist Commission is currently involved in an intensive advertising campaign in the United States of America and that this campaign is aimed at attracting more Americans to holiday i.n Australia? Can the Minister inform the House of . the likely impact of this campaign on the Australian economy?",50
111,Mr SHIPTON,ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN,"Tell us why Club Med is not coming because of penalty rates, while you are at it.",50
112,Mr SPEAKER,ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN,Order! I suggest the honourable member take up the queries about Club Med with the Minister outside the chamber. The Minister already has a question to answer. I call the Minister.,50
113,Mr JOHN BROWN,ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN,"I can deal with the honourable member for Higgins if he can sit there and suffer the embarrassment. I think it is fair to say that since this Government has been in office the tourism industry has found its proper place in Australia's commercial atmosphere. It always was the biggest industry in Australia, but the previous Government did not have the wit to recognise it. In 20 months we have turned what is the biggest industry in Australia, albeit the most fragmented, into what is now a co-ordinated, impressive, cooperative and profitable industry, the biggest in Australian employing something like 400,000 people. I do not know whether the shadow Minister has yet recovered from the embarrassment he suffered a week or so ago when he attended the first annual tourism awards which were held in Sydney. He had to sit there and suffer the ignominy of the remarks of speaker after speaker. I refer in particular to someone very closely attached to the National Party in another State. He observed that, having spent a life in the tourism industry and having seen what has happened to it in the last 18 months to two years, he hoped that this Government stayed in power for the next 20 years. He well realised how the industry was ignored by the previous incumbents.",50
114,Mr HAWKE,ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN,Who said that?,50
115,Mr JOHN BROWN,ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN,I cannot say; I do not out of this want to embarrass the man .,50
116,Mr SINCLAIR,ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN,We have a different story in Queensland.,50
117,Mr JOHN BROWN,ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN,"I do not.know. Â·Every time. I go to Queensland I am almost embarrassed at the sorts of functions I have to attend at having members of other political parties' making the same statements. In the last Budget we introduced a faster depreciation rate to help the production of more hotels, motels-",50

119,Mr SPEAKER,ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN,Order! I warn the honourable member for Higgins. The honourable member for Casey will cease interjecting. Mr Steedman-I have not been interjecting.,51
120,Mr SPEAKER,ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN,I warn the honourable member for Casey. I call the Minister.,51
121,Mr JOHN BROWN,ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN,"The Treasurer has passed me a note reminding me of the fact that we increased the depreciation rate on tourist buildings from 2.5 per cent to.4 per cent in the recent Budget. The good news that I am giving the House now about the amount of development going on in Australia at the minute will be even greater when the change makes its full impact. At present there are $7,000m-worth of tourist developments going on in Australia-hotels, motels and resorts-which is an enormous turnaround in that very short period. These developments in fact account for 220,000 man years in the construction stage and 42,000 permanent jobs at the finish of the construction stage, which says something about how this industry is going. The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations was talking yesterday about increases in the labour force and the new jobs created in Australia. I am very proud to tell you, Mr Speaker, that the tourist industry has accounted for 40,000-odd new jobs in 18 months, which is far and away the best result of any industry in Australia. I defy anybody in this House to find any other industry that has this capacity. All it needed was a government like this to co-ordinate this industry. We now have the very happy spectacle of the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments of differing political colours and the industry all pulling together as they are in this advertising thrust now going on in the United States. I come to the specifics of the question of the honourable member for Bowman who has a very deep interest in and knowledge of the tourism industry, particularly as his electorate includes the very pleasant resort of Moreton Island. We now have Paul Hogan, the ambassador of culture, operating for us in the United States of America. I received a telex today from the United States telling me that in the one month period over which this campaign has been running on the East Coast the advertisement has produced a response of 100,000-odd calls on the toll line. One hundred thousand East Coast residents have rung up wanting the book on Australia. Of course, the cynics will say: 'So what'. I will tell them what the survey also shows. Information supplied to me by International Airlines in the United States is that more than half of those respondents will travel to Australia within the next five years. So we will have 50,000 new visitors coming to Australia.",51

125,Mr SPEAKER,ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN,Order! There is no point of order. That is quite right; you are under a warning from me. I suggest that the Minister should avoid provoking the honourable member.,51

131,Mr SPEAKER,ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN,Order! The honourable member will resume his seat.,51
132,Mr SPEAKER,ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN,I remind honourable members that their opportunity to take part in the proceedings of the House is when they get the call from the Chair. I suggest to the Minister that perhaps he round off his answer and cease provoking the honourable member.,51
133,Mr JOHN BROWN,ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN,"Out of a sense of mercy I will no longer refer to him. The 50,000 extra visitors that we will get out of this one-month advertising campaign will mean something like $50m extra revenue if they spend only $1,000 each, and of course they will spend more than that. To sum up, the advertising campaign we have run has been an absolutely spectacular success. Paul Hogan is now a superstar in America, as he should well be for a man of his sophistication, culture, personality and great Australian characteristics. He has now become a cult figure in the United States and we are very lucky that he has provided all of this service for us for nothing. We have been very lucky to have the services of this very great Australian. Now 40,000 kids in Australia have jobs that they might not have had had we not been able to get the services of Paul Hogan, for one thing, and had the Government not had the good wit to bolster a good industry. NA",51
134,Mr HOWARD,SPECIAL MINISTER OF STATE,"I ask a question of the Prime Minister which is supplementary to that asked by the honourable member for Calare. Does the Prime Minister recall saying on the Sundqy program of 28 July that the Government had referred new information on the Young affair to Mr Black, QC? Why has the Prime Minister consistently refused to reveal the new evidence that led to the establishment of the Black Inquiry into the Circumstances Surrounding the Making of a Customs Declaration? Did Mr Black consider this new evidence or was this material not examined because it was ruled to be outside the limited terms of reference imposed on the inquiry by the Prime Minister? Did the Government give Mr Black terms of reference that were so limited as to prevent him from examining the new information which the the Prime Minister said on 28 July was the very reason for the establishment of the Black Inquiry?",52
135,Mr HAWKE,SPECIAL MINISTER OF STATE,"I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for his question and for the w-y in which it was put. It was not appropriate for me to refer to the information. We did all that was appropriate-I think the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would agree-when we got that information. If I can recall the dates, the Minister made his statement on, I think, 20 July, which was a Friday. The Minister became aware of the new information, I think, on Tuesday 24 July. He conveyed it ,to me on the evening of 24 July. We immediately took steps then to check on what had been put and in the light of what we checked we then initiated the inquiry. I assure the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that all the issues that had come to our attention were referred to Mr Black. He had the opportunity of considering all those matters and the decision which he made and which was published was made on the basis of that information being available to him. TASMANIA: FUNDING",52
136,Mr CUNNINGHAM,SPECIAL MINISTER OF STATE,"I address my question also to the Prime Minister. Will decisions be taken in the near future on special employment creation projects in Tasmania following the agreement reached between the Commonwealth and Tasmania on compensation for the cessation of the Gordon below Franklin dam project? In particular, when will the Commonwealth respond to Tasmania's request for a further $3m for the upgrading of the Hobart Airport?",52
137,Mr HAWKE,SPECIAL MINISTER OF STATE,"When we settled the arrangements with Tasmania for dealing with the consequences of the cessation of the Gordon below Franklin scheme we decided that $3m out of the $15m that the Commonwealth would be providing for employment purposes should be spent on upgrading the Hobart Airport for wide bodied jets. That work is proceeding. The Tasmania Government then asked for a further $3m to be allocated from post-Gordon below Franklin funds for upgrading to allow fully laden B747-200 flights. After careful consideration of all the factors, including the attitude of the aviation industry and, more broadly, our responsibility to ensure that funds are spent in the best interests of Tasmanians, we have decided to agree to that request. I have advised the Premier accordingly today, which I hope will be welcomed by all Tasmanian members of this House. I have also informed the Premier that the Commonwealth is looking at other possible projects for the remaining $9m of the employment creation funds. I expect to be able to put to him our proposals for the expenditure of that additional $9m by the end of the coming week. As I understand it, the Premier of Tasmania is also developing his own proposals. I look forward to receiving his proposals as soon as possible. When those proposals have been received our two governments will be able to consult as a matter of priority so that decisions can be made as to the projects which will be of major benefit to the people of Tasmania. I conclude by saying that it is certainly the Commonwealth's strong wish to see the remaining funds committed to worthwhile projects and for work to commence as quickly as possible. I welcome the co-operation that we hav\? received to this point in what has been a difficult series ofdiscussions and I look' forward further to cooperating with the Government of Tasmania to get the most beneficial results for the people of Tasmania.

159,Mr HODGMAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Mr Speaker, during the debate to which the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Good luck) has just referred, the Minister  ing remarks alleged that the Tasmanian members who had spoken in the debate-that is me, the honourable member for Franklin and the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Burr)-had in some way impugned the impartiality of the Inter-State Commission, headed by His Honour Judge Everett, which is currently reviewing the Tasmanian freight equalisation scheme. I make it quite clear that no such imputation was ever made. Concern was expressed about what this Government, if it got another term in government, would do to the Tasmanian freight equalisation scheme. NA The following Bills were returned from the Senate without amehdment or requests: Bounty (Agricultural Tractors) Amendment Bill 1984. Bounty (Tractor Cabs) Amendment Bill 1984. Bounty (Computers) Bill 1984. Automatic Data Processing Equipment Bounty Amendment Bill (No.2) 1984. Bounty (Electric Motors) Bill 1984. NA Discussion of Matter of Public Importance",53
160,Mr SPEAKER,ASSETS TEST,"I have received a letter from  posing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Hawke Labor Government's inequitable assets test on pensioners which continues the Government's piecemeal attack upon the retirement security of Australians. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number o/members required by theÂ· Standing Orders having risen in their places position) (3.06)-There are several fundamental reasons why the great majority of Australians are opposed to the Hawke Government's assets test on pensioners, as indeed they are to Labor's 31 per cent slug on lump sum superannuation. The case against the assets test, and incidentally the lump sum superannuation rip-off, is overwhelming. This is why the Coalition has opposed the assets test and the lump sum super tax since Labor began its attack on the elderly well over a year ago. The Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia are committed to scrapping Labor's assets test and its 31 per cent tax on lump sum superannuation immediately after we return to government. The depth of public feeling against this Government's .attacks on the retired and the elderly was further revealed in a recent poll in the -1ge newspaper. In that poll 62 per cent of people surveyed said that Labor's second Budget did not do enough for pensioners. On the contrary, the Budget signalled the Government's determination to go ahead with its assets test. The Vice - President of the Retired Persons Association, R. W. Parry, said that this Budget was the worse ever for pensioners. After more than a year of twisting and turning, causing widespread confusion and anxiety, the Government finally revealed its shabby assets test. The current assets test has much in common with its predecessors. Labor's assets test is, firstly, intrusive; secondly, manifestly unfair and inequitable; and thirdly, complex and costly. Those major shortcomings are inherent in any assets test. They are the reasons why the previous Coalition Government scrapped the assets test in 1976. Let me look at the assets test under each of those headings, the first of which is intrusive. Regardless of the propaganda-that is largely what it ill-put out by the Government, ordinary Australians are not deceived. Ordinary people will not be fooled by the comments of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that the assets test means only that millionaires will no longer get the pension. That is nonsense. The truth is that at least 500,000 Australians are now in the process of receivi l1g unwelcome forms and letters about the as.ets test from the Department of Social Security and the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Some 99 per cent of these people ar- not rich by any standard. They are people whose only mistake was to work, save and plan ahead for a secure and moderately comfortable retirement. They are not living in mansions or attempting to fiddle the system. They have worked a lifetime and paidÂ· their taxes. The . Government will hear a lot about this matter throughout the election campaign. Australians will not forget that it was the Hawke Labor Government .which .penalised people for putting aside a nest egg. Thatgeneration which is faced with the assets test today has lived and worked in Australia with the notion that it was right to have a nest egg for their retirement. The Government has penalised them fot it. It has gone against the hopes and aspirations of ordinary Australians. Sir Colin Hines, the New South Wales President of the Returned Services'League, said recently: It is a national disgrace that 6ur membets areÂ· being penalised for having carefully accumulated assets for their future .. '... The GovernmentÂ· has employ-d an additional 1,500 public servants to process the assets test forms. Let us look at those supposedly harmless forms, as the Government ha<;l people be\ieve. The assets test form comes with a covering letter which contains more disinformation.1t says: The assets test only affects a small ntlIp.be(Of people. That is rubbish. It affects .everyone who gets a let-.. ter and a form. It affects their families. It. causes confusion and concern. The form poses f7qllestions. The Government wants to knpw everything about pensioners. It wants to. know whether they have life insurance and, if so, the. policy number and the amount. It wants to know. what they have int-e bank, their accoll,nt number and the Cl,ment balance. It wants to know what they have in a building society or a credit union, and whether they have any bonds or shares and, if so, specific details about them. It wants to know whether they own a car and, if so, the make, model and year; and the same for boats and caravans. In ,case the Government has overlooked anything, there is a catc--all question on 'Any other assets'. What right has a government, to insist on all this information from people who have worked hard and have put something aside and are now being told that they have to reveal everything about themselves to a government? No Liberal Party or National Party government would involve itself with that sort of stuff. The Government wants to know whether people or their spouses have disposed of any assets since June 1984. Farm families come in for special detailed scrutiny. The Government wants to know all about the farm, the livestock, machinery and values. Having looked at what Labor wants to know about what are rightly the confidential details of people's lives, can anyone now, can this Government, still cling to the nonsense that the assets test is, not intrusive? Of course they cannot. The truth is that Labor's assets test strips bare the pensioners'\ives. Although the Government does not like to admit it, there will be penalties for those who do not divulge all information required or who fail to co-operate. For farm families and for those who own large bush blocks, the Government has made available the valuers of the Australian Taxation Office value the family farm or the hobby farm. Country people will not welcome these visits. It must not be overlooked that the intrusion is an ongoing process. Assets information will have to be updated regularly. The bottom line on the assets forms was spoken two days ago by a panel of ac-, countants brought in by the Adelaide Advertiser to examin- the form. The accountants said that the assets test form is""daunting in size', 'a horrible thing to hit them with', and 'worse than a tax return'. So much for Labor's empty claims about there being no intrusion. , "" Next, I refer to the unfairness and the inequity. This assets test is especially unfair to a number groups of the elderly. I give some examples. First, the assets test is highly unfair to people who take their superannuatioripaY-Olit as a lump sum, people such' as the thousands of servicemen and women who retire from the defence forces in their forties and fifties. These Australians are now victitnsof Labor's triple dipping tax grab. They pay taxon tllernoney that they earn in the defence forces' or in other occupations; they then have to pay this Labor Government the 31 per cent tax on lump sum superannuation pay-outs; and what is left is subject to Labor's assets test. That is straight triple dipping. It is no wonder that the Returned Services League National Congress last month in Melbourne passed a resolution rejecting the assets test. Secondly, farming organisations and the Opposition have pointed out the unfairness of the assets test to the 170,000 farm families who live on small but highly efficient family farms. Exempting the farmhouse from the assets test but not the productive land puts the future of family farms at risk. The land cannot be gifted to sons and daughters, and the so-called pay-as-you-die scheme, the grisly scheme that the Government has introduced, is an insult to those who have made considerable sacrifices to build up' a farm over two or the- generations. Thirdly, the severe gifting restrictions are highly inequitable and are outright cold-blooded. The limits are $2,000 a year for single pensioners and $4,000 for couples. These restrictions mean that,Jor example, a pensioner who becomes frail and wants to give his or her car to a daughter can- ' not do that without risking loss of part of the pension. It is an absolute disgrace which highlights the inherent injustice of assets testing. Finally, I come to the cost and the complexity. This is the area in which the Government has revealed its inten-ions for pensioners and the assets test after the coming election should it be to returned. Since the Government began its to-ing and fro-ing about the assets test over a year ago, a string of figures has been bandied about by the Prime Minister, by the Minister at the table, the Minister for Health (Dr Blewett), and by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Grimes) and other Government spokesmen about the supposed savings of the assets test. There has been one element of consistency about these figures. Each new claim has been less than the previous one. The figure has gone from $31 Om to $1 OOm, to $70m, and to the $45m in the Prime Minister's statement of June. But even that figure is so uncertain that the Minister for Health now of refuses to verify it. Regardless of the everdwindling savings estimates of the assets test, what we know is that social security fraud is costing taxpayers $31Om a year. But this Government is not interested in stopping cheats and bludgers. It is determined to squeeze people who have' the worked hard towards a secure retirement. What we know 'is that the start-up costs of the assets ' test, the 1,500-plus 'extra public servants, the equipment, the forms and the letters, all of this red tape, will not save one penny during the first year of the assets test. Mr Donald Cameron-Disgraceful!  because on the contrary, not only is there no saving i- the first year of the assets test, b-! imposing the test will cost taxpayers - n add.ltton-l $30m-plus in this year. The complexity of It alliS enormous. This Government has made the squeezing of pensioners a major industry. The Government's inability to tell the public what the assets test will save and the fact that the estimated savings figure has always moved downwards are clear warnings to all Australians. The Hawke Government is not concerned about what the assets test will net it in the short term. It ought to come clean on this matter now before an election. It is what will happen after the election to make the assets test bite harder which is uppermost in the minds of Australia's elderly. The Government has got the assets test on the books with only the Liberal Party and the National Party opposing it, because Labor was joined by the Australian Democrats in voting for the assets test legislation. There would be no assets test legislation in place had the Democrats stood with us and rejected this measure. When 1 hear Democrats spokesmen talk about justice for the elderly, I shall remind them, day after day, that apart from Mr Hawke and the Labour Party, who introduced the assets test, the Democrats must also share the blame because they could have killed it by voting with us in the Senate, but they chose not to do so. Now that the Government has the assets test legislation on the books, it will be easier for the Government in the unlikely event of its return, to tighten the s-rews by toughening the regulations and restrictions of the test. People will be aware of what this Government has in store for pensioners should Labor be returned. Australians have a clear choice on this issue at the coming election. The Liberal and National parties will scrap Labor's unfair assets test and, indeed, will scrap the 31 per cent tax on lump sum superannuation as one of our first acts after this early election. We will give the elderly a fair deal and end the piecemeal attacks which are one of the most deplorable features of the Hawke Government. 1 said earlier, and it is a point worth noting, that the Government, in its ruthless drive to introduce this assets test, overlooked this element. I have talked about cost, about unfairness, about. inequity, and about intrusiveness. There is one other element to be borne in mind. There are those, particularly the aged pensioners-this assets test applies to the overwhelming majority of pensioners-whoÂ· are of a generation who were brought up not only to work and strive for a nest egg but also to save for a rainy day. On ma-y occasions during their lives it was probably raming like hell, but they chose to - rit th.eir teeth and go on in the belief that on their retIrement they would have access to funds they had generated during their working lives. They have no right to suffer a penalty by the present Government turning that notion on its head in an outright attack-Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Child)Order! The Leader of the Opposition's time has expired. .",54
161,Dr BLEWETT,ASSETS TEST,"1 suppose at least o,!- should congratulate the Leader of the OppositIOn (Mr Peacock) on returning to some real issues in politics after his futile and contemptible effort to link the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) with crime. Having fallen flat on his face in that issue, havingÂ· failed completely either to put up or shut up, the Leader of the Opposition now turns to some real issues:""""for that he should be congratulated-and not the fantasies on which he has concentrated in the past fortnight. That is about the onl- mark of congratulation one can note because his speech itself further undermines the limited credibility of the Leader of the Opposition. Let me say, and 1 say it quite honestly, that there was a period in Which 1 believe the Leader of, the Opposition was held in .this society and in this Parliament as a man of considerable integrity. He was prepared to say tough things and t? advocate. tough decisions in the interests of thiS country. But all that has ceased .as he has become an increasingly desperate politician faced with electoral defeat. It is a test not of our credibility but of the credibility of the Opposition. 1 go to a statement that will be repeated in this election day after day. On 9 SeptelTIber 1981, when the Leader of the Opposition was in the governing parties, he made this honest c;:omment: . In future, I would prefer to see a budge- framed on - he basis of its being as economically and SOCially productive as possible . . .By 'sociall- pro-uctive' I mean a budget which caters for carefully Identified areas of genuine human need and avoids a situation in which those who do not need Government assistance are given help at the . expense of those who do: He went on to say: The Government-he was talking about his own Government-needs to re-assess its approach to spending, concentrating on areas of genuine need, cutting out expenditure to those who do not need assistance. That is the very principle underlying this Government's assets test. There are two things that have been forgotten by the Leader of the Opposition since he was in government. One is that he has always supported a needs based welfare system. In government he was always an advocate of that system. The question he must answer to the Australian people is: If an old person's nest egg is in income and not in assets, why is that person's income subjected to the various tests and the pension reduced? We all accept that; the previous Government accepted and practised it. Why, however, if the nest egg is in the form of assets, should it not be subjected also to tests so that the old person with the nest egg in income is treated in exactly the same way as the person who has the nest egg in assets? If we are to have a needs based welfare system-not one Opposition member has been prepared to say that we do not need a needs based welfare system in this country, given the demands on the public purse-the Opposition will have to explain the inequity as to why a nest egg in assets should not be treated in the same way as a nest egg in income. That is the first question Opposition members have to answer. The second point the Leader of the Opposition has forgotten is that it is easy to make critical comments about the short term effects of this policy, but this is a gov<;rnment which, in its first 18 months, has clearly indicated to the Australian people that it is prepared to make decisions in the long term interests of the country. All the decisions, on superannuation, Medicare, the assets test, which are so easy to attack in the short run, are made in the long term interests of this country. As we have pointed out time and again, the growth of the aged population itself will simply mean that the returns from this decision will grow to whichever party is, in government in future years. Instead of recognising the position he held in Opposition, the present Leader of the Opposition has simply abandoned all those arguments and has surrounded himself with the bully boys of the National Party and the lunatic fringe of his own party. For example, he has the fanatic from Denison-I suppose he, could be referred to as the gold tooth fanati--and his absurd remarks about old ladies and their rings. That is the kind of nonsense that has become the subject of debate by the Opposition. Fortunately, there are still honest and genuine people on the conservative side of politics. I would be the last to say that any individual or political party has a total monopoly on wisdom, but it is a disgrace to the institution of parliament, to good government and to the people of Australia that no honest, effective alternative voice is being put forward by most members of the Liberal and National parties. I believe that will be one of the main reasons why, come the election, the electorate will judge them so harshly. Let us look at a few of the conservative figures in politics who have been prepared to face up to the real question of the assets test. Let me take first the National President of the Young Liberal movement. As the Liberal Party is busily disowning the future, I suppose it will probably disown him. I quote an article about him on 18 June this year: . . . it was unfortunate that the parliamentary party was opposing the assets test for pensions. He said the Young Liberal movement would strongly oppose any moves by the Opposition to adopt a universal age pension policy because it would require an increase in taxes and because it would give the same benefit to the rich as to the weak and needy. It went on to say: The debate over assets tests and income tests is a further example of the influence that can be wielded by the welleducated and the wealthy in this society. Let me also turn to the past of the Liberal Partythe real past-and take the former Liberal Prime Minister, Sir William MCMahon, speaking on 3LO in June this year. He said that the Government's assets test was right in principle. So both the youth of the Liberal Party, the Young Liberal's President, and the aged in the Liberal Party argue that the assets test was right in principle. One can even cite in this context contemporary members of the Opposition, such as the current member for Wide Bay (Mr Millar). I quote his words as published in the Gympie Times of a month ago. He was responding to queries from Gympie pensioners in the light of comments by the Leader of the Opposition who had said notoriously, as we alI know, that under the Government's assets test legislation inspectors would have the right of entry into pensioners' homes. I congratulate the honest member for Wide Bay and quote what he said in that newspaper. Referring to the Government's position, he said: The official position is that there would be no intrusion into people's homes but the reality would be-if there were grounds to suspect a false declaration had been made-that there could and would be. If there is a law and someone suspects it is being broken then it would be quite logical to expect that there would be some follow-up. The follow-up is supposed to be by mail or telephone but if this proved unsatisfactory then one would' imagine that more direct approaches would be used. That seems to me to be a legitimate debating point.",56
162,Mr SPENDER,ASSETS TEST,Do you agree with it?,57
163,Dr BLEWETT,ASSETS TEST,"I will come to that in a moment. It is not the kind of tactic used by both the front and back benches in this House, whose occupants have simply tried to scare aged pensioners rather than argue the issue in detail. The article in the Gympie Times then went on: However, Mr Millar said he dissociated himself from the comments by MrPeacock.  cock. He continued: But I do accept that there is no way to meet the social welfare bill without trimming expenditure somewhere. Therefore, on the premise that there is not enough to go around, those not in the most urgent need must miss out. This year the Government has increased its social welfare budget by 9.8 per cent on last year's and will outlay 18,047 million dollars. This expenditure is 28.2 per cent of the Government's planned spending this financial year. These are comments by an Opposition member. He continues: I'm certainly not saying that the assets legislation but the reality is that if spending has to be cut somewhere then it cannot be at the lower end of the scale to allow people to die in the street. . These views have been put forward by a Young Liberal, an old Liberal and an honest member of the National Party. At least those three men were able to put forward an honestly held opinion. However, the Opposition parties and its leadership do not have any sort of taxation policy. They have no sort of health policy and no coherent economic policy. They have increasingly resorted to smears and scares. What a joke and fraud the Opposition has become. It has not succeeded in these kinds of tactics in respect of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, racism or the assets test. That is simply demonstrated by the editorial from the Australian Pensioner of II September 1984. I am not saying that that organisation agrees with our policies but at least it is prepared to say quite frankly what it thinks about the Opposition and its tactics and policies. The editorial stated: Opposition politicians, certain sectors of the media, and certain so-called pensioners' representatives have resorted to just about everything in their campaign against .the assets test-even to the point of suggesting that a type of social security Gestapo will be created to body-search pensioners and ransack their homes to make sure they are not hiding any valuable assets. That particular scare tactic has been heard on the floor of this Parliament. The editorial continue.li: The Australian social security system has never operated this way and there is no reason to believe that it will start to do so now. So how do those opposed to the proposed test justify their hysterical outpourings? They do it, tIiey say, in the name of pensioners' rights. Well, pensioners do have rights, and the first right is the right to be told the truth; the right to be informed, not misinformed. If those opposed to the assets test have a legitimate case to put, then let them put it honestly and openly. Don't play on the ignorance, fear, and insecurity of this most vulnerable group. No Opposition which sets out to win a point by creating such anxiety in a community can ever be regarded as worthy of governing that community. I think that is a pretty fair response to the behaviour and the tactics of this Opposition. I have quoted the Leader of the Opposition. I quoted his position when he was a back bencher of the previous Government, when he was prepared to look honestly at the issues of a needs based welfare system and the real challenges we have in this area over the next 30 years. I have quoted honest men from the conservative side of politics-Young. Liberals, the ex-Prime Minister and the honourable member for Wide Bay. I have looked at serious and responsible publications and their editorials to show what a total fraud, hypocrisy and humbug this whole Opposition attack is. The is just, Leader of the Opposition asked: What about the response of ordinary Australians? I will leave the final word to an ordinary member of the public, a Mrs Ellis from North Melbourne, who wrote to the Minister for Social Security in the following terms: I have read all the information about the assets test and listened to the debate in parliament. I have come to the conclusion that the introduction of an assets test is a just and sensible measure. Politicians opposing the test keep saying that people's savings are to be attacked by the test, but I have always understood that the lucky ones who were able to, saved during their lives to protect themselves in their old age, not so they could put away all their savings and leave them to their children, and then .live themselves on the rest of the community in their old age. Low income earning pensioners or pensioners without any income should also support the assets test and stop having the wool pulled over their eyes by the wealthy and greedy in the commul).ity who want to have their .cake and eat it too. The funds available to the Minister for Social Welfare are limited and therefore the fewer pensions he has to pay, the more money there will be available to 'pay to those pensioners who are on the base rate, without their own homes, and are therefore in greater need. It is certainly not their fault they are in this position, many of them went through the depression or the dislocation of the last war so were unable to put aside !issets that would cre-, ate an income large enough to live on in their old age. To get the amount of even the base pension'would have been very difficult for people who earned about sixteen dollars a week as an adult wage for most of their lives and had no hope of owning their own house. I think that will be the kind of response from ordinary, honest Australians when they look at this issue. The people of Australia have great faith in the Hawke Government. We are determined to, repay that trust. Their distrust of the Opposition Leader and the Opposition parties on this and every other issue will be amply displayed at the next election. I",58
164,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ASSETS TEST,"Mr Mountford)The discussion is concluded. NA NA Mr LEO MeLEAY (Grayndler)-On behalf of the Standing Committee on Expenditure, I present an information paper of the Committee inquiry entitled: 'Invalidity Provisions of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme', together with the minutes of proceedings, and seek leave to make a short statement in connection with the paper. Leave granted. Mr LEO Me LEA Y - The subject of superannuation, together with its extent, format and cost of its coverage, has drawn wide attention in recent times. Much of this attention has focused on public sector superannuation schemes, some in New South Wales and some within the Commonwealth service. Revi-ws relating to various aspects of public sector schemes have recently been conducted in several States. At the Commonwealth level there has been an examinat.ion of the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust. Given the degree of interest shown in the Commonwealth superannuation scheme and its charter to review areas of government spending, the Expenditure Committee decided that an inc formation paper focussing on the extent and cost to the taxpayer of invalidity retirement through the Commonwealth superannuation scheme should be prepared. The paper outlines the invalidity provisions of the scheme and summarises the available information on the level and cost of invalidity retirement and the factors underlying trends in their magnitude in recent years. The cost or extent of invalidity retirement is not insignificant. As at 30 June 1983-the date at which the latest figures are available-the total annual pension liability of the scheme with respect to invalidity pensions in force was $268.8m, representing 46.4 per cent of the scheme's total annual pension liability. In 1982-83, about 39.1 per cent of all exits, excluding resignation from the scheme, resulted from invalidity retirement compared with 36.2 per cent due to age retirement, with early retirement and death accounting for the remainder. Moreover, although there has been a sharp decline in invalidity retirements from 1979 on, the acceleration of invalidity retirements in the immediate period following the introduction of the scheme in 1976 has altered the composition of the pensioner populations and the annual pension liability of the scheme to the extent that, even if a downturn in invalidity retirements were to be experienced, it would take some years before the proportion of invalidity pensioners in the pensioner population would be reduced. The Committee believes that the pilper raises sufficient issues to warrant further inquiry. Those issues will oe taken up by the Committee at the end of its current work schedule. In conclusion I would like to record my appreciation of the work of David Worthy and Helen Fleming of the Committee secretariat in the production of this paper. NA NA Mr LEO MeLEAY (Grayndler)-On behalf of the Standing Committee on Expenditure, I present the interim report of the Committee on the Aboriginal Development Commission, together with the minutes of the proceedings, the transcript of evidence and submissions authorised for publication. Ordered that the report be printed. Mr LEO MeLEA Y-by leave-This interim reportÂ· on the Aboriginal Development Commission reflects the findings of the Standing Committee on Expenditure to date. It is expected that this report will be followed by two further reports-firstly, a detailed report which explores further the issues raised in this interim report and other matters within the term of reference and, secondly, a confidential report to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Holding) which will take up a number of matters that have been drawn to the Committee's attention but which are beyond the Committee'sÂ· terms of reference or its expertise. The Committee has taken the step .of preparing this interim report to put on record the Committee's belief that the Aboriginal Development Commission has an important role to play in the promotion of Aboriginal development and selfmanagement. The Committee )Vas prompted to make this early report by its belief that in some quarters its inquiry was being interpreted as a mechanism for bringing about the demise of the ADC. While supporting the concept of the Aboriginal Developmeht CommissioÂ·n, the Committee has found in the .course of its investigation that the ADC has had some significant weaknesses during its brief history. Some of the weaknesses described by the Committee stem from the normal establishment difficulties ora new organisation. Others are more serious and need to be corrected if the Aboriginal Development Commission is to fulfil its potential to promote AborigiI).al selfdevelopment and self-management. A significant conclusion reached in: the preparation of this interim report was the importance of the word 'development' in the Commission's title and the need for the Aboriginal Development Commission to address the issue of development with greater vigour, planning and administrative control. The Committee is pleased to note that in the. course of its inquiry a new chairman and administrator have been appointed to the Commission and that this new top level management team recognises the weaknesses in the organisation found by the Committee during the inquiry and has begun to implement necessary changes to the administration and conduct of the ADC. I thank the members of the Committee. In ticular I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker MountÂ· ford, who as a member of the Committee gave a lot of your time and effort to attend hearings and inspection tours throughout Australia. l'heComhopes mittee believed that it was important for us to out and talk to Aboriginal people as well as to bureaucrats to find out the people's thoughts what the Aboriginal Development Commission should do. I think that the effort the Committee put into talking to widely disparate groups around Australia was one way of ensuring that got the best sounding for the recommendations that we have made. I am pleased to see that the Minister is in the chillliber this afternoon as he has taken an interest in the Committee's work. In conclusion I put on record my appreciation of the efforts of the Committee secretariat in the preparation of this re-. port. The Committee secretariat worked long hours and was somewhat harassed by me and other members of the Committee to ensure that we got the report out on time. In particular I praise the work of Bruce Boell, on secondment to the Committee from the executive development scheme, the Committee secretary Sue Harlow, mittee Chris Paterson and Betty Williams for the work they did in the preparation of this report on Aboriginal Development Commission.",59
165,Mr HOLDING,EXPENDITURE,"by leave-1 congratulate the Standing Committee.ori Expenditure on providing the House with this interim r-port on the Aboriginal Development Commissiot;l. 1'Ieedless to say, the Government will study its findings recommendations closely. As is customary with all parliamentary committee reports, the Government ment's response will be provided in this place soon as pOSSible. I note that the report is terim one and I am grateful that the Committee has provided advice of this kind to the Parliament without delaying for a final report which, I understand, will take some time to complete. For some time now we have seen in the Press a campaign of denigration of Aboriginal people and a belittling of their efforts, after such long oppression, to achieve self-reliance and selfmanagement. It is a matter of regret for me as Minister that so much publicity is given to the difficulties that Aboriginal people face and so little credit is paid to the many significant achievements that have been made in recent years. Members of this Committee have had an opportunity to come to that conclusion for themselves. The Aboriginal Development Commission was established by this Parliament during the life of parthe former Government. We have been happy to continue to support the work of the Commission because the statute under which it was established gives significant expression to the aspirations and of Aboriginal people to manage their own go affairs. It is they who have told us so many times the that they want to be free of government paternalon ism and government direction. The Aboriginal Development Commission is the body which has the seeds of hope within it for the achievement of these goals. Not unnaturally, as with any new it agency established by government, there have been teething troubles and administrative difficulties. I trust that the Committee's interim report and, when available, the final one, will assist the Commission and the Government to consider ways in which the delivery of services to Aboriginal people can be improved. I can inform the House that the present Chairman of the Aboriginal Development Commission has told me of her readiness to follow up the various suggestions and proposals contained in the report so far as it lies within her capacity to do so. I appreciate the opportunity of addressing the House on this matter today. I commend the Comfor its work and I look forward to studying its recommendations closely in the near future. I the know that all honourable members wish to see the delivery of services to Aboriginal people achieved in the most efficient and effective way. I shall certainly do what I can to ensure that the recommendations in this report are given consideration with these objectives in mind.",60
166,Mr TUCKEY,EXPENDITURE,"by leave-I comapd mence my remarks on the Standing Committee on Expenditure report on the Aboriginal DevelopCommission by giving my congratulations in as a general sense to the Chairman of the Expendian inture Committee, the honourable member for Grayndler, Mr Leo MCLeay. Ifl have a criticism of him it is his enthusiasm and the number of references he is prepared to take on at anyone time. I admit to being one of the less energetic members of the Committee because I could not manage, with my other responsibilities, to keep up with all of them. The honourable member for Grayndler has shown a great enthusiasm for this particular inquiry. I congratlliate him from the heart. I took quite an interest in this inquiry because in the time of the previous Government I was a member of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. Also, I lived for 25 years in a community in which over one-third of the people were of Aboriginal descent. Contrary to some of the views held in this place, I have a great interest in what I consider to be practical solutions to the problems that exist for Aboriginal people. I use those words advisedly. Of course, it is also a fact that I disagree with many honourable members on both sides of the House as to how those solutions should be achieved. In regard to the Committee report, the first recommendation is to the effect that the role of the Aboriginal Development Commission should be maintained and strengthened. I am a signatory to that recommendation. I think that was probably the question that was in the minds of many people prior to the commencement of this inquiry. Nevertheless, I still believe the Aboriginal Development Commission is under threat. As in many other operations, the institution gets mixed up with the operatives. I am sur- that the theory of the institution and the legislation under which it was formed are very good in the opinion of most people. However, if at any time people do notoperate such an institution properly that institutio'n will come under criticism and could be lost. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Holding) made reference to public opinion in this regard. It is quite pointless hiding our heads in the sand when the difficulties are identified. If we do not react to them in the normal way it will be the institution that carries the odium. In this regard I was greatly concerned some time ago at the rumours of appointment of the then Chairman of the ADC, Mr Charles Perkins, to his present role as Secretary to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. Consequently, on about 16 March I telexed the Minister. That telex read in part: I wish to state that I consider this appointment-I was referring to the rumoured appointment of  is inapptopriate at this time in light of the pending inquiry by that Committee into the Aboriginal Development Commission. As Chairman of this Commission it is im during the inquiry so that the inquiry is not thwarted by  must provide and for which he must resume responsibility. At no time during my attendance at ,the inquiry  tory. He has constantly attempted to misinform the Committee. He has demonstrated the most remarkable lack of memory I have encountered in any person of his seniority. It is a great shame that he has caused this Committee in its summary of recommendations to state: The Committee will, in due course, prepare a more detailed report on the efficiency and effectiveness of the ADC, as well as a, confidential report which will be made available to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. This confidential report will deal with information and allegations of a serious nature which have come to the Committee's attention during the inquiry but which are generally peripheral to its terms of reference. Paragraph 1.1 0 states: A number of other matters brought to the attention of the Committee have involved serious allegations of maladministration which in some instances may lead to criminal prosecution.  way that may have saved us making that recommendation. It is quite disgraceful. My concerns, as expressed to the Minister, have materialised. I am highly critical of the man and of what I believe to be his effect on the reputation of that institution. I will not go further than that, but I urge the Minister not to wait for the final report. It is my understanding that the staff of the Committee, busy as they are, will not be able to finish it in the life of this Parliament. The Minister has an obligation to acquaint himself with the information and take some steps in the interests of the ADC and its present management, which I agree, on the evidence presented to date at least, is attemptillg to overcome many of the problems that have been visited on it and for which I blame the past Chairman. I dissented from recommendation 14, and I hope that it is some evidence of my support for the people running the Commission now. The recommendation in clause 14 is that the majority of persons employed by the Commission should be employed under the Commonwealth Public Service Act, with provision for employing a smaller number, say 20 to 30 per cent, outside the provisions of the Act. That recommendation is there in part because of the concern of other members about the administration of the old ADC and their belief that perhaps the constraints of the Public' Service employment regime may have stopped some of those things occurring, if they did occur. I stress that they were allegations. I do not believe that will be the case. I believe it totally rogates the real thrust of the ADC Act, which was to give some power and re'sponsibility to Aboriginal people. In so doing, a responsibility was placed upon the Minister and his advisers-that group of people already employed under the Public Service Act in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. It is totally unnecessary to introduce the Public Service Board. Further, I believe it would be totally unworkable to have 70 per cent of that group in that 'position. Another criticism was that the promotion system could be haywire under the present arrangements, and I believe that would be so. The office boy could become director overnight if the Aboriginal commissioners so decided. It is fairly unlikely that they would, but if the office boy is one of the 20 per cent not subject to Public Service Board conditions, I presume that he can still be promoted to director overnight if the commissioners so decide. The sorts of problems that Public Service Board employment arrangements would raise would not be overcome. I think it would be much better if the Minister and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs took steps to ensure that the commissioners and others are competent, are doing their jobs, and are employing the right people. I am of the opinion that Public Service Board employment background is not suitable for the vision I have for the ADC. If I can make the comparison, the ADC to my mind has a merchant banking role for Aboriginal people. The type of expertise that is required does not necessarily reside in the Public Service to the extent that it does in the private sector. Another thought I have is that as the ADC arranges its affairs and does business ,with other financial institutions, it could by using polite ence, create work opportunities for young Aboriginal people outside the ADC. I do not want to take any more of the time of the House today. I am pleased with the recommendations, with the exception of the one I have mentioned. Responsibility for past actions of the ADC rests with numerous Ministers and two governments. It is up to this Government, because of its present responsibility, to deal with it promptly and satisfy the Australian people that the institution can give the service it is intended to give.  pre-empting the subsequent and final reports of, the Standing Committee on Expenditure, I should like to make a few comments following the brief look I have had at the recommendations of the report which was tabled today. The Aboriginal Development Commission was established by the previous Government. However, our initiative in abits implementatiC'n does not blind us to recognising weaknesses and even disappointments in the operation of the ADC concept as a working instrument for Aboriginal advancement and self-management. The report identifies a number of specific matters that warrant the serious and immediate attention of both the Commission and the Government. I trust that the Minister will give the report his urgent attention. Administrative efficiency has not been one of the strong points of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Holding) and I therefore urge that he promptly attend to the deficiencies highlighted by these reports-the one that has been tabled and the confidential report. I am sorry that the Minister is not in the House for this debate. It is also important that this House, the Aboriginal people and the wider community are kept informed of the progress of the consideration of the recommendations in this report. I draw attention to a number of major points raised by the report, firstly in relation to fragmentation. On page 4 the report warns of the adverse effect of undue fragmentation of the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio. It states: Further fragmentation of responsibilities within the portfolio should not occur. Any new organisation experiences teething problems and requires a settling-in-period to function efficiently. Continuing changes of responsibilities and creation of new organisations militates against achieving efficient program delivery. This is a matter to which the Minister should pay particular attention because I believe fragmentation will only exacerbate the high delivery cost of programs in the Aboriginal area. This conclusion of the Committee needs to be considered by the Minister as I:te continues to ponder the influexact nature of the proposed Aboriginal housing authority. In fact, I note with interest recommendation 16 of the Committee's report which states: The Grants-in-Aid Housing program should remain the responsibility of the Commission. I believe that the fragmentatitm of the delivery of funds under the various Aboriginal advancement programs is not only an inefficient and wasteful expenditure of taxpayers funds but also isconfusing for the Aboriginal people. For example, I am informed that there are five agencies providing Aboriginal housing assistance in MountIsa. Similarly, the enclave programs in a number of tertiary education institutions are funded from five different departments. I see that the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Willis) is in the chamber. His Department provides some of the funds for those enclave programs. The opportunity to improve the Â·efficiency of administration in this area is enormous. It is a facet of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs' administration of his portfolio which has not been properly addressed. In addition to recommending that the Commission should, as a matter of high priority, establish a corporate plan for its objective, this report addresses the very real need for improvements in the Commission's monitoring and evaluation of programs. I welcome this report as providing both the Commission and. the Government with the opportunity to address the need for changes and improvements to the management and direction of the ADC, and indeed in the portfolio in general, in order that the positive principles of Aboriginal development and self-management envisaged by the previous Government can be realised. I thank the House.",60
167,Mr BALDWIN,EXPENDITURE,"by leave-Initially the inquiry conducted by the Standing Committee on Expenditure attracted a great deal of unfavourable publicity. There was a lot of speculation surrounding one of the terms of reference of the inquiry which seemed to suggest that what was being looked at was the very principle of an autonomous Aboriginal organisation involved in the disbursement of funds for housing, land acquisitions and enterprise programs. I am pleased to say that, very early in the proceedings of the inquiry, that position was clarified by the issuing of a statement which made it perfectly clear that the Committee accepted. the desirability of an autonomous Aboriginal body continuing to exist and having overriding responsibility in this area. I think it is also true to say that there was a lot of speculation in the first instance that the purpose of the inquiry was to nail certain individuals or to investigate certain allegations of corruption. Some of the statements that have been made, I think by the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) today, seemed to give substance to the claim that some people involved in the inquiry had that objective but it certainly was not the view of the Committee as a whole or the bulk of its, members. I believe that the ultimate outcome of the inquiry was very constructive. I think that fact is acknowledged by both past and present officers of the Aboriginal Development Commission .. I could talk about a range of matters concerning the recommendations that have been made but will refer to only a few of them. Section 33 (1) of the Aboriginal Development Commission Act was considered by the Committee in some detail. On the face of it, it appears to give the ADC the capacity to employ such people as are required to fulfill its objectives. In other words, it seems to override any possible staff ceilings that might be imposed or preclude the possibility of such staff ceilings. One of our recommendations is that clarification be sought from the Government of the degree to which the ADC is subject to regulation of its staffing levels by the Government. The staff ceiling notion is no longer applicable but the broad question of the regulation of staff levels is. Another facet to which we gave some attention was the whole issue of the integration of the training role into the enterprise program. It certainly seems to be the case that those enterprises that have failed-a considerable number of them have failed-have done so as a consequence ofinadequacy in terms of training. By that I mean inadequate skills on the part of those who had the responsibility of carrying out or administering ana running those programs. We recommended that consideration be given to building in a very explicit training role in regard to every enterprise program under consideration. In regard to the housing program, there was some complaint that people with incomes substantially in excess of average weekly earnings were gaining housing loans witli concessional interest rates. We have made a recommendation that the interest rates charge be linked to bank interest rates and also that the availability of concessional interest rates be made subject to some form of means testing. That again will certainly diffuse a lot of the criticism about the way in which these loans are being dispersed. I refer also to the proposal that the bulk of the Abc's employees he brought under the ambit of the Public Service Act. That recommendation was dissented from by the honourable member for O'Connor. I do not believe that he has begun to adduce any coherent reasons for resisting that recommendation. The fact is that he claims it would serve to vitiate the autonomy of the ADC. That is an interesting sort of complaint coming from good old iron bar Tuckey. But the fact 'is that ADC officers themselves confirmed the obvious view that the autonomy of the ADC is primarily embodied in the power of the commissioners to make broad policy decisions about how funds are to be dispersed. The fact that most of the staff of the ADC would be brought under the ambit of the Public Service Act does not in any significant way reduce the autonoiny of that body in the areas that generally matter. Wilson Tuckey also referred-",63
168,Mr SPEAKER,EXPENDITURE,Order! The honourable member for Sydney knows the proper way of referring to another member of the House. I assume that he is referring to the honourable member for O'Connor.,63
169,Mr BALDWIN,EXPENDITURE,"Yes, Mr Speaker, that is correct. The honourable member for O'Connor also made reference to a merchant bank analogy as far as the ADC is concerned. In some ways I guess that such an analogy exists but there are also obviously very significant points of difference between what the ADC, in its enterprise program, is seeking t.o do and the way in which a merchant bank would operate. There are very major and obvious differences. The ADC is seeking to achieve a range of social rather than commercial objectives. It is obvious that the ADC is not in the business of solely extracting the maximum rate of return from enterprise projects it might fund. It is actually seeking to achieve a range of social objectives. In any case, if it is believed that it is desirable to bring in outside expertise, people from outside the Public Service who might have some business acumen considered desirable to the ADC's enterprise program, the recommendation that has been made clearly makes room for that. It states that 20 per cent to 30 per cent of the employees of the ADC wouldÂ· be outside the Public Service Act. That is just an indicative figure. It could be higher if it was deemed to be desirable. The object of that recommendation is to make available to the ADC a greater range of expertise from within the Public Service than it currently has access to. The problem that we have had is that people who transfer from the Public Service to the ADC and subsequently gain promotion within the ADC cannot be transferred back into the mainstream Public Service with those promotions. Clearly, that acts as a significant disincentive to people wanting to do that. It clearly restricts the ability of the ADC to gain access to such expertise as exists in the Public Service. I do not believe that any significant weight can be attached to the objections of the honourable member for O'Connor. I notice in his minority report that he refers to the risk that the capacity to employ people outside the Public Service Act . would 'create the possibility of making selective appointments from outside the Public Service'. Surely to goodness, if that is a legitimate complaint, placing the whole of the staff of the ADC outside the Public Service Act would merely serve to exacerbate that problem, if indeed it is one. I conclude on that note. I again join with earlier speakers in congratulating the secretariat and all those who had a role in the preparation of this interim report.
