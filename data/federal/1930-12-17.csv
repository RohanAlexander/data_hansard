2,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"Will you give consideration, Mr Speaker, to the suggestion that, instead of all the motions of which notice has been given appearing on the notice-paper each day, such notices might be published, say, once a week, or once a month?",10
3,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The suggestion appears to commend itself on the score of economy in printing, and may, perhaps, be considered by the Printing Committee. Anything I can do to ensure that, it receives attention ""will be done.",10
4,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"As the type from which the notices are printed is kept standing, would any saving worth mentioning be effected by adopting the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition? I would suggest, however, that it would save time, if members having motions on the business paper could have a division taken on them without previous debate, at any time, if they thought >fit. That would expedite decisions upon the matters brought before Parliament, and would also reduce the quantity of standing matter on the notice-paper - ",10
5,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"It is not within the power of the Chair to alter the practice of the House to give effect to the honourable member's suggestion; DURATION OF SESSION , GOVERNMENT BUSINESS.",10
6,Mr R GREEN,Unknown,"Havin g regard to the obvious geniality of the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Fenton) this afternoon, I ask if he will be courteous enough to inform honourable members, for their convenience, of the approximate date of the rising of Parliament for the Christmas vacation ? Has the Government any further business to bring forward which it has not yet disclosed? ",10
7,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I hope that during the afternoon, this evening, and perhaps tomorrow morning, we may be able to finish the business we have to do. I intend to announce later one or two matters which are to be brought forward for discussion.",10
8,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,What further business is it proposed to submit to the House during the remaining weeks of the session ?,10

10,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,Unknown,Will the Acting Prime Minister state in express terms the nature of the business he proposes to introduce before the House adjourns over the Christmas holidays!,10
11,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I have already intimated to the Leader of the Opposition that it is proposed to introduce a bounty bill relating to canned mutton. That bill cannot be ready before tomorrow morning. It will probably be necessary also to introduce an appropriation bill. Then, if amendments are made to the Wheat Advances Bill by the Senate, we shall have them to consider. That is about all the business there will be, so far as I know. TAX ON FOREIGN COAL.",11
12,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"Some time ago, I asked a question of the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Forde), regarding foreign steamers trading on the Australian coast, and using foreign coal in their bunkers instead of Australian coal.

16,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"It is not customary to answer questions involving matters of Government policy, but the inquiry will be dealt with if the honourable memher places his question cn the notice-paper.",11
17,Mr HAWKER,Unknown,"Will the Minister state whether this ' matter has been referred back to the board, and whether he has yet received a report from it which will be made available to honourable members? I do not ask the Assistant Minister to state what decision has been arrived at regarding the report of the Tariff Board, but merely whether a second report has been received.",11
18,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"There are so many qualifications to the honourable member's question that I find it difficult to follow him, and I ask notice of it.  question asked by me ten days ago, the Assistant Minister for Trade and Customs said that he had referred back to the Tariff Board the proposal that a hounty should be paid on sheepskins. Will he state whether he has yet received the board's report?",11

63,Mr SPEAKER,REPORTS OF CONFERENCE BY,"Hon. Norman Makin). - I understand. that there is some misapprehension respecting the right of the Speaker to leave the chair under the circumstances in which it was vacated this afternoon. From the early sittings of the first Commonwealth Parliament until the present day, every Speaker has adopted the practice which Ithen followed. There is no provision in our Standing"" Orders under which a motion may be' made for the suspension of proceedings, and a motion for the adjournmeiit'bf the House, if carried, closes a sitting. This afternoon, as there was no longer any immediate business to transact, it was desired by the Acting Prime Minister that the sitting should be suspended for a brief period to enable a conference with another place to proceed. My action in leaving the chair was in accordance with the practice of the past, and was the only procedure possible to bring about the suspension of a sitting to meet the general convenience of members. ' Mr LATHAM - Will you, sir, seek an opportunity to give a ruling on this matter in order that it may be discussed by the House?",16
64,Mr SPEAKER,REPORTS OF CONFERENCE BY,"I have just said thai my action was in accordance with long and well-established practice. No Other ruling could be given by me unless Standing orders were made to alter the procedure, or the House varied it on a specific motion.",17

66,Mr SPEAKER,REPORTS OF CONFERENCE BY,"The motion under the Standing Orders becomes an order of the day for the next day of sitting, and no debate may take place upon it.",17
67,Mr CROUCH,REPORTS OF CONFERENCE BY,"-On a point of order, I submit that the notice of motion does not correctly state the facts, in that it implies that you, sir, left the chair this afternoon without the consent of the House. I understand that, prior to vacating the chair, you made the announcement, "" I shall leave the chair and resume it at a later hour"". You then paused for a moment, and no objection was offered to your suggestion.",17
68,Mr GULLETT,REPORTS OF CONFERENCE BY,-It was not assented to.,17
69,Mr CROUCH,REPORTS OF CONFERENCE BY,"I submit that you left the chair with the concurrence of the House, but as you were leaving it the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham) protested against your action. The statement of the circumstances upon which your ruling is being challenged differs from what occurred this afternoon.",17
70,Mr SPEAKER,REPORTS OF CONFERENCE BY,"I cannot allow debate, nor will I offer comment upon the matter at the present time. That must await the consideration of the motion of dissent, when I shall have an opportunity to make whatever explanation I may deem necessary. UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEF. PROPOSED COMMONWEALTH GRANT.",17
71,Mr FENTON,REPORTS OF CONFERENCE BY,"Maribyrnong-Actin g Prime Minister) [6.21] - by leaveThere is no need for me to make any statement in the direction of enlightening honourable members of this House respecting the deplorable condition of many of our fellow citizens owing to the preva 1 lence of unemployment. This is the time of the year when our hearts are filled with goodwill and kindly feeling - towards our brothers and sisters. It is most distressing for any individual who has reached the age of discretion and judgment to see tens of thousands of our brothers and sisters, particularly women ancl children, throughout Australia suffering acutely because of a lack of employment in this land of plenty. The Government realizes that it can afforu the comparatively slight relief; but so that it may do what it can, it has decided to allocate for that purpose the sum of £500,000 out of the present year's Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure. There are three ways in which a grant may be made: First, by the passage of in appropriation bill, which would need to be preceded by a message from the Governor General; secondly, out of the Treasurer's Advance; and thirdly, by the method proposed, in order that the money may be disbursed through the State Governments, the municipalities, and other authorities that are organized for the provision of employment for our fellow citizens. At page 375 of the Estimates, of Receipts ancl Expenditure for the year ending the 30th June, 1931, honourable members will find figures relating to a Commonwealth grant to the States towards the relief of unemployment. As honourable members are aware, the State of Soutli Australia' this year found itself in such a difficult position financially, that a very strong appeal for assistance was made on its behalf, at the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers, held in Melbourne last August. In response to that appeal, some of the States agreed to hand over to South Australia the whole of the amount voted to them by this Parliament for the relief of unemployment, and, in the case of other States, it was agreed that a proportion of the grant should be diverted to South Australia. Mr E. RILEY - Will this distribution take place before Christmas?",17
72,Mr FENTON,REPORTS OF CONFERENCE BY,"Yes . During its present sittings, this Parliament has passed an act allocating to South Australia the sum of £850,000. remains on this year's Estimates an amount of £375,000, which enables the Government to make the proposed grant out of this particular vote.",18
73,Mr GULLETT,REPORTS OF CONFERENCE BY,Is the amount actually there ?,18
74,Mr FENTON,REPORTS OF CONFERENCE BY,"It is. I may say that 1. am acting on the very best authority and advice in making this announcement to the House. Whatever may be the party feelings of honourable members on ordinary occasions, they should be gratified that this sum is available to relieve in some measure the prevailing distress.",18
75,Mr FRANCIS,REPORTS OF CONFERENCE BY,How will it be allocated?,18
76,Mr FENTON,REPORTS OF CONFERENCE BY,"As near as practicable, on a population basis.",18
77,Mr BELL,REPORTS OF CONFERENCE BY,Will any conditions be attached to the grant?,18
78,Mr FENTON,REPORTS OF CONFERENCE BY,The grant will be made on the condition that employment is provided for the people. Most of the States and municipalities are organized for the purpose of putting work in hand and of giving employment to the people.,18
79,Mr GULLETT,REPORTS OF CONFERENCE BY,Will there be any conditions relating to the rate of wage to be paid ?,18
80,Mr FENTON,REPORTS OF CONFERENCE BY,"-No . This is a grant in which, I think, every honourable memher will concur. My only regret is that it is not a thousand times greater than the amount stipulated; but in the straitened condition of the. finances, both Federal and State, we are being as liberal as possible. I believe I speak for all honourable members, when I . regret, that the amount is not larger. We hope, however, that it will bring some blessing to hundreds of homes in the approaching season.",18
81,Mr LATHAM,REPORTS OF CONFERENCE BY,"Kooyong) [6.28]':by leave- I feel sure that the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Fenton) spoke rightly when he said that any proposal to deal with the distressing unemployment in Australia would be sympathetically received by all honourable members of this House. I am glad that the Government finds itself in a position to make money available for that purpose; There but I confess to being surprised to learn that that is so. That, however, is entirely the responsibility of the Government. We are all aware of the condition of the finances of the Commonwealth; it is fortunate, therefore, that this amount; is available. I am inclined to think that the wisest method of raising money to deal with' unemployment is the taxation of the wages and salaries received by those who are in employment. That system has already been adopted by the States. I shall not, however, raise any objection to this grant on that ground. All honourable members probably will be interested to learn whether the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Fenton) intends ns to understand that the terms and conditions upon which the grant is to be expended are to be determined by the States. Honourable members are aware that there has been a-controversy between those who consider that relief should he given in the form of sustenance, those who hold the view that at least some work should be provided, and those who contend that, when relief work'is provided, the money is not being wisely spent if there is an insistence upon the observance of ordinary industrial conditions and the payment of the basic wage. I understand from what the Acting Prime Minister has said that the intention is to leave all these matters to be determined by the several States. If that is so, I agree that it is the wisest course to adopt. I need only add.that I think that all honourable members will agree that grants of money are only in the nature of a palliative for the evil of unemployment, aud that responsibility rests upon the Governments and Parliaments of Australia to find some means of dealing much more radically and effectively with those evils of which unemployment is the symptom. While we may have varying views as to the methods to be adopted, this is perhaps the first and foremost subject which should engage the attention of this House.  by leave-The members of the Country party wish to associate themselves with the remarks of the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Fenton) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham). generally speaking, the responsibility of dealing with unemployment rests upon the State Governmeuts rather than upon the Commonwealth Government, we feel that in the special circumstances in which Australia finds itself today, there is reason for some divergence from what - might be ordinarily regarded' as the proper method of dealing with unemployment. . Therefore, the party to - which E belong desires to raise no objection to the action proposed to be taken by the Acting Prime Minister. TARIFF SCHEDULE (No. 6) 1930. Exi'ORT DOTTES.

82,Mr FENTON,REPORTS OF CONFERENCE BY,"Maribyrnong-Actin g Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Customs) [6.34] - I move That on and after the Eighteenth day of December, One thousand nine hundred and thirty, at nine o'clock in the forenoon, reckoned according to standard time - in the Territory for the Seat of Government, Duties of Customs he imposed according to the following Tariff:EXPORT DUTIES. Tarlfl Item. Bate pi Duty. 1. Sheep-skins with Wool - per lb. This schedule - provides for an export duty of ^d. per lb. on sheep-skins in the wool exported from Australia, and is being introduced with a view to ensuring that more of the work of fellmongering of skins shall he performed in Australia. It is estimated by the Tariff Board that the net advantage of the export duty will be the employment of about 1,109 additional men, and a distribution of approximately £275,000 extra per annum in wages. Unemployment is so acute in the fellmongering industry in Australia today that the Government considers it necessary to take this action at once in order to relieve the situation. It is anticipated that any falling off in the value of exports of sheep-skins consequent on this duty will be more than offset by the enhanced value of the exports of pelts, fellmongered wool, and basils.",19

That amendment removed the specific reference .to the Commonwealth Bank, aud substituted for it the words, "" any prescribed authority."" This would not exclude the Commonwealth Bank, but would place it on the same footing as other financial authorities. .1 do not wish to re-awaken controversy on this point, but it was made fair l y clear during the course of the debate on the bill that the intention of the Government was to squeeze the Commonwealth Bank, and to compel it to advance up to £4,000,000.",21

114,Mr GULLETT,REPORTS OF CONFERENCE BY,"I am delighted to withdraw the statement objected to, especially as the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Blakeley) has given an inferential assurance that the Government and its supporters do not contemplate bringing pressure to bear on the Commonwealth Bank. I could not receive fro m the .Minister a more welcome assurance. If no pressure is to be brought to bear upon the bank, the bill is not worth the paper on which it is printed. When the bank was asked to accede voluntarily to the request of the Government, it emphatically refused to provide this money; but, in view of the Minister's assurance that no pressure is to be applied to the bank, the ouly course open to him is to withdraw the bill. Minister has admitted that, after mature consideration, the bank could not see its way clear to guarantee an f.o.b. price of 2s. 6d. a bushel, even if a guarantee against loss were given, not only by the Commonwealth, as provided under the bill, but by the Commonwealth in conjunction with the six States. The Minister'having practically said that the bank is a free agent in this matter, honourable gentlemen opposite should not be in the least aggrieved if it refuses to find this The money.

I congratulate you, Mr Speaker, upon the impartial way in which you have prosided over our sittings; you have held the scales of justice evenly and have added to the dignity and distinction of your high office. I congratulate, too, the Chairman of Committees upon the ability and firmness that he has displayed in carrying out his duties. To the Clerk of the House and to his assistants 1 tender our thanks for their uniform courtesy and kindness, and for the valuable help they have given to us, and their prompt attention to our requests for assistance.

Every honourable member will bear testimony to the ready and capable services of all those who assist us in the performance of our duties. This is a season of goodwill. While we are inclined at times to emphasize our differences, and sometimes do a little hard hitting, for the most part a fine spirit of friendship and good fellowship prevails among us.

124,Mr CUNNINGHAM,REPORTS OF CONFERENCE BY,"Gwydir) [2.10 a.m.]- I understood from the statement made by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Fenton) this evening, when tabling the proposal for an export duty on sheep-skins, that one portion of the money thus collected is to be earmarked to provide a bounty on exports of canned mutton, and the other portion is to be applied to scientific research in connection with the pastoral industry. In my opinion the bill for the payment of the bounty should have been approved by Parliament before the export duty was imposed. Obviously, the duty will be futile, and its effect injurious to the sheep-farmers if the bounty legislation fails to receive the approval of Parliament. There is a great danger that, unless the proceeds of the duty are rigidly earmarked, in the event of the bounty legislation not being passed, the money derived from it may be diverted to some other avenue of expenditure and not returned to the growers.",24

130,Mr SPEAKER,REPORTS OF CONFERENCE BY,"Discussio n of those matters would open up a very wide field of debate, and would anticipate business to come before the House later.

132,Mr CHIFLEY,REPORTS OF CONFERENCE BY,"Macquarie) [2.14 a.m.] - In connection with the collection of State taxes on salaries for the relief of unemployment, the present practice is to assess the impost on the annual income. If in New South Wales the tax of Is. in the £1 be collected in a lump sum at the end of the year, a heavy financial strain will be imposed on many Commonwealth public servants living in that State, particularly those on the basic wage. I ask the Acting Prime Minister to consider the practicability of arranging for this tax to be deducted from the fortnightly pay, and so relieve the public servants of the possibility of financial embarrassment at the end of the year.",25

Tf a buffer area could be established on the north-west coast of Queensland, much good might be done. Those who have a knowledge of this pest will appreciate the menace it may .become to the .dairy herds, and if it establishes itself in the closely-settled areas along the eastern coast, "" it will cause losses which are estimated at several million pounds, and be most difficult to eradicate.",25

[2.18 a.m.] - I warmly appreciate the expressions that have fallen from the lips of the Acting Prime Minister, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr, Stewart). The task of presiding over this assembly and meting but evenhanded justice is not easy, and the testimony of representatives of all parties that my efforts to be strictly impartial and just have been successful, is most gratifying to me. I acknowledge also the appreciation that has been expressed of the services of the Chairman of Committees and the various officers of the House.' By an inadvertence the Temporary Chairmen of Committees were omitted; we all are indebted to them for ""their services, and I desire to express my personal gratitude for the assistance they have given in conducting the affairs of the House.
