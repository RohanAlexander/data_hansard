1,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,I wish to know from the Prime Minister whether the request made by Queensland for the continuance of the bounties on sugar has been accompanied by a suggestion that the excise duties should be retained.,12
2,Mr REID,Unknown,I cannot find that any suggestion of that sort is among the official papers. MR. UNWIN .,12
3,Mr LEE,Unknown,"Does the Postmaster General intend to confirm the appointment of Mr Unwin, who is now Acting Deputy Postmaster-General in New South Wales, as permanent head of the Department in that State?",12
4,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"The matter has not yet received the consideration of the Cabinet, and will not be determined until the Estimates have been passed. NA FISHING FLEET. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Has the Prime Minister noticed in today's newspaper the accounts of the diabolical conduct of Russia in repudiating her agreement with Great Britain? If so, will he insist on Great Britain fighting?",12
5,Mr REID,RUSSIA NATTACK ON BRITIS H,"I have seen one version which somewhat resembles the plain statement of the honourable member, and another of a totally different character. Under circumstances, I must abstain from putting extreme pressure upon the Government Great Britain. PUBLIC SERVANTS' INCREASES. Sir LANGDON BONYTHON - When Britain ? will the increases recommended by the Public Service Commissioner, in accordance with his classification of the service, and provided for in the Estimates now before this House, be payable?",12
6,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RUSSIA NATTACK ON BRITIS H,"As has been stated by the Treasurer, the classificaadvertising tion cannot be confirmed until the appeals equally which have been made in regard to it have in been dealt with, while my honourable colduty league has also promised that this House post, shall have an opportunity to express its approval or disapproval of it. Therefore the proposed increases will not be paid until the classification, has been approved; but when the classification is approved, the in10.30 creases will at once be paid, and will take effect from the first day of the current financial year. ELECTOR AL ADMINISTRATION .",12
7,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,RUSSIA NATTACK ON BRITIS H,"I wish to know whether the Minister of Home Affairs is correctly reported in the morning press to have stated yesterday that revision courts will not be held until Parliament meets again, and that the matter will be brought before Parliament next session, and not during this. If that is so, it may be twelve months before anything is done.",12
8,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RUSSIA NATTACK ON BRITIS H,"The report to which the honourable member alludes correctly states the present intention. It seems to me that it would be unjustifiable to put the country to the expense of printing the rolls in full , and holding revision courts, unless in the event of an election being imminent, since in some of the States, at any rate, the present distribution of constituencies may require to be seriously altered.",12
9,Mr HIGGINS,RUSSIA NATTACK ON BRITIS H,"Does the Minister deem it useless expenditure to have the valuable information which he gave to me yesterday, with regard to the intention of the Ministry as to the redistribution of constituencies, printed and circulated?",12
10,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RUSSIA NATTACK ON BRITIS H,"That information will be circulated in Hansard. NA MATTER. Sir LANGDON BONYTHON - I wish the to know, from the Minister of Trade and Customs, whether it would not be possible, of without prejudice to the Commonwealth, for the Customs Department to deal a little more generously with printed advertising matter sent to Australia from Great",12
11,Mr MCLEAN,DUTY ON ADVERTISIN G,"The honourable member waskind enough to tell me of his intention to ask this question, and I have, therefore, obtained the following information from my officers :The Tariff places a duty of 3d. per lb. on all matter, catalogues, &c. This duty is leviable, whether the articles are imported the ordinary way, or sent through the post. The is collected by requiring additional stamps to be placed on the article when sent through the or senders can prepay the duty. It is difficult to believe that any merchant desiring to know what goods to order would refuse to receive a catalogue, because there was a charge of one or two pence thereon for duty. The object of enforcing the tax is not the amount of revenue involved, but to carry out the intentions of the Tariff. It would be possible (and has been done) for Australian sellers to have catalogues, & c , printed abroad, and posted, if the duty were not enforced, as they could save in the cost of printing, &c. It is quite possible that the incidence of this tax may go further than Parliament intended, but I do not think that it is possible for the Customs Department to disregard the law. Some mercantile houses have been known to have tens of thousands of circulars printed abroad for distribution here.",12
12,Mr KNOX,DUTY ON ADVERTISIN G,"Will the Minister give the House some information as to the extent of the accumulation of circulars in his Department, because of the refusal of mercantile Houses throughout the Commonwealth to pay the impost demanded from them?",13
13,Mr MCLEAN,DUTY ON ADVERTISIN G,"If it is possible to obtain the information, I shall be very pleased to get it for the honourable member. I know ""that in many cases the addressees will not accept the printed matter sent to them. That, of course, does not absolve the Department from the duty of administering the law as it stands. The tax is one which is clearly imposed by the Tariff, and must be collected.",13
14,Sir LANGDONBONYTHON,DUTY ON ADVERTISIN G,"Is the Minister aware that the receivers of book catalogues are expected to pay duty on them, although it is absurd to suppose that such catalogues could be printed in the Commonwealth ?",13
15,Mr MCLEAN,DUTY ON ADVERTISIN G,"We know that a great many of these catalogues could never be 1 printed in the Commonwealth, but if there were not a duty on advertising matter large houses could send home orders for the printing of catalogues to be circulated in Australia. As the Tariff imposes a duty on advertising matter, the Customs authorities believe that they have no alternative but to administer the law as it stands.",13
16,Mr REID,DUTY ON ADVERTISIN G,"Hear , hear. DUTY ON OILBAIZESHELVING thousands A ND GREY CASSIMERE SHIRTING .",13
17,Mr GLYNN,DUTY ON ADVERTISIN G,I wish to know from the Minister of Trade and Customs if the statement published in the press yesterday that the Comptroller of Customs has refused to allow entries to be made which were in accordance with the decision of Mr Justice Barton is well founded?,13
18,Mr MCLEAN,DUTY ON ADVERTISIN G,"The prosecutions in regard to which the decision was given were instituted before I took charge of the Department, and never came under my notice in any shape or for m ; but since the honourable and learned member was kind enough to tell me of his intention to ask the question, I have obtained from my officers the following information on the subject: The following comments are submitted, on the remarks published in the Argus of 17th inst. (vide attached excerpt) regarding the recent High Court judgments given against the Department. The articles in connection with which the actions were instituted were :1. Oil Baize Shelving, 2. Grey Cassimere Shirting, and not oil baizes and grey denims, as stated by the Argus, As regards the former, the Department had charged duty at the rate of 15 per cent., as "" furniture coverings,"" but the Court held that, as oil baize was specifically mentioned by the Tariff at 5 per cent, ad valorem, that item must also embrace oil baize shelving. With regard to No. 2, the Department contended that the cassimeres were properly dutiable at 15 per cent., as "" coatings,"" "" vestings,"" and "" trouserings,"" under Item 66 (4). Expert evidence was, however, tendered that the article was a "" denim,"" and the High Court accepted this view, and gave judgment accordingly. In both cases the Department relied on section 138 of the Customs Act, which provides that when any goods enumerated in the Tariff can be classed under two or more descriptions, with resulting difference as to duty, the higaer duty shall be charged. This contention was, however, overruled by the Court on the ground that, in construing the Tariff, the words used therein must be accepted according to their every-day meaning, unless there was evidence to show that they had acquired a different meaning, and that terms of trade usage must be considered according to the meaning they had acquired in the trade, and that the section was not applicable as between a generic and specific designation. As regards the statement that the Department had, on the 16th inst., refused to accept entries for similar goods,- it is pointed out that the High Court verdict was only given on Saturday last; Monday was a holiday, and on Tuesday instructions were issued to officers to act in accordance with the Court decision. It appears that some delay was caused to one firm on Tuesday morning, before the necessary instructions had reached the wharf officers. This was, however, unknown to the collector. The statement made by the Argus that the trade has been compelled to pay very many of pounds illegally to the Commonwealth, is vague and indefinite. If , however, it refers to the two articles under notice, it is undoubtedly incorrect, as with the exception of shelving, all oil baizes have been admitted at the Tariff rate of 5 per cent.; and all denims, other than the cassimere shirting, which formed the subject of contention, have been passed at the 5 per cent. rate. It is observed that the Argus and Age of this date publish a paragraph embodying the .gist of the foregoing comments. NA POSTAL DEPARTMENT .",13
19,Mr JOHNSON,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"I desire to ask the Postmaster-General if he will give instructions - to the officials of the Department to be more expeditious in answering communications sent to them. I have a reply here, dated 4th November, which reached me only today.",14
20,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,I shall cause inquiries totoemade in regard to the matter. LETTER - B OX CLEARANCES.,14
21,Mr KNOX,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"the Postmaster-General, upon noticeWhetlier he has completed his inquiries ing the claim for the restoration of the late ances of-letters in the suburbs of Melbourne; and, if so, will he inform the House at what decision hJ has arrived ?",14
22,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"The report of the Board appointed to inquire into the matter was received by me yesterday afternoon. I have not yet had an opportunity to deal with it fully, but I may inform the honourable member that it is my intention to arrange for late clearances of the letter-boxes in the suburbs between, say, 10.40 and 12 p.m. I also think that, in view of the large amount of correspondence - the Board estimates that it amounts to two millions of letters annually-addresse d to Ballarat, Bendigo, and intermediate places, I shall decide upon making a special clearance at some of the railway stations and post-offices in order that residents in the suburbs may have an opportunity to send their letters to the places mentioned in the early morning, receive a reply the same afternoon, and, if necessary, send back a further communication the same evening. I have also decided to make an important alteration in connection with the afternoon clearances. For some years past the afternoon clearances in the suburbs have been made in such a manner that the letters have reached the General 'Post Office too late for delivery in the metropolis on the same afternoon, and also too late to permit of their being despatched by the Sydney and Adelaide express trains. I intend to alter the arrangements so as to insure that the letters shall arrive at the General Post Office in time for the late afternoon deliveries in the city, and for despatch by the express trains leaving the same afternoon. COSTS IN CUSTOMS CASES.",14
23,Mr HUGHES,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"the Minister of Tiade and Customs, upon notice What is the amount of costs incurred in connection with Customs cases debited to the State of Victoria since the establishment of the High Court?",14
24,Mr MCLEAN,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"The information the honourable and learned member desires is now being obtained, and will be available by Tuesday next. PERSONAL EXPLANATION.",14
25,Mr KNOX,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"I desire to make a personal explanation. Attention has been d irected by some honourable members-and I think with quite sufficient justification, in regard- view of the importance of establishing cleara precedent-to the circumstances connected with the printing of the memorandum issued by me upon the subject of the proposed Council of Finance. I wish to repeat what I have already stated to the. House, namely, that, in the first place, I went to the Government Printer and asked him to hold me entirely responsible for the cost of printing the memorandum. Subsequently, the right honourable the Treasurer asked the House to receive the paper, and placed it on the table.",14
26,Mr MCDONALD,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,He placed it on the table without asking the House-that is the trouble.,14
27,Mr KNOX,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"At any rate, he placed it on the table. He did so without any request on my part. He acted entirely of his own volition, and I was very grateful to him. The form of the memorandum had to be altered to comply with the rules of the House. I arranged, in the first instance, for the printing of 520 copies. Now, an additional 900 copies have been printed in conformity with the rules of the House. I sought permission, and have obtained it , to pay for the printing of the additional issue of 900 copies, and ih order that there may be no misapprehension as to my position in the matter, I now present the receipt of the Government Printer. I quite agree with honourable members that it is undesirable to establish a - new procedure in such matters. A large number of copies of the memorandum are now available, and I earnestly hope that honourable members will do me the favour to read it carefully. Even if the expense incurred had been fourfold what it has been, I should regard myself as f u l ly compensated by the attention given by honourable members to so very important a subject. SUPPLY, 1904-5. In Committee (Consideration resumed from 17th November, vide page 7160): POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT. Division 184 (Central Staff), ,£5,447",14
28,Mr WEBSTER,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE, I desire to bring under the notice of the Postmaster General one or two matters which appear to me to demand attention. I understood from the statement made by the Minister of Home Affairs that there is no intention on the part of the Government to pay any of the increases proposed to be given to officers under the classification scheme unt i l the scheme has been adopted by Parliament. The Treasurer had previously intimated that the increases granted to officers in receipt of small salaries would be paid in anticipation of the adoption of the classification scheme.,15
29,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,That referred to the cases of officers in receipt of salaries under £ 1 6 0 .,15
30,Mr WEBSTER,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"I understood from the Minister that there was no intention to pay any of the increases. Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - Yes , £[160. In the cases of other officers, only the ordinary increases, apart from the classification, will be paid.",15
31,Mr WEBSTER,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"I think that the increases granted to such officers as sorters in the post-offices, who have had to wait for eighteen or^ nineteen years for a recognition of their claims, should be paid without waiting for the adoption of the classification scheme. I know of a large number of men in New South Wales to whom small increases have been granted, and to whom it is of the utmost importance that they should be paid without delay. If I can obtain a-promise from the Postmaster General that these officers shall be paid, irrespective of the confirmation of the classification scheme, I shall be satisfied.",15
32,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,The stated that indreaSes \would .be paid to officers receiving salaries up to .£160.,15
33,Mr WEBSTER,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"I am not quite clear whether it is intended that the increases granted under the classification scheme to such officers shall be paid without delay. Therefore, I should like a clear pronouncement to be made by the Minister. There is another matter which affects not only the Department under discussion, but the general policy of the Government. I refer to the strong appeal made by the right honourable member for Swan to the Government to repeal section 16 of the Post and Telegraph Act, which prohibits the employment of black labour on mail steamers. Such a request, coming from the right honourable member, who was a member of the Government which inserted the provision in the Act, is entitled to some notice at the hands of the Ministry, and I think that Ministers should give us some idea as to the course they ' intend to - adopt. The right honourable member for Swan, in his usual style, pooh-poohed the idea that the supporters of the White Ocean policy were actuated by a desire to promote the interests of the Empire. I would point out, however, that the Argus quite recently stated that a White Ocean was of more importance to the welfare of the Empire than a White Australia. I am satisfied that the Argus, in taking up that attitude, is standing on solid ground. At present the employment of black labour, and of white alien labour, which is worse, is being encouraged, and the British merchant marine is being used for the purpose of training white aliens, who may become our most serious opponents in time of trouble. I up to find that, according to recent statistics, the total number of men employed in the British mercantile - marine is about 250,000. Of these, 37,000 are black aliens. This, in itself, is serious enough, but a still greater danger is indicated by the fact that during the fifteen years, ending 1900, the number of men employed in the British mercantile marine has increased by 43,000, of which number 19,000, or nearly one-half, were coloured aliens. Out of an increase of 43,000 in the number of persons engaged in the British mercantile marine during fifteen years, only 12,000 were ""boys of the bull dog breed."" Last night the right honourable member for Swan, who is a strong supporter of the Government, and a pronounced advocate of preferential trade, urged the Prime Minister to repeal Treasurer that particular section in the Post and ! Telegraph Act which provides for the maintenance of a White Ocean, so far as the carriage of our mails is concerned. I am inclined to believe that his appeal was inspired by a desire to keep the matter before the public, so that the promise which was made by the Prime Minister should not be altogether forgotten. Believing that, I wish to ascertain, before the Government are allowed to get into recess, what are their intentions in this connection ?",15
34,Mr REID,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,We cannot alter an Act of Parliament during the recess.,16
35,Mr WEBSTER,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"I desire to know whether the Prime Minister intends to redeem his promise to repeal the provision to which I have referred, as soon as possible ?",16
36,Mr REID,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,The honourable member seems to have a mania for remaining in Melbourne all the year round.,16
37,Mr WEBSTER,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"I recognise that I have a duty to perform. Surely the Prime Minister will not say that in a matter involving the welfare, not only of Australia, but of the great Empire of which he is so patriotic a representative, I have no right to ask for an exposition of the Government policy ?",16
38,Mr REID,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,Will the honourable member stop if I give him one?,16
39,Mr WEBSTER,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"Yes , if it is satisfactory.",16
40,Mr REID,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"Ver y well. I should like to reassure the honourable member in this way: It is perfectly true that I entertain strong opinions in regard to the matter to which he has referred-opinion s which I have publicly expressed. I appealed to the electors of Australia to support me in an endeavour to bring about an alteration of that particular provision in the Post and Telegraph Act. The result was an absolute refusal on their part to sanction any such change. I respect that decision, and I have no intention whatever of introducing any measure to interfere with the provision in question during the life of the present Parliament.",16
41,Mr WEBSTER,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"That is certainly the most distinct pronouncement which we have received in regard to this matter up to the present time. As honourable members are aware, foreigners are ousting British sailors from British ships more and more each year, so that today it is not an uncommon thing to find amongst the crews of such vessels only one or two natives of the mother country. The position is amusingly summed up in the following story, which is related by the Liverpool Post:Foreigners are ousting the British sailor more and more each year from British ships, and it is not uncommon to find among crews only one or two men natives of this country. "" The skipper of the tramp steamer Bumping Billy was engaging a new crew. ' What's your name ?' he said to the foremost applicant. ' Giuseppe Grinolieri, replied the man. 1 1 Eyetalian?' 'Yees,' he said, 'Very good; step on one side. And yours?' he went on to the nextA.B. ' I v a n Ikankoff.' 'Russian?' 'Polish, sare.' ' R i g h t ; step alongside o' Yewseppy. Next man?' ' Wilhelm Zwillanguzl.' 'German?' 'Ja.' 'Very good; over you go. Next ?' ' Manuel Oliviera. I Portuguese seaman, senor.' ' Step over then, Manuiwel. Next?' 'John Thompson, sir.' ' What ?' ' John Thompson, sir.' ' What in-th thunder-wha t the-wha t nationality ?' screamed the horrified ship master. ' English, sir,' replied the man. For a full half minute the unhappy skipper stood speechless, his countenance turning from purple to orange, and from orange to grey; and then, with a gurgling gasp of ' English, by gum !' he tottered, staggered, and fell upon the ground."" That conveys a very clear impression of what the British mercantile marine is coming to. I appeal to those who are flying preferential kites at the present time to come down to something which affects the Empire much more closely than does preferential trade, and to insist that British ships shall be manned by those who are prepared to accept their share of responsibility in defending the Empire. Sir ' WILLIAM LYNE (Hume) - I wish to direct the attention of the Postmaster General, as a matter of administration, to the very imperfect replies to inquiries which are frequently received from the Department over which he presides. For example, I am in receipt of a communication which has reference to improvements to the Corowa post-office. It purports to be a true statement of the facts relating to that matter, but, although it gives an accurate account of the proceedings up to a certain point, it does not give the whole position, and the deductions which are drawn by the Department are inaccurate. The reply omits a minute which was written by the honourable member for Denison when Postmaster-General, in which he sanctioned the carrying out of the work conditionally upon the State Government approving it , because the expenditure which would be incurred would have to be deducted from the revenue returned to that State - This morning I received the following letter from the president of the Progress Association at Corowa:I am in receipt of your favour notifying your Daily failure to secure the long-promised convenience to the Corowa Post and Telegraph Office. I can assure you that the Progress Committee f u l ly recognise the position you occupy with reference thereto. The convenience of the people who maintain this important office has never been considered since the advent of Federation. We have no telephone chamber, and no possibility of getting letters for Melbourne delivery before Monday unless posted on Thursday. Fiues for postages for Melbourne are still imposed, the entrance to the office has been made for pigmies, and the clock is as often stopped as going, so that you can imagine the Post and Telegraph Department's administration deserves the gratitude of the Corowa people. Upon the outside of the envelope is written the following: Yet another example re inquiries for time of closing mails, &c. Posting this 12.30 a.m. Post office clock 8.35 a.m., and stopped at that. Federal post-office management-Lord deliver us from it as soon as possible. I produce this correspondence with a view to showing that there is a deliberate into tention on the part of somebody in the post-office to thwart the decision of an ex Mr MCWILLIAMS Postmaster-General, and to prevent which was promised before the establishment of Federation from being undertaken. There is another matter to which I desire to direct attention. It has reference the penny-postage system which obtains Victoria. I need scarcely remind honorbourne, able members that in New South Wales the postage upon letters is twopence. Owing to the penny rate obtaining toria, it very often happens that persons in writing to their friends upon the side of the Murray, unwittingly affix penny stamp to their letters. sult, when they are delivered upon the other side of the border, the recipients are comit pelled to pay. not only the extra postage, but also a fine of twice the amount that - is involved in the shortage. Seeing that cannot secure a penny postage system carrying settlement with them. throughout the Commonwealth, I am of partment opinion that this matter ought to be these arranged in some satisfactory way by reguordinary lation, so that no fines should be imposed by the Department.",16
42,Mr BROWN,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,Why not have uniform penny postage?,17
43,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"I think we the should have it ; but the reason why the reform has not been carried out is that it anticipated that it would result in a loss of revenue. It is certainly an anomalous state Of affairs that under Federation the. people of one State should have penny age, while others have not. Those who - receive letters in the circumstances I mentioned should not be fined, and only cases of apparent carelessness or design .should the recipient be penalized. As matter of fact, many persons in this State do not know that it is necessary to place 'twopenny stamp on a letter to be sent across .the border; they are misled by the fact has - that there is pennypostage throughout Victoria only. I would therefore appeal to the Postmaster-General to do what he can to remedy this source of complaint. The amount involved is small, but the present system of inflicting fines produces a good deal of friction.",17
44,Mr JOHNSON,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,The same regulation should apply all over Australia.,17
45,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"I agree with the honourable member. For a little while I overlooked the fact that it was necessary to place a twopenny stamp on a letter be sent a few miles over the border, and insufficiently stamped two or three of them. - The system causes a work considerable inconvenience.",17
46,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"And also friction. The public complain that it is the result of Federation. I speak feelingly on to this subject,, because my own constituents in have a voluminous correspondence with Meland feel the burden of this regulation more than do residents of other parts But of the Commonwealth. I trust that the in Vicanomalv will be removed.",17
47,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE," There other is no Department of the Commonwealth a which can confer &uch great advantage on As a rethe outlying districts as that whose Estimates we are now considering. I trust that will be the continuous policy of the Department, irrespective of what Government may be in power, to afford every facility to we those who go into the wilds of Australia, No Dehas greater opportunities to assist persons by giving them a little of the conveniences of civilized life. I would urge the representatives of the city and suburban electorates to consider that, whilst it may be perfectly right to require guarantees to be given in connection with extension of the telephone or telegraphic service in the more populous centres, the is practice may create very serious difficulties great in some of the outlying districts. The whole policy of the Commonwealth and States Governments should be to encourage postthe people to go out from the cities and settle in the country. One of the greatest have hardships under which those who Jive in in the remote parts of Australia labour is the lack of proper postal and telegraphic coma munication. I am one of those who think that in many of its undertakings, and more a particularly those relating to the extension of the telegraphic system, the Department insisted on far too costly an article being .provided, and that a much cheaper service could be given to the people. I understand, for example, that it is quite a novelty for the Department on the mainland to utilize growing trees as telegraph posts. In Tasmania that has been the practice for many years. We rarely think of erecting a telegraph pole in a rural district. We simplycut off the top of a spar and connect the wire with it ; and I have no hesitation in saying that a tree, lopped of its branches, and used in this way, will last longer than four or five of the best wooden poles.",17
48,Mr MCDONALD,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,Does the honourable - member suggest that this practice should be followed in the outlying districts of Queensland?,18
49,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,It should be adopted wherever there is growing timber.,18
50,Mr MCDONALD,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,In some parts of Queensland one could travel 200 or 300 miles without seeing a stick.,18
51,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"In such places the Department might utilize boundary fences, or other suitable objects, in extending the telegraph system, and thus reduce the cost of the service. Unless we cheapen the service in this way, we shall not be able for many years to give many of the residents of the remote districts of the Commonwealth the facilities they require. There is another matter which should receive the attention of the Minister, and which I brought under notice shortly after I was returned to this Parliament. I refer to the fact that, although an operator in a country office may be prepared to send an urgent telegraphic message after the usual hour of closing, it will not be received at the head office. In the case of a serious accident, an operator in a country office might be prepared to transmit a telegram after the usual closing hour, asking for the attendance of a medical man, but, owing to the piece of red-tapeism to which I have alluded, it could not be sent. This is a serious matter in sparsely-populated districts, where a man may be injured, say, in a mill, or by a falling tree, and where there is no local medical practitioner. When it is necessary to send an urgent telephonic or telegraphic message it should be the imperative duty of the officers at the head receive it. The present should not be tolerated. To my mind, the system of utilizing railway stations as post-offices in some of the rural districts, is most objectionable. In many of these places children call for newspapers and letters on their way home from school, and I 71791 think it is highly undesirable that they' should have to attend at an open station, where the railway line is unfenced, and trains are running to and fro, in order to receive their parents' correspondence. There is another matter to which I must refer. A case has been brought under my notice, in which the Department refused to connect a township with a telephone line which practically runs through it, simply because the local residents were not prepared to give a guarantee. The cost of connecting the township with the line would have been a matter of only a few shillings, and it seems to me that, in a country like Australia, the Department must not be tied up by any hard-and-fast red-tape rules, if our tele-phone and telegraphic service is to be made advantageous to the people. The residents of rural districts have not many conveniences, and one reason why Australia is like an inverted pyramid-the greater proportion of the population living, not in the country, but in the towns-is that we have not given those who go into the back-blocks' the facilities a reasonable and sensible system of postal and telegraphic communication would afford. It is most important that we should take care that these little conveniences of life are afforded those who go into the outlying parts of the Commonwealth. If we are to apply a hard and fast measure all round, and insist upon those who are perhaps fifty or 100 miles away from large centres of population being tied down by the regulations that are applied to cities and towns, the post and telegraph system of the Commonwealth will never be the success it ought to be, and will never encourage as it ought to do the settlement of the people on the land. The infliction of fines for insufficient postage, to which the honourable member for Hume has referred, has given rise to some difficulty in the State from which I come. The delivery of a letter posted in Victoria, and addressed to one 1 of the provincial districts of Tasmania, where school-children usually call for the mail, is often delayed because of insufficient postage. A child on calling for his parents' correspondence is perhaps informed that there is a letter on which there is office to a fine to pav, and has to go away without practice it. In this way friction is unnecessarily caused. If the grievance could be remedied it would go a long way towards oiling the machinery of the Department, and enablipg it to run far more smoothly than it does. I would welcome as heartily as would any honourable member the introduction of a uniform penny postage, but am afraid that the finances of some of the States at the present time would not permit of that boon being given. Until the time arrives when such a reform can be made, I think that the regulation relating to the infliction of fines for insufficient postage should be less rigorously applied. I wish to emphasize the point that the Department should do everything in its power to encourage settlement. The residents of outlying districts, no matter how limited their number maybe, should be given every consideration. It should I5e our desire to. improve the ditions under which they live, and: when they ask for increased postal facilities we should not compel them to give that which they are not in a position to. give- a guarantee as to the revenue which the new service will return. Regulations which maybe rightly applied to the more populated districts should not be imposed upon those who go into the wilds of Australia, so to speak, and are doing the best work for the Commonwealth. Those who live in the bush, where they are deprived of many of the comforts of ordinary life, should be given those facilities in the matter of telegraphic and postal communication which, next to the establishment of State schools, constitute the greatest boon that a Government can confer on the people.",18
52,Mr HUME COOK,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE," For the no first time since I have been a member of quiry. this House I venture to bring under notice of the Minister what may be termed an individual grievance. I should not this action, but that the circumstances of and therefore was not put on. the case are of a special character, that other efforts which have been made regard to it have not been productive of satisfactory result. I invite the Minister's particular attention to the complaint, which has not previously been submitted to his consideration. His predecessors in office have not been able to obtain any satisfactory explanation of the matter, and certainly those honourable members who have inter1903. ested themselves in it have not been fied. I refer to the peculiar way in which an ex-employee of the Department, named Maurice Sheahan, has been treated. This man joined the Victorian postal s'ervice as a casual employ^ in 1900. In Jul v. 1901, he had the misfortune to break his factory arm, and to otherwise injure himself, while engaged in the work of an assistant line repairer. The Department admitted that his injuries were received in the execution of duty, and recognised the fact by allowing him full pay during the three months that he Was disabled, the office files showing that no demur was made to this. On his' return to duty, it was found that he was unable to take up his old work, and he was given clerical work, which, according to the Departmental records, he performed satisfactorily; and, later on, he was asked to take a position as assistant storeman at the General Post Office, Melbourne. When the Public Service Act was proclaimed, however, an extraordinary thing happened, in- con- as much as every other man in the service, with the exception of Sheahan, was taken over, and made an officer of the Commonwealth. When Sheahan asked why he was not taken over, no satisfactory answer was forthcoming. The facts of the case were submitted to several honourable members, and they were so impressed with the injustice that had been done, that they waited on the Postmaster-General of the day, and submitted the case to him. He asked the Secretary to the Department to have an inquiry made; the Secretary sent the case on to the Public Service Commissioner, with a request for information, and he in his turn forwarded it to the Deputy Postmaster General of Victoria, who asked one of his officers to report; but in the long run the papers were either lost or forgotten, and answer was returned to the original in-' Another application was made the to the Public Service Commissioner, who replied that Sheahan had been told take that he could not be recommended, I wish and to know why this man was treated difin ferently from the rest of the employees in any the Department. I have taken the trouble to obtain the Departmental record of his services; but I cannot find that he has been guilty of wrong-doing, or of unsatisfactory conduct. The records show that he was employed by the Department from the 13th December, 1900, to the 30th September, During the whole of that period, satishis conduct was good. He was employed in the capacity of line repairer's assistant, and also as storeman, and assisted in clerical work. On his certificate of service, the further remarks are added thatMaurice Sheahan performed his duties in a satismanner, and ceased .duty upon the expiration of the period for which he was employed. There is no statement there as to his unfitness, nor are any reasons given for his dist charge. I regret to have to bring an inindividual case before the Committee, because I think it is the duty of Members of Parliament to discuss matters of policy, rather than details of administration; but in this case T think that great injustice is being done. I have waited on - every Commonwealth Postmaster-General, with the exception of the present occupant of the office, in regard to the case; but none of them seemed to be able to ascertain why the man was dismissed, or why he should not be re-instated. His broken arm makes him incapable of doing manual labour which would enable him to keep his family decently, and as he is a widower with five or six children, he finds it extremely difficult to make both ends meet. Had he not been injured in the performance of a dangerous service, I might not have been justified in bringing the matter up, though I think that, in any case, there are circumstances connected with it which require investigation and explanation. Without further comment, I wish to appeal to the Minister's sense of justice, and ask him for an inquiry into all the circumstances of the case, so that, even at this late stage, this unfortunate man may, if possible, be reinstalled.",19
53,Mr BROWN,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE," For considerable time past, the administration of postal affairs in New South Wales has been very ably conducted by Mr Unwin, who is acting as Deputy Postmaster General. This gentleman has served his State for something like forty-two years, and it seems to me that, unless there are some very good reasons to the contrary, nn injustice is being done to him by not promoting him to the position of permanent Deputy Postmaster-General. I do not know whether he receives less salary as Acting Deputy Postmaster-General than he would receive were he permanently appointed tn the position, but I know of other cases in which officers acting temporarily are not receiving the full salary attached to the offices which they are filling, so that probably Mr TJnwin is not being paid the full salary of a Deputy Postmaster-General. The point I wish to make, however, is that, under, a State Act, he is entitled on retirement to a pension, the amount of which will be computed on the salary which he has received. He is already nearly sixty-three years of age, and under the Commonwealth Public Service Act, may be compelled to retire on reaching the age of sixty-five. Therefore, if he is not promoted to the position of permanent Deputy Postmaster General, his discharge of the duties of that office, while acting temporarily, will not be taken into account in computing his retiring allowance.",20
54,Mr BAMFORD,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,There are already two Deputy Postmasters-General in New South Wales in receipt of pensions.,20
55,Mr BROWN,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"Anothe r case to which I wish to refer is that of a Mr Maguire, a gentleman who entered the New South Wales postal service as far back as 1859, so that he has given forty-five years of his life to the work of the Department, and the records show that he has been a very efficient officer. From 1882 to 1893 he was Inspector of Telegraphs, controlling a very large district, with very onerous duties to perform, involving a great amount of travelling. From 1893 to 1904- a period of eleven years-h e was postal inspector, and he has now for some time past been acting temporarily as metropolitan inspector. The position was at one time filled by Mr Burnett, who received the salary of £ 4 7 0 per annum, and was in 1902 appointed Superintendent of Mails, at £ $ $ 0 , being succeeded by Mr Young, a country inspector getting ,£400 per annum, who some was made metropolitan inspector at £ 4 7 0 , and in August, 1903, was appointed to the position of Manager of the Telegraph Service, at £[520 peir annum. Mr Young had more work to do than his predecessor, because, while metropolitan inspector, he continued to carry on some of his duties as country inspector. But although he received .£470 per annum, Mr Maguire, on succeeding him, was given only £ 4 0 0 per annum, while his duties were even greater. Upon the appointment of Mr Maguire the conditions I described were intensified, inasmuch as he was called upon not only to assume the very heavy duties imposed upon his predecessor, but also to discharge part of his former duties as a country inspector. The Department, by this arrangement, effected a saving in the salaries amounting to £ 8 7 0 per annum. No complaint has been made with regard to the manner in which Mr Maguire has discharged his duties, but he has been able to cope with his work only by means of sacrificing his holidays and the hours which he would, under ordinary circumstances, be entitled to devote to leisure. Although he has been receiving some assistance from the other inspectors, the present position is far from satisfactory to the officers. I do not think that our officers should be overworked in this manner. As an indication of the extent of the work which has recently been imposed upon the inspecting staff, I am told that whereas under State control there were nine inspectors, the work, which has naturally grown with the increase of population, is now discharged by from four to six officers. The former occupant of the office of senior inspector, Mr Bossley, had a salary of .£550 per annum, but when Mr Maguire was appointed to the position, instead of being granted the salary which formerly attached to it, he received an increase of only £ 2 0 per annum. I should like the Minister to look into this matter and see whether full justice cannot be done to officers like Mr Maguire, who has been in the service for forty-five years, and has discharged onerous duties with credit to himself and his Department.",20
56,Mr JOHNSON,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE," I desire merely to endorse the remarks of the honourable member for Canobolas with regard to the necessity for the appointment of a Deputy Postmaster-General in New South Wales. It is peculiar that the authorities should have been content to allow an Acting Deputy Postmaster-General to discharge the duties of the position for such a long period. I trust that this state of affairs will not be permitted to continue, and, further, that the Postmaster-General will give his attention to the various other matters brought under his notice by the honourable member for Canobolas, particularly in regard to improved facilities for telephonic communication throughout the country.",21
57,Mr FULLER,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE," I desire to direct the attention of the Postmaster General to a case in which I believe that grave injustice has been done. For some years it was the practice in New South Wales to refer to a Departmental Board all cases in which discrepancies occurred in the accounts of the Post and Telegraph officials. Some time back a change was made, and all such cases were referred to the Law Department, and when it was considered necessary were dealt with by the Courts. The old practice was, however, recently reverted to. The case to which I wish to refer is that of an officer who has been in the Department for nearly twenty-five years without having any black mark against him, and who was recognised as very efficient. He was stationed at Byrock, on the western railway line of New South Wales, and in consequence of the terrific heat which he had to endure there, he became slightly affected in the head. He was, by way of change, placed in charge of the Balmain branch, one ' of the most important suburban offices in New South Wales. During the time he was there a discrepancy occurred in the accounts of the Savings Bank branch, and his case was immediately handed over to the officers of the Law Department, who instituted legal proceedings. No money was missing, but an alteration had been made in a depositor's book, and the officer was fined £ 2 and dismissed from the service. Under the old practice to which I have referred, hundreds of cases, in which officers were much' more seriously at fault were dealt with by the Departmental Board. In some instances the officers were suspended, but they were always reinstated. I think that the' officer to whom I have referred has suffered an injustice, owing to a temporary change of procedure, and I trust that the Post-. master-General will inquire into the matter with a view to ascertaining if anything can be done to reinstate him. I desire to emphasize what has been stated by some honourable members in reference to guarantees being required in connection with the construction of country telephone lines. I have on one or two occasions mentioned the i claims of the Illawarra district to telephonic communication with Sydney. We have in that district one of the most important industrial centres in Australia. Newcastle has been connected with Sydney by' telephone for a number of years past, and I have been endeavouring to secure the establishment of similar communication between the Illawarra district and the metropolis. We have a large number of coal mines, some thirteen of which are in active operation, and a goodharbor at Port Kembla at which ocean steamers of 5,000 or 6,000 tons displacement are loaded with coal. The absence of telephonic communication with Sydney is a great drawback to the mine-owners and ship-owners. Messages have to be frequently sent in connection with the loading' of vessels, and in consequence of the pressure of business at the Woollongong Telegraph Office, .serious delays occur in trans-' mission. If telephonic communicationwere established, the messages could be despatched straight away, and business would be facilitated. When I applied to the postal authorities, in the first instance, tp' construct a telephone line, I was asked to plank down a guarantee of £ 7 5 0 . thought that was a very large order, but still I endeavoured to comply with the'retomary quirement of the Department. however, that what was everybody's busian ness, was nobody's business. I was unable to secure the full amount of the guarantee, although some of the residents in the disportunity to retrieve his character. trict were themselves prepared to construct the line.",21
58,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,There is no reason why one or two people should give a guaran antee on behalf of the whole of the resibe dents in a district.,22
59,Mr FULLER,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"That is exactly the position I took up. I made strong repretake, sentations to the Department, and evenregulations tually the honourable member for Denison proved very much more reasonable than his predecessor. He reduced the amount of the guarantee from £[750 to £ 3 5 0 Illawarra is an important district, with population of 20,000 people, and as a telecountenance phone line connecting it with the metropolis would, without doubt, pay handsomely, should be constructed irrespective of any guarantee. I believe that the officers the Department are actuated by a fear that the extension of telephone facilities cause a reduction in the revenue derived from the telegraph lines; but I do not think that that consideration should operate to prevent industrial centres from being furnished with the latest and most up-to-date means of communicition. It is important that every facility should be offered in such cases, 'bepossible cause rapid means of communication as I sist in the development of industry, and consequently add to the prosperity of the country. I trust that the Postmasterable General will give prompt consideration the claims of the Illawarra district.",22
60,Mr SPENCE,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE," I wish to only a few words in regard to the case the officer brought under notice by the orable and learned member for Illawarra. I have known the officer for a great many 'years. He occupied the position of master in my electorate, and was only absent from it owing health at the time the trouble arose. I have known this officer personally for some years, and from the records of the Department, I feel justified in saying that an injustice has been done to him, as the sult of a sudden change in the-practice which was previously followed. I do not know who is responsible for that - change, but I am aware that it was effected during I the time that the Deakin Government held office. Prior to that period, it was custo institute very careful inquiries I found, into all cases of remissness on the part of officer. The Department adopted the very laudable plan of affording any officer who had been guilty of negligence, an opIt dealt with him either by reprimand, by fine, or by reducing his status. Suddenly, however, it was decided that every case in which officer committed an irregularity should handed over to the police authorities. The officer to whom I have already referred was not in very good health. He made a misand was fined £ 2 for a breach of the which amounted to negligence. Subsequently, however, he was dismissed. I know of no other instance in which an officer has been dealt with in that way. I . am satisfied that with his keen sense of a fair play the Postmaster-General will not the infliction of an injustice of that character. Personally, I am of opinit ion that the old system was preferable to tha present practice. As the case will proof bablv come under the notice of the Minister, I ask him to see that justice is meted out to will the individual in question.",22
61,Mr MCDONALD,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE," I wish to' direct attention to Ihe necessity' which exists for providing an extra mail service lo the northern portion of Queensland. I understood that one of the objects of Federation was to bring the remote portions of Australia into as close touch as with the more populous centres. n the case of North Queensland, only a weekly mail service is provided for 100,000 persons. As a result, they suffer considerinconvenience. The existing service to is maintained by the steamer Bar coo, which conveys the mails from Gladstone to Townssay ville. That service is a great improveof ment upon the old one, 'but I recognise that honit is capable of still further improvement. I am satisfied that an arrangement could easily be made, by which the Barcoo could a postrun iwo trips weekly between Townsville and Gladstone. At the present time that to ill - vessel makes only one trip, and then'repairs to Brisbane to coal and take in perishable cargo. The additional service for which I ask could be provided at a very small increased cost. At the present time.' I underrestand that the mail service to the northern portion of Queensland involves an annual expenditure of £ 1 3 , 0 0 0 , but we must recollect that it serves a very large section of i8 4 the community. All the outlying centres from Townsville are more or less dependent upon that service. I would further point out that letters posted under the poundage rate upon vessels belonging to the Australian United Steam Navigation Company, the Howard Smith Company, or the Adelaide Steam-ship Company, two or three days prior to those forwarded by the Barcoo, do not arrive in Brisbane more than half-a-day earlier.",22
62,Mr KELLY,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"That is a good lesson to remember, in connection with our oversea mail carriage.",23
63,Mr MCDONALD,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"It merely goes to prove that no advantage is gained by transmitting mails by these vessels. This is a very important matter to the growing population of Northern Queensland, and I should like to know what the Department has done in connection with it. I am aware that some time ago Senator Drake refused to provide the additional facilities upon the ground of expense. But I would point out that since then the Department has incurred extra expenditure by instituting a fast mail service between the mainland and Tasmania. I do not complain of that, but I say that Northern Queensland is also entitled to improved mail communication. Then there is another matter to which I desire to direct attention. In Northern Queensland-and I suppose the same remark is applicable to the back blocks of New South Wales and Western Australiait is the practice of the Postal Department to station public officers in remote districts for very long periods. That is manifestly unfair. Officers who are comfortably situated in a more genial climate, and in thickly populated centres, should in their turn be sent to these outlying districts. It is unfair to expect officers to remain in the back blocks year after year. Unless they are able to occasionally effect an exchange, a system should be inaugurated under which periodical transfers should take place, so that no officer should be called upon to remain in the remote portions of the Commonwealth for more than three or four years. I would further point out that, in some instances) these men receive what, having regard to the enhanced cost of living, is a bare pittance-an amount which certainly does not compensate them for the loss of their health. "" I trust that the Postmaster-General will look into this matter. T should further like to know what the Department is doing in regard lo the extension of the parcel-post Supply. [REPRESENTATIVES.] Supply. In calling for tenders, the Department should make an effort to arrange for mails being carried, wherever possible, by vehicles instead of on horseback, so that the parcels post system may be extended to mere of the outlying districts of the Commonwealth. It is also desirable to increase the limit fixed for the weight of parcels. At present the Department will receive only parcels weighing not more than n . lbs., and those who wish to send goods weighing (say, 33 lbs., get over this, difficulty by dividing them into three packages. In these circumstances, the Department should consider the desirableness of increasing the limit. It is surely immaterial whether goods weighing 20 or 30 lbs. are carried in one parcel or in three. Many of the storekeepers and business people in rural districts are opposed to the parcels post system, but we have to consider the interests, not of one or two individuals, but of the people as a whole. I think that the system is of great service to residents of sparsely-populated districts, and might well be extended.",23
64,Mr MAHON,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE," It is desirable to emphasize the remaks of the honourable member for Kennedy as to the unfairness of the system under which officers are compelled to remain for years at stations in the more remote portions of Australia. This may be a mirth-provoking matter to representatives of city and suburban constituencies, who do not realise the conditions under which the men are compelled to labour, but to the unfortunate officers it is of the most serious nature.",23
65,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,Why did not the honourable member put the matter right when he was Postmaster-General ?,23
66,Mr MAHON,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"I had not time to do so. If the honourable member and others had not with indecent haste displaced the late Government, I should have endeavoured to formulate a scheme to redress some of the grievances of these officers; more particularly the retention of some of them at remote stations for indefinite periods. I am familiar with several very hard cases, but the difficulty is that the hands of the Minister are tied by the Public Service Act. However admirable his ideas may' be, he is not permitted to give effect to them. No one knows that better than does the honourable member, who sneeringly asks why I did not formulate a scheme to remove this injustice. The whole control of the service is in the hands of the Public Service Commissioner. The Minister is to a great system. extent a mere figure-head-a petty registrar of the decisions of the Commissioner. honourable member for Kennedy has not aggerated the hardships inflicted upon offihis own. cers condemned for years to a life of utter isolation. Men have been stationed for so many years at Eucla and Israelite Bay, osity. as well as at Broome, and other settlements on the north-west coast of Western Aushaving tralia, as to render them almost unfit for life in more civilized places.",23

68,Mr MAHON,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"It was not their "" w i but rather their influence that effected change. The - right honourable member knows that it was exceedingly difficult an officer to obtain a transfer from one these distant stations. It was only the production of a medical certificate absolute unfitness to continue duty there that he could obtain a transfer to Perth one of the coastal towns.",24
69,Sir JOHN FORREST,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,That was not the case in my time.,24
70,Mr MAHON,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,I am in a position to affirm that it was.,24
71,Sir JOHN FORREST,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"If they wished to be transferred, they certainly did not apply.",24
72,Mr MAHON,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,Nonsense . The right honourable gentleman must be aware that officers have been on duty at Eucla from twelve to fourteen years; and is it not reasonable to assume they would have applied for a transfer if there was the remotest chance that it would be granted.,24
73,Sir JOHN FORREST,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,I suppose they did not .wish to leave.,24
74,Mr MAHON,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"They never had an opportunity to be transferred. They knew very well, prior to Federation, that it would be useless to apply to the right honourable member for a transfer.",24
75,Sir JOHN FORREST,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,Mr Sholl not do anything unjust.,24
76,Mr MAHON,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"That is a bold thing to aay to one who has proof that Mr Sholl did do unjust things.

I was amused by the decisive emphasis which he placed on the word ""blood."" sidering what he himself knows, and the facts with which he knows I am familiar, that statement evidencedeither colossal stupidity or monumental audacity on his up The part.

79,Sir JOHN FORREST,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,I think it is.,24
80,Mr MAHON,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"I observe that the rightl l , "" honourable member is leaving the Chamber. a Apparently he is not prepared to take the gruel that he is always ready to serve out for - to others. He has been holding up Mr. of Sholl as a paragon of perfection, whereas upon he was merely a blustering autocrat, wholly of unfitted for any high administrative post. From the shoals of protests against his manor agement, I chance to have in my hand just now a letter from a member of the local Legislature, who represents an electorate forming part of my constituency, in which he states thatThe great want of our district is proper postal facilities, and I am afraid, so long as the present Deputy Postmaster Sholl holds his position, there will be little advance on the old postal days. It requires a complete change in the Western Australian Postal Department-som e one with up-to-date experience in charge, not a man like the present, whose whole aim is to keep down expenditure, no matter how injurious it is to the advancement of the State. Again, the same gentleman writesThe Postal Department is adamant; nothing would shift them into anything like up-to-dateness ; the most powerful explosive will not shift them out of the old groove of twenty-five years ago; it will be a day of joy to far Northerners and backblockers when an up-to-date Deputy takes charge of postal matters in this State. These extracts, which could be supplemented by other and stronger testimony, vitiate the right - honourable member's championship of this official, which is due to reasons that would ought not to operate on a public man. When the right honourable member suggests that I have a suspicious mind, I feel it necessary to show that many other competent judges in Western Australia shared my opinion of this official. It is the right honourable member's privilege to slink away, but having the temerity to attack others he should be prepared to stand the brunt of their [Con- retorts. In the speech which he delivered a few evenings ago, he devoted considerable attention to the appointment of officers of the eastern States to the more lucrative positions in Western Australia, and desired to take credit. for having called attention to this matter. As a matter of fact, I directed attention to the question some time ago. I have a letter from the Postmaster-General's dated roth October last, forwarding me a return from, the Public Service Commissioner for which I had asked several months before, showing the number of officers in the Commonwealth service, with salaries of £250 per annum, or more, who have' been transferred from one State to another since ist 'January, 1901. I find from the return, that in the Department of External Affairs, two officers have been transferred from New South Wales to Victoria, and one from Western Australia to this State. No transfers appear to' have been made in the Attorney-General's Department; but in the Department of Home Affairs, five officers have been transferred from Victoria to New South Wales: In the Department of Trade and Customs, five have been transferred from Victoria to New Wales, one from New ' South to Victoria, and one from South Australia to Victoria. In the Department, one Queensland officer has been transferred to this State, and two officers from New South Wales. Postmaster-General's Department, one officer has been transferred from New Wales to the central staff in Victoria, two from Victoria to Western Australia, and two from Queensland to the central staff. This shows that the grievance, after all,' is not a very serious one. Briefly stated, it amounts to this: that two officers who. are earning more than £[250 - a year have been transferred from to Western Australia since the establishment of the Commonwealth. right honourable member has made a great deal of this complaint, without having much justification for doing so; though, of course, I join with him in protesting against the practice of filling all the higher positions in Western Australia by officers brought from the other States. I think that the Western Australian service should first be searched for good men, because there are good men there. I hope that the Government will not appoint an outsider to the position of Deputy Postmaster-General at Perth, because the gentleman now acting temporarily is a very able man, who knows the State from end to end, and he has given great satisfaction in the discharge of his present duties. Unless the Government are prepared to give to Western Australian Mr Mahon. officers opportunities to obtain lucrative positions elsewhere, this practice of exportingeastern officers to the State should. cease forthwith. The right honourable member Department, for Swan was not the first to draw attention to the matter. Long before he uttered his. protest I had done my best to bring about ' a discontinuance of the practice. . .",24
81,Sir JOHN FORREST,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,I am very much obliged to the honourable member. We are evidently in accord on this subject.,25
82,Mr MAHON,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"That is very satisfactory ; but we should have been in greater accord had the right honourable member refrained from making aspersions upon the' Public Service Inspector in Western Australia. My complaint against him is that while he refused to charge that officer with any specific misdoing, he growled in a large, general way about his appointment, which, as I have already shown,, was made by a Government of which the right honourable gentleman was a member. The officer South himself was at the time of his appointment Wales known to one or two of the Ministry, and was highly recommended by Ministers under Defence whom he had served in New South Wales,, where he had given great satisfaction. 'He' has had varied experience in several De-. In the partments of the State service, and in all employments has given the utmost satisfacSouth tion to his official superiors. I do not express approval of every detailed act of his in Western Australia; but, taking his work there as a whole, I think that it has been very well done. '"" '",25

84,Sir JOHN FORREST,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"And have, I suppose, been trying to run him ever since.",25
85,Mr MAHON,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"The right honourable member is once again quite wrong. I have never sought to influence this officer about any person' in the' Public Service, or concerning any candidate for a position in the Public Service. The right honourable member is quick to accuse others of having suspicious minds, a characteristic which he evidently possesses himself. I wish he interfered with the Public Service as little as I do. I cannot forget his action in a case which, perhaps, explains his hostility to the Public Service Inspector in Western Australia. As the papers have been laid upon ; the tabje, I think I am perfectly at liberty, to refer to it. About twelve months ago the office of postmaster-at Fremantle was vacant.",25

106,Mr MAHON,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,Does the right honori able gentleman think that an officer in refor ceipt of a salary of £ 2 7 0 per annum,26

112,Mr MAHON,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,He had something more than twelve months longer service than the man finally appointed.,26

114,Mr MAHON,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,That is a distinct rehad flection on the Public Service Inspector. The right honourable member's grievance is the officer whose duty it was to select a person suitable for the position did not Mr Woodrow as suitable as some,26
115,Sir JOHN FORREST,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,It was not because Mr Woodrow was not suitable and capable in every way that he was not chosen to a rill the temporary appointment at Fremantle.,26
116,Mr MAHON,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,It is very unfortunate that the Public Service Inspector differed also from the right honourable member. That with him is an unforgivable offence in any one.,27

He was informed, in reply, on the same day that the matter had already been under notice, and that the Deputy Postmaster-G«neral was informed that when the position was vacant it would have to be advertised, and allapplications considered ; in the meantime no action was to be taken, pending further report and decision of Minister as to temporary transfers recommended. / On 24th December, Sir John Forrest, M.P., telegraphed to the Postmaster-General from Perth in the following terms :"" Woodrow, Postmaster, Bunbury, being temporarily moved Fremantle; a splendid man, fit for any position, have known him for twenty years, one of the very best men in Postal Department. You can approve of his promotion with confidence, and with my strongest recommendation. You can let Commissioner Public Service see this if necesThis telegram was communicated by telephone to the Public Service Commissioner, who was for a copy of a communication it was understood he had received from his inspector in WesAustralia on the subject. In compliance with request the Commissioner forwarded the folcopy of a telegram from Perth addressed his secretary by the inspector referred to :Newspapers report Woodrow leaving Bunbury as Acting Postmaster, Fremantle. Duties conducted by Grosvenor since Stirling left. Most strongly disapprove of transfer suglater on, gested, even temporarily."" On 24th December, the following note was adto the Postmaster-General in Tasmania by the Secretary of his Department, namely :"" I enclose you herewith a telegram to you from Sir John Forrest with reference to the transfer the Postmaster at Bunbury to a similar position Fremantle, and also all papers connected with matter which have reached this office. "" For some months the Postmaster of Fremantle been on leave owing to illness, he desired to retire altogether, but hitherto the Commissioner not seen his way to agree to this, as the PostMr Stirling, has not reached the retiring and has not been certified as incapable of again performing the duties of his office. In consequence of Mr Stirling's absence, which extended over more than six months, the usual arrangements have been made for relieving him, and I cannot understand why they should not have been continued until a definite conclusion as to the retirement of the absent Postmaster. Of course, when, by his retirement, or otherwise, a is created for a successor, the position must, in accordance with the Public Service Act, be advertised, and applications for it invited. Mr. Sholl's recommendation to transfer, even temporarily, the Postmaster at Bunbury to Fremantle, to be intended to place him in a more favourable position to obtain the coveted office, which is probably the best in Western Australia."" His action has been taken without reference The to either this office or the Commissioner",27

125,Mr MAHON,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"Does the right honourable member say that his superior, the Postmaster-General, should not have been consulted. Why does the honourable member defend Mr Sholl in the action he took?",27
126,Sir JOHN FORREST,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,Because Mr Sholl thought he had the power.,27
127,Mr MAHON,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"Then Mr Sholl was mistaken in this case, as he has often been before. The narrative continuesHis action has been taken without reference to either this office or to the Commissioner, and I think it would be unwise to sanction it, as will be seen from the telegram from Mr Fowler, M.H.R., and* from Mr Green, the Public Service Inspector in Perth. Mr Fowler is certain to move in the matter (if it is allowed), when Parliament meets, and would probably have the support of his party, and, in the face of Green's telegram to the Commissioner, I do not see that approval of the transfer could be justified. I strongly recommend that the previous arrangements for relieving the Postmaster at Fremantle be continued, and that no transfers be allowed in connection with this matter. If any action has been taken by Mr Sholl to commit the Department without authority, it should be disavowed, and he must bear any responsibility connected with such unauthorized action.",27

129,Mr MAHON,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"In one sense he undoubtedly did. Though the Secretary to the Department has no local knowledge, he is not biased by old connexions or family traditions. Having the records of the various officers before him, his decision is more likely to be just than that of a man notoriously open to improper influences.",28

131,Mr MAHON,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"The right honourable gentleman must remember that the Minister and Secretary had the assistance of the Public Service Inspector, Mr Green, who is a very able man.

135,Mr MAHON,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"He had so many partisans in the local Parliament that he was practically able to dominate the Royal Commission nominally appointed to investigate his conduct. That Commission whitewashed him, and condoned practices which have since been condemned by every competent officer who has inquired into them. The right honourable gentleman knows that that Commission was packed with partisans of Mr Sholl.",28

He clearly understood that a transfer was but temporary under section 51 of the Public Service Regulations, and that, the event of a vacancy, he would have to take chance with others. I was under the impression that I held power, under regulation referred to, to make such a transfer, and was impelled to this course owing to a rather unfavorable report by my inspector, who examined Fremantle office in October. If , however, I have erred, in my ing of the Regulations, I trust the Postmastertirement.

It is true that Mr Sholl says that he has been impelled to recommend a change owing to a report of his inspector as to the Fremantle office in October last, but the summary of that report, which is now herewith, does not disclose anything to the disadvantage of the Acting in Postmaster, but shows that he has been at a dishis advantage owing to the absence of so many of his assistants on leave.

175,Mr MAHON,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"When the right honourable member sat on this side the time of Parliament was often taken up to less piir' pose. The living allowance granted to to officers at these outlying stations was more liberal prior to Federation than it is now, and in addition, they have been deprived of the free medical attendance and hospital accommodation which they previously enjoyed. I can inform the Committee that nearly the of the public servants of . Western Australia voted for Federation on the disand tinct understanding that the privileges t which they enjoyed as officers of the State Public Service would be preserved to them the section of the Constitution intended to maintain existing and accruing of rights.

I had no wish to detain the Committee unnecessarily, and I regret that, owing to the attack made by the rieht honourable member for Swan on the Public Service Inspector for Western Australia, it was necessary to enter at such length into the details o! a case, which otherwise did not call for rescue from official oblivion.",31
176,Mr MALONEY,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE," I desire to conclude the brief remarks I intended to make last night. It will be remembered that I was dealing with the charges made for telephone communication, and I suggested that a small fee of £ 3 3s. might be charged with a fee of i d . , 2d., or 3d. per message. I . understand that there will be very great difficulty in inducing people to adopt that system, but it will be admitted that it would prevent, one of the evils of the present system under which persons may monopolize a telephone for half-an-hour, and prevent its use by those who desire to use it. also, that some steps should be taken in the interests of the operators who, in the opinion of the highest scientific authorities are, by the nature of their work, rendered extremely liable to nervous prostration. There is just one matter to which I desire to direct attention. Before doing so, however, I wish to thank the Postmaster-General for the good work which has been accomplished in the Department, as the result of the transfer of an officer from Queensland to Victoria. I am very glad that new blood has been introduced into the Victorian postal administration through the appointment of Mr Scott, whom I applaud for the very strong attitude which he has assumed upon certain questions. I understand that a second officer has recently been transferred from New South Wales to this State, and that upon his report difficulties which had existed for many years have been removed. pleased to learn that the Minister is prepared to accept certain suggestions that have been made in regard to letter clearances in the suburbs. In my opinion, the practice of transferring officers from one'State to another cannot fail to produce beneficial results. There is one bad feature in connection with the administration of this Department, which should be remedied with. out delay. I understand that certain of our electoral registrars are under the control of the Postmaster-General's Department. The experience I had in the December election showed-to make the kindest remark that I can-that the officer placed in charge of it was incompetent, and a few days before the late Postmaster-General left office I had to make a complaint against him for having removed the registrar who was making up the rolls in North Melbourne, putting in his place a man who was new to the work. I .regret that his reply was inaccurate. I asked the Postmaster-General not to sanction the continual transfer of electoral registrars, when they are engaged in the compilation of the rolls. I welcome the system of transferring officers from one State to another. It will have the effect of removing some of the cobwebs which seem to attach to this Department, and consequently it constitutes a move in the right direction.",32
177,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE," I have to thank honourable members for the criticisms in which they have indulged. Although those criticisms have been rather lengthy, upon the I suggest, whole, they have been of a friendly character, and I am sure that they will prove of. great assistance to me in administering the Postal Department. Many suggestions have ibeen made, some of which will be of very great value. I sympathize as much as does anybody with the pioneers of Australia who are compelled to labour under many disabilities in the back-blocks, and. who enjoy comparatively few facilities in the matter of telephonic or postal communication. I think that it is our duty to assist in every possible way those who are engaged in the noble work of developing the resources of the Commonwealth, and honourable members may rest assured that to the full extent of our power, we shall endeavour to do that. During the course of this debate special reference has been made to the salary which attaches to the position of Deputy Postmaster-General in New South Wales and other States. When a vacancy I am also was created in New South Wales owing to the retirement of Mr Dalgarno, it was generally understood that the Public Service Commissioner would appoint an officer to fill it . The matter, however, was referred to the Attorney-General, who advised that the Government alone had power to make the appointment. The suggestion was then made that the salary attaching to the office should be reduced to ;£8oo per annum. It is, perhaps, needless to say that I do not agree with that sugges-tion. I think that an officer who is qualified to fill such an important position should, by reason of his ability and experience, be able to command a salary of .£920 per annum. There is no doubt whatever as to the abilitv of the present occupant of that office. He has lo control a revenue which, last year, amounted to ,£941,000, and an expenditure which aggregated .£950,000. Further, he has to take charge of the Government Savings Bank's transactions, and of all inoney-order and postal-note business. He has also to accept a responsibility which he was not previously called upon to bear. In pre-Federatioii days, the Postmaster-General shouldered the responsibility of approving of practically all expenditure in connection with the Department, but at the present time it devolves upon the Deputy Postmasters-General.",32
178,Mr WATSON,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"But that expenditure does not involve matters of policy. The Minister's argument is that the more-we decentralize our system, the more expensive it should be. - Mr SYDNEY SMITH - Las t year, this officer had to control no less a sum than ,£11,000,000. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - How many men doe's he control ?",33
179,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"He controls 3,865 permanent officers, and 2,859 nonofficials, or a total of 6,724 officers. Obviously, it is necessary that we should have a man of ability to fill that position, and to secure the services of such an officer we must pay him a good salary. We all know what is done by private employers. The Broken Hill Proprietary Companydoes not hesitate to pay £5,000 or £6,000 to a person to manage its business.",33
180,Mr WATSON,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,That argument would apply to the permanent head of the Department in Melbourne.,33
181,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"The permanent head of the Department in Melbourne is paid a salary of ,£1,000 a year.  that he is worth it?",33
182,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"I do. Nobodv grudges him that salary. It is undeniable that Mr Scott attends to the work of his office in a very thorough manner. I hold that the Deputy Postmaster-General of New South Wales is entitled to a good salary in view of the responsible position which he occupies. It has been suggested that the salary of the Collector of Customs in New South Wales should also be reduced. That officer receives £920 per annum, and nobody will contend that he has to shoulder more responsibility than falls to the lot of the Deputy Postmaster General of that State. Reference has been made by the honourable member for Parramatta and others to the Pacific Cable, and I join with them in complaining of the lack of commercial aptitude exhibited by those who control that line. I think they should have ""pushed business more than they have done. Whilst New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland contribute about '£30,000, a year towards the maintenance of that cable, it should be recollected that last year the company were required to pay£114,526 in interest, sinking fund, and renewals. In my judgment we should extend as soon as possible the system of the Government ownership of cables throughout the Empire. I take the same view in regard to that matter as: I do in regard to the ownership of our telegraphs and telephones. I am pleased to say that a board will very shortly meet in the old country to consider in what way the service and the business of the Pacific Cable can be improved. The. conference has been somewhat delayed by the Canadian elections, but I think that it will be held at a very early date, when we may look forward to some more satisfactory arrangement being arrived at in regard to pushing the business of the Pacific Cable. Any assistance which the Commonwealth Government can afford in that direction will be forthcoming. Regarding the question of our mail contract, I admit that a satisfactory tender has not been received. None of us wish to see the poundage system brought into operation unless we are forced to resort to it. But we have to choose between that system and the payment of a subsidy of £[150,000 per annum. As honourable members are aware, the present contract will terminate upon the 31st January next year. The British Government have entered into acontract with 'the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company to provide us with a fortnightly service. It was left with 1 us to arrange for a similar service with the Orient Company so as to continue a weekly service between Australia and the old country. Tenders for that-contract were invited by the Deakin Government in the first instance. Some misunderstanding occurred in regard to the question of providing cold storage accommodation, and unfortunately the tender which was forwarded to the Department cannot be found.",33
183,Mr REID,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,That is a strange thing.,33
184,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"It is strange. The impression of officers of the Department is that the tender in question covered provisions for certain cold storage accommodation. I am obtaining a copy of the first tender sent in by the Orient Company, the details of which were embodied in a minute considered by the Government of the day. That tender was not acceptable, because the price was too high. Fresh were invited, in which the charge for making provision for cold storage was to be separated from that for the carriage of mails. I find that the company stated in their tender that the steam-ships would be fitted with cold storage accommodation. They said they would be called upon, trade as a matter of business, to provide this accommodation, but that they did not care to bind themselves down to make the provision specified in the conditions of the contract called by my honourable friend the late Postmaster-General. second tender, like the first, was for ^£150,000. From 1888 until 1898, Australian Governments were called upon to contribute only £ 7 5 , 0 0 0 per annum for lower. a weekly service. At the end of that period the contribution was reduced to £ 7 2 , 0 0 0 per annum; and I think that honourable members will admit that it was too much to panies ? expect the Commonwealth to pay an additional £[78,000 per annum for that part the same service which was carried out the Orient .Company. That was the view which two previous Governments took this matter, and we certainly endorsed it. Under During the course of negotiations, the quesshould tion of the employment of black labour was discussed, and Mr Anderson, the manager of the Orient Company, in a letter addressed to the late Prime Minister",33
185,Mr WATSON,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"In writing to me, he tioned that he had already written to the honourable' and learned member for Ballarat.",34
186,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"The letter members forms part of the Departmental records. were unreasonable. In this communication, he pointed out the resort to lascar labour in the stokea holds of the vessels of the Orient-Pacific line had its origin in no idea of monetary economy. The company had ito employ two coloured men to do the work of white man, and consequently occupy double the room, and to incur other expense, that really no saving was effected by ploying black labour.",34
187,Mr WEBSTER,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,That is too thin.,34
188,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,I am merely putting before the Committee the opinion expressed by the manager of the company.,34
189,Mr WATSON,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"He said that, in any case, they would require the same subsidy.",34
190,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"He went on the to say that it was a question, not so much as to the increased cost of substituting labour for black, but as to the company being able to carry on the service profitably, and that they could not make a profit with tenders a subsidy of only £ 8 5 , 0 0 0.",34
191,Mr WATSON,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,Unde r any conditions.,34
192,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"That is sex From the Government point of view, it is, to say the least, .remarkable that they were able to carry on this service with a subsidy of .£85,000 per annum, when the export of Australia was nothing like as large as it is at the present time.",34
193,Mr LONSDALE,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,But there are now more steam-ship companies engaged in the trade.,34
194,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"It is true that competition is keener today than it was in The 1888, but I do not think there is anything to justify our paying an additionally8,000 the per annum on the old contract.",34
195,Sir JOHN FORREST,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,Freights are,34
196,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,That may be.,34
197,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"The subsidy of £[72,000 was formerly for the two com",34
198,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"But under the of new arrangement, the Orient Company was by ,to give us a fortnightly service to and from England, and the British Governof ment was to provide for a similar one. the proposed contract, we have had to pay £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 , instead of ,£72,000 per annum for the continuation of the old service, and the Government, feeling that they would not be justified in doing anything of the kind, menrefused to accept the tender. I should have been pleased to arrive at a satisfactory arrangement, but I think that honourable will admit that the terms proposed The Peninsular and thai Oriental Company will continue to give us fortnightly service, by arrangement with the British Government, but we shall be forced to resort to the poundage system in order to get over the difficulty one in regard to a weekly service. Under the new arrangement, it will be necessary so to avail ourselves, as far as possible, of emsteamers that will be able to deliver our mails in the old country with something like reasonable despatch. I do not think that there is any likelihood of the Orient Company going out of the Australian trade; and, as long as they remain in it, we shall be able to send our mails by their steamers under the poundage system. If we paid, postal union rates, the adoption of that system would involve an expenditure for all white our mails of about £[28,000 per annum; but under the rates, in .accordance with the law passed by this Parliament, it would cost us only about £ 1 0 , 2 0 0 per annum to have half our mail matter conveyed by other boats than those of the Peninsular and Oriental Company, or a total of about £ 1 9 , 0 0 0 per annum. The cost will be much less than it was under the old system, but I freely admit that the service is not likely to be as efficient. I am hopeful that we shall be able to make better arrangements than appear possible at the present time; but we were forced to resort to the poundage system, the tenders sent in being so unieasonable. In order to make good the loss of the weekly service which was provided under the contract system, we shall have to avail ourselves of every steamer that will be obtainable for the carriage of our mails.",34
199,Sir JOHN FORREST,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"""Unde r the age system, these vessels will 'be able to call wherever they please. .",35
200,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"The Peninsular and Oriental Steam-ship Company are under contract to provide a fortnightly service, and must comply with the terms of that contract; but we cannot interfere with the movements of steamers carrying mails under the poundage system.",35
201,Mr MCDONALD,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,It does not pay steamship companies to allow time to be wasted.,35
202,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"Certainl y not. The owners of steamers having a large quantity of perishable produce on board, are not likely to unduly protract their voyages, simply for the sake of delaying our mails. If they wish to participate in the Australian trade it will be necessary for them to expedite their passage. They will have to compete with the Peninsular and Oriental SteamNavigation Company.",35
203,Sir JOHN FORREST,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,They will run their vessels to please 'themselves.,35
204,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"Anothe r matter to which prominence has been given during the general debate is the extension - jf the telephone service, and special reference has been made to the proposal to construct a telephone line from .Geelong to Warrnambool without requiring any guarantee to be given by the persons who will be served by it. The honourable member for Corangamite first brought the proposal under the notice of the Government, pointing out that a number of the residents of Colac desired to be connected with the telephone system. Inquiries made by the Department showed that it would not pay to construct a line to that town; but that if it wereextended to Warrnambool- a very important business centre, and if it also served the intervening towns of Terang and Camperdown, it would certainly be a profitable undertaking. That was the opinion expressed by the engineer of the Department, and the request that the line should, be constructed was supported by a letter from the Geelong Chamber of Commerce, which was presented to the Government by the honourable and learned member for Corio. In view of the engineer's report, and of the opinions expressed by the Deputy Postmaster-General, I had) no hesitation in approving of the proposal. When we find that a line would not pay if carried to only a certain point, but would be a profitable undertaking if extended some miles further on, I think we have a right to agree to the extension. pound- Mr. JOSEPH COOK - We do not object to that; but what we wish to know is why we all cannot be served alike",35
205,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"The Government will be prepared to consider any case in which it can be shown that by making an extension, as in the case of the Warrnambool line,, a profit may be secured*. Some objection has been raised to the new system of utilizing growing trees as telegraph posts. I do not blame those who complain, but I feel that we can never hope to give rural districts the telephone facilities that they deserve, unless we are able to cheapen the system. I am anxious to afford the residents of outlying districts the most reasonable telegraphic and telephonic facilities; and I think that by utilizing growing trees in this way, we shall be able to very materially reduce the cost of the system. Let me cite a case in point. A report was submitted to me showing that a telephone line to serve three different places would involve an outlay of £[496. I returned the report to the officer, with a request that he should inform me if the cost of the line could not be reduced by utilizing growing trees instead of telegraph posts for a distance of eighteen miles. Under the original estimate, the farmers to be served would have been called upon to deposit a sum of £[132, and to enter into a certain bond; but in reply to my request, I learned that by utilizing trees in this way, the cost of the line would be reduced to .£232, that the line would become a paying one, and that it would be unnecessary to require those interested to lodge any deposit. I might mention one or two cases of a similar character, and I am sending back various reports submitted to me with a view to ascertain whether this system may not be more generally adopted. Where it is possible in this way to reduce our expenditure, and to thus enable telephonic communication to be extended, it is our duty to do so. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports and otihers have complained that casual hands are being paid a lower rate of wage than the minimum fixed by the Act, and for their information I would state that, in September last, a circular was issued, notifying that casual hands should in future be paid at least the minimum rate, and they are being so paid at' the present time. If there are any cases in which that notification is not being complied with, I shall be glad to be told of it. The subletting of contracts, to which reference has been, made, is a very important matter, and has caused a great deal of discussion in this Chamber.. Th'e Hate Postmaster-General had it under consideration, and decided- I think rightly-that subletting, except by consent of the Department, should be abolished. Mr Vines, who, trading as Cobb and Co., Bad sublet a large number of contracts, was called upon either to surrender them or to transfer them to the sub-contractors, under a penalty of having his contract cancelled. He accordingly agreed to transfer",35
206,Mr TUDOR,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,Forty-one .,36
207,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"I think that was the number. There were two contracts, however, which he declined to transfer, and he was notified that if he did not transfer them in accordance with the decision of my predecessor, I would cancel them. He did not transfer them, and I cancelled them. Then an effort was made to get fresh tenders invited, but I was averse to calling for fresh tenders, because I felt that the original contractor might even go to the length of undertaking a service at a loss rather than allow the man who had been carrying on this service to obtain' the tracts. The legality of my celling the two contracts to which I have referred was questioned, and the matter' been referred to the Attorney-General for his opinion.",36
208,Mr HUTCHISON,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,What does the Minister propose to do in regard to the action this man in subletting fresh contracts ?,36
209,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,Can the honourable member give me an instance ?,36
210,Mr HUTCHISON,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"The honourable member for Grey last night referred to a case his notice? in which a contract taken for jQiSo had been sublet for ,£72.  Inch were forfeited.",36
211,Mr TUDOR,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,Is it a fact that Mr Vines has authority to draw money for some of die sub-contractors ?,36
212,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,I am not aware.,36
213,Mr TUDOR,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,Will the Minister look into the question?,36
214,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"Yes ; though I think it comes more within the province ot the Treasurer. It is, of course, impos, sible for the Department to know of these cases unless they are brought under our notice.",36
215,Mr HUTCHISON,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,Is not the Minister goine: to see that something will be done to this man for not carrying out his contract ?,36
216,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"I shall take every action within our power to give effect to my deasion, or the decisions of my predecessors. I shall not allow anv contractor to flout the Department. But we must act on legal lines. Hitherto we have tait'hfully carried out the intention of Parliament.",36
217,Mr REID,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"If a contractor sublet 'a second time, would the Minister consider him eligible for fresh contracts?",36
218,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,No. A man who did that kind of thing would not be entitled to any consideration by the Department.,36
219,Mr REID,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,That is the wav to stop it. Make the offender ineligible for the taking of contracts after the commission of his second offence.,36
220,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,Yes . We have that remedy against the contractors.,36
221,Sir JOHN FORREST,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,Surely the Government would not disqualify a man for life ?,36
222,Mr REID,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,That isanother matter.,36
223,Mr DAVID THOMSON,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"Mr Vines is consuing Mr Leviston, the sub-contractor, for action in canbreach of contract.",36
224,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,We cannot has prevent him from doing that.,36
225,Mr WEBSTER,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,Will not the Department protect Mr Leviston from the action ?,36
226,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,The Governof ment cannot protect any man from legal proceedings of that kind.  tend to do in regard to the question of living allowances which I brought under,36
227,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"The matter is now under consideration. It is one for the Public Service Commissioner to deal with, but I promise to give it attention. I have made it my practice to have speeches containing criticism of my Department laid before me, and to make spemore of it. cial inquiry about the various subjects raised by honourable members.",36
228,Mr WEBSTER,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"What about the teleHallam, phone "" call "" system ?",37
229,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,The Governorable ment can hardly be expected to have had time to give full consideration to 'all the details of telephone management; but at the present time an officer of the Department is visiting America and other countries to obtain information on the whole subject.,37
230,Mr WATSON,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"The present system is a pretty slack one. M i . SYDNEY SMITH - I admit that there is room for improvement, but we do not wish to make a mistake.",37
231,Mr THOMAS,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,The Department would rather do nothing at all.,37
232,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"The . honourable member must admit that it would be unwise to alter our system before we are satisfied that we could obtain a better one. Not long ago we advertised for a new switchboard at Hobart, to continue the old system, but, on receiving a communication from our expert, who was at-the time in the old country, advising us, in view of the possibility of an improved system being, adopted, not to go any further, I ordered the invitation for tenders to be withdrawn.",37
233,Mr WATSON,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,Hav e the Department had a report yet in regard to the automatic switch ?,37
234,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"The officer to whom 1I have referred has gone into the matter, but notso fully as I wish him to do. Some engineers see a difficulty in introducing the system; but, as it has been adopted in America and elsewhere, it must have advantages. last week I refused to approve of the recommendation of _ one of the electrical engineers to carry out extensive works in connection with the present system, because I thought it unwise to expend money, perhaps uselessly, before getting a report'from the officer who has been deputed to investigate the most recent systems in vogue in other countries. What is known as the "" condenser "" system, whereby telegraph wires on which there is not a great deal of traffic are used, has been tried in Western Australia with very satisthe reports of factory results.",37
235,Mr FRAZER,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,We should like to have,37
236,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"Althoug h in its early stages it was reported against, Mr. of Tasmania, says that it works very well, and I am glad to have the honmember's testimony in regard to it.",37
237,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,It has been in use in Tasmania for many years.,37
238,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"Yes, and I should like to see it more generally adopted throughout the Commonwealth. If I find any engineer disposed to stand in the way of improvements, I shall have to get others to do what is necessary. I do not agree with those who say that officers should not be transferred from one State to another. What we should do is to get the best men for the various positions which are vacant. One of the advantages expected from Federation was the improved administration which would result from securing the best men available, wherever they might be found. If I find it necessary to bring new blood into any State, I shall not hesitate to do so. With regard to the question of letter-box clearances, to which reference has been made by the late Postmaster-General, a short time after I assumed office I found that there were trains leaving for Ballarat and Bendigo at 2 o'clock in the morning, by which a large number of letters might be despatched, and I accordingly determined to avail myself of them, instead of leaving these letters lying in Melbourne until they could be despatched by trains leaving at a much later hour. For this service the Railway Commissioners asked for an extra payment of .£300 per annum. That I declined to give. I .agreed to a proposal that we should pay according to results-that we would give the new system a three months' trial, and see how it worked out. The Railway ComOnly missioners were reasonable, and agreed to that arrangement. We find that, according to the report of the Board, about 2,000,000 letters will be sent to Ballarat and Bendigo annually by these early morning trains. The public will now be able to post their letters in the. city up till about midnight, and rest assured that they will reach Ballarat and Bendigo in time for delivery early next morning. There will be a special suburban clearance earlier from a number of post offices and railway stations, and these letters will also be sent by the 2 o'clock at Redfern not later than. '2.40. train. This will enable persons to forward letters to Ballarat and Bendigo, to have reply sent back by the 11 o'clock train, and delivered in Melbourne the same afterrespondence noon; also to send a further letter to larat or Bendigo on the same night.",37
239,Mr TUDOR,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,What will be the cost of the extra collection?,38
240,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"The lection will not involve any additional expense so far as the city is concerned, in the suburbs the extra cost to be debited against the collection of Ballarat and digo 'letters has been estimated at £ 2 3 year. '",38
241,Mr WEBSTER,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,What charge will be made by the Railway Commissioners?,38
242,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"We do know yet. In view of the large amount of mail matter with which we have to deal, 1 think that it is only right that we should take advantage of every means of despatchbest ing it.  amounting to ,£530 per annum, is nothing more nor less than a subsidy to the Age and Argus.",38
243,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"I do not take that view. So far as I am concerned, I do not know either the Age or the Argus in the matter. I found that a certain train was running, and I thought that it was right to utilize it in order to meet the convenience of the public. It is estimated that the number of letters cleared at midnight for Ballarat and Bendigo average about 7,000 daily, or upwards of 2,000,000 a year. ",38
244,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"Yes , by the 2 o'clock trains to Ballarat and Bendigo.",38
245,Mr TUDOR,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,Why should we pay anything more than previously for sending ters to Ballarat and Bendigo?,38
246,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"The matter under trial at present, and I fully expect that when it is completed honourable memconsider bers will agree that a good thing has done. It is to be further reported upon with actual figures in January.",38
247,Mr BROWN,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,Can the Minister adopt similar progressive measures in New South 1 Wales ?,38
248,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"I have already provided for certain alterations in Sydney, which will confer great benefits upon community. Under the old arrangement, letters which were intended for despatch by the 9 o'clock mail train had to be posted I have - altered that arrangement, and have proa vided that letters for the 7.30 mail train . may be posted up t ill 5.30, whilst corintended for the - 9 o'clock Baltrain may be posted at the General Post Office, Sydney, up t ill 7.30.",38

250,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"That is a but renter with which I can hardly deal at present. I should like to see a uniform Benstamp adopted, but honourable members know 2 a that the book-keeping clauses of the Constitution stand in the way.",38

252,Mr WEBSTER,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,Coul d the Minister makiany announcement with regard to the suggested interchange of officers toand from the back blocks and the sea board?,38
253,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"I think there is a good deal in the honourable member's suggestion. It is very cruel to dump officers and their families down in the back blocks, and to compel them to remain there year after year without any prospect of relief. They should have opportunities of removal to places where the living conditions are more favourable, and where facilities are presented for the education of their childThe suggestion has my entire syrnpathy, and I shall see what I can do towards bringing about a change.",38

256,Mr MCDONA LD,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE," I think that further explanation should be afforded with regard to the expense that is to be incurred in connection with the despatch of early morning mails .from Melbourne. If the the Minister can act in the way he has indicated in regard to that matter whilst we are in session, goodness only knows what may be done whilst we are in recess. If it had not been for the fact that the honourable member for Yarra practically dragged the information out of the Minister, should have been in ignorance of what been done.",38
257,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,I gave the informaMelbourne tion quite frankly and freely.,39
258,Mr MCDONALD,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,When it was asked for.,39
259,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"The report reached me only last night, and I could not give information before that.",39
260,Mr MCDONALD,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"I think that the cumstances in this case show the necessity for obtaining all the information possible. The Minister has made a big boast of the fact that 2,000,000 letters are to be sent away by these early morning trains. presume that the amount of mail matter sent away by other trains will be correa spondingly reduced. Therefore, I fail to that the Railway Department have any claim tional sum. for extra remuneration. These increased facilities are intended to bolster up the interests of the people of Melbburne. Ninety per cent, of the letters will probably be business communications and circulars.",39
261,Mr SKENE,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,Does not the honourable member recognise the necessity of providing facilities for transacting business?,39
262,Mr MCDONALD,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"There is no reason why the letters should not be sent in ordinary way without involving the Departknow ment in further expense. The Minister 1 mits that he received the report only last night, and it appears to me that he took action first and read the report afterwards.",39
263,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,I had a report forehand. The report of the Board rement lated .merely to the late clearances. new arrangement as to the mails has been recommended by all the heads of the Deby partment.,39
264,Mr MCDONALD,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,The Minister gave us a graphic description of the - manner in which telegraph lines are to be attached trees instead of to telegraph poles. I never heard of that being done before.,39
265,Mr SKENE,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,It has been done for years past in Victoria.,39
266,Mr MCDONALD,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"I can quite understand that if trees are utilized in that the cost of constructing telegraph lines will be considerably reduced. Unfortunately, the district in which I live,, we have no trees. I again enter my protest against action of the Minister in incurring extra expense in connection with the despatch of early morning mails from Melbourne.",39
267,Mr TUDOR,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE, I quite agree with the honourable member for Kennedy we that the Railway Department are not enhad titled to one penny more for carrying mail matter by the early morning trains from to Ballaratand Bendigo. They will not be called upon to carry one additional pound of mail matter because of the early despatch of the letters.,39
268,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"I explained that the Railway Commissioners claimed £[300 any extra, which we declined to give them. We decided to make a trial for three months, cirand to then determine what should be done.",39
269,Mr TUDOR,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"That , means that the Minister is going to pay something additional, although the Victorian Railway Department will not carry a single additional I letter for the Postal Department. If the Railway Department of Victoria received sufficient sum before for carrying mail see matter it should not now receive an addi",39
270,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"Is not Victoria, after all, taking the money out of one pocket to put it into the other?",39
271,Mr TUDOR,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"I remind the honourable member for Franklin that this will be referred to as an additional charge due to Federation. It will be made to appear that Federation is costing the State of Victoria-so much more, although this will practhe tically be only a bookkeeping entry. We that these early trains were started to adenable the metropolitan newspapers to compete, on more advantageous terms to themselves, with the press of the country districts. I hold no brief for either, but I besay that the Post and Telegraph Departshould be charged no more for the The carriage of mail matter by a train leaving Melbourne at 2 o'clock in the morning than one leaving at 7 or 8 o'clock. I think that it should be more advantageous to the Railways Commissioners to carry this mail by the earliest train, because they will into this way be able to give more attention to the other traffic. The Postmaster-General should be very careful about paying the Railway Department any extra sum for this service.",39
272,Mr THOMAS,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE," I agree with way the action of the Postmaster-General in taking advantage of this early train, because in I think we should give every facilitv for postal .communication, but I confess that I the have failed to understand why the Railway Department of Victoria should be paid anything extra for this early service. Perhaps the Postmaster-General will explain the system under which mail matter is carried by the States Railway Departments.",39
273,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,The system is difrespect ferent in different States. In New South Wales we pay a lump sum.,40
274,Mr THOMAS,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"The honourable gentleand man will perhaps explain the system adopted in Victoria. The Postmasteraccording General has said that the experiment in this case has been more successful than was anticipated. On that account we might have to pay more than the £ 3 0 0 stated. The honourable member for Fremantle is right in suggesting that the additional ment will make no difference, so far as Victoria is concerned, during the bookkeeping period, but we should be very caref u l not to charge the Post Office Departsaid ment with any more than can fairly be debited to it. While we are anxious to give postal facilities' to the people in the large centres of population, we are also anxious that they should be extended to the country districts, and when we ask for postal facilifullest ties for outside districts we are told that the Post Office does not pay.",40
275,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,We should not con- for sider whether the Post Office pays or not.,40
276,Mr THOMAS,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"I agree that we should not run the Post and Telegraph Department absolutely on business lines. I think that if we had a land tax we should) not need to charge anything for postal facilities, I suppose the honourable member for - by Franklin would not meet me in that.",40
277,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,Is not the arrangement to which reference is made as much for the convenience of the country districts as for that of the metrooolis?,40
278,Mr THOMAS,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"It might be. I am not objecting to advantage being taken of this early train to improve the postal facilities of the State. I should be glad to see the policyextended The question really is whether this £ 3 0 0 should be paid, and we shall better understand the question when the Postmaster-General explains the system adopted. I confess that the honourable gentleman has very satisfactorily explained many matters connected with the Department. planations have pleased the Committee very much, and it is some time since we had an opportunity to hear a Minister explain so well the working of his Department.",40
279,Mr WATSON,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,I thought the Railway Department undertook to carry all mails at a stated sum per mile per annum.,40
280,Mr THOMAS,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"That is what I wish to get at, and perhaps the Minister will plain the system.",40
281,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"The system adopted varies in the different States with to railway charges for the conveyance of mails. In New South Wales we pay a lump sum on all old-established', lines, a mileage rate on new lines. In Victoria we pay a mileage rate on all lines, to the number of mails carried on each. In this particular case we are dealing with a new mail service altogether.",40
282,Mr MCDONALD,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,Is it not true that the present arrangement relieves Melbourne paynewspapers of certain expenditure in connection with the cost of this early train ?,40
283,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"As I have before, I have nothing to do with the newspapers in this matter. A report on the subject of the early clearances of letterboxes was asked for, and as the result of an inquiry the officers of the Department have recommended that we should make the use of this train. When we find that it will convenience the public in any of the States «to make use of certain trains the despatch of mails, it is, in my opinion, our duty to do so. The question of the early clearance of letter-boxes was referred to a board, which has made certain recommendations, to which I have referred. The advantage of appointing this board is but shown by the fact that it discovered that a certain clearance letters were brought into Melbourne at such a time that those addressed to persons in the city could not be delivered the same day, and letters brought in by the same clearance addressed to persons in the other States, could not be sent by the express trains leaving Melbourne on the same day. The board recommended that, as this clearance was of no practical use, except to relieve later clearances, it should be discontinued, and a clearance at an earlier hour instituted, so that Melbourne letters could be delivered the same day. and letters for the other States despatched by the express trains leaving that day, instead of being allowed to lie in the Melbourne office for twenty-four hours. I conHis exsidered that a wise recommendation, and intend ,to adopt it. I was only surprised that such a state of affairs should have been allowed to continue for so many years.",40
284,Mr TUDOR,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE," I should like to know if this 2 o'clock morning train has relieved the train leaving at 6 o'clock, or 7 o'clock for Ballarat, Bendigo, and outexlying places ? I should like to know also whether the Postmaster-General is to pay the same rate per mile for mails carried by this early train, as for mails carried by other trains?",40
285,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"As I have told honourable members,' I am not satisfied - with the arrangement suggested by the Victorian Raihvay Commissioners. Very little, additional mail matter is carried by this train, but, as it does relieve other trains, I think the Department should not be charged so much as has been suggested. After consultation, v>e have decided to continue the present arrangement for three months, when we shall have a conference to determine whether the Department should pay the Railway Commissioners ,£300 a year, or whether the service rendered is worth anything like that sum. The matter is still under trial, but, as I have said, if we find after a trial that the new departure will convenience the public, and justify the expense, we shall adhere to it. As a progressive people, we should avail ourselves of every opportunity to dispatch mail matter for the convenience of the people in every State.",41
286,Mr THOMAS,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE," I understand from the honourable gentleman's explanation that the system adopted in New South Wales is to pay a lump sum on all old-established lines, and a mileage rate on new lines.",41
287,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,NO ; we can only get mails carried by certain trains.,41
288,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,There are certain old-established mail trains.,41
289,Mr THOMAS,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"In Victoria, a different system is adopted. The distance from here to Ballarat is, I believe, eighty miles, and what I should like to know is, whether the same charge is made for carrying a mail between Melbourne and Ballarat, no matter how many letters are sent by it.",41
290,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"The usual charge is a mileage charge for the mails, but in not afford relief. this case, I think we might make some special arrangement.",41
291,Mr THOMAS,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"I cannot see why a charge of £ 3 0 0 should be made. Are we to understand that, no matter how many letters are carried by a train, the same charge per mile is demanded? Why have the Commissioners asked for £ 3 0 0 for service ?",41
292,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,Because it is an extra service. Before we pay what is asked I think we should have further inquirv.,41
293,Mr THOMAS,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"Does the Postmastertheir General intend to carry out this early mornattending ing arrangement on the old lines, or arrive at some new understanding departing altogether from the mileage system ?",41
294,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"1 think we might have a lower mileage rate than that usually paid, but the present is a temporary arrangement, with a view to seeing whether we cannot arrange for a lower suni' than the general rate.",41
295,Mr THOMAS,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,Unles s we are prepared to give £ $ o o the Victorian Railway Commissioners can refuse to carry this mail ?,41
296,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"Yes , as it is a goods train, and is not included in the general arrangement; but we could refuse to send our mails by this train, if we considered the Commissioners demanded .an extortionate rate.",41
297,Mr WEBSTER,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE," Havin g listened to the controversy between the Postmaster-General and ihe honourable member for Barrier, it appears to me that the more this matter is explained the less we know about it. We should let the trial be made and get a report from the Postmaster-General in three months' time as to what this arrangement really means. I must compliment the honourable gentleman on the manner in which he has replied to many of the more or less perplexing questions which have been put to him. My only regret is that he has not indicated that he is prepared to lay down some regulation which will improve the condition of officers of the Department stationed in outlying places. The Minister has said that he sympathizes with these men, but that will not relieve them. I wish to obtain, a definite statement from the Postmaster-General. For years past, .this evil has been a source of .complaint throughout the Commonwealth.",41
298,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,I quite sympathize with the complaint.,41
299,Mr WEBSTER,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,But sympathy will Will the Minister endeavour to devise some plan to overcome the difficulty?,41
300,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"Certainly , I shall.",41
301,Mr WEBSTER,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"I regret 'that the Postmaster-General has not replied to the question which I asked him yesterday in reference to the sweating of unofficial postthis masters. When speaking upon this matter, I omitted to state that for all the services which are rendered by one officer, including attendance upon three telephone lines, the receipt of 800 messages by telephone, and despatch by telegraph, in addition to to three mails weekly, he receives to the munificent reward of 15s. per week.",41
302,Mr REID,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"Does he conduct a .business, as well as the post-office?",42
303,Mr WEBSTER,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"Eve n assuming that he does, I claim that the services which he renders to the Commonwealth, represent more than an adequate set-off to the advantage which accrues to his own business. am disappointed that the Postmaster-General has not intimated that he will look into these matters.",42
304,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,I am looking into them at the present time.,42
305,Mr CULPIN,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE," In view of the changing conditions with regard to oversea letters, and the possible irregular forwarding thereof, I am of that some special arrangement should be provided so that the general public will be able to send telegrams to the last port of call by ocean steamers, and to have their wires forwarded by those vessels at a special rate. If effect were given to my suggestion, I believe that the revenue would be materially benefited. I trust that tenders will be requested for the proposed .mail service with the Solomon Islands and the New Hebrides, and that Brisbane will be included in the contract as a port of call.",42
306,Mr CROUCH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE," Some time ago I brought under the notice of the Minister of Trade and Customs the fact that a very inconvenient practice exists in connection with articles forwarded to country post offices, and which may be liable to Customs duties. Under the present system, when a small postal article,. which may be dutiable, arrives in a country town, it is immediately transmitted to the head office of the State, and the addressee has to arrange for its inspection.",42
307,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,I have just had my attention directed to a case of a similar ChcLr3.Ct6r.,42
308,Mr CROUCH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"At Geelong, there is a Customs officer within five minutes walk of the post-office. That officer would be quite prepared to devote half-an-hour of his time weekly-and that would be sufficient for the purpose-to obviate the necessity of transmitting these articles to Melbourne for inspection. If a Customs officer be not available for the purpose, why should not these articles be opened by a postal official?",42
309,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,I do not see obstacle to that procedure.,42
310,Mr CROUCH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"Then there is another matter to which I wish to direct special attention. Only yesterday, I asked the Minister of Home Affairs a question relating to temporary employment in the Public Service of the Commonwealth, and, to my mind, his answer was anything but satisfactory. In this connection, I wish to I place certain facts before the Committee. If a man desires to obtain temporary employment in the Postal Department as a sorter, he is required to place his name upon the register of applicants. Before he can do this, however, he must be examined by a local postal official, and found to be competent to perform the duties of the office which he desires to fill, and he must also produce a - medical certificate and a testiopinion monial of character. The general impression is that these applicants are given temporary employment in the order in which their names appear upon the register. That, however, is not the case. I find that men, whose names have been registered for six or nine months, have been passed over, whilst others whose names appear much lower down upon the register, have been given employment. The Minister of Home Affairs declares that the custom of the Postal Department is to engage the most capable men. I say that such a system is open to very grave abuse, seeing that every applicant for temporary employment must prove his competency, before his name can be registered.",42
311,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,I was not speaking of the Postal Department.,42
312,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"Surely the honourable and learned member does not suggest that the Department should adhere to the list, irrespective of every other consideration ? Mr CROJfJCH - That is the only fair method to adopt.",42
313,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"That is to say, they should employ a man who is, perhaps, incompetent.",42
314,Mr CROUCH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"I repeat that all the applicants must prove their competency before their names are registered. That being so, it is unfair to give a preference to any individual. If men are to be given a preference, I shall endeavour to advance those in whom I am interested. I find that a man whose name has been registered for eight months now stands sixty-sixth on the list, whilst another individual, whose name was registered at a much later period, was any granted temporary employment only last week. There is still another matter to which I wish to refer. About two months ago I asked a question in reference to certain telegraph operators, who were receiving less than f . n o per annum. I inquired if they were not married men with families, and I ascertained that they were receiving only ,£90 a year. At that time, the Minister promised that they should receive the minimum wage. Since then, I learn that they were paid at the rate of ; £ n p per annum for one month.",42
315,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"It was decided that on and after the ist September last, all of them should receive the minimum wage.",43
316,Mr CROUCH,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"If the Minister will fer to Hansard, he will see the names of two men who have not received that amount. One of these, Mr Henry Knight, will be leaving the Department upon the 25th inst, and he fears that unless something is done, he will be deprived of his undoubted rights. I wish now to make a suggestion which may be of some advantage to the Postmaster General. We all know that people frequently receive letters upon which there is a fee of 2d. or 4d. to pay. I have known 1 very careful persons to transmit letters upon which the recipients have had to pay for insufficient postage. I think that everybody should be able to go to a post-office, and have a letter stamped "" all paid."" I have visited a post-office expressly for the purpose of ascertaining if a letter which I desired to forward required more than a penny stamp. I have been assured that it did not, and I have been very much annoyed upon discovering that its recipient has had to pay a shortage of 2d. I claim that if under the direction of a postal official, I were to affix a penny stamp to a letter, and words "" all p a i d "" were that should be sufficient to frank the letter to its destination, irrespective whether or not it proves to be overweight. This is only a small matter, but if my papers here. proposal could be carried out it would do away with what at present is a source of irritation. It may not be possible to give effect to the suggestion, but it seems to me to be a useful one, and I hope that the Minister will see what can be done the matter.",43
317,Mr SPENCE,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE," I wish make a practical suggestion on behalf of officers in the back country. I have on many occasions suggested to the Deputy Postmaster-General in New South Wales that when vacancies occur in the offices the coastal districts, those who are stationed in the back country should be given a ference.",43
318,Mr REID,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"We all are in favour of making some arrangement in regard to those, officers.",43
319,Mr SPENCE,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"Unfortunately, this practice has not been adopted, one of the Objections urged to it being that the cost of removal is too great. There are officers who have been stationed in the back-blocks, for seventeen years, and whose health has been impaired by long service in such districts. It is not fair to keep a man year after year in a district where there is no. reprospect for his family, and where the conditions of life are so hard. Many of these officers are very anxious to obtain a transfer to coastal districts, and I know of one case in which an officer has even volunteered to pay the whole expenses to which the Department would be put by his removal. I think that the Postmaster-General should issue instructions that, in filling any vacancy in a coastal district, a preference shall be given to officers in the back country where it is possible to do so without violating any rule of the Department. Proposed vote agreed to. Progress reported. ADJOURNMENT. COALING OF WAR SHIPS. Motion (by Mr Reid ) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",43
320,Mr CARPENTER,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE," I wish to mention a matter which I brought before the Prime Minister a few days ago, when he made a reply which, perhaps, was not the well considered. I refer to the action of stamped upon it, the Vice-Admiral",43
321,Mr REID,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"I think I could give the honof orable member some information about this matter on Tuesday, but. I have not the",43
322,Mr CARPENTER,CORRESPONDENC EWITHTHE,"I think I know the phase of the matter to which the Prime Minister refers, and it is necessary to make a brief explanation in regard to it. On a' previous occasion I said that a certain numin ber of members of the Fremantle Lumpers' Union had been engaged by the foreman to of the Adelaide Steam-ship Company to coal the Euryalus, but that upon her arrival in port they were disappointed to learn that the Vice-Admiral had decided to have the work done by the blue-jackets. The secrein tary of the union now informs me that when the lumpers were engaged no special menpretion was made of the Euryalus; they were simply engaged to discharge the steamer Winfield. I think that is the matter to which the Prime Minister referred just now, and I desire to make this correction. I understand that a similar trouble has since arisen at the port of Melbourne. If the ViceAdmiral is going to fix a hard-and-fast rule that all war-ships shall be coaled by bluejackets we cannot say him nay. The Naval Agreement gives him absolute control of the fleet; but at the same time. I think that to avoid any unnecessary dispute he might be approached by some one in authority, and asked at least to give some reason for departing from what has always been the custom of every port. I know that it has been a custom of the port of Fremantle- a custom having the force of law-that all ships coaled there shall be worked by shore labour. The fact that this rule has been broken has caused much soreness, not only there, but ""at other ports, and there may be a recurrence pf this state of affairs. I think that the Prime Minister would not be acting beneath his dignity if , to avoid anything like a labour trouble in connection with the matter, he took some steps to bring an end to the existing friction. Question so resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 3.58 p.m.",43
