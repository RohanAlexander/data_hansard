0,NA,Unknown,"?^ouse of iiepnsentatibrs. Tuesday, 2 June, 1008. Mr SPEAKER took the chair at 2.30 p.m., and read prayers. NA REVENUE. . Mr HUTCHISON - I desire to ask the Treasurer whether he will prepare a statement showing the adjustment of revenue between the Commonwealth and the States in the month of June of each year since the establishment of Federation. - Sir WILLI AM LYNE I think that it would be better for the honourable member to move for a return giving the information for which he asks, but I do not object to furnishing it.",14
1,Sir JOHN FORREST,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,I think that such a return has already been laid' on the table.,14
2,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"A return showing the adjustment of revenue from June last has been prepared, but I do not know whether a statement supplying all the information for which the honourable member asks has vet been compiled. Sir JOHN'FORREST - Yesterday , in reply to a question put by me, the Treasurer saidIf the Surplus Revenue Bill passes there will be oo return to the States for June; but in any case there can be only a small one, because we have'to re-adjust the whole question. I desire to ask the honourable gentleman whether it is not a fact that if the Surplus Revenue Bill were not passed this month a further sum of ,£472,000 would be returned to the States, consisting of .£222,000, which it is/proposed, under the Bill, to set aside for-old-age pensions,-and £250,000 to be set aside under (Sie same Bill for defence purposes? I should like to know whether the , Treasurer considers that .£472,000 is a' small amount? Sir WILLI AM LYNE - I do not know whether the honourable member has quoted the exact words that I used.",14
3,Sir JOHN FORREST,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,I took them from a proof copy of the Hansard report of my question - and the answer given to it by the honourable gentleman.,14
4,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"I saw the proof this morning, and found that it was not quite accurate in one or two particulars.",14
5,Sir JOHN FORREST,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,Is the ment that I have attributed to the honourable member incorrect?,15
6,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"I did not use the exact words quoted by the honourable member. I spoke of adjusting not "" the whole question,"" but the balances. I intend to submit a Bill providing for an appropriation of ,£250,000 for defence purposes. I am not quite certain whether or not that amount would be returned to the States if the Surplus Revenue Bill were not passed, but I do not think that it would. I am inclined to believe that the Bill which I intend to submit will deal with it in such a wav as to prevent its return. The right honourable member has put what was intended, no doubt, to be a catchy question.",15
7,Sir JOHN FORREST,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,Not at all.,15
8,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"The sum of ,£222,000, which it is estimated will be available for old-age pensions under the Surplus Revenue Bill, would certainly be returned to the States if that Bill were not passed. I hope and anticipate, however, that it will be passed, so that we shall have the two amounts available for the purposes mentioned. When I said yesterday that the amount to be returned in any case would not be large, I had in mind the sum of £222,000 proposed to be devoted to old-age pensions, and not the total of £472,000. As I have said, the sum of £250,000 for defence purposes will be dealt with'under a separate Bill, which I . hope will in itself be sufficient' fix it for defence purposes.  know from the Treasurer what is the total sum which has been paid over to the States, in excess of the three-fourths of. the Customs and Exciserevenue, since the establishment of the Commonwealth up to the 30th of last month?",15
9,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"I should like the honourable member to give notice of his question, because, although I have some idea of the reply, it is necessary to be quite accurate in naming the amqunt. I shall obtain the information for the honourable member tomorrow. .",15
10,Mr FISHER,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"Is it over £6,000,000?",15
11,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"I think it is,. but I desire to be quite accurate.",15
12,Mr WILSON,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"In view of the answers the .Treasurer gave just now to the honourable member for Swan, and others, I desire to know whether he does not consider it advisable, in the event of the Surplus Revenue Bill becoming law, to devote the state- whole of the £472,000 to old-age pensions, instead of allocating £250,000 for defence-for which we at present have no Bill-and £222,000 to the former purpose? p Sir William LYNE - I can only do as the law allows.",15
13,Mr KELLY,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,This is good 1,15
14,Mr MAUGER,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,Do not mind the laughter of the Opposition-it is all right!,15
15,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"Honourable members can laugh as much as they please, so far as I am concerned, because they only laugh vacantly. However, if the £250,000 is voted for the certain purpose of defence, how can it be regarded as a surplus available for old-age pensions?",15
16,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"Will the Treasurer,' when making a statement as to the revenue to be returned to the States over and above the three-fourths, indicate approximately, for the sake of accuracy, what amount of that payment would be represented by interest on the transferred properties, if those properties had been valued? I understand that the values are now practically settled; and, therefore, I desire to know what proportion of the so called surplus would be due to the Statesas interest on transferred properties.",15
17,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"The honourable member is quite mistaken if . he thinks I know what the amount is, because I do not know anything about the value. I have never had an opportunity of considering the to question of values, and the Government have not clealt with it ; therefore, it is quite impossible, at the present stage, t'o say what problematical interest-becaus e it is problematical-is due to the States. I say that the surplus is to be dealt with by this Chamber,",15
18,Mr BATCHELOR,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"I desire to know from the Treasurer whether the notices recently sent out to the sub-Treasurers is a new departure, or whether similar notices have previously been issued?",15
19,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"The practice h not a new one. The same thing has been done every June when the balances have been adjusted, at any rate during the past three or four years. The balances are paid fo the States at the end of each month according to law, until the termination of the financial year, when an adjustment is made upon the basis of the returns for that year. I know that Sir George Turner sent out a similar notice in the form of a telegram, the honourable member for South Sydney, did the same thing when he was Treasurer, and I think that the .right honourable member for Swan also did it.",15
20,Sir JOHN FORREST,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,Not at the end the year.,16
21,Sir WILIAM LYNE,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"Yes at the end of the year. I can speak positively of action of Sir George Turner and the orable member for South Sydney in connection, and I am pretty certain that right honourable member for Swan did the same thing. It was a departmental ter, that is to say, it was done by the partment.",16
22,Mr BATCHELOR,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"Was any outcry ever raised about the practice before? Sir WILLI AM LYNE - No . I quoted the telegram transmitted by Sir George "" Turner the other evening, and only last June the sum of £108,000 was' deducted from the revenue of that month to adjust the balance which had been paid to the States in excess of the three-fourths of net Customs and Excise revenue to which they are constitutionally entitled.",16
23,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"I desire to clear up the haze which seems to hover over thefiguressubmitted by In introducing the Additional Estimates, the honourable gentleman said It is estimated that this year the three-fourths returnable to the States this year will amount £S,yy3,y62, and that there will be a balance ^427,064, which must also be paid to them less the Surplus Revenue Bill is passed, in which case we can appropriate the money to our of own purposes. I desire to ask the Treasurer whether-i the' Surplus Revenue Bill be passed, this money is appropriated to our own poses-the States will not be compelled - pay interest on the transferred properties out of their three-fourths of the net toms and Excise revenue-?",16
24,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"The honourable member has asked me a question which is difficult to answer. Probably the States will have to pay interest upon the transtion. ferred properties, but the Commonwealth has offered to take over the whole of their debts, and to pay interest upon them-t shoulder the whole burden. . When they cry out so much about this little terest, I ask why they do not hand over all their debts to us?",16
25,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"I am sorry to have to ask the Treasurer a further question with regard to the interest able on the transferred properties. honourable gentleman's last answer to a question put to him on the matter was unsatisfactory that I must ask him whether he does not recognise a very great difference between the payment of interest on State of debts, for which we may take over responsibility at our option, and the payment of interest on the valuation of transferred the properties, which is a debt due to the v honStates, and must be paid from the onethis fourth of Customs and Excise revenue the which belongs to the Commonwealth, and not out of the three-fourths which belongs matto the States ? Does the honourable gentleDeman not' recognise also that that being so, a fair statement of the surplus handed over to the States is the amount handed over above the three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue less the interest that would be payable on the transferred properties? As I understand the matter, the valuation of the transferred properties is in the hands of the Home Affairs Department, and has practically been decided. Cannot the the honourable gentleman, in the circumstances, give a rough approximation as to the amount of interest which should have been paid in respect of those properties during the years that have passed since the Treasurer. their transfer ?",16
26,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"I think it is hardly fair to expect a Minister to reply offhand to a long question containing so many to commas, as that which the honourable gentleof man has just asked. I think I should be unjustified in asking him to give notice such a question. However, I will say that at the present moment f I have no idea of what the valuand ation of the transferred - properties puramounts to. I should also say that dur""to ing the years past, in which the question of the payment of interest upon them has Cusbeen referred to, the States have been receiving from the Commonwealth an immense sum of money in excess of the threeit fourths of Customs and Excise revenue to which they are entitled under the ConstituI was asked a question on the subject today, and I believe that the amount thus paid to the States in excess is someo thing like £6,000,000, or mors. Surely there should be some consideration given to bit of in that aspect of the question.",16
27,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,Certainly .,16
28,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"At the present moment I can give the honourable member no further information, but I shaM see paywhat I can gather on the subject when I The get the balances before me.  so question asked by the honourable member for North Sydney, I wish to ask the Treasurer without notice, whether, apart from transfer of States debts generally, it a fair proposition that the Commonwealth should take over sufficient of the debts the States to cover the value of the ferred properties used by the Commonwealth ?",16
29,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"In the first place, I think that it is very dangerous answer thesequestions without notice. A saidConference has been held at which these matters have been discussed, and in answerwhether ing ' a question of the kind impromptu, it ment, is possible that, believing the information I was giving to be correct, I might say something which would not be accurate. the circumstances I think that the honorpassed able member had better ask me his queswith this tion quietly, and by notice. Mr Reid. - I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether any intimation has we been made' to him by any of the of revenue States Premiers suggesting a further Conference of the ' Premiers with representatives of the Commonwealth Governthat ment, in order to make a further endeavour to settle these vexed questions date? I - have seen a reference to something of the kind in the press, and that is my reason for putting the question.",17
30,Mr DEAKIN,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,The last Conference has closed with a general understanding that ing the consideration of the matters referred to would require to be resumed about the commencement of the next calendar year.,17
31,Mr REID,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,In 1909?,17
32,Mr DEAKIN,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"Yes . The right honorThat able gentleman will remember that Premier of Queensland, whose presence is considered essential, is not expected to remiers turn to the Commonwealth much before that date, and, besides, the States Parliaments expect to be in session in the meantime. I said, might take advantage of this allusion to been the Conference to answer finally and for any mistake. exactly a question which the right honourable member for Swan put last Friday? so. . By courtesy of the Secretary to the late Premiers' Conference, I have obtained copy of the actual reply' I made to the question put to me with reference to Surplus Revenue Bill by the Premier of concerting. Tasmania.",17
33,Sir JOHN FORREST,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,Did I ask a quescome tionabout that ?,17
34,Mr DEAKIN,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"Yes . The right honbetter orable member, last night, called attention ally. to the second part of my reply to a previous question he had put. In my reply the to the right honourable gentleman, last is not night, I alluded to this statement. Sir JOHN FORREST. ' - My question reof ferred to something which the honourable transgentleman had said the evening before.",17
35,Mr DEAKIN,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"Yes . This statement will make that quite clear. I quote from the official report of proceedings just at to the close of the Conference. Mr Evans Before we disband we would like to know it is the intention of the Federal Governi f the Surplus Revenue Bill is passed into law, to bring it into opeiation from the beginning of the present financial year?",17
36,Mr DEAKIN,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,It will come into operation at In the earliest date we can arrange.,17
37,Mr EVANS,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"But suppose the measure is within the next few weeks, would it deal year's revenue ?",17
38,Mr DEAKIN,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"Yes , it would operate this year.",17
39,Mr EVANS,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,That is a proposal against which should enter a respectful protest. The Treasurer of Tasmania has made his estimate and expenditure on the understanding that Tasmania will be treated as hitherto.,17
40,Mr DEAKIN,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"I am perfectly safe in ""saying not one of you reckoned on receiving as much revenue as you have received this year.",17
41,Mr EVANS,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,All the States reckoned on a at an early large increase.,17
42,Mr WADE,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"It would mean that If the Bill becomes law at the end of June next, you would call on the various States to make a restitution.",17
43,Mr DEAKIN,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"No . It would affect whatever not been handed over. The process of askfor anything back would be unnecessary, if not unproductive.",17
44,Mr EVANS,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,Then you were in error in replying to my question; for you said it would be retrospective.,17
45,Mr DEAKIN,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"No ; I thought you spoke of the financial year as something, closed. shows the particular statement. I made the in reply to the question asked.",17
46,Sir JOHN FORREST,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,The States Prewent away with another impression.,17
47,Mr FISHER,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,Poo r things 1,17
48,Mr DEAKIN,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"They could not. I "" It would affect whatever has not handed over."" There was no room",17
49,Sir JOHN FORREST,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,They did not think .,17
50,Mr SPEAKER,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"The Prime Minister a will allow me. These constant comments on both questions and answers by the right the honourable member for Swan are most disI f every honourable member pursued a similar course our business would to an absolute standstill. I ask ""the right honourable member for Swan to set a example to honourable members gener",17
51,Sir JOHN FORREST,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,I should like to make a personal explanation. I wish to say that what I intended to state-irregu larly it seems-wa s that the Prime Minister allowed the Premiers of the States to go away with the impression that the Surplus Revenue Bill was not to interfere with the three-fourths that was to be paid to the States befween then and the end of the year.,17
52,Mr DEAKIN,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,No .,18
53,Sir JOHN FORREST,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"I do not mean to say for a moment that the Prime Minister intended to convey that impression. I am, quite sure that he did not. He would not be capable of doing such a thing. But that impression was conveyed to the Premiers; and in the same way I and other honourable members went away from the House on Friday afternoon under the same impression. When I came to look closely into the Prime Minister's words, of course, I saw that they were capable of two meanings.",18
54,Mr REID,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,They generally are.,18
55,Sir JOHN FORREST,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,That is the reason why I complained of the ambiguity of the Prime Minister's remarks. He knows that I would not' charge him with doing such a thing deliberately; but still his words were capable of two constructions ; and in both instances constructions were placed upon them that he did not intend.,18
56,Mr DEAKIN,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"I do not see that the words used by me at the Conference of the Premiers are capable of any misconstruction. The only misconstruction possible in regard to the remarks I made in replv to the right' honourable member for Swan, on Friday afternoon, arose because I spoke, first of certain things done in this House, and then referred to the Premiers' Conference. The right honourable member for Swan might have understood me when speaking of the Premiers' Conference to be still referring to statements in this House, though even then the point itself was plain.",18
57,Mr REID,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"In reference to the"" Prime Minister's answer to the right honourable member for Swan, I desire to ask him whether the following Hansard report of his statement, made yesterday, is correct. I will read the passage to which I refer. The Premiers had inquired whether, under proposed Surplus Revenue Bill , we intended require them to pay back to the Commonwealth all that they had received over and above three-fourths to which they were the Constitution; and I had answered them distinctly that no such visionary attempt was in my mind. I said that .when the Surplus Revenue Bill came on for discussion it would be found that the surpluses with which it proposed to deal were those which had not yet been paid to the States. Is that correct?",18
58,Mr DEAKIN,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"I can best answer the right honourable member by reading again a passage from the report of the Premiers' Conference, in which my views on that subject are reported.",18
59,Mr WADE,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"It would mean that if the Bill becomes law at the end of June next, you would call on the various States to make a restitution. That is the paying back to the States to which I alluded.",18
60,Mr DEAKIN,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"No . It would affect whatever has not been handed over/ The process of asking for anything back would be unnecessary, if not unproductive.",18
61,Sir JOHN FORREST,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether at the end of June the money withheld during J une will, not be handed over to the States? What I mean is, that at the end of June the financial year will have closed, and the accounts will have been concluded; and, therefore, that the answer of the Prime Minister, to which reference has been made, bears the construction put upon it by the Premiers that there was no",18
62,Mr SPEAKER,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,The right honourable .member is debating the question.,18
63,Sir JOHN FORREST,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"I merely wish to ask a question, and to show that the statement of the Prime Minister was not understood by the Premiers to mean that there would be no return for this month at all, seeing that the year's accounts would be closed at the end of June.",18
64,Mr DEAKIN,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,I am sorry that I have to again read a sentence or two from tjhe report of the Premiers' Conference.,18
65,Mr EVANS,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"But suppose the measure is passed within the next few weeks, would it deal with this year's revenue?",18
66,Mr DEAKIN,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,Yes . It would operate this year.,18
67,Sir JOHN FORKEST,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,That is not the reply given to Mr Wade immediately afterwards.,18
68,Mr ATKINSON,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"Following up a question which I asked a little while ago, I desire to ask the Prime Minister-assum ing that the Surplus Revenue Bill were the passed at once, and that' £70,000 were to the amount returnable to Western Austhe tralia, in June-ho w much would actually entitled under be handed back?",18
69,Mr DEAKIN,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,I do not feel able to as that make a calculation off hand.,18
70,Mr ATKINSON,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"Roughly , I mean.",18
71,Mr REID,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"I should like to recall to the attention of the Prime Minister the question which I asked him, and which he has hot yet answered.",19
72,Mr DEAKIN,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,I think I have.,19
73,Mr REID,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"May I ask the Prime Minister, again-referrin g not to any statement at the Premiers' Conference; but fo his remarks in this House yesterday afternoon-whethe r the remarks reported in the Hansard proof are correct. That is what I ask.",19
74,Mr DEAKIN,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,I said that! they were correct. - Mr Reid - The remarks to which I direct attention areI said that when the Surplus Revenue. Bill came on for discussion it would be found that the surpluses with which it proposed to deal were those which had not vet been paid to the States. .Is that correct?,19
75,Mr DEAKIN,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"Yes ; whatever has not been handed over may be retained by us. TARIFF. . Mr KELLY - I wish to ask the Treasurer whether he is correctly reported in the press as having expressed great dissatisfaction with the Tariff as passed by the House, and as having stated that he proposes to re-open the Tariff question.",19
76,Mr MATHEWS,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"He should have said so, even if he did not.",19
77,Mr KELLY,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"Further , is the honourable gentleman correctly reported as having expressed.the determination to go on pressing forward the fiscal question until a truly Protectionist Tariff is passed? Does he propose to take independent action, if his party will not support him, at the next general election, to try to secure popular support for his high Tariff views ""? ",19
78,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"I am absolutely dissatisfied with a large number of items as passed, as a consequence of the attitude of certain honourable members who were returned as Protectionists, and I do intend to try to have those items rectified. There is no doubt as to what my intention in that regard is.",19
79,Sir JOHN FORREST,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,Is the honourable member expressing the view of. the Government ? _ Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I am not going to answer that question; but I certainly know what my own intention is. I am going to bring up to the bull-ring some of those honourable members who secured their return under false pretences.,19
80,Mr KELLY,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether he shares the dissatisfaction of the Treasurer with the Tariff which has just been passed, and whether he proposes to join the honourable gentleman in raising the Tariff issue at the next general election ?",19
81,Mr DEAKIN,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,In that matter the governing consideration must be the needs and industries pf Australia. When these demand ah alteration of the Tariff we shall be prepared to undertake it. IRON INDUSTRY.,19
82,Mr CARR,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"I wish to ask the Treasurer whether, in view .of the position of the Australian iron industry as revealed by an interview with Mr Hoskins, published in yesterday's issue of the Argus, which ""shows that £90,000 has been expended on a blast furnace at the Lithgow works, that the present output of pig iron is about 800 tons, per week, most of which, for want of a market, is being stacked, and that about 1,500 hands are employed",19
83,Mr SPEAKER,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,Is the honourable member stating facts or asking a question ?,19
84,Mr CARR,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"I am stating facts. I should not be likely, sir, to base my question on anything save facts.",19
85,Mr SPEAKER,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"I .would remind the honourable member that the Standing Orders expressly prohibit, in the putting of a question, any statement of facts which is unnecessary to explain that question. .. Mr CARR - I merely wished to explain that it is desirable, in view of the position of the industry, that something should be done to assist it, and to ask the Treasurer whether the Government are prepared to grant that assistance by way of a bounty or a protective duty?",19
86,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"I think that it was understood that the Manufactures Encouragement Bill was so closely allied with the Tariff that the two, measures would practically be dealt with simultaneously. I have made that statement on more than one occasion; but whether it is possible to deal with the Manufactures Encouragement Bill this session I cannot at present say. I shall certainly make inquiries, and if I can obtain the support of honourable members for a proposal to deal with it this session, I shall do so.",19
87,Mr BOWDEN,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"In view of the statement of the Treasurer, in reply to a question put by the honourable member for Macquarie, that as the Tariff was out of the way he would, if possible, before the close of. the session, Bring forward the Manufactures Encouragement Bill , will the Prime Minister see that an opportunity is given for the consideration of that measure before the session terminates?",19
88,Mr DEAKIN,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"If I find that there is a reasonable prospect of passing it in the time at our disposal, I shall be most happy to do so.",20
89,Mr CHANTER,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether he is aware that the head of the New South Wales Government has slated that there is no necessity for Federal interference in the matter of the Lithgow ironworks, because of the action that has been taken by that State?",20
90,Mr DEAKIN,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"I do not remember the exa'ct terms of the statement of the Premier of New South Wales, but this House will judge for itself what it conceives to beits duty irrespective of any outside opinions. DIFFERENTIALTREATMENT OF sion is likely to close? SHIPPING.",20
91,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"I desire confidently to ask the Treasurer, in the absence of the Prime Minister, if he has observed in the press a statement that, in Victoria, there is differential treatment in regard pilotage rates and exemptions, and also in regard to the hour's of departure from the port. What I desire to know is whether' sion? steamers which are registered in Victoria have certain privileges as to rates of pilotto age and exemptions, and as to the hours departure, not granted to vessels in other States. Does the Minister recognise that, if there is such differentiation, it is an infringement of the equality of trade guaranteed by the Constitution? If Commonwealth legislation which could deal with such matters is not ready to introduced, will the Treasurer ascertain whether the State Government will susthe pend the operation of these unequal reguwithholding lations in the meantime? Perhaps Minister of Trade and Customs may know something of the subject^ but I wished fund ? to address mv question to the Prime Minister, as head of tihe Government.",20
92,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"The Prime Minister is out of the chamber for a few moments, but I may say that I think is a matter with which the Customs Departintend ment deals, to an extent, in conjunction with the State Minister. I had noticed the newspaper announcement referred to and if the position disclosed is correct, seems to me very anomalous. This is a Government. question which would very properly come within the cognisance of an Inter-State Commission. Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - Cannot the matter be dealt with in' a Bill ?",20
93,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"I believe it can be dealt with, and, without giving any positive answer, I can promise to bring the matter under the notice of the head of the Government. _ Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - Will the Minister, endeavour to induce the State Government to suspend these regulations?",20
94,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"I shall inform the Prime Minister of the question which has been asked, and no doubt he will attend to the matter. ' CLOSE OF THE SESSION.",20
95,Mr BAMFORD,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,I desire to ask the. Prime Minister whether he can give the. House any indication as to when the ses,20
96,Mr DEAKIN,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"I think that we may expect that it will close early next week, and, if we put our shoulders to the wheel, it may possibly close this week'.",20
97,Mr HUTCHISON,PAYMEN T TO STATE S OF SURPLUS,"Will the Prime to Minister ask the House to meet in the mornings, and to sit a little later than usual, in order to expedite the close of the ses",20

160,Mr FRAZ ER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Kalgoorlie) [3.31] This afternoon I find myself in the position of being prepared to speak in support of a Government measure. During the last few days I have been surprised at the great amount of attention which has been given to the opinions expressed by some of the States Premiers regarding this Bill . I do not know that the attitude of some honourable members here does not amount almost to a consideration of the States interest instead of the Commonwealth interest.' I recognise, of course, that the States possess certain powers. But I also recognise that in this House a minority are making it particularly apparent that they are prepared to give the States more than .was intended to be given to them by the words of ' the Constitution. I find myself in entire disagreement with the view of the honourable member for Swan concerning this Bill .",26
161,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The member does not belong to any State. . Mr Frazer - I am very glad to be able to say that in this House I have given to the Commonwealth the first consideration, and done an injury to no particular State. It does appear to me that the attitude of the right honourable gentleman is entirely inconsistent. I h the Federal Convention he said : "" I am going to stand up for a States House,"" and was a great pleader for the rights of the States as represented in a Senate - I can understand a man holding that particular view, and believing in the State getting every consideration that is granted to it in the Constitution. But when a Senate's request for the BILL. amendment of Tariff items was submitted here a second time recently, he wanted tp take away from that Chamber the very powers which he now believes that it ought to have.",26

164,Mr FRAZER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Suppos e that the Senate should reject an important provision of this Bill , or send down a suggestion' that it should be deleted. What would the right honourable gentleman do in that case?",26
165,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The Senate would then be acting within its powers. - Mr Frazer - Accordin g to the right honourable gentleman, the Senate would be acting within its powers in requesting an alteration of this Bill , but it was not acting within its powers the other day when it suggested additions in regard to another Bill.",26
166,Mr SPEAKER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"That Has nothing to "" do with the question before the Chair. .",26
167,Mr FRAZER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I bow. to your ruling, sir, but I think it is a reasonable thing for me to point out the apparent inconsistencies of an honourable member who has debated this Bill . From my point of view the'attitude of the - right honourable member for Swan is entirely inconsistent, and I do not see how, after he endeavoured to clip the wings of the States House in one case, he can claim to have any special consideration for them. I am not here for the-purpose of tying up the Commonwealth in honourable order to assist some necessitous State Treasurers, who have been consistently and continuously denouncing the Commonwealth. In my opinion,"" this is a desirable measure, and ithe objecti which it has in view is.one of the most laudable.",26
168,Mr ATKINSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,What does the honourable member consider is the object of the B i ll ?,26
169,Mr FRAZER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The Bill will provide the nucleus of a fund for the payment of old-age pensions, and for other purposes. It will be the means of ""raising the monev, and, of course, a Bill to. authorize the payment of it will follow.",26
170,Mr ATKINSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,The Treasurer never mentioned that when he' introduced the Bill .,26
171,Mr FRAZER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I was surprised that the Treasurer did not mention it . But I do not think that my honourable friend, innocent as he may appear to be, imagines that there is any other object in view.",27
172,Mr ATKINSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,I do not.,27
173,Mr FRAZER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"It appears to me that honourable members who are adopting a hostile attitude to the Bill are liable to be charged with an indifference towards the question of old-age pensions. I do not dispute the right of any honourable member to disagree with the proposed method of raising the money, but I point out that in opposing this measure honourable members leave themselves open to a charge.of callousness regarding the creation of a fund in the interests of a desirable section of the community.",27
174,Mr ATKINSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,Does the member think that we can pay old-age pensions out of this money ? ,27
175,Mr FRAZER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I 'do not think that, even by the end of this year, from this fund alone sufficient will be achieved. T am very sorry that that should be the case,/ but having regard to the composition of the House at the present time, I believe that this will be a means of getting a system of old-age pensions established very much earlier than would otherwise be the case. It is a pity that the Bill was not introduced on the 10th October, 1906, at the expiration of the bookkeeping section of the Constitution.",27
176,Mr FISHER,SURPLUS REVENUE,We were before our constituents then.,27
177,Mr FRAZER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"No, - but certainly we were proceeding in that direction. I believe that had we gone to our constituents then with a Surplus Revenue Act and an Old-age Pensions Act, there would have been less grumbling amongst a deserving class throughout-Australia than there was. Although one might reserve to himself an opinion as to whether this is the most desirable means to adopt to raise money for this desirable object, still I think that the position of those who are really entitled to pensions justifies its adoption. It appears to me that the telegram which was. recently sent by or at the instance of the Treasurer to the collectors throughout the States, was a most injudicious one, and I should not be surprised to hear that he is not of the same frame' of mind now. It gave to a. number of persons who were looking for a cue. an opportunity to denounce the Commonwealth, and possibly it has raised a considerable amount of ill feeling towards this Parliament without [419] having achieved any good results. In connection with this measure I want to see everything done squarely. According to my reading of the Constitution there is not the slightest doubt that its framers contemplated a position when the payment of certain liabilities incurred by the Commonwealth would be necessary. I do not think it is possible to imagine that fhey did not contemplate that we might have to provide for the payment of bounties in different directions. As a matter of fact, that provision had to lie made more quickly than was anticipated by some persons. We have incurred the statutory liability of between £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 and £.250,000, which is payable over a period of fifteen years. The Commonwealth would be in a most unsatisfactory position if it could not in f at honourable years make provision for liabilities likely to have to be faced in lean years.",27
178,Mr ATKINSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Canno t that be done under the Audit Act ? - Mr Frazer - I doubt it . The honourable member said last night that it would be unconstitutional to do it under this Bill , and yet he suggests that it can - be done under the Audit Act.",27
179,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,"If the trust funds alreadv established are constitutional, the Bill is unnecessary, while, if they are not, the Bill will not make them constitutional.",27
180,Mr ATKINSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,A trust fund can be established without the Bill.,27
181,Mr FRAZER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"In my opinion, the establishment of trust funds is constitutional. I do not pose as a constitutional authority, but, on the question now before the Chair, as I read the Constitution, its framers had in mind, when they drew up section 87, a state of affairs such as that which we have now reached. The right honourable member for Swan says that that section means that the Commonwealth can take of its one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue only so much as it actually spends within the year.",27
182,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,I said a little more than that..,27
183,Mr FRAZER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The right honourable gentleman madetwo long speeches, asked a string of questions, and yesterday tried to move the adjournment of the House in regard to the subject, so that naturally he must have said a good deal more. I believe that if the Bill becomes law, and its constitutionality is tested by injudicious State Treasurers, the High Court will say that we were within our powers in passing it. It may occur to some that it will be impossible for a'State possessing no surplus to Contribute under the Bill , and it may therefore be thought that the States which have surpluses - will be called upon to pay the Contributions of those which have not. That, however, is not what will happen. All new expenditure will be debited to the States per capita, absolute justice being done to all / We should hail with satisfaction the introduction of a measure to provide money to. meet a great national necessity. It is proposed to insert in the Old-age Pensions Bill a provision bringing it into effect not later than a certain date; but providing for the payment of pensions earlier under agreement with the State Treasurers.",27
184,Mr FISHER,SURPLUS REVENUE,Almos t right awav.,28
185,Mr FRAZER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Yes . Still, i ' do not suppose that such an agreement will be come to ; and in that case Parliament will have thrown on it the obligation to find the necessary money not later than July, 1909. I support the measure as a means to achieving a great end-the establishment, of a Commonwealth old-age pensions scheme.",28
186,Mr GLYNN,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Angas) [3.46] - In dealing with this measure, it should be remembered that one of the chief problems of the Convention was how to distribute among the States, after the first five years of union, the surplus revenue. The matter was debated in Adelaide, Sydney, and Melbourne, and eventually it was decided not to anticipate, by requiring a fixed appropriation, results which could not then be estimated, and to leave the matter to the good sense of the Parliament after five years' experience of a uniform Tariff - I need hardly remind those who were members of the Convention of these facts; unhappily, there are not now many members of the Convention here. Mv proposed solution of the financial difficulty was to provide for the taking over by the Commonwealth of the whole, of the debts qf the States immediately on Federation. Those who are interested in the matter will find, by referring to page 1540 of volume II . of the official report of the Melbourne session, that I proposed that the debts of the States should be pooled, after conversion, to give their true relations of value. As - the various stocks are of different duration and bear different rates of interest, they are not on the same level in the market, ancl to express their true relative values it would be necessary to convert them into terms of a common stock. To some extent, the proposals of the Government now f all into line with mine, though the conversion I speak of is not provided for. The States, on going into Federal partnership, could have pooled their debts, those having an excess over the average being responsible for the amounf of the excess, and those having less than the average being credited with - the difference. At the time of the union, the debts of the States amounted to about £150,000,000 , and the differences to be .accounted for to not more than about £16,000,000 . Thus the result would have been .to wipe out at all events the responsi-. bility to the States to an amount represented by the interest on their average indebtedness. Assuming that the average were £ 5 2 per head of the population, by taking over the debts at that stage, we should have wiped out interest equal to an indebtedness represented by that average - South Australia would have owed the Commonwealth £6,000,00 0 or £ 7 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 , as her indebtedness at. that time was over £ 7 0 per head of her population. On the other hand, Victoria, whose indebtedness was equal to only about £ 4 2 per head of her population, would Iiave been credited in the books of the Commonwealth with a difference which would have been somewhere about £ 5 , 0 0 0 , 0 00 or £ 6 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 . Unfortunately, my proposal was rejected on the ground that the Federation, within a few years of its establishment, would have acquired such a reputation in the financial world as to bring about an enormous appreciation in Commonwealth stock, and that it would be unwise to do away with the chance of obtaining-a large premium for the addition, or the substitution, of the - security of the Commonwealth to or for that of the States. That anticipation has been falsified by experience. Sir George Turner, when Treasurer, in 1903, presented a report in which he stated that the best information he could obtain from the Old Country was that a Commonwealth security would not lead to a saving in the .matter of interest. We were furnished with the same information by Mr Coghlan, Agent-General for. New South Wales, in .a report written on behalf of himself and the Agents-General of the other States - about two cr three years ago: In the cir- cumstances, nothing has been done- - That was only one of the attempts made to absorb portion of the revenue, the whole of which will be at our disposal in 1-910, but it w.as not for one moment assumed that it would dispose of the whole question. At page 1540 of the official record of the Debates at the Melbourne sittings of the Convention, I am reported as having saidThe honourable member (Mr MCMillan) urged a few days ago that by taking over the debts at the start you. did not settle the financial difficulty. I do not think that any one who proposes that the Commonwealth shall take over these debts suggests that this is a method of solving the difficulty connected with the apportionment of the surplus. That was an independent problem which this Parliament had to face if the Convention did not settle it. You cannot possibly, by taking over an equal amount of annual liability, determine the share that the several States ""will get of the surplus revenue of the Commonwealth. What you can do is to get over one difficulty. You can at all events absorb the whole of the surplus, by the transfer of the liability for a portion of the interest. En justice to the States we ought to remember that all these problems regarding the transfer of the debts and the taking over of the railways had relation to the disposal of the surplus amongst the States, or the return of the Customs revenue to the States after we had taken our share, at the end of the five years' period. It was not for one moment thought that by handing over to the Commonwealth the collection-""collection "" is the word used in the Constitution-of the Customs revenue, then estimated £6,000,000, but which .is now nearby equal to £11,000,000 per annum, we should entitle the Commonwealth, at the end of a few years, to spend the whole of that sura. I mention this in connection with the fact that within two years that problem will have to be faced by us. So much for the consideration due to the anxiety of the States, which has been stirred up, perhaps, by the declaration of the Treasurer last week, as regards the disposal of the balance for June. On the other hand, I would remind the States that the Commonwealth has taken over, and very properlv taken over, large responsibilities. In 1902, for instance, we refused to follow the example of the. States jn the. matter of borrowing. A Bill providing for a loan of £571,000 then introduced by Sir George Turner was rejected, if I remember rightly, by a majority of two to one. I happened to be the only representative of South. Australia who voted against that. Bill, and it was said that when I ' returned to that State I should be scarified for .my action. I think, however, that approval has rather followed the minority vote given on that [419]- 2 occasion on behalf of South Australia. We refused to borrow, and since then we have been providing out of - revenue large sums for various works for which the States would have made provision by borrowing - I cannot recall the exact figures, but am sure that we annually set. apart out of revenue something like £900,000 or ,£1,000,000 for works and buildings, to provide for which the States would have borrowed. Matters of this sort must be taken into consideration by the States in connection with the financial question. Then, again, the States are not doing all that was expected of them when the Constitution was passed. What have they done, may I ask, as regards the abolition of differential railway rates? In that respect, the Germans have shown us an ex- ample. The German Constitution contained a direction that there should be some uniformity of control and abolition of the differential rates' on railways as between State and State within a very short period after its adoption in 1870. That principle was declared in sections 4 and 45 of that 2 Constitution, and it has been observed. We have a similar implication in the Commonwealth Constitution, but it has not been respected by the States. I shall say no more regarding the extent to which we ougtii to consider the reasonable remonstrances of at the States in anticipation of a too large encroachment upon the surplus,. of which we shall have complete disposal in 1910. Coming to the Bill itself, I think that the principle is sound. It would be most unfortunate if , at the end of each month, no matter how overflowing the Treasury, we were compelled to unload upon the States. In such circumstances, what would be the position if we were entering upon a large undertaking, or were threatened with a war, and needed an anticipatory vote ? We could not read common sense into a Constitution providing that at the end of each month we had no power to impound, moneys as against the necessities of one or two succeeding months. It would be out of accord with all common-senseviews on finance to say that we should strike an absolute balance at the end of each month, and, however meagre might be the funds of the Commonwealth Treasury, have no power to allot any portion of the surplus revenue towards meeting the demands of the subsequent months of that year or of a succeeding year. While I consider, that the principle of the Bill is sound, I do not'think its introduction, in view of what the Treasurer has stated, is particularly opportune. The honourable member said that he intended to introduce this Bill now in order to impound moneys that have not yet been appropriated by this House, and to impound them in relation to policies that have not even been discussed. Although I am in favour of the principle of old-age pensions, I do not think that it is consistent with our duty to actually authorize the disposal of moneys for old-age pensions before a Bill affirming the principle has been passed by this House, or the method of giving effect to it determined. It is on that ground that I think that the introduction of the Bill , in view of the Government's declared policy, is inopportune. If the Ministry can assure us that they require it for some legitimate purpose of Parliament-that they require it to meet some appropriation that has been made, we ought to pass it ; but they do nothing of the sort. I think that, the onlyconsistent reading of the Constitution, so far as the question of appropriation is concerned, is that we have power, within the limits of our annual expenditure, to deduct moneys that have been appropriated although not actually spent.",28
187,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Where no contract has been entered info?Mr Glynn , - I am dealing, not with contracts, but with appropriations. history of the financial sections of the Constitution would be authoritative in a Court of justice, but I do not want to delay the House, at this stage of the session, by going into their development. I would out, however, that the words in section 87 - "" shall be applied annually by the Comtion monwealth towards its expenditure""were not in the clause as it passed the Adelaide sitting of the Convention. As it left that sitting of the Convention, clause 91 declared that the yearly expenditure Commonwealth, for the purpose of the. services and the exercise of the powers ferred by the States to the Commonwealth, should not exceed the sum of £ 1 , 2 5 0 , Honourable members will at once notice trie difference. It was declared, at the Adevided laide sittings, that the yearly expenditure was not to exceed a certain sum, but here we fal l into line with the terminology of wise provides."" the Imperial Acts, and the Acts of the States, by providing that not more than certain amount shall be applied annually towards the expenditure. In my opinion, that covers, at all events, appropriations. I picked up at random in the Library an Imperial Appropriation Act, the wording the title to which was almost identical with the wording of clause 87 of the Federal ConstitutionAn Act to apply certain sums out of the Consolidated Fund to the service of the years ending on the thirty-first day of March one thousand nine hundred and two, one'thousand nine hundred and three, one thousand ninehundred and four. That is an appropriation. It is an Act to "" apply ""-the wording of our Constitution-a n Act to appropriate certain moneys. The wording of section 94 alone gives rise to a doubt as to our power to pass this Bill. It provides thatAfter five years from the imposition of uniform duties of Customs, The Parliament may provide, on such basis as it deems fair, for the monthly payment to the several States of all surplus revenue of the Commonwealth. Surely the word "" m o n t h l y "" used'there does not destroy the power given by a preceding section - at the end of five years to alter the whole of the provisions dealing with the apportionment of the revenue, and the method of estimating the States' share of the expenditure. Section 93 provides what the system is to be for the first five years, and it. is then declared that that system is to be observed only until the Parliament otherwise provides. Those words, "" until the Parliament otherwise provides,"" The have been interpreted by the High Court as meaning really that the provisions to which they relate are to remain in force until that period, when we can alter them.",30
188,Sir PHILIP FYSH,SURPLUS REVENUE,Follo w that up with point the wording of section 94.,30
189,Mr GLYNN,SURPLUS REVENUE,"To a large extent sec94 is superfluous, and niight be struck out.",30
190,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,Oh !,30
191,Mr GLYNN,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The matter is open to two opinions, but I wish to develop' the of the argument as it appeals to me.",30
192,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Sectio n 94 is to.retransmain, in-operation for all time.",30
193,Mr GLYNN,SURPLUS REVENUE,"My contention is that, 0 0 0 . even if section 94 were struck out, we could alter the' financial' arrangements profor in the three preceding sections. Section 93 provides that they are to be enforced only "" until the Parliament otherThose words apply to various sections of the Constitution. a Section 93 provides that after the first five years the arrangement shall be as Parliament may determine; and my argu' ment is that section 94 might be struck out altogether as superfluous, and that, at theof end of the five years, we may make .any provision we think fit for the apportionment of the surplus. But section 94 was, I suppose, inserted for greater caution, though I do not think it alters the power conferred by section 93. Its introduction may raise a doubt on the point, because Courts of Justice will not regard any section as superfluous if they can give a meaning to it. Inasmuch, therefore, as we find that, without section 94, we could have the establishment of any new financial basis we. wish, we have to ask what was the intention of the Federal Convention in inserting bhat section. It may be said that it was to impose some limitation on the discretion of Parliament under the preceding clauses, and this makes our power somewhat doubtful. I think, however, it would be straining the rules of construction rather too far, to say that section 94 would prevent our'altering anything under section 93.",30
194,Sir PHILIP FYSH,SURPLUS REVENUE,But the section goes on to provide for monthly payments.,31
195,Mr GLYNN,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Surely it cannot be held that the words as to monthly payments tie the hands of Parliament, and oblige the Commonwealth, at the end of each month, in defiance of all the experience elsewhere, to pay over to the States all balances unexpended ? I do not regard that as a - common-sense reading of the Constitution.",31
196,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,"-The section means something,' I suppose 1",31
197,Mr GLYNN,SURPLUS REVENUE,All I am endeavouring to show is that the section raises a doubt.,31
198,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,Then means nothing?,31
199,Mr GLYNN,SURPLUS REVENUE,What is the pertinence b f that question? I did not read the speech of the right honourable member for Swan.,31
200,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,I did not refer to section 94.,31
201,Mr GLYNN,SURPLUS REVENUE,"At all events, I say that we have power to absorb the surplus; and I do not think that section 94, by the use of the words as to monthly payments, clearly takes away the power that would - exist without the section.",31
202,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Havin g power, where is the need for this Bill?",31
203,Mr GLYNN,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I am dealing with the power to pass the Bill . Mr D UGALD THOMSON - But ihe power, where is the need for the Bill ?",31
204,Mr GLYNN,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The power does not - exist in the Bill , but is exercised by the Hill.",31
205,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,But we have trust funds already.,31
206,Mr GLYNN,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I am not dealing with the question of trust funds, which under the Audit Act of 1906 are provided to deal with appropriations that otherwise would lapse. The existence of these trust funds only bears out my contention that our power is the power to appropriate. If we make an appropriation before the end of June, then under the trust funds provisions the appropriation does not lapse as it would have done under the earlier Act of 1901. But we are now dealing with altogether a different question. This B i ll does not' deal with trust funds, but alters - pro lanto the provisions of the financial sections ending with section 93. My argument is that, in any alteration, our hands are not tied by section 94-that is, we are not obliged t'o make such an arrangement that we must hand over the unexpended balances at the end of each month. At all events, while, admitting a doubt as to the constitutionality, I think the principle of the Bill is sound, but that the measure is - dangerous, inasmuch as we have never discussed the two principal objects, which involve the absorption of £ 4 5 0 , 0 0 0 of revenue. Indeed, the Bill in relation to one of the objects has been introduced only today; and we should not pass a measure, the clear object of which is to anticipate the passing of other measures to impound revenue. I have seen statements in the newspapers in regard to the Trea"" surplus "" surer's policy of cancelling the surpluses that have hitherto been paid to the States.",31
207,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"That has been done every year, in June.",31
208,Mr GLYNN,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I do not know to what extent the judgment in the case of the Tasmanian Government against the Commonwealth affects the Treasurer's power. That was an action to recover from Victoria £ 1 2 , 0 0 0 , which, under section 89 of the Constitution, had been appropriated; and the Court declared that the appropriation was absolute; that if , for instance, a surplus had been appropriated the under section 89 to a particular State, it could never again be touched. That judgment is reported in the first volume of the Commonwealt/i Law Reports and conhaving tains the following from the Chief JusticeThat section, if there is no more in the Constitution, gave the State of Victoria an absolute vested right to receive the money now in question, and to keep it. Mr Justice Barton, later on, expressed a similar view. I do not know that' that case throws much light on the position taken up by the Treasurer; - because, if he had paid the States the three-fourths, considering that the limitation on the Federal expenditure is annual, there may be nothing to. prevent him, if he chooses to be so exceptional in his view of what is due to the States, impounding whatever revenue may be necessary to recoup himself.",31
209,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Hear , hear; that is what has been done.",32
210,Mr GLYNN,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I think that may be done under the Constitution; and I am merely showing that there are doubts in view of the words of the judgment of the High Court in the Tasmanian case.. I do not intend to. support this Bill , because it is introduced for purposes which have not yet been sanctioned by Parliament. Had the * appropriations been made, this Bill would have been useful; and if it could be shown that the Bil l is necessary, as a matter'of urgency, we might, of course, consider the position. That, however, has not been shown by anything in the speech of the .Treasurer in introducing the measure.",32
211,Sir PHILIP FYSH,SURPLUS REVENUE,Denison) [4.14] A Bill for the appropriation of surplus revenue is of the greatest importance and interest to the financially weaker States; and hence. I was very glad to listen to the speech of the right honourable member for Swan.,32
212,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Is it much less important to the stronger States, having in view what it is proposed to do with the money ?",32
213,Sir PHILIP FYSH,SURPLUS REVENUE,"My intention is to illustrate the effect of the general financial legislation of the Commonwealth on the weaker States; and for that reason I am thankful for the speech of the right honourable member for Swan, who, recalled the duty which we owe, not only to the Commonwealth, but to the States which we represent. Regarding the Commonwealth as the parent, and the various States as the children, we ought, as far as possible, to work for the welfare of the States, for in that is involved the welfare of the Commonwealth. Let me make my meaning clearer by suggesting that the Commonwealth is desirous of inflating its own importance.",32
214,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I think that th.it charge might, with more propriety, be laid against the States.",32
215,Sir PHILIP FYSH,SURPLUS REVENUE,"We hope, as representatives of the States, to prevent the Commonwealth from inflating its own importance, though we have not succeeded so far.",32
216,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,Then the honourable member does not support the Commonwealth? A nice sort of position to take up 1,32
217,Sir PHILIP FYSH,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The Commonwealth financial legislation has laid upon the States responsibilities which heretofore did not exist; so much so, that, in the State which I have the honour to represent, the result is that 88 per cent, of the voters pay 4.25 per cent, of the direct taxes, while 12 per cent, of the voters pay 95.75 per cent.",32

221,Sir PHILIP FYSH,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I am afraid the Treasurer is not listening. I am urging that the representatives of the States should bear in mind the important bearing which the fiscal legislation of the Commonwealth has on the finances of the various States; and, therefore, I thank the right honourable member for Swan for reminding us of-our duty to the financially weaker members of the Commonwealth. I differ from the views expressed by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. We are here, not only to assist the Commonwealth, but also to protect the interest of the States; and, as I have pointed out, the financial legislation of this Parliament is leading the weaker States",32
222,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"What has the hon 7 orable'member to say about the. New South Wales Government remitting State taxation, while insisting on more money being returned by the Commonwealth?",32

224,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The New South Wales Government are repealing taxation, because they get so much money from the Commonwealth.",32
225,Sir PHILIP FYSH,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I do not desire to be drawn from the thread of my remarks, but I shall reply to the Treasurer by reminding him that, in consequence of Commonwealth fiscal legislation, the people of New South Wales have had their taxation, through Customs and Excise, increased from 25s. per head to £ 3 p e r head. ",32
226,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,And the Treasurer calls that a gift 1,32
227,Sir PHILIP FYSH,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I am not surprised that the leader of the Opposition should allude sarcastically to this change' as a g if t . But, as a matter of fact, this increase represents a gif t from the people of New South Wales to the Commonwealth j and I learn that they suffer very grievously in consequence. The honourable member for Wide Bay, in a dissertation to which I was very pleased to listen, was very enthusiastic in regard to old-age pensions. Although I did not remind the honourable .member of it while he was addressing the House, it is a fact that for years the various States Parliaments have annually voted various sums, by way of compassionate and other allowances, to assist our aged poor. Under an. old-age pensions scheme, we shall probably dry up, to alarge extent, all those well springs of charity which, happily, have always existed in the human heart. What has been clone in Victoria and New South Wales will shortly be accomplished in the four remaining States. Both New South Wales' and Victoria have accepted the responsibility of paying old-age pensions, and they have never regretted it. As a representative of Tasmania, I believe that I shall be giving effect to the wishes of my constituents by supporting an Old-age Pensions Bill when it comes before us, provided that it draws a great distinction between the thriftless anclthrifty , between the vagabonds of ' the earth-lik e the sundowner, who lives under a tree, and levies mail on every household that he passes-and deserving persons.",33
228,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The honourable member would giye the pension to the wealthier classes, I suppose?",33
229,Sir PHILIP FYSH,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Surely , that is very ridiculous-interjection. I presume that States an Old-age Pensions Bill will provide a pension can be claimed by almost old person in the community. But, on the toms and Excise revenue, other hand, it is sure to discriminate bethey tween individuals. Here I would remind stitution, honourable members of the Labour cornerand I wish that the honourable member for Wide Bay had been presentto hear statement-that under a Bill which was introduced two years ago, a Federal scheme of old-age pensions would have been istence at the present time but for the action of .Labour members in another would place. That measure contained a prevision which specially earmarked certain Customs revenue for the payment of old-age penthe sions. It passed this House by a large majority, but, owing to the action of members of the Labour Party elsewhere, it was rejected, because they would not sanction the payment of pensions out of Customs revenue.",33
230,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,But that Bill provided for a special form of Customs revenue.,33
231,Sir PHILIP FYSH,SURPLUS REVENUE,"It specially earmarked certain revenue for the purpose of paying old-age pensions. Now, however, when the surplus revenue, which the States desire shall be returned to them, is increasing, members of the Labour Party hail with gratification the intention of this measure to permit of old-age pensions being paid out of Customs revenue. When the Treasurer first introduced this Bill , we heard nothing about the payment of old-age pensions. We were told that the measure was necessary to give him control of the balances returnable to the States at the end of each month, in order to prevent the Treasury from being depleted, and so that he might have funds in hand with which to meet payments as they fell due. But, finding that he had a big surplus, the idea occurred to him to appropriate that surplus fora purpose which was never contemplated when this - Bill was drafted. Only incidentally have we learned that a portion of the money which he expects will be available under this Bill is to be devoted to the payment of old-age pensions. I think, sir, you will have observed, from the trend of my remarks, thar 1 hold that the return of these monthly balances to the States is still very necessary. Certainly, their return is very necessary in the case of Tasmania. ' When the Treasurer submitted his Budget, he estimated that a sum a of £7,777,000 would be returned to the during the 'current financial that . year, and that amount included not every only the three-fourths of the Custo which are entitled under the Conbut the unexpended balance of our one-fourth of that revenue, which he set down at £ 1 1 3 , 0 0 0 . my But since then a verygreat change has taken place in our finances. U p t ill the end of March last we have realized from in.exCustoms and Excise duties - not the £ 9 0 0 , 0 0 0 which the Treasurer anticipated be the excess upon the revenue collected under the old. Tariff-bu t an excess of £2,000,000 . I should like to remind honourable gentleman that when he made that announcement the leader of the Opposition recalled the circumstance that, during the first month in which the new Tariff was operative, the revenue from Customs and Excise exceeded the revenue collected under the old Tariff, during the same period, by more than £300,000. I also told the Treasurer that, in my opinion, the new Tariff, during 1907-8, would yield £2,500,000 or even £3,000,000 more than did the old Tariff. During its passage through the two branches of the Legislature the reductions made in the duties represent a decrease in the revenue of £400,000. At the present moment, therefore, I am disposed to think that the new Tariff will yield a revenue of about £2,500,000 in excess of that derived under the old Tariff. During the first six months of its operation the increased revenue represented an annual increase of £2,000,000. A further excess has been realized during April; May, and June, and it will not be until September next that the full effect for a whole year of the new Tariff will become apparent. I IT all probability the Treasurer will find that the revenue for the year will exceed the amount collected under the old Tariff by £2,500,000, notwithstanding the serious reductions which were made in the schedule. I credit Sir George Turner, who is, unfortunately, no longer a member of this House, and the present Treasurer, with every' desire to place before the country a clear exposition of our finances. But I submit that the statement made by the Treasurer in October last did not disclose the real condition of thefinancesunder the new Tariff. Therefore, we ought not to repose too much trust in the Estimates made by our Treasurers. I say that with all respect. Of course, I recognise the difficulty of making accurate estimates."" T am sure we all regret the absence from this House of Sir George Turner. He was a man whose attention to Treasury matters has never been equalled by any of his successors- a man who was particularly scrupulous in every financial statement that he made, and particularly careful to frame a fair, estimate. He told us that the Tariff of 1902 would probably yield a revenue of about £9,000,000 during the first year of its operation, .but that five years would elapse before a normal year would be reached, and that it would then probably return only £5,000,000.",33
232,Mr MAUGER,SURPLUS REVENUE,But Sir George Turner was naturally pessimistic. Sir Philif Fysh. Sir PHIL IP FYSH - Then I take it that the present Treasurer is pessimistic.,34
233,Mr MAUGER,SURPLUS REVENUE,He is inclined to be.,34
234,Sir PHILIP FYSH,SURPLUS REVENUE,"In the first year of the Tariff of 1902 the revenue amounted to £9,500,000. That result was brought about by natural circumstances-by the necessity to import grain and fodder by reason of the drought which then existed. Subsequently, the revenue declined to £8,500,000 during one year and £8,700,000 during another year. But, in the fifth year, it increased to £9,600,000, the result of the general prosperity of the country. In normal years that Tariff yielded about £9,000,000, and showed no sign' of falling to £5,000,000, as estimated by Sir George Turner. The present Treasurer estimates that the newTariff will produce a revenue of about £10,000,000. But I would point out to him that during the six months following its introduction, the revenue increased by £1,000,000. He also told us that the, surplus which would be returnable to the States this year would be £7,777,000, inclusive of an amount of £113,000 in excessof the three-fourths to which the States are constitutionally entitled. But, instead of that amount having been returned to the States, we find that, under the circumstances which existed in October last, the' sum of £9,100,000 would have been returnable to them, and that this amount would have included a sum of ,£1,400,000 in excess of their three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue. If there have been paid into the Treasury large sums in excess of the estimated revenue, the States Treasurers will naturally ask what we are going to do with the money. They have very naturally looked for a large surplus at the end of the year. But we shall find that the surplus returnable to the States instead of being £113,000 will be £222,000, or an addition of £119,000 to the sum estimated. I allude to this because I read in the morning press that, judging by the statement of the Treasurer, there would be no surplusrevenue returnable to the States for the year 1907-8. To the extent I have mentioned that statement is incorrect. I havesatisfied myself by reference to, the Treasurer himself, that there will be a surplus of £222,000 returnable to the States.",34
235,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,"But the Treasurer is not going to return that £222,000.",34
236,Sir PHILIP,SURPLUS REVENUE,"FYSH - Yes , I have it from the Treasurer himself. I am informed that the various States Treasurers will find themselves at the end of this year in possession of three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue collected and payable to them under the Constitution, plus £ 2 2 2 , 0 0 0 of surplus revenue returnable from the one-fourth of Customs and Excise revenue collected as the Commonwealth's share.",35
237,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,No .,35
238,Sir PHILIP FYSH,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I feel sure that the House is being misled in some way. I have made up my own statement of the finances, and I confess that in comparing it with the statements made by the Treasurer, with figures quoted by honourable members in the course of these debates, and with reports in the daily press, I am unable exactly to check the figures. I have referred to the amount of £ 2 2 2 , 0 0 0 , because that is the amount which the Treasurer has assured me will be returnable to the States, and because I think the matter of great importance, particularly to the State which I represent, since whilst the State Parliaments are in session the States Treasurers may be able. to supply statements from their point of view of their respective financial positions. The difference beween £ 7 , 7 7 7 , 0 0 0 , which the Treasurer estimated in October last as the amount returnable to the States, and ,£9,100,000, which really represents the difference this year between expenditure and revenue for the year, should give an amount <3f £ 1 , 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 as the .sum returnable to the States. But we find that only. £ 2 2 2 , 0 0 0 is to be returned, and we are justified in asking what has become of the other £ 1 , 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 . We have alreadydealt with Additional Estimates covering amounting to £ 5 7 0 , 0 0 0 , of which amount £116,000 was departmental, £ 4 6 0 , 0 0 0 related to public works and included £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 for new defence expenditure. I learn that this amount of £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 for new defence expenditure is regarded by the Treasurer as reducing the surplus which he has estimated at £ 4 7 2 , 0 0 0 to £ 2 2 2 , 0 0 0 . But this does not account for the whole expenditure of the Commonwealth. There have been extra expenses which the Treasurer will have to announce in his next Budget. The matter is left in this position-that by some means or other, whether in the form of Supplementary Estimates or Defence Estimates, or by the reservation of £ 2 2 2 , 0 0 0 for the purpose of old-age pensions, the large surplus to which I have referred is to be applied or appropriated; and, as a result, the excess of revenue for the current year of 1907-8 to the amount of £ 1 , 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 is not to be returned as surplus revenue to the States, but only the. very meagre sum to which I have already referred. . If , with a revenue from Customs and Excise increasing at the rate of over £2,000,00 0 a year, we have so far applied or appropriated, or intend to apply or appropriate, so vast a portion of the one-fourth under the control of the Commonwealth, that the amount returnable to the States is only £ 2 2 2 , 0 0 0 , how is it possible to provide for the payment of old age pensions under the provisions of this Surplus Revenue Bill? The Bill , as I have already - said, was at first proposed for the purpose of enabling the Treasurer to keep balances to his credit at the end of each month. It has now been diverted to the purpose of making early provision for some small payment, and that to a trust fund, to provide for old-age pensions. We might reasonably ask when, in the special circumstances referred to, it is hoped that the proposed trust fund will reach an amount of £1,500,000, the sum which we are informed will be necessary to finance a Commonwealth old-age pensions system ? I ask this question particularly in view of the fact that I am reminded by a statement of the Treasurer that it is estimated that our - revenue from Customs and Excise will be reduced, year by year, by £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 : The honourable gentleman, therefore, anticipates that in two years the revenue derived in this way will be less than that which might be anticipated from present returns by £2,000,000. Further, \\e are votes told that, year by year, our expenditure will Be increased by £1,000,000. Estimatand ing results by these statements of the Treasurer, the difference between our position this year and the position which we shall occupy two years hence will represent a reduction of our means to the extent of £4,000,000. Instead, therefore, of having a surplus of £1,400,000; we shall, at that time, be faced with a deficiency of £ 2 , 6 0 0 , 0 0 0, unless the revenue productiveness of the Tariff which we have just passed is very greatly increased as a result of the small increase of population which is likely to take place within the next two years, or unless it is found that the Tariff has not encouraged local manufactures, and that our imports are of such a character that it is impossible to shut them out except by a Tariff that would be absolutely prohibitive in its operation. These points worthy of consideration in dealing"" with the Surplus Revenue Bill. We have surplus revenue to deal with this year, if the Treasurer be right in his estimates, we shall have no surplus next year, and in the following year we shall be faced with a large deficiency. Having had a large experience of the imports of the Commona monwealth, as I have been associated with shipments from the Old Country to tralia since 1847, a period of sixty years, I course have 'statecl in this House, on more than . venue one occasion, that nothing short of absolute £13,000,000, prohibition will prevent very large overestimate, sea imports. In January and February last, our textile imports were larger than ever before.",35
239,Mr MAUGER,SURPLUS REVENUE,That is likely to coneven tinue.,36
240,Sir PHILIP FYSH,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I am glad to find that the Postmaster-General supports the view I have taken of the matter. There can be no doubt that, in respect to certain items, the Tariff we have passed is absobetween lutely a revenue Tariff.",36
241,Mr MAUGER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Hear , hear.",36
242,Sir PHILIP FYSH,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I think that - if the Treasurer were present he would find it strange to listen to such an appreciation of the remarks I have made, in view of his own distinct statement that he would not have a revenue Tariff. As a matter of fact, it is impossible to frame any Tariff which will not, in some respects, be a revenue Tariff j because it is impossible for ttie 4,000,000 of people we have in Australia and buoys. to manufacture locally a very large proportion of the articles which we now find it necessary to import.. We cannot shut out imports. Although I appreciate all that being done to encourage local manufactures and to give employment to our people, say that, no matter how our Tariff is penditure framed, it will be many years before revenue derived under it will be reduced to any appreciable extent. I admit that this point I am at issue with the Treasurer, who says"" that the revenue under the Tariff will next year be reduced by £1,000,000, and the year following by another yet £1,000,000.",36
243,Mr MAUGER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"It might be reduced respect of some items, and increased in reforty spect of others.",36
244,Sir PHILIP FYSH,SURPLUS REVENUE,"That is so; but it must be remembered that capitalists are induced to invest large sums in machinery only if they can be assured of some stability in the fiscal policy of the country, are. and we know that Governments may change. Although I think that the Tariff a we have just passed will remain in operabut tion for some considerable time, I doubt whether there will be an appreciable change in the revenue derived under it, or, on the other hand, in the volume of local production. Although the Treasurer has taken very pessimistic view of the future in estimating that our expenditure will run up Ausfrom £6,000,000 to £9,000,000 in the of a few years, whilst our re- will fall from £15,000,000 to I am more hopeful of the future. If , according to the Treasurer's we are able to devote £222,000 this year to a trust fund for the payment of old-age pensions, how much can we expect to devote to that purpose next year, though our revenue should be maintained at the present rate? We have been reminded today that the accumulated interest, at 3^ or 4 per cent.,' due to the various States on transferred properties valued at about £10,000,060, amounts to £2,000,000 and £3,000,000. If some provision is made to meet that interest due to the States, we shall require to provide about £400,000 a year for that purpose alone. Then the Prime Minister has reminded us that we must expect to have to incur a largely increased expenditure in connection with defence, the development of the Northern Territory, to meet losses on transcontinental railways, and to cover the expenditure which will be due to the taking over of harbors, liglv.*",36
245,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SURPLUS REVENUE,And quarantine.,36
246,Sir PHILIP FYSH,SURPLUS REVENUE,"We are already is incurring, extra expenditure in connection with quarantine. In the new Bills introI duced or referred to today, there is exinvolved quite sufficient to cover the any excess of our revenue for the current year from Customs and Excise. on Under these circumstances, I object at the present moment to the introduction of this Surplus Revenue Bill. It makes provision in regard to another measure which has riot been passed, and the money on account of which cannot be paid under any cirin cumstances for another year. During my or fifty years of political experience,. I have not been associated with any Treasurer or any Government that has made financial provision for a measure to come into operation in a subsequent year. It is customary for a Treasurer to bring down Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure for the current year. Here, however, we have provision made in regard to a year that has - not yet arrived, and to an appropriation which cannot take place within the present financial year. I have not dwelt upon the constitutional aspect of this Bill. I should always speak with bated breath on such a subject. I always consider that constitutional topics are best left to the legal members of the House. Certainly, in this instance, the matter will have to bp left to the High Court, which is the only body that can decide the issue. Sections 81, 87, and 94 of our Constitution are affected. Section 81 places the whole of our Customs and Excise revenue in what solicitors call' hotchpot. It places it all in the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Section 87 is known as the Braddon section. It has a peculiar history. I remember its passage through the Convention. I recollect, on many occasions, having had conversations with you, Mr. Speaker, and with Sir George Turner. - Great difficulties were felt as to what would be the result. One fact, however, we may recognise, and that is that the section has not been mischievous in its effects. Anything that can be said in regard to it is rather in its favour. We have never yet appropriated, for the purposes of the year's expenditure, a sum sufficient to consume the whole one-fourth of Customs and Excise revenue which the Commonwealth is entitled to use. So that the Braddon sectiou may be said to have worked neither favourably nor unfavorably to the States. As to the intention of the Convention, I should hesitate to express a definite opinion, because I am reminded that Judges do not recognise the intentions of the framers of an Act of Parliament. They simply read into it what the language implies. B.ut, in passing, I would say, from what I remember of the Convention, that the evident intention of the framers of the Constitution was that the one-fourth of Customs and Excise revenue should be appropriated by the Commonwealth only when necessity arose, and that the surplus should be refunded to the States. You, Mr Speaker, made a proposal in the Finance Committee - of the Convention that 70 per cent, of the Customs and Excise revenue should be paid by the Commonwealth to the States. ' Your proposal made no mention of the number - of years for which that scheme should - operate - I think I am right in saying that some of the Treasurers of the States at the - Convention considered it more satisfactory that there, should be a. limitation as to the number of years. Therefore, a period of ten years was fixed. But the Convention went on to provide, in section 94, that when the time arrived that the Commonwealth, in its wisdom, should think it desirable to make a new distribution, that distribution might be made; but that it should be made on the principle of the payment each month to the States of the surplus revenue. That is very clear. That leads me to the question whether the surplus anticipated by the Treasurer can be applied or appropriated Avithout the introduction of an Appropriation Bill for the purpose. It is quite new to me to find that an anticipated surplus at the end of this financial year can be ap1 propriated and applied in anticipation. The Prime Minister has told us that the £250,000 for defence works will not be spent, and the Treasurer has informed us that £220,000 for old-age pensions will not be paid this year. This money will be set aside in a trust fund. Now, the Audit Act of 1906 contains certain trust sections., and the purposes for which they were passed is apparent on the face of them. It was found from time to time that certain votes were made by Parliament, and that the money could not be used for precisely those purposes' for which the appropriation was made. It was, therefore, provided that the Department for which money was appropriated in connexioo with one vote might use it for the purposes of another. But we are now faced with quite a new phase, and find that a trust fund is to be applied to quite a novel purpose. It is proposed to set aside-not ' to pay, or apply, or appropriate; indeed appropriation implies the receipt by Parliament of a message from the Governor General-money s as to which we have simply the word of Ministers that they will use them for certain purposes. For example, £250,000 is to be set aside for defence purposes, and £222,000 for old-age pensions. That' seems to me to be quite a new idea. There, however, I must leave the question. I have stated that, so far as old-age pensions are concerned, I believe that the people of Tasmania anticipated that such a provision would be made. They hoped that it would be made with some judgment, and with some regard to the thrift or thriftlessness of the recipients. I may, however, express the great disappointment of my constituents, after having paid so much as their share of the extra £ 1,400,00 0 of Customs and Excise revenue, at realizing how small a proportion of that excess is represented by the £ 2 2 2 , 0 0 0 to be paid this year to the whole of the States. Their disappointment will be the greater when they remember the figures to which I referred in my opening remarks, that 88 per cent, of the voting power pays only 4.25 of the direct taxes, whilst 12 per cent, of the voting power pays 95.75 per'cent, of the same. The people will also be disappointed when they realise in the face of those figures that the money to be spent on old-age pensions means a payment, if by direct taxation, of £ 1 ios. by every one of those who constitute the voting power of 12 per cent., whilst only is. 6d. per head will be paid by those who constitute the voting power of 88 per cent.",36
247,Mr FAIRBAIRN,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Fawkner) [5.0] - I shall not detain the House very long at this late stage of the debate, but I wish to make a few remarks before the second reading of the Bill is agreed to. I shall not enter upon the question of the constitutionality of the Bill . There seems to be a fair division of opinion upon that question, and it seems likely that it wiil lead to another of those interminable law suits between the States and the Commonwealth, which are to be so much' deprecated.",38
248,Mr BRUCE SMITH,SURPLUS REVENUE,We are legislating on the border line.,38
249,Mr FAIRBAIRN,SURPLUS REVENUE,"We are always legislating close to or on the border line. The object of this Bill , we are told, is enable the Government to pile up money, so that they may at an early date pay oldwhilst age pensions. I was one of those bers of this House who declared selves to-be in favour of old-age pensions, and of the Commonwealth undertaking that class of legislation. I was influenced by the fact that we have to look at this - matter from an Australian point of view. The man who has lived first in one State and then in another, is very frequently a very valuable citizen of this country. He should not, therefore, be left out in the cold when old-age pensions are being of pensions. paid. In order that the pensions might be paid on equal terms all over Australia, I was in favour of the work being underquite taken by the Federal Parliament. principle is, I think, generally conceded sions. by all. ' But the question, how we can in the best and quickest manner undertake this class of work, is quite another matter. I consider that it ought to be undertaken in connection with a general consideration of the financial affairs, of the States and the Commonwealth. Even if we. adopt this Bill , it inevitably means a law suit and consequent delay; after which we shall probably have to submit to the people a proposition for an alteration of the Constitution, involving still more delay. Consequently, the people who are to benefit from an old-age pensions scheme, which is the object of the Bill, are likely to remain out in the cold for an indefinite period. I consider that the States have a good deal of right on their side in desiring to know their exact financial position. I wish to point out to the House how this matter will affect Victoria. This State was the first in Australia to adopt an old-age pensions scheme. Then followed New South Wales; and lately, Queensland has passed an Act for the same purpose. In Victoria, the old-age pensions are fixed at a.. maximum of 10s. per week-£2 6 per annum. That is all that any citizen of this State, man or woman, is allowed to re-, ceive. In New South Wales, recipientsof old-age pensions are permitted to enjoy an income of twice that amount-£5 2 per annum.",38
250,Mr MAUGER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The pension in New South Wales is 10s. a week, or £ 1 per always week for a married couple.",38
251,Mr FAIRBAIRN,SURPLUS REVENUE,"But the old-age . pensioner in New South Wales is not. debarred from the receipt of a pension of to ios. per week if he also enjoys an income of ios. per week from a private source, in Victoria no old-age pensioner is memallowed to have a source of income apart themfrom his ios. per week'.",38
252,Mr MATHEWS,SURPLUS REVENUE,Who says so?,38
253,Mr FAIRBAIRN,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I take those facts from the oflicial Year-Book of the Commonwealth. That state of things has brought about the following result-that in Victoria only 16per cent, of the people over 65, years of age receive old-age pensions, whereas in New South Wales 40 per cent. of the people above that age are in receipt",38
254,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,SURPLUS REVENUE,"That is largelv owing to the fact that in Victoria, until recently, only £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annumThat . was permitted to be spent on old-age pen",38
255,Mr MATHEWS,SURPLUS REVENUE,It has been only a. charity dole in Victoria.,38
256,Mr FAIRBAIRN,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I have heard the honourable member say so before. 1 do not quite understand what a charity dole is in this connection. take it that there is a considerable difference between the system in Victoria and that existing in New South Wales. If we adopt the suggestions of the Commonwealth Commission went into this matter, with the Minister of Trade and Customs at its head-and probably they will be adopted-the present cost to Victoria of old-age pensions will, at any rate, be doubled.",39
257,Mr MAUGER,SURPLUS REVENUE,Victori a can afford if.,39
258,Mr FAIRBAIRN,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I do not think Victoria can afford it. When old-age pensions were first paid in this State, the maximum amount was ios., but when bad times came it was cut down to 8s. i o j d ",39
259,Mr CROUCH,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The maximum was made 8s,",39
260,Mr FAIRBAIRN,SURPLUS REVENUE,"At any rate, it was reduced. From that it appears that the State Parliament, which is representative of the people the same as we are",39
261,Mr MAUGER,SURPLUS REVENUE,It is not. That is trouble.,39
262,Mr FAIRBAIRN,SURPLUS REVENUE,The Victorian Parof liament is elected by a considerable portion of the people.,39
263,Mr MAUGER,SURPLUS REVENUE,The women have not vote for it.,39
264,Mr FAIRBAIRN,SURPLUS REVENUE,"They have not, but experience shows that - the women's vote would not alter the representation to considerable extent. In any case, toria has not got the money; although rethat cently, under considerable stress, the maximum pension was again raised.",39
265,Mr MAUGER,SURPLUS REVENUE,And the' income tax was reduced.,39
266,Mr MATHEWS,SURPLUS REVENUE,And still the Victorian Treasurer has a large surplus.,39
267,Mr FAIRBATRN,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Time s have been favourable, but now there is every appearment ance of bad times ahead. suffering from drought more than is other State in the group, and stock is for being shifted in every direction. a good time to jump in and double what altogether the honourable member refers to charitable dole? I do not say that or is not, but I think the States are fectly justified in looking most carefully into their finances. That ' is why I am low. prepared to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Parramatta to postpone the consideration of the Bill until the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States can be dealt But we may_ with as a whole. That ought to be done.",39
268,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,SURPLUS REVENUE,Then the honourable member supports the amendment on the ground that we cannot afford to payold-age pensions? which Mr Mauger - Do not let it go out to the world that Victoria cannot afford to pay as much as New South Wales for old-age pensions.,39
269,Mr FAIRBAIRN,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I do not want to support the amendment on those grounds, but we ought to look into the question I have indicated, and not go recklessly into the undertaking. The - Postmaster-General is a man of impulse. Like myself, he would be glad to see everybody paid £ 1 0 0 a year, but the question is, "" Can we afford it ? "" As the honourable member for Denison pointed out, a great many of the taxpayers are little better off than are the people who are to receive this "" charitable dole.""- We are told that the object of the Bil l is to provide money for old-age the pensions and naval defence. ' Mr Bruce SMITH - I think the object the Bill is to amend the Constitution.",39
270,Mr FAIRBAIRN,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I have not felt competent to deal with thab point; it will a probably be settled by the High Court. We are told, at any rate, that the object of the Bill is to put money into a trust fund for those two purposes. I altogether agree any with the honourable member for Angas, who Vichit the nail on the - head when he stated if the Bill is constitutional at all, it is constitutional only where this House has appropriated the money. It is all very well for the Treasurer to tell us that the intention underlying the Bill is to set money aside for old-age pensions and naval defence ; but how do we know that that intention will be carried out? The Governmay change, all sorts of things might Victoria is happen .to prevent it , and so this House any would be actually creating a trust fund one purpose, while the money 1 Is that might afterwards be applied to some different object. As"" a as a business man who has ha'd to make it is both ends meet and look into points of this perkind.very seriously, I think that is a very dangerous practice for the House to folThe House ought to know before ir votes any money exactly how that money is going to be spent. That is one reason why I think we ought to go thoroughly into the whole financial position, to see what we can afford before we authorize the Government to accumulate a trust fund. I have no objection to such a fund, except that the money is always better in the pockets of the taxpayers than accumulated in the coffers of the'Government. If Labour members are so anxious for old-age pensions, why do they not bring them into force in South Australia? The existing state of. things is a slur on that State, which is entirely in the hands of the Labour Party. There is a Labour Government in power there, and yet it is one of the few States where old-age pensions are not paid. It is significant that Victoria, which is in the hands of what is called a Conservative Government, with Mr Bent at its head, has passed an old-age pensions scheme, and that New South Wales and Queensland have also done so.",39
271,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"It was a democratic Government, and not the present Government in New South Wales, that passed it.",40
272,Mr MATHEWS,SURPLUS REVENUE,It was not the present Government in Victoria that passed it.,40
273,Mr FAIRBAIRN,SURPLUS REVENUE,The present Government in Victoria have actually increased the amount.,40
274,Mr CARR,SURPLUS REVENUE,Does the honourable member advance those arguments as a justification for his not voting for a Federal old-age pensions scheme?,40
275,Mr FAIRBAIRN,SURPLUS REVENUE,"No . I am merely pointing out that, it is extraordinary that the only State where old-age pensions are urgently wanted is South Australia, which is in the hands of the Labour Party. That makes me ask myself, "" Can it be that that State is hanging back so as to force the Commonwealth Parliament to launch out on a scheme?"" One has to find motives, although one does not like imputing them. There must be some motive behind the delay. The matter is not as simple as it looks on the surface. In Western Australia, the population is nearly all of a working age, and there are only a few hundred people at most who would benefit by old-age pensions; so that they are not very necessary in that State. Tasmania is the only other State, and the people there are a. small happy family. It is astonishing to find that in South Australia, where old age pensions ought to have been granted years ago, and where the Labour Party has had a free hand, no provision has been made..",40
276,Mr MATHEWS,SURPLUS REVENUE,On e of the reasons is that South Australia distinctly understood that a Federal scheme was to be passed.,40
277,Mr FAIRBAIRN,SURPLUS REVENUE,That is an extraordinary-idea. Apparently they do not do their .duty because they think that the Federal Parliament are going to pass a scheme some day. SirW ILLIAM LYNE - We are going to pass it at once.,40
278,Mr FAIRBAIRN,SURPLUS REVENUE,I hope we are.,40
279,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Then why is the honourable member objecting to it? , Mr FAIRBAIRN - I object to the Bill because it means putting an old-age pensions scheme off for years. The people with whom the Federal Government ought to agree are the States people, but they continue fighting with. them. The Government might perfectly well have come to an agreement with the States.",40
280,Mr MAUGER,SURPLUS REVENUE,Is it not the other way about? Are the States not always fighting us ?,40
281,Mr SPEAKER,SURPLUS REVENUE,I ask honourable members not to interrupt.,40
282,Mr FAIRBAIRN,SURPLUS REVENUE,"An y old-age pensions provision ought to be a part of the whole scheme for the settlement of the financialrelations between the Commonwealth and the States. The Government have no business to ask this House to set aside money for old-age pensions and naval defence under this Bill unless Parliament appropriates the money arid sets it apart for those specific purposes. If that were done, such a trust fun d would not be a bad thing, but it is most unbusiness-like and unpractical to tell us in a vague way that the money will probably be spent upon those two objects. I shall, therefore, vote for the amendment of the honourable member for Parramatta.",40
283,Mr BRUC ESMITH,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Parkes) [5.17]. - The speeches delivered upon this Bill have taken a great variety of forms. Most of them seem to have treated it as if it were a Bill to legalize old-age pensions. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie made some observations which seemed to suggest that the division upon the Bill would, in fact, be a test of the feelings of members with regard to the propriety and desirableness of passing an Old-age Pensions Bill . I want to make it clear that whatever vote I give upon this measure will have nothing to do with my opinions upon old-age pensions. This Bill is a purely constitutional provision; and if I were asked to put my view of it into a few words I should sav that it was a Bill that was intended solely to alter the Constitution. We all understudied stand clearly that, at all events, for five vears after Federation was inaugurated it was. intended that the bookkeeping system should be continued, and that whatever moneys were not expended by the Commonwealth out of its 25 per cent, of the net Customs and Excise revenue should be handed back to the States. The Government have thought necessary to attach to the Bill a memorandetermined dum which is, I suppose, intended to the place of the usual Ministerial explanaaccount tion of the measure. ' I am not - aware whether the Treasurer was unable to make the purpose of the Bill sufficiently clear his second-reading speech, but the memortion andum is obviously intended to explain honourable members what the Bill really upon the assumption that they will not able to understand it for themselves. three sections in the Constitution which seem to deal with this proposal are 89, and 94. I ask honourable members, when considering whether or not they ought to tion vote for the Bill, to give serious attention to the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Parramatta, that the passthating of the Bill should be postponed until the financial arrangements between the form Commonwealth and the States-as to which there is at present some friction-hav placed upon a more satisfactory basis. Whether the. Bill is or is not constitutional, its object is to alter the distribution of 25 per cent, of the Customs and revenue which the Commonwealth mav exbefore pend. Section 89 provides that the Comof monwealth shall pay to each State, month by month, the balance, if any, in favour of the State. The word ""expenditure"" very prominent where the debiting with. Ministers, in the fourth paragraph of the memorandum attached to the Bill, make an admissionSection 94 is far more elastic than porary sections. Those sections contain appropriation to the States of all unexpended revenue; and while they remain in force Commonwealth is bound to return to the 'every penny that is not actually expended. I agree with that interpretation. Every honourable member must interpret for self the expression "" expenditure "" ; people understand it to mean "" money pended."" A balance having been struck, in reference to the 25 per cent., the credit and the debit of actual expendition. ture, the difference is to be returned States each month. Section 93 deals with the bookkeeping period. Those who have the history of the Constitution, know what a long and laboured discussion took place in the Convention in regard to the distribution of the Customs and Excise revenue. It was demonstrated that a fer cafita distribution would give some of the States an unfair advantage, by enabling them to receive more revenue than would be collected on commodities consumed it within their borders. Therefore, it was that, notwithstanding its enortake mous trouble and expense, an accurate should be kept for five years of the Customs revenue received from each State, so that the distribution might be in in accordance with the contributions. Sec94, which Ministers say is more elastic to than sections 89 and 93, does not, in my is, opinion, modify them, except in so far be as it gives the Parliament power to alter The the basis of the division. It was recognised in the Convention that the book93, keeping system, by reason' of its complicaand expense, must sooner or later be abandoned, and a fer cafita distribution adopted. Section 94 therefore provides After five years from the imposition of uniduties of customs, the Parliament may provide, on such basis as it deems fair, for the. monthly payment to the several States of all e been surplus revenue of the Commonwealth. That section, I submit, in no way modithe fies tihe requirements of section 89 that the Excise Commonwealth must "" expend"" money it can deduct it from its 25 per cent, the Customs and Excise revenue, to the balance of which the States are entitled.",40
284,Mr JH CATTS,SURPLUS REVENUE,Would not that make is it impossible for the Commonwealth to is dealt undertake big national works?,41
285,Mr BRUCE SMITH,SURPLUS REVENUE,"An Act of Parliament is not variously interpreted according to its effect upon particular interests. The Constitution provides that the Comthe' temmonwealth may expend as much of its 2«{ a special per cent, of the Customs and Excise the revenue a§ the Parliament may think fit, States but the balance is to be .returned to the States. Ministers, no doubt with the best intentions, wish to provide that, instead himof the Commonwealth being required to most ""expend,"" it shall only be necessary t.o ex- "" appropriate "" money. They say, "" We want to create a fund for the payment of between old-age pensions""- a very good intenA certain place is paved with good to the intentions; but they should not be considered a sufficient justification for this Parliament. We are asked to make "" appropriation "" a synonym for ""expenditure."" The Bill seeks' to enable any part of the 25 per cent, to be placed to a trust fund, which may not be used for some years. The week before last, the Prime Minister blandly asked, a Committee _ of Supply to vote a sum of £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 , which, he admitted, would not be expended during the current financial year. When reminded that only ""expenditure"" within the financial year ' could be' deducted from the Commonwealth 25 per cent, of the Customs and Excise revenue j he withdrew the proposal. . No matter how much may be said about old age pensions-and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie had a good deal to say on the subject-o r about the effect on Victoria of the Commonwealth old-age pensions system, of which the honourable member for Fawkner spoke, that question has nothing to do with this discussion. We a.re concernedi almost whollv. with the provision in paragraph d, of clause 4, thatA l l payments to Trust Accounts, establislied under the Audit Acts 1901-1906, of moneys appropriated by law for any purpose of the Commonwealth, shall be deemed to be expenditure. That, as I have said, is an attempt to make ""appropriation"" a synonym for "" expenditure.""",41
286,Mr BOWDEN,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Does the honourable and learned member say that the words "".applied annually,"" as used in section 87', mean ""expended annually,"" not ""appropriated""?",42
287,Mr BRUC ESMITH,SURPLUS REVENUE,"It does not, I think, touch my present argument. tion 93 determines how 25 per cent, of the Customs and Excise revenue shallbe divided. ' The Commonwealth is - empowered to "" expend "" as much as it likes, but the unexpended balance must be re- . turned to the States. The Commonweath cannot say, "".We are unable to spend all this money during the current financial year, but we are going to appropriate part of it for future expenditure, and call that -' expenditure.' "" Ministers have admitted that by introducing the Bill . If "" expenditure "" and ""appropriation"" were synonymous, there would really be no need ' for the measure; to make them so involves an alteration of the Constitution.",42
288,Mr CARR,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Does not the division, provided for in section 87, clash with the monthly division in section 94? Mr Bruce ' SMITH - It may; but I do not think that that touches the point which I am discussing. The Constitution cannot be amended by a Bill of this kind. From what I have seen of the action of the Government, it seems to me that, for a long time, they have been at their wits' end to know how to become the authors of a Bill to provide for old-age pensions. The honourable member for Flinders threw out some suggestions the other night about a trust fund.",42
289,Mr WILKS,SURPLUS REVENUE,He says that this Bill is constitutional.,42
290,Mr BRUCE SMITH,SURPLUS REVENUE,"That may be; and I am sure that, if he thinks so, he will agree to differ with me over it. ' He threw out-as I said-sorii e suggestions about a trust fund, and immediately - a member, of the Ministry- I do not credit the Treasurer with that acuteness which would enable him to take it up so rapidly-seize d upon the idea of creating a trust fund for old-age pensions. This Bill is the outcome, and I think that the honourable member for Flinders, if he is pleased with the offspring, can claim to be its father.. Mr W. H. IRVINE - My suggestions were made in connection with the Bounties Bill.",42
291,Mr BRUCE SMITH,SURPLUS REVENUE,"But in a speech which I have here, the honourable member referred generally to the possibility of creating a trust f u n d ; and I quite agree with him that we mav have an appropriation for a trust fund, but not out of the 25 per cent, of the Customs revenue. Whether the appropriation of a sum for a trust fund is an ""expendit u r e "" by the .Commonwealth is a Sec- totally different question. If the Federal Convention had meant ""appropriation,"" if c o u l d have used that word in the section .providing for the right c f the Commonwealth.'to take from the 25 per cent, of the Customs, and Excise revenue any sums appropriated by the Commonwealth, but it put in ""expenditure,"" and it anticipated, I suppose, that the Commonwealth would be able to pay its wav out of that percentage, without the building up of any trust funds. That seems to me to be the kernel of the whole question. The effect of the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Parramatta would be to suspend this question until some better and more satisfactory arrangement had been annual entered into between the States and the Commonwealth. The Bill may be intended as a political placard- I do not know, and I am not going to say that it is-bu t certainly there is no immediate hurry over it .",42
292,Mr WILKS,SURPLUS REVENUE,It must be remembered that the revenue is diminishing every vear.,43
293,Mr BRUCE SMITH,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The honourable member will see that if some satisfactory arrangement is' made between the States and the Commonwealth, there should be no difficulty over the provision of Old-age pensions, whatever our personal views on that question may be. I suppose that I take as circumspect a view of that question as does anybody here, because I believe that whatever provision we make for the purpose ought to be hedged round with a number of precautions, the necessity for which has been demonstrated by the States in actual experience of that legislation. I have always felt, if I may go off' the constitutional track for a moment, that when a person claiming an old-age pension is known to have near relatives who are amply competent to keep him from the want against which an old-age pension is supposed to provide at the expense of the State- that is, at the expense of the recipient's fellow-citizens-thos e low-citizens ought not' to be called upon to support him when his own relatives could well do so. .",43
294,Mr FAIRBAIRN,SURPLUS REVENUE,"That is the Victorian system. ' Mr Bruce SMITH - I know of many cases in which people in affluence are allowing their parents - to receive an old-age pension in New South Wales. Whether we vote for or against this measure is no test, and I repudiate it as a test of my feelings towards old-age pensions. I recognise that under the Constitution it is an accepted principle in Federal politics that the Commonwealth shall take over the whole question of old-age pensions. Already three States are paying those pensions, namely, New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland, and I suppose that they absorb four-fifths of the population - of Australia. I do not think that anybody can object on principle to the establishment of an Australian system of old-age pensions as provided in the Constitution. So that this Bill will not be a test of one's opinions on the desirableness of old-age pensions as part of a legislative policy.",43
295,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SURPLUS REVENUE,Le t the Government bring in a Bill and provide the money.,43
296,Mr BRUCE SMITH,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Of course, the Government will have to bring in an Old-age Pensions Bill, and honourable members will then be able to suggest any modifications or precautions with which it is necessary to hedge round the general provision. But I repeat that this measure is an attempt to alter the Constitution, so as to enable the Commonwealth to pay moneys into a variety of funds. Paragraph d of clause 4 puts the whole attempt in a nutshell when it says thatA l l payments to trust accounts . . . shall be deemed to be expenditure. Those few words clearly show what the Bill is intended to do. It raises the whole question, whether under section 93 of the Constitution we can interpret "" expenditure"" as ""appropriation."" One reason why I think that we cannot do so is that-in a State' the Parliament can appropriate money without expending it j therefore, the two things are not co-terminus or synonymous, and it follows, as a matter of course, that they do not mean the same thing. Inasmuch, then, as an appropriation may be made without expending the money, I submit that we should only be attempting to amend the Constitution by sub: fel- stituting the word "" appropriation "" for the word ""expenditure."" We are not in a hurry, I repeat, about this measure. It is not as if a scheme of old-age pensions were awaiting its passage; because, although we pass a Bill, we cannot start such a scheme with the small sum of money which the Government would be able immediatelv to place at the disposal of the fund. And as the Prime Minister has told us this evening in answer to a question,"" it is, orwas, contemplated when the Premiers' Conference dispersed to have another meeting very shortly, when we all hope there will be a more amicable spirit existing. It ought not to be many months before the whole of this question is discussed between the States and the Commonwealth, and some satisfactory arrangement made by which old age pensions will be provided for.",43
297,Mr BOWDEN,SURPLUS REVENUE,The Premiers offered to make such payments.,43
298,Mr BRUCE SMITH,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Yes , and I understand that the. Prime Minister is in a mood to accept the offer. Therefore, there should be no obstacle in the way.",43
299,Mr WILKS,SURPLUS REVENUE,"They made a strong offer. "" Mr Bruce SMITH - The honourable member for Kalgoorlie laid great stress upon this so-called difference between the States and the Commonwealth, ancl seemed to imply that it was the duty of every man in this Parliament to take up the cause of the Commonwealth - as against the States. There ought, in mv opinion, to be no such ""cause."" We exist, as a Parliament, by reason of a partnership deedthe Constitution-and it is our duty here, as the honourable member for Parramatta once said, not to be constantly legislating on the border line between our constitutional rights and those of the States, but to be always watching that border line, because, although the citizens and the taxpayers of the States are the same as the citizens and taxpayers of the Commonwealth, there are divided interests. We, as custodians of the Commonwealth powers, ought to do our utmost to see that the 'partnership deed is worked in the most equitabie, harmonious way possible between the State interests and the. Commonwealth interests. If there is a tendency on the part of this Parliament to overstep that line on behalf of the Commonwealth, it is the duty of those who can assume a judicial attitude between the two conflicting sets of rights, to urge that the Commonwealth should not become aggressive; just as much is it our duty to resent any aggressive conduct on' the'part of the States. The ideal which we should set up, is not that-of attacking the States, but of overlooking the relative positions of the two national entities, to see that there is no overstepping, and little as possible cause for irritation. If we are always going to legislate on the border line, in the spirit in which we have done in the past,, and to say, "" We do not mind the High Court; we will chance_ it , "" as 1I have heard men occupying positions in the Government say here",43
300,Mr WILKS,SURPLUS REVENUE,"In any case we must chance it, because we cannot decide any constitutional point here.",44
301,Mr BRUCE SMITH,SURPLUS REVENUE,"No ; but the honourable member will admit that we ought to be very careful about legislating so close to the border line that that sort of expression can be used; especially when we have opportunities of discussing with the Premiers, from time to time, questions which can be settled amicably. He knows very well that the people of the different States take up the cudgels for one State or another.",44
302,Mr WEBSTER,SURPLUS REVENUE,We are perfectly safe so long as we do not go over the border line.,44
303,Mr BRUCE SMITH,SURPLUS REVENUE,"No doubt, but if the honourable member is skating on the edge of a lake, he is very careful not to go very close to the deep water. He keeps off that point because he can, perhaps, do just as well over the shallow water as he could over deep water. Besides, every time that we do something that leads to conflict between the States and the Commonwealth, - through the High Court, we rouse antagonism on the part of one class or otlier, which it ought to be our duty to obviate. I claim, then, that my vote on this measure has nothing to do with my opinion on the question of old-age pensions.",44
304,Mr WEBSTER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The honourable member cannot help it. . Mr Bruce SMITH - My vote on this matter ought not to be in favour of the Commonwealth, if I think that the Bill involves an overstepping of our rights. I submit that, constitutionally, it is one which ought not to be passed, because the same result can be produced without raising any question as to its constitutional propriety, as soon as the Premiers of the States and the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth meet in a broad and friendly spirit.",44
305,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Flinders) [5.47]. - Perhaps the honourable member for Parkes will allow me to express the gratification which, I think, is shared by every honourable member listening to his very admirable and short speech, marked as it was by the most moderate and temperate language to which we have listened. I should not like, even if it were in order, to enter into a lengthy discussion on the constitutional question which has been so much debated - I do not know that you, sir, would consider me in order in doing so, seeing that, as I have already spoken to the main question, I can only speak now to the amendment. But, perhaps, with your permission, and that of the' House-seein g that so much criticism has been directed towards some of the arguments I addressed to honourable members, I may be allowed to occupy a very few minutes in dealing with one alspect of this important question. I do not claim that a lawyer can speak on this particular question with any special authority. It is not 1 a matter which involves any abstruse learning or technical reasoning. It is a question on which any man who has had experience of constitutional matters is quite as much entitled to speak with authority as is any one who has had experience of law. Under our Constitution there are many cases, as the honourable member for Parkes has observed, in which it would be not only imprudent, but not altogether honest, for us to say that our opinions are absolutely fixed until the points at issue have been determined by the tribunal which alone can do so. In fact, when I find so many honourable members, for whose opinion I entertain very great respect, differing from the view I formed on this subject, I am not so arrogant as not to feel certain doubts coming into my mind as to whether, after all, I may not be wrong and they may be right, although there are many honourable' members who support my view. I should, however, like to place before honourable members one or two considerations which I do not think have yet been fully dwelt upon. In the first place, in considering any document, especially a fundamental document such as our Constitution is, we ought to remember that old rule of construction which has been handed down to us clothed in a Latin form, like so many of those precepts of the Middle Ages, and which has only been preserved, not from the language in which it is clothed, but from its real pith and common sense-Qu i hceret in liters hceret in cortices A literal translation is that he who merely considers the letter of a document goes but skin-deep into its meaning; he who stops at the bark never gets to the heart of the tree. In construing more particularly .a great charter of constitutional powers, we must not confine ourselves to any one word, one expression, one sentence, or one section. We have to look at the whole scheme as embodied in all the sections dealing with the particular matter under consideration. I approach this question from that point of view, and hold that the intention of the framers of the Constitution was to invest this Parlia-. ment, not with powers limited in the same way as are those vested in a municipality, but with powers that would make it the sovereign Parliament within its own realm, and the leading parliamentary institution in the Commonwealth. I think it was intended that, as far as possible, it should be free and unfettered in carrying out the important duties which were intrusted to it, so long as the equally sovereign or important rights of the States were preserved to them. I always feel disposed to read the financial provisions of the Constitution in the most liberal, rather than in the most restricted, way. I may be wrong, but that is the spirit in which I always approach their consideration. I find in the sections commencing with section 81, and ending practically with section 94, a complete scheme of financial adjustment between the States and the Commonwealth, which presents certain broad, outstanding features that impress themselves very strongly upon' my mind. It was intended, first of all, as section 81 provides, to give to the Commonwealth the most complete power to appropriate Commonwealth revenues to Commonwealth purposes. The Commonwealth revenues include the whole of the revenue from Customs and Excise. We start with that. There is no limit to the word "" appropriated."" As used there, it is as wide as it could be. It means the taking of the Commonwealth revenues and applying them to any purpose within the realm of Commonwealth functions. Coming to section 87, upon the proper meaning of which, after all, the whole question hinges, we find that, broadly speaking, its object seems to be beyond question. I do not think that honourable members who have ranged themselves on either side of this much-disputed question would argue that the intention was not mainly to secure to the States three-fourths of the revenue from Customs and Excise. The framers of the Constitution contemplated their getting probably more, but it was to secure to them at least three-fourths of that great revenue, the management of which was handed over to the Commonwealth, that section 87 was passed. That was the main object with which they set out. Section 87 providesDuring a period of ten years after the establishment of the Commonwealth, and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides, of the net revenue of the Commonwealth from duties of customs and duties of excise, not more than one-fourth shall be applied annually by the Commonwealth towards its expenditure. The whole question turns upon the meaning of the words "" shall be applied annually by the Commonwealth towards its expenditure."" We are to read them, of course, in the light of the language employed, not only in the section,,T5ut in all parts of the Constitution relating to Ihis particular matter. The narrower view-fh e view put forward so strongly by some cf my honorabje friends-is that these words mean that the money must be applied by the Commonwealth only towards its an- nual expenditure. That is to say, the whole operation and effect of the section is limited to what we may call the annual services of the year. That is practically the point at which I find myself totally unable to agree with my honourable friends. If such a contention were adopted, it would, to my mind, limit the whole of the powers of this House in many respects. To assume that this money was to be applied only to annual expenditure, would be to give to the section a meaning which in the first place is not necessary to carry out the intention which the framers of the Constitution had in their mind-the intention to secure to the States at least three-fourths the' Customs revenue-and which would place this Parliament very much in the position of a municipal council, hedged round with all kinds of restrictions.",44
306,Mr BRUCE SMITH,SURPLUS REVENUE,Onl y as applied to the Customs House.,46
307,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I shall come to that point presently. I listened with the greatest pleasure and attention to the honourable member's speech. The view which he and others hold was put by him as well as by any honourable member whom I have heard address himself to this subject. But there is another distinction which has been rather left out of account by most of those who have addressed themselves to this constitutional question. I refer to the broad distinction between Parliamentary appropriation and Executive expenditure. The two, as honourable members know, are absolutely distinct. Parliament does not spend money in the sense of paying out money. The Executive spends money under the authority of Parliament. If we mean by the use of the word "" spending,"" to refer to the handing out of sovereigns or cheques for services rendered or for goods received, it certainly cannot be said that Parliament spends money. Parliament authorizes expenditure. It sets apart by appropriation - it applies-it s revenues towards expenditure. I have never heard it suggested that "" appropriation "" is limited to appropriation for services of the year, nor can I find any reason to suggest that an application by Parliament towards its expenditure is necessarily limited to an application of its revenues towards the expenditure of the current year. The Constitution does not say that it is. Why should we read into it a limitation further than is actually expressed in the language employed ? Section 87, and this seems to me to lie at the very root of what, if I may - say so, is the fallacy of the argument of a good many of my honourable friends, does not deal with what the Treasurer or the Executive has to do. It is a restriction upon the authority of Parliament. It says that the Commonwealth Parliament is not to take out of the stream of revenue which is allowed flow through its channels",46
308,Colonel FOXTON,SURPLUS REVENUE,What is the honourable member quoting?,46
309,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I am paraphrasof ing section 87, in order to convey tp orable members what I think is the proper meaning to be given to it. The framers of the Constitution in that section say, in of effect to the Commonwealth, "" We give you the vast fund which comes annually from Customs and Excise.""",46
310,Colonel FOXTON,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The words used are applied "" by the Commonwealth,"" not "" by the Parliament.""",46
311,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,Quite true.,46
312,Colonel FOXTON,SURPLUS REVENUE,That may - refer to the Executive just as much as to the Parliament.,46
313,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Certainly , it may apply to any of the functions of Government, parliamentary or executix e We have, however, to apply those words to one or the other; we cannot apply them to both. The amount appropriated by Parliament may be different from the amount actually spent during the course of a particular year. If we are to choose between taking this provision as a limitation upon the actual amount spent or paid out, and a limitation upon the authority of the Parliament to appropriate or apply an amount towards its expenditure, I have no hesitation in saying that the latter meaning is not only at least equally consistent with the express language used, but affords a far more effective and better check for the States than would the other.",46
314,Mr HARPER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The original, object was to secure to the States three-fourths of the Customs revenue.",46
315,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The framers of the Constitution said, in effect: "" We invest the Commonwealth with an enormous revenue, and we say to it : ' Out of the annual revenue coming in from this great source, you are only to take for appropriation or application towards your expenditure-at whatever time it may be-no t more than one-fourth. You may take less, and if you do, you must return to the States the whole of the three-fourths, plus the amount of the one-fourth that you. do not take for yourselves.' "" That, it seems to me is the object and purpose of section 87. I come now to section 89, to which the honourable member for Parkes referred.",46
316,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The word ""month "" is used in section 89.",46
317,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"That is .precisely to the contrast I am going to draw. I now come to two other sections which, as the honourable member for Parkes has pointed out, must be read together as being part one definite direction. I refer to sechontions"" 89 and 93. Honourable members are familiar with both of them. They may be read together as meaning that until the imposition of uniform duties of Customs, and for five years after, the Commonwealth shall, first of all, credit to each State the revenues actually collected therein by the Commonwealth, and, secondly, debit to each State its actual, expenditure in that State. Having done'that, it is to pay over month by month anv balance in favour of the State. What is the object of that direction ? It seems to me to be quite clear. I do not wish to refer to the reports of the Convention debates, because once we allow the discussion, to go back to what any member of the Convention said, we might just as well try to construe an Act of Parliament by turning to the speeches delivered upon it as reported in Hansard: Is hot the intention of the framers of the Constitution plain? They were saying to the Commonwealth: "" First of all we give you the whole of this vast revenue-by far the largest proportion of the revenue of the States. We put that into your hands to start with, and we say that we are going ultimately to allow you to adjust absolutely the proportion in which that revenue is to be divided between the States and yourself. But we say that for the first ten years you are not to take more than one-fourth of that revenue."" We then come upon a totally different' kind of provision intended, it seems to me, for a different purpose. The framers of the Constitution in passing section 93, said, in effect, to the Commonwealth : "" For five' years we are going to make you keep an account showing money ooming in and cash paid out month by month. You will have to prepare returns of what Parliament may have expended month by month. You must show what you have expended in Victoria out of the money collected in that State month by month, and what you have collected in Tasmania, and expended in that State, and so forth. But we shall only impose that .rigid system of bookkeeping, and of cash payments upon you for five years, because we think it is a discipline to which you should be subjected no longer than is necessary."" After that period, according to my view, the 'Commonwealth Parliament was to be given absolute freedom without reference to the actual expenditure or cash received, and the right was given to wipe out these two sectionsj and substitute any mode that might be thought proper for returning the surplus revenue to the States. I do not like to appear absolutely certain on a point as to which there is great difference of opinion amongst those of experience ; but I am giving what seems tome to be a Federal reading of a Federal Constitution. It was then intended, after the rigid cash payment conditions were done away with, to confer on Parliament the great trust and responsibility of fixing for all time the amount of revenue it should reserve for its own expenditure, a'nd the amount to be returned, subject only to the condition that, after the expiration of ten years, there should still be returned at least three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue to the States. Reading, the Constitution in that way, I do not intend to spend any more time on this point. I might reiterate my views over and over again j and I know there are suggestionsto be advanced on both sides. If we enter into a verbal criticism of the sections, I can quite see the possibility of arguments against my view, and I might, occupy considerable time in substantiating what I have advanced. All I venture to say, however, is that, where there are two possible views regarding the powers under these financial sections, I feel disposed to believe that the correct and true view,, which would probably be upheld by theHigh Court in the last resort, is that which imposes only such restrictions on the great financial .power given to this Parliament, as are deliberately and expressly embodied in the Constitution. If I am wrong, I am wrong in good company; and I know that the opinions of those opposed to me are entitled to quite as much respect as are my own. Turning to the Bill before us, I think that the form of it is such as to invite the criticism which has been bestowed on it by the honourable member for Parkes. Assuming the Government to be right' as to our constitutional powers, to introduce a B i ll in a form, which, taking the words of the Constitution, says that appropriation is to be deemed to be expenditure, seems to me to be either a very awkward way of expressing the meaning of "" expenditure "" as used in the Bill , or a very futile attempt to express the meaning of ""expenditure"" within the meaning of the Constitution. I agree with the criticism that the honourable membeT for Parkes has passed upon this point; but this, however, is a matter for consideration in Committee. Leaving that matter, I desire to sav that I entirely concur in the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Parramatta; and I ask honourable members to allow me to place before them, in a concise form, some of the facts which honourable members who have preceded me have referred to, v n h regard to the actual financial position we are called upon to face. place, I must say that this House has looked in vain, ever since I have been a member, to the Government for that light and leading in financial affairs to which we are entitled. There is no responsibility which is so difficult for a popular assembly to deal with as that of the management of the finances; and the only way in which it is possible to ' meet that responsibility is by the affording of some definite light and leading by the responsible Ministers of the Crown. that we have had no complete or consistent scheme of finance for the immediate future placed before us; and all that the ""amendment of the honourable member for Parramatta asks is that, before we corrimit ourselves to a great financial change under the Constitution-becaus e this Bill abrogates sections 89 and 93, .and substitutes other provisions-w e ave entitled '.o have something like an outline, at all events, of a financial policv. Up to the present, as I have indicated, the Government have put forward no policy whatever; and when speaking nearly a year ago, on the same question, I ventured to say that we were like a ship which is being steered in a fog - that no .bearings are taken, and that there is nobody' to tell us what shoals or reefs we are approaching.",46
318,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"We have never struck a reef vet! Mr W. H . ' IRVINE - What an answer is that to be given by the captain of a ship ""to a timorous passenger? Here we are, going along, full speed in the f o g ; and when a passenger asks the captain, "" Do you think it safe? "" the reply is, "" We have not yet struck a reef ! """,48

The attitude of the helpless mariners "" Property in the Bolivar seems to be the attipose, tude of the Government at the preDepartments sent time; but it is not really a laughing matter, as I think I shall be able to in a few sentences. We have had no finanunderstand cial scheme presented, though we have had disjointed utterances from various members of the Government; and, seeing that we have nothing in the way of a chart to show In the first the direction in which we are going--n o policv whatever, except for tomorrow and the day after- I have thought it my duty, as I have no doubt other honourable members have done, to make such forecasts as Ave can in regard to what is likely to take place in the future. I propose now to take the figures which have been put forward b)'. the Treasurer, and endeavour to piece them together.",48
321,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"But the honourable member says that the figures are wrong ! I find Mr W ."" H . "" IRVINE - I do not say T I agree with all the figures, but I think it will be rather instructive to the House to know the results that must inevitably follow from accepting the disjointed fragments of policy that have emanated from individual Ministers, in the absence of any policy from the Government as a whole. Of course, it is not the duty of private members, especially those sitting in Opposition, ' to frame the policy of the Government. First of all, we have a Surplus Revenue Bill introduced with a great flourish of trumpets, and many promises from my friends in the Labour corner of a vast scheme of old-age pensions almost immediately. But when we come to examine the facts, we find that, although we have a Surplus Revenue Bill , we have no surplus revenue.",48
322,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Honourable members opposite would be glad if we had no surplus revenue, but we shall have.",48
323,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Assumin g that the Government are within their constitutional rights in passing this Bill , and that we are going to exert our powers to the limit proposed, we must suppose that the States will press their legitimate constituSection 85 of the Constitution provides that the Commonwealth shall compensate the States to the value of any property passing to the The Commonwealth under that section. It is rea very simple provision; but what does it It is not merely a sort of direction, but a. legal right legally enforceable in ai court. passing"" means, I supproperty passing at the time the were taken over; and a good many years have elapsed since then. If I show know anything about such subjects, I that, if there were a suit instituted to determine what was owing to any particular State under this section, the issue would be a very simple one, namely, the ascertainment of the actual value of the asset-the property takenover-at the date it was taken over, together with the interest calculated at ordinary rates from then until the present time.",48
324,Mr WILKS,SURPLUS REVENUE,An y difference has been more than compensated for by the surplus revenue paid over since.,49
325,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I am not talking about any general constitutional direction, but about a legal right created and given to the States, which may be enforced against the' Commonwealth under these provisions of the Constitution.",49
326,Mr HARPER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"If that money had been paid, would it not have had to be debited to the States?",49
327,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The honourable member has, I think, fallen into an error which I have noticed in more than one of the discussions at Premiers' Conferences. . What the honourable member says is perfectly right up to a certain point. The money has to be debited to the States, but it has to be debited as Commonwealth expenditure ; and, so long as we have a surplus exceeding the amount of interest to be paid, it does not matter-it is merely a question of adjustment amongst the States. But once that the surplus is, according to the Treasurer's statement at the beginning of the year, £ 1 0 3 , 0 0 0 , as against £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 formerly, it is not a mere matter of adjustment. Under the Braddon section, whether the case be that of transferred or "" o the r "" expenditure, interest and sinking fund must be provided for in the case of the transferred properties; and this provision, by the way, the Treasurer estimates at £ 4 5 0 , 0 0 0 a. year.",49
328,Mr HARPER,SURPLUS REVENUE,And not charge that to the States?,49
329,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"No . The Constitution says that the Commonwealth shall compensate the States for the transferred properties. How can it compensate them if it pays for those properties out of moneys which belong to the States? In declaring that we are not to take more than one-fourth of the net Customs and Excise revenue, the Constitution means that we are to return to the States the other three-fourths. It does not mean that we are to take out of that three-fourths the money with which to compensate the States for their own properties.",49
330,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,The other side of the House is the States side; this is the national side.,49
331,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"That is the kind of remark which the Treasurer mistakes for argument. Even the figures for this year are a little misleading, and difficult to understand, so that it is quite impossible to ascertain the surplus which may be anticipated. But, according to Hansard, page 11266, the Treasurer sets down a sum of £ 4 5 0 , 0 0 0 for interest and sinking f u n d in connection with the transferred properties. If we are - to pay that amount, where is the surplus revenue? Has the Treasurer forgotten this consideration, or is he prepared to take up the posi- . tion that we are not going to compensate the States for those properties? Is he going to take up the position that that compensation may be delayed for seven years, or seventeen years, or seventy years, without paying the States any interest at all ? He must take up one of these positions. If he does not, he has no surplus. I think I shall be able to show that verysoon-eithe r next year, or the year afterhis surplus revenue will disappear.",49
332,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,The honourable member will argue that black is white.,49
333,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"P u t t in g aside the fact that we are being asked to pass a Surplus Revenue Bill , when there is no surplus revenue, I wish to invite the attention of honourable members-and .particularly of the Treasurer-to a little mosaic which I have made out of the different items which have been supplied by himself, by the Prime Minister, and by other Ministers, with a view to showing the state of the finances which we may anticipate in the immediate future if the policy of the Government-so far as we are capable of judging what it is-be given effect to. I propose to take the end of the year 1910, because that is the time when we must come to some definite adjustment of our financial relations with the States, and to show what we may anticipate will be the position of the finances in that year if the Treasurer's forecast be correct. In doing so, no doubt I shall cover ground which has already been traversed by other honourable members, but I may be forgiven for putting the position in a precise and succinct way. The Treasurer states what we all know to be a fact, namely, that the Customs and Excise revenue for the current year represents a very large sum, but that it will gradually decrease. So far we have had no intelligible analysis of the figures, and 1 think that the only way in which we can fairly approach this question .is by dealing with the Post Office as an entirely separate concern. I am justified in doing that, because the Prime Minister has intimated that that is the plan which ought to be followed. Let us suppose that the Post Office, which practically pays its own way, continues to pay its own way, and is able to provide' out of its own revenue, not perhaps all the money that is necessary for the erection of new buildings, but all that is necessary to establish a sinking fund in connection with, and to pay interest upon, any money borrowed for the erection of new buildings.",49
334,Mr BOWDEN,SURPLUS REVENUE,Does the honourable member include interest upon the transferred properties?,50
335,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,No .,50
336,Mr MAUGER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The Department can pay that, too.",50
337,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The Postmaster-' General's statement is incorrect. The partment cannot anything like pay its way ties. if the interest upon the transferred properties be included. Upon a previous occasion I showed that if we debited that partment with one-tenth of the average penditure upon new works-and ten years is a very good allowance to make for life of such works-it would be just able to pay its way. B u i if we debit with the payment of interest upon transferred properties, obviously it would not be able to do so. Therefore, I do not include that interest in my estimate.",50
338,Mr MAUGER,SURPLUS REVENUE,The honourable member mav do so.,50
339,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,I dispute that tion statement.,50
340,Mr MAUGER,SURPLUS REVENUE,I have had the figures checked quite recently.,50
341,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I propose, therepolicy, fore, to adopt the suggestion of the Prime .Minister, and to deal with the Post Office upon a separate basis. That Department is not to be treated as a profit-earning machine, but it is to be able, as a whole, to stand upon its own bottom and to proviously vide out of its increasing revenue for payment of interest and the establishment of a sinking fund in connection with works necessary for its development.",50
342,Unknown,SURPLUS REVENUE,Sitting suspended from 6.28 to 7.45 p.m.,50
343,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I am sorry I do not see the Postmaster-General in his place, because I desire before I proceed to some of the more important features of the financial position to deal with an interjection he made when I was dealing with the Post Office figures. However, I shall proceed to state the answer to the point he took up. When I said that the Post Office was just about paying its way, the honourable member for Nepean asked me whether that was taking into account the interest on the transferred Post Office properties. I answered "" No . "" The Postmaster General stated that the Department could more than pay its way, after taking into account the interest on the transferred properties. In the absence of the Postmaster General, I should like the Treasurer to give me his attention, and if I am wrong to check the figures I use, although they will be taken from the honourable gentleman's own Budget statement. Honourable members will see, if my statement is correct, that the Post and Telegraph Department cannot be expecteld to dp more than pay its way, and at present only about pays its way without taking into account Deinterest on transferred Post Office proper",50
344,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"In estimating the Devalue of the transferred property referred exto, what value does the honourable member place on the land which the States Govern the ments got for nothing, but in respect of about whicjh they wish the' Commonwealth Goi t vernment to pay a sum representing the the unealrned increment of value? Mr W . . H . IRVINE - My calculations are based on the figures placed before the House by the Treasurer himself, which are supposed to contain full information, and on which I am entitled to rely. The posiin regard to the Post Office is this: It is the policy of the Government to establish penny postage in the Commonwealth. I say that I am entirely in accord with that and that penny postage should have been established before this. The whole idea in connection with the transfer to the Commonwealth of such a Department as the Post Office was that it should not lead to an alliance, but to a fusion of the preexisting State services: In view of the the fusion which has taken place since the establishment of Federation, it is quite unreasonable that people living in outlying districts should have to pay a higher postage rate on their letters than those living in large centres of population.",50
345,Mr SPEAKER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Does the honourable member think that the matter he is now discuss discussing relates to this Bill? Mr VV. H . IRVINE - If you will allow me, sir, I will finish the sentence, and then leave the matter. I say that that would have been just as unreasonable as to have proposed that people living in remote districts of Victoria or New South Wales should have to pay a higher postage rate than those living in the larger cities of those States. As I am reminded that to pursue that line of argument would perhaps be to enter upon a discussion of Post Office policy, I will only say now that it was part of the Government policy to give effect to penny postage within the Commonwealth. Had that policy been given effect to the estimated revenue of the Post ' and Telegraph Department for next year would have been As against that we find, the expenditure this year to be as follows: The regular departmental 'expenditure amounts to £ 2 , 8 6 5 , 0 0 0 ; additional works and expenditure, £ 4 3 4 , 0 0 0 ; and there are Additional Estimates covering votes of £ 2 7 , 0 0 0 and £ 6 3 , 0 0 0 , giving a total of £ 3 , 3 8 9 , 0 0 0. But, as I said before in dealing with the Post Office Estimates, it is only fair that we should nqt encumber one year with the whole cost of additional works to be paid for out of revenue. On that principle I have adopted the Postmaster-General's 1 whidh I suggested myself-whic h is based on the assumption that the life of new works is about ten years, and that the expenditure upon them should be spread over that period. That principle has been expressly accepted in the tables submitted by the Postmaster-General himself. Having regard to the adoption of that principle in connection with expenditure on this Department, and thus reducing the item of £ 4 3 4 , 0 0 0 to £ 1 3 4 , 0 6 0 , the expenditure of the Post Office is shown to be £3,0891,000, or about £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 over what might be considered the present revenue. I again express my regret that the Postmaster-General is not present to check these figures.",50
346,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,SURPLUS REVENUE,Does the honorfor able member make allowance for the fact that the revenue from the Post Office creases very considerably every year?,51
347,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,The honourable gentleman will see that I cannot allow f o an increase of revenue without estimating also increased expenditure. I assume the Post Office should not be relied upon a profit-producing Department.,51
348,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,SURPLUS REVENUE,-It ought not to be.,51
349,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"That is so. If it could support itself, and also provide year by year a reasonable amount towards necessary extension and development, that is the most that could be expected from it. .",51
350,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The honourable member ought not to forget that the Post Office is debited with a number of charges in connection with trade and commerce, which ought not to be chatged to it .",51
351,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Does the honourable 'gentleman say that we are justified in looking to the Post Office for any substantial contribution to the revenue in the £ 2 , 0 7 3 , 0 0 0. future ?",51
352,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Yes . If we had penny postage, the revenue of the Department would be sure to go up.",51
353,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"That statement is on a par with all the vague and somewhat imaginary premises on which the Government proceed. It seems to me that they have eaten, I was going to say of the root which takes the reason prisoner, but I shall put it more mildly, and say that they appear to have taken some narcotic which has. dulled their sensibilities with regard to the terrible responsibilities estimate-a n estimate that lie before them. What an insane thing it is to say that given the establishment of penny postage we shall be justified in looking to the Post Office in the future as a great revenue-producing machine 1",51
354,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,The honourable member is arguing on a wrong assumption. I made no calculations based on the establishment of penny postage at all. ',51
355,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,SURPLUS REVENUE,And no one ever made the statement which the honourable member is attempting to - attribute to me now.,51
356,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"If the Treasurer admits it , I shall be content to proceed on the assumption that the Post Office cannot be looked to for revenue in the future. Then, with the exception of a few fees patents and such matters, which might be left out of consideration, the only insource of revenue left is the Customs and Excise. Without - exercising our own judgment, we may, for the moment, place ourselves in the position of the Governr ment, and rely upon their estimates of future revenue and expenditure - I find that, that at page 11265 of Hansard, the Treaas surer is reported as saying that he confidently anticipates that the Customs and Excise revenue will fall. That is what his officers have told him, and he to agree with them. agree that there must be some fall revenue, but I am, for the moment, going to take the figures which the honourable gentleman himself uses. As the custodian of the moneys of the people of Australia at the present critical juncture, able gentleman says that we may anticipate a fall in revenue amounting to nearly by .£2,000,000.",51
357,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,I never said anything of the kind.,52
358,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,I should be sorry to do the Minister an injustice. Sir. WILLIAM LYNE - I know what I said perfectly well.,52
359,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"At.presen t the revenue from Customs and Excise amounts to about £12,000,000. Sir WILLIAM LYNE. - Not quite. That is the honourable member's estimate, not mine.",52
360,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,Neve r mind my estimate. I am in a position in which I am not called upon to make any estimates.,52
361,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Ru t the honourable gentleman has done so. ' Mr WH IRVINE - I have; but my estimate of a normal revenue of £9,000,000 was based on the Treasurer's estimate that this year's revenue would amount to ^10,500,000. I propose for the present to keep the Minister to his own estimates I find, at page 11265 of Hansard, the following report of what took place",52
362,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,But the revenue in .succeeding years will not be so high as it is likely to be this year?,52
363,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"No . It is estimated by the departmental officers that whereas this year the revenue from Customs and Excise will be about ^12,000,000, next year it will be about ,£1,000,000 less, and in the ""following year less by 5°°,ooo at",52
364,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"No ; I never said that. The fall in the second year might be to the extent of £1,500,000 on a revenue of £12,000,000. Mr W. H. IRVINE - The singularly unfortunate in the way which he is reported by the authorized reporters of the House. I. can only read what I find reported in Hansard.",52
365,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The £1,500,000 would be the total fall in the revenue over the two years. I did not say that in the appears two years the decrease would be No doubt we all £ 2 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 . in the Mr WH IRVINE - I did not say £2,500,000, but £2,000,000. Perhaps if the Minister would wait until I read the next sentence, he will find that I was quite accurate. I will read the passage again the honorto be quite clear",52
366,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"No . It is estimated the departmenjal officers, that whereas this year the revenue from Customs and Excise will be about ^12,000,000, next year it will be about ,£1,000,000 less, and in the following year less by 500,000 at the very least. My officials inform me that they do not anticipate a revenue of more than ^'10,000,000 for the year after that unless a great change takes place. The "" year after that "" is the'one to which I have referred, the critical year of 1910. I want to know where we shall stand at the close df that year. Does the Treasurer know ? * Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I do not think the honourable member will stand where he is now.",52
367,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The honourable gentleman has consulted his departmental officials. They give him information which he repeats to the House, and, so far as he has any opinion whatever on the momentous issues which he is called upon to direct, we must take the statement of his officials as his own. Taking then the total revenue from present sources, we may anticipate that it will amount, at the time referred to, to £10,000,000. We have next to see how much of that we shall be entitled to spend. Again, I am not going to ask honourable members . to form their own conclusions, but to adopt the policy of the Government as announced by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister. They have placed before this House a statement with regard to the financial relations of the Commonwealth with the States, in which the basis of the whole scheme they propose is that they shall hand over to the the very least. States £6,000,000 a year. I shall assume for the purpose of argument that that is enough for the States, even without any subsequent increases. But in passing, I may be permitted to read to the House a few figures to show what the result would Minister is be to the States if the Government proposal were adopted. The result would be that New South Wales would receive £1,167,000 a year less than she receives at present, and Victoria would receive £670,000 a year less than she receives at present. I regard that with comparative equanimity. I think that those large States paying on.that account. - considerabl e as these amounts are-ar able to stand the shrinkage. we come to Queensland, which will be deprived of an amount of revenue £ 2 7 4 , 0 0 0 a year less than she is now enjoying. South' Australia will have to do with an income decreased by £ 2 1 0 , 0 a year; Western Australia, with an income decreased by £ 1 5 9 , 0 0 0 a year; and little Tasmania, which finds it difficult enough to make ends meet at present, will have do with £ 5 1 , 0 0 0 a year less. figures are remarkable.",52

I have read to him the motion and There is full scope for the discussion.Of the question, whether this not Bill should be passed before or after a settlement is arrived at between the Commonwealth and the States as to-the finances. It is not, however, within the .terms of the motion and the amendment to discuss whole question of possible modes of settlement, or the basis upon which those For example, if the honourable member's line of were in order, I could not prevent honourable member from discussing any of the three or four schemes which have that been suggested for the settlement of the difficulties between the Commonwealth and the States. It will be' seen that if those schemes, or any, or all of them, were"" dis-cussed with such fulness as the honourable member is discussing the question, we .should be engaged for weeks upon this debate; and I think it must be quite clear that we should be proceeding beyond the .bounds prescribed by the motion and the - amendment. The honourable member is perfectly at liberty to discuss whether an .agreement between the States and the Commonwealth should be arrived at before this Bill is agreed tc, but I do not think that he should discuss the terms upon which an - agreement may ultimately be arrived at between those two bodies. Mr VV. H . IRVINE - I shall endeavour, sir, to keep entirely within the which you have laid down. But I should .have thought that, on a motion of this sort, if was practically impossible to discuss advisability of dealing with this change in - our Constitution-becaus e it is a change in the Constitution-inasmuc h as it means substituting a new provision for sections 89 and 93 of the Constitution, and for all time-withou t dealing' with the matters which I was discussing. I question whether 'Such a question should be dealt with until this House has been given some general idea of the policy of the Government with .respect to the whole financial relations of the Commonwealth with the States. I do not see, therefore, how we can possibly limit the discussion within the bounds prescribed. However, I shall endeavour to obey your ruling. I do not intend to enter into the details of the scheme at all. I merely desire to point out, as part of the general position with which we are faced, that the sum of £6,000,000 to be returned to the States is an amount which, under no possible scheme, can Ave get under. It is the lOAvest amount. I do not think that any section of this House desires to embarrass the States to such a degree as Would be involved in paying back to them an amount of Customs and Excise revenue less than - C6,000,000 per annum.

382,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,That depends on the increase of the population.,54
383,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Again , I must say that I desire to accept the statement of the Treasurer, and I can only go upon that. If there be an increased population-as we all desire and hope there will be-ther e Avill be an increase of the functions of government and of the cost of government. We have tb take some basis upon which to rest the argument, and I am taking the position as the - Treasurer put it - Taking £6,000,000 out of the £10,000,000 for payment to the States, Ave are left with £4,000,000 as the normal available revenue of the CommonAvealth. As against that £4,000,000, I find that the current expenditure of the present year-omittin g the Post Office-come s to £3,149,000. It is a very simple question of figures; a A'ery simple sum. The Treasurer himself set us the elements of it ; and it needs only a little addition and subtraction to arrive at the sum of £3,149,000, whioh has to ruling come out of tha £4,000,000 of CommonAvealth revenue anticipated by the Treasurer. That leaves the sum of £851,000 the anticipated by the Government at the end of 1910 as the total amount available for all other Commonwealth purposes - NOAV, what are the claims made upon this £851,000? We are told that a scheme of old-age pensions is going to be brought in. NOAV, sir, the passing of an old-age pensions scheme has been discussed in connection Will this Bill. All I am going to say about it at the present stage is this : I have always thought that it - would be wiser to leaA'e the administration of old age pensions to the States. In that I mav be wrong. I find that the States Governments themselves - haA'e already practically assented* to hand OA*er the administration of old-age pensions to the Federal Government.",54
384,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,That is not correct.,54
385,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"If ""they get a satisfactory scheme; that is, they are conditionally willing to do so.",54
386,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"If Ave adopt everything else that they propose. Mr W. H. IRVINE - I find that 'an overwhelming majority of this House is of opinion that the matter of old-age pensions should be transferred to the Common-, wealth.",54
387,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,But not'under those conditions.,54
388,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"In the circumstances, I consider it niy duty to do AvhateA'er I can to aid in carrying out the policy which the majority of this House desires. That is all that I intend to say upon the question at present. But let us see Avhat the result will be if the present policy, of the Government Will regard to old-age pensions be carried out. We haA'e an anticipated surplus of £ 8 5 1 , 0 0 0 . As . Mr WH IRVINE against that we have a scheme of old-age pensions involving an annual expenditure to have saidof, I take it , £1,500,000 ",54
389,Mr WILKS,SURPLUS REVENUE,"One £1.800,000 . That is in the morning newspapers.",55
390,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"About £ 1 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 ' Mr WH IRVINE - I should be curious to know what is the authority lot the statement mentioned by the honourable member for Dalley. But I shall adhere to the responsible statements of the Government of this Commonwealth. Therefore, I will take the estimate of £ 1 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 . am not counting anything for administration. In addition to that, we have only to look to the Prime Minister's speech on defence to see that the lowest amount of' additional expenditure that we may expect in 1910 on account of the Defence Department will be £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year. In addition to that we have what has already been referred to-takin g the Treasurer's own figures-the interest and sinking fund on account of the transferred properties, because we surely cannot ask the States to accept £ 6 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum, and tb pay the interest on their transferred - properties out of it. We have, therefore, to provide £ 4 5 0 , 0 0 0 for interest and sinking fund on that account. We have also another proposal, agreed to by the Government, for taking over the Northern Territory from South Australia. The Treasurer estimates, on the same page of Hansard to which I have referred before, that that will cause an annual loss of £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 . - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I did not say annual loss; I said an annual expenditure.",55
391,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"An .additional expenditure, in respect of which the Treasurer was careful not to anticipate any revenue.",55
392,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"It is not a loss. The honourable member's statement is unfair. There may be returns, and, probably, will be important returns.",55
393,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I always like to fund talk by the book. says he referred - to annual expenditure, and not annual loss. I will read what he ture said.",55
394,Mr BRUCE SMITH,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Before the honoram able member reads the passage, it is the Treasurer never said it !",55
395,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I am not like honourable member; I always stick to what 1 say. - This is what the Treasurer has the misfortune to be reported Then again the deficiency estimate is the deficiency 1in connection with the administration of the Northern Territory in 1905-6 was ^121,000, and it . is estimated that a further expenditure of ^25,000 will be required, so that a total of ^146,000 is set down in respect of the expenditure of the territory for 1920. Provision is also made for a deficit of ^50,000 on the working of the Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie railway; ,£210,000 in respect of the deficit in connection with the Oodnadatta to Pine Creek railway I Mr HUTCHISON - The Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie railway, has nothing to do with the Northern Territory.",55
396,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I do not want to enter into that question now, but the scheme for taking over the Northern Territory involved the consent of South Australia to the construction of the line westward, and I think that is what the Treasury officials referred to. I am not responsible for the logic of the Treasurer's statement. This is the Treasurer's statement, given with his authority. "" Sir WILLIAM LYNE - No , it is not. It was put on the {able againstmy wish, at the instance of the honourable member.. I said at the time that I would not vouch for' its correctness.",55
397,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"That is quite true. The Treasurer did say so - But he said that he had asked his officers to give him an estimate of future expenditure, and this is it.",55
398,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I said it was unan safe. I was not anxious to do it , because it was not checked.",55
399,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,The honourable member is never anxious to give us information.,55
400,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I did that at the honourable member's instigation, and against my own desire, for his convenience ",55
401,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Then the Treasurer goes onAnd ^'9.3,000 in respect c f interest and sinking on the cost of the Port Augusta to OodnaThe Treasurer now datta line. He also mentioned an estimated expendiof £ 4 5 0 , 0 0 0 in respect of interest and sinking fund on transferred properties. I not dealing with what will happen, but wrong; with what the Government say will happen. They have entered into a contract the with the South Australian Government for taking over the Northern Territory. Unless they are going to jettison the whole of that portion of their policy, they must propose to ask this House for authority for that proposed expenditure. Are we not entitled to consider it in connection with the financial future immediately before us? Surely, as reasonable men, we are entitled to some explanation. If all we are allowed to do is to piece together these little bits of explanation that we get from different Ministers, then I suppose that is the best we can do. The result is that, as against £ 8 5 1 , 0 0 0 , which would be the amount available for everything except the ordinary current expenditure of the Departments, we shall have to meet an annual expenditure of £ 2 , 8 5 0 , 0 0 0 , all to be in the immediate future under the definite policy of the Government. We shall have to meet it with less than £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 .",55
402,Mr KELLY,SURPLUS REVENUE,"And that estimated expenditure does not include the iron bounty. ' Mr WH IRVINE - It includes no provision for giving bounties for the encouragement of the iron industry, or, in fact, any bounties. It includes no provision for the Western Australian railway, if ever it should be made, or for the Federal Capital. It includes nothing whatever for what, I think, throughout the length and breadth of Australia is recognised now to be one of the main functions of a Federal Government-the encouragement of settlers to come here and help us to people this continent. Without providing for any of those national ends, which we all look for, we find that we shall be landed, according to the definite policv of the Government, within two years from now, in a deficit of £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year.",56
403,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,And with the termination of the Braddon section. honourable member does not say anything about that.,56
404,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"That lets the cat out of .the bag. Sir . JOHN FORREST - Then the Government are going to rob the States ! xVIr. W. H . IRVINE - A r e we to under- stand that the magnificently generous offer of £ 6 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year to the States Treasurers is simply a blind-that it is to be dangled before them until the end of 1910, and that, then, even that is to be taken awav from them?",56
405,Mr SPEAKER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I have really failed, after the utmost endeavour to understand the honourable member's line of argument, to see that the matter to which he is referring is within the bounds of the motion now before the House. If the honourable member will, kindly tell me how he means to link it to that motion, I shall be only too pleased to permit him to proceed. But, unless I understand how he proposes to do so, I really cannot allow him to go further.",56
406,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I was not entering then into any discussion of the subject. Perhaps, owing to the interjections, you, sir, may not have entirely heard my last remarks. I was not entering in the slightest degree upon the details of any scheme, but I pointed out that, with the scheme outlined by the Government for the future financial relations of the Commonwealth with the States, we should be incurred . landed within two. years in a deficit of £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 , without starting to perform any of the services for which the country is looking, when the Treasurer interjected- "" But we shall be at the end Of the Braddon section.""",56
407,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Hear , hear.",56
408,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"W as it not immediately applicable and appropriate to that remark that I should point out that the Treasurer will be no freer when the Braddon section is at an end than he is now, unless he desires to repudiate the proposal that he has put before the States Treasurers ?",56
409,Mr SPEAKER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I was not referring merely to the last utterances of the honourable member, but practically to all he has said , since I had to ask his attention a few minutes since. The honourable member should address himself to the reasons why this Bil l should not be further considered until after some agreement has been come to between the Commonwealth - and the States. If he will do that, he will be comThe pletely in order, but the remarks that he has made during the last quarter of an hour are not, in my opinion, germane to the question now before the Chair, unless it is the intention of the honourable member to show that we cannot affordto set apart this money in this way. If that is his argument.. I have no more to say, but I did nof understand that that was so, and, therefore, I am anxious to know what he is arguing.",56
410,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I desire, with your permission, sir, to claim my right, as a member of this House, to show, on a great financial debate, when we are asked to alter the structure of the financial provisions of. the Constitution, that we ought not to do so until the Government lay .some definite financial policy before us. I submit that it would be curtailing the privileges of members of this'House enormously if we were not allowed to pursue the course that I have been pursuing so far. Am I to lie tongue-tied? Are we to be expected to vote for this Bill, to change the financial machinery, without having any idea of what lies before us in the ""immediate future?",56
411,Mr SPEAKER,SURPLUS REVENUE,I have asked the honourable member whether he intends to show that we cannot afford this new departure.,57
412,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"All my remarks tended to show that it would be in the highest degree unwise, if not improper, to force the House to accept this alteration in the financial scheme of the Constitution until a definite policy has been placed before it with regard to the financial relations of the Commonwealth with the States, and with regard to what, we may anticipate from those relations.",57
413,Mr SPEAKER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"On that head, I am sorry to have to rule that the honourable member's remarks have not been in order; but would more appropriately be addressed to a Committee on a Budget speech, or some such occasion. This debate must be confined to two points; first, the desirability or otherwise of passing this Bill, and next, in the alternative, the desirability of delaying its passage until an agreement of some kind, which need not be specified, has been come to between the States and theGommonwealth.",57
414,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I have almost concluded my remarks upon that head, but I really cannot understand what the precise limits of the debate are. Am I not to be allowed to discuss the fact that the Ministry have not put forward any comprehensive or comprehensible policy of finance?",57
415,Mr SPEAKER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I will ask the honourable member, when I have replied to his question, to proceed with his speech. I am not prepared to have the matter discussed backwards and. forwards between the honourable member and myself. It seems to me that the scope of the debate, now. in progress, is this : First, for all those who have not already spoken to the main question, to discuss the advisability of passing, or not passing, the Bill. The honourable member 1 has already, on a previous occasion, addressed himself to that question. There remains, therefore, the second question of whether the further consideration of the Bill should be deferred 'until after some agreement, the terms of which need not .be specified, has 'been come to between the Commonwealth and the States. That question alone is open to the honourable member to debate now.",57
416,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I shall try to keep within your ruling, sir. I submit that we ought' riot to be asked, without any knowledge of what our actual financial relations with the States are to be, to enter blindfold into a career that may land us in a financial quagmire. Once we have met the States, and come to an agreement with them, we shall. know where we are. Now we do not. The whole burden of my remarks has.' been to show that the light, and leading that we might have expected from the Government has been denied to us. We have not got the facts.",57
417,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,They do not know.,57
418,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I am forced to believe that they do not know, because I cannot conceive that they would willingly keep from the House information so material to our coming to a conclusion upon the amendment now before us. If they, do not know, surely that in itself is suflicient reason why this Bill should not be passed until they do know, and until they enable the House to know."" I shall not take up the time of the House mucb longer. I find myself more or less hampered by not knowing exactly how far I can go. But from what 1I have said, it is obvious that by. this measure, which the honourable member for Parramatta desires should be postponed until we have some definite settlement of the financial position, we are asked to . embark on a stream of which we do not' know the end. A ll we know is that we are approaching the rapids. We do not know how near they are. We know that provision will have to be made almost immediately to meet the great additional expenses that are coming upon us, and that there will have to be either some definite scheme of reduction of expenditure - althoug h it is hard to see at present in what directions expenditure can be reduced-o r some definite scheme or outline of a scheme for considerable direct taxation, or else we shall have to refuse at the end of 1910, as the Treasurer seemed to forecast a few minutes ago, to give the States or the States Parliaments anything like the amount which we have hitherto given to them. One of .those three courses must be open to us. Before we pass this measure, are we not entitled, as a House, to demand from the Government a more or less definite forecast of their intentions with regard to those matters? We are now at the most critical time in the history of this country. We are at a time when we know that the trouble is before us. We can see it. The Treasurer's own figures that he has given to the House, and the Prime Minister's own explanations, show us the trouble right in front of us. Are we then to - give this enormous power - to make this momentous change in the whole financial policy of the Commonwealth-withou t having the ordinary leading which every representative House is entitled in such a matter to expect from the Government that conducts its affairs?",57
419,Mr WISE,SURPLUS REVENUE,The honourable member said he was going to support this Bill .,58
420,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,When did I say that ?,58
421,Mr WISE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"On the 31st March last honourable member said, "" I shall feel pelled even now to support it . """,58
422,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Ver y we'd, I shall support the principle of the Bill , us? but I shall certainly not support' its sage until we have some definite financial arrangement with the States.",58
423,Mr WISE,SURPLUS REVENUE,That is a somersault.,58
424,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Of course, the honourable gentleman's quotation is an apt either. one, and I have no doubt that I said what he quoted; but since that time, all these figures have been placed before the House.",58
425,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,I do not think so.,58
426,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,We have had information concerning some of the additional expenditure on defence. We have had a definite promise from the Prime Minister.,58
427,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,The whole of the to the House. figures were lying oh the tablewhen the honourable member made that statement.,58
428,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,The honourable member is in error.,58
429,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,I am not; because they were laid on the table before that of the speech. time.,58
430,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The honourable member is in error, because it had not even been intimated then that the Government proposed, in this session, to introduce Old-age Pensions Bill .",58
431,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Yes , it .was.",58
432,Mr WEBSTER,SURPLUS REVENUE,That ' is The honourable member.wants to oppose the institution of old-age pensions?,58
433,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,The honourable member can say that; but I have told the to I exercise House exactly my position.,58
434,Mr WILSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,In Victoria we have a system of old-age pensions.,58
435,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Yes . I have told the House-and I suppose the honourable member for Gwydir. was not present at the moment-that I have always expressed the opinion that it would be a great deal wiser if the Federation did not take over the matter of old-age pensions, and that it would be administered more economically and more efficiently by the States. But I have also said that, as an overwhelming majority of the members of this House, had been returned by their constituents to carry out that transference, I considered it my duty to aid them in that work, and to do everything I could towards making the scheme efficient. Before ' we commit ourselves to any such scheme, we should have .some comprehensive and comprehensible statement of the finanthe cial position. What is the outlook? The comGovernment takes no responsibility. We are rapidly approaching a crisis in our finances, and how is the Government leading The Treasurer sits at the table and pasfinds himself incapable when asked, on many occasions, to explain the simplest matter relating to the finances.",58
436,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"That is a very in sulting thing to say, and it is not true,",58
437,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,The Prime M in ister can explain anything and everything ; he can even explain his own explanations.,58
438,Mr WISE,SURPLUS REVENUE,That is more insulting.,58
439,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"But beyond the vaguest, wildest promises for the future, we are asked to support this B i ll blindfold, before any financial statement is made The honourable member for Gippsland, in citing one portion of my speech, ought at least to have done me the simple justice of citing what I said at the end of it.",58
440,Mr WISE,SURPLUS REVENUE,I quoted the very last words,58
441,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"If the honourable member will be kind enough to let me see the passage I will read it. I had argued the constitutional view, and an. pointed out that if my suggestions were adopted",58
442,Mr WISE,SURPLUS REVENUE,The honourable member anthe trouble. ticipated the amendment.,58
443,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I said, as reported on page 9866 of Hansardhold, however, that when we are called upon our extremely important duties in regard to the financial relations of the States and the Commonwealth, and are asked, on the eve of a Conference of Premiers, to delay what is, after all, only a fractional part of the settlement of the financial question-to stay our hand until those representing States interests have had an opportunity to put their views before us-w e ought not to regard such a request as unreasonable. It would have been infinitely wiser for the Government to bring in this proposal as part of a general scheme for the settlement of the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States. I therefore regret that we are forced now to vote upon the Bill. I should very much prefer to see its further consideration, postponed by the Government; but if we are forced to vote upon the actual merits of the Bill , then, thinking, as I do, that it is not only within our constitutional powers, but embodies a prudent nnd sensible course to adopt, I shall feel compelled even now to support it. I am quite prepared to make the honourable member a present of that. Some three or four months after earnestly beseeching the Government to bring in financial proposals, and to deal' with this question them, and after regretting that they had not done so, I said that I would feel obliged t.o vote for the Bill if they forced it upon me.",58
444,Mr WEBSTER,SURPLUS REVENUE,Six weeks ago.,59
445,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"T w o months ago. I do not feel inclined to vote for the Bill now-and my honourable friend can make, the most of it-and I have given unreasons.",59
446,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"They would not have Royal Commission three weeks ago, and pone they have swallowed that in much less time.",59
447,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,Yes . The honsive orable member for Parramatta has drawn the Government. my attention to a passage in my speech. I am not fond of citing my own speeches.,59
448,Mr WISE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I should think not, after that.",59
449,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"In the same speech, as the honourable member for Parracame matta has pointed out to me, I saidSubject to one important consideration, to which I shall refer in a moment, I think this is a very reasonable business-like proposition myself in entire accord with him. to make, and that it does not impinge upon rights of the States.",59
450,Sir JOHN EORKEST,SURPLUS REVENUE,"It is curious, if this is so clearly conferred by the Constitution, that it has not occurred to any one before to seek to use it.",59
451,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I am afraid that sometimes it does not occur to us to do that which we ought to do - Having regard to the view I have expressed, I should not in ordinary circumstances have the slightest difficulty in giving my entire support to this Bill , but I must sav that I feel that it is very unfortunate that it should have been brought forward at the present juncture. [420] If the honourable member for Gippsland has got any comfort out of that little bit - of verbal inconsistency, I am willing to make him a present of it. If it had gone to a vote then, I have no doubt that I would have voted for the Bil l as I had said that I would; but now I do not intend to vote for it .",59
452,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,I never thought that the honourable member would.,59
453,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I intend to vote for the amendment. If I have advanced reasons which ought to affect the minds of the honourable member for Gippsland and others, it will not be a very effective reply to those reasons to show that I may have been - inconsistent. I have often been inconsistent.",59

456,Mr WILSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Oh , never ! Mr W. ""H. IRVINE - If the Minister has never been inconsistent, that is only because he is never subject to development. When I find that the figures which have been placed before us by the Government, and for which they are responsible, lead to results such as I. have indicated tonight, I do not care in the slightest degree what I should have done on any other occasion.

457,Mr HARPER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Mernda) [8.39] - I listened with the greatest interest to the speech made by the honourable member for Flinders. The first part of it seemed to me to be admirable, but the latter part upon me as a surprise. I listened to my honourable and learned friend, on the 31st March, when he enunciated the that views which he has just read, and I found In the the first part of his speech to-night he dealt with the constitutional question, and power I think that he stated the case admirably.",59
458,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Yes , from his point of view.",59
459,Mr HARPER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"To my mind, his argument was, and is, unanswerable. It is incomprehensible, at any rate to me, that any one should believe that those who drafted the Constitution meant, when they provided that three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue was to be given to the States, to tie the hands of this Parliament in the disposal of the balance by limiting its powers of appropriation to the mere mechanical process of passing over the money. It seems to me that the view which, some honourable members entertain is untenable. The right honourable member, for Swan interjected just now, "" That was from his stand-point."" But, in his speech on Friday, the right honourable gentleman informed the House that it was practically impossible to limit it to the expenditure for the year, because we had to pot the money into trust funds now, and practically evade the law in order to pay our just debts.",59
460,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,I did not say°that.,60
461,Mr HARPER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The right honourable gentleman said so distinctly. He admitted that, for services which had been rendered but not paid for, the money was put asidein order to meet the claims.",60
462,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I said that, so long as the services had been rendered, it was right.",60
463,Mr HARPER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"That admission and the practice of the Department show clearly that it could not have been the intention of the authors of the Constitution to tie the hands of this Legislature in any such manner. I do not think that one need labour that argument. I consider that the last speaker has placed the matter before the House in a reasonable and fair way, and, to my mind, there is no answer to his . position. But when he went on to support his position by. references which it seemed - to me would.only be appropriate to a discussion on proposals for the settlement of the 'financial relations between the States and the Commonwealth, and that were not relevant to the question immediately before us, he tried to make a case t'o show that we should place ourselves in a position to meet all the obligations which have been foreshadowed before we proceed with this Bill . . In that it seemed to me that he failed. The only question now is whether we shall secure for this Parliament the appropriation and the disposal of the one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue which the Constitution has placed at its disposal. I ask the honourable gentleman for what reason we should be limited iii our action in . respect of our one-fourth share, ancl what relation the settlement of that question has to any future obligations which this Parliament may incur?",60
464,Mr WILSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,It has everything with it.,60
465,Mr HARPER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"There is no connection, it seems to me, between the two questions. In passing this Bill , we avail ourselves of our right under the Constitution to arrange for the appropriation bf one-fourth of the net revenue from Customs and Excise duties. That is the sole business before us to-night. I think that the honourable member for Flinders gave away his case when he told us that there would be no revenue available.",60
466,Mr FAIRBAIRN,SURPLUS REVENUE,Then why the Bill ?,60
467,Mr HARPER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"In another year there may be revenue available, and, if there is not, the Bill will harm no one. It shows, to my mind,' that my honourable friend's argument on that point was on an unsound basis. He got away from the question, and dealt with another matter. I do not underrate its importance, and, at the. proper time, when we have all the facts before us, I submit that his opinion and the views ^vhich he has partly enunciated to us would be of the greatest value. But they are not now strictly relevant. I interjected in the early part of his speech, when he urged as a reason for not passing the Bill that no provision had been made for the settlement of - the transferred properties, "" If that money had been paid would it not have had to be debited to the States?"" According to 'his view, the States would have a claim for something like £ 4 5 0 , 0 0 0 annually. To my interjection he replied that, as it was a Commfonwealth liability, it should be paid out of the bne- fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue - which the Commonwealth has the right to spend. I was intensely surprised by the remark, because the States Premiers, who must be supposed to have looked closely into the Constitution, and to have made themselves thoroughly acquainted witli the financial right of .this Parliarwmt, have taken an opposite view.",60
468,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,Not at every Conference.,60
469,Mr HARPER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The right honourable member for Swan has laid down very clearlv what I look upon as the correct view in this matter. He interjected just now, when I quoted a remark of the honourable and learned member for Flinders, that the latter was expressing his own view. The latter may now retort that, in the document from which I am about to read, to do the right honourable member was doing the same. In a memorandum published among the appendices to the report of the Treasurers' Conference on "" States debts, transferred properties, immigration, & c , "" held in Melbourne, in February, 1904, the honourable and learned member wroteAs the Government has been advised until the determination of the period the interest on the value of the transferred property must be a charge against each State, on the amounts credited to the State, there is no need for any action in regard to payment till the book-keeping period expires; as the amount of interest to be faid by each State would be exactly the same amount as would be charged against each State.",60
470,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I said that "" the Government had been advised."" the honourable member will not make me responsible for a legal opinion tendered to the Government?",61
471,Mr HARPER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I shall not make .the honourable and learned gentleman responsible ' for more than his own statements. Two-passages which I am about to quote will show the position which he then occupied - He stated "" four proposals for payment,"" and said in regard to the secondI can see no advantage either to the Commonwealth or the States by this proposal. mean that the Commonwealth would have to pay, at 3^ per cent., ^315,000 a year interest, and have to charge the same amount to the States during the book-keeping period, and afterwards t ill the loans matured, in proportion to the numbers of their people.",61
472,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,They back less.,61
473,Mr HARPER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"They do not get back less. They get what they are debited with. The right honourable gentleman continued If a State is to receive a benefit in action, some other State or States must bear the burden. It therefore follows as self-evident that the Commonwealth is really not so vitally interested (except as the guardian of all the States) in the equitable settlement of the matter, or in the equity of the claims made, as the States themselves, for the people of the States have to pay fercafita the claims made by all the States. The arrangement for valuing the properties should be such as wil l meet with the approval of the States, and I do not anticipate any difficulty in deciding upon a procedure which will be mutually satisfactory. Notwithstanding that, until the termination of the book-keeping period, the interest paid to and charged against the States is the same amount, and, therefore, in any case only a book entry, it is, I think, very desirable to deal with the liquidation of the - compensation as soon as possible.'",61
474,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,"We were returning - £ 8 0 0 , 0 00 or £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year. would mean returning less. [420]- 2",61
475,Mr HARPER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I am dealing with the settlement of the claim of the States in connection with properties transferred to the Commonwealth, arid the view expressed by the right honourable gentleman is that that which I have . urged, and now hold, book-keeping namely, that if the transferred properties are paid for, they must be paid for by the States as between themselves, the balance, if any, alone remaining to be dealt with as part of our financial scheme. It seems to me, therefore, that the honourable and learned member for Flinders has not taken what I consider a fair and equitable view of the case. Until we discuss the settleSurely ment of the States debts question, we should postpone the consideration of how far we are exceeding our means by the payment' of old-age pensions, the provision of further defence, or in any other direction. The question of the transferred properties does not enter into the case with which we are now dealing. When we art considering the whole financial position will be the occasion for honourable members to express their opinions on the policy of Ministers as to future expenditure. I anxiously await the statement of It.would their proposals. The amendment, if carried, will mean the indefinite postponement of a question which ought to be settled at once, in the interests of, hot only the 'Commonwealth, but also the States. We should see that the onewould get fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue which we are entitled to spend is placed wholly at our disposal, so that when we appropriate we shall know that the money, will be within our control until expended. A State Treasurer who has a surplus at this trans- the end of a year can keep the money in the Treasury until revoted next year; but if this Parliament appropriates money for a particular purpose, and it is not' expended during, the vear in which it is voted, it must be paid into the Treasuries of the States, and pass irrevocably from the Commonwealth revenue fund, and . we must provide for expenditure, out of the revenue of future vears. I am surprised that honourable members do not see that this, is not a proposal to take from the States anything to which they are entitled. If we were able to spend within, any one year onefQurth of the revenue from Customs and' Excise, the States would have no right to complain, and does the right honourable This member for Swan contend that they wish to obtain money which we are entitled to spend, but which, because of the awkwardness of the financial arrangements of the Constitution, we cannot now put aside for future expenditure?",61
476,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,The States have always expected the return of unexpended bs.ld.ncGS,62
477,Mr HARPER,SURPLUS REVENUE,They claim that they ' are entitled to receive what we cannot expend within the financial year.,62
478,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Why have we not done from the first what it is now said that we can do? . Mr HARPER - In the early years of Federation we had surpluses, and handed the money back to the States, getting small thanks for our liberality. We have given to the States between £6,000,000 and £7,000,000 more than they would have been' entitled to receive had we been able hence ? to appropriate the whole of our one-fourth of the revenue from Customs and Excise. Sir JOHN. FORREST - Why did not the Commonwealth appropriate those surduring pluses?",62
479,Mr HARPER,SURPLUS REVENUE,The right . honourable gentleman is now opposing a Bill which gives us power to appropriate.,62
480,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I say that that power cannot be .given by such a Bill. cording to the honourable member's argudelay ment, the appropriation could have taken place.",62
481,Mr HARPER,SURPLUS REVENUE,No . I have stated that our appropriations become ineffective gard to money not expended during financial year in which it is voted.,62
482,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,Coul d we from the beginning have appropriated money and put it aside for future use?,62
483,Mr HARPER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"No , and we cannot so now. The object of the Bill is to alter the position.",62
484,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Coul d we, by a Bill of this kind, have made provision for appropriation and putting aside?",62
485,Mr HARPER,SURPLUS REVENUE,Of course.,62
486,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,Fro m the beginthe ning?,62
487,Mr HARPER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"No ; since the expiration, tion of the bookkeeping period. That be done under a power conferred by the Constitution.",62
488,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,I think that it not be done now more than then.,62
489,Mr HARPER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"That we omitted to do what we could have done some years ago is not a reason for not doing it now. question is merely-Shal l the Commonhis wealth Parliament be enabled to control one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue which the Constitution allows it to expend? To speak as if the future financial arrangements with the States wore concerned, is to go beyond the question. The Bill has nothing to do with future financial arrangements. Until 1910 the Commonwealth is entitled to expend one-fourth of the revenue from Customs and Excise, and it seems idle to""object to. Parliament providing for the appropriation of any part of the one-fourth for purposes for .which it cannot be applied in the current financial year.",62
490,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,To be used in future years?,62
491,Mr HARPER,SURPLUS REVENUE,Perhaps to be used - next year.,62
492,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,O r twenty years,62
493,Mr HARPER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"At the end of 1910 the financial position must be settled on a different basis. There are only two years which the measure will be effective. If it is constitutional, and it is also a matter of business necessity to do this, why not pass the Bill instead of waiting for the settlement of a question of infinitely greater importance, the' general financial relations Acof the States and the Commonwealth? Why doing what is right and proper for the sake of something with which we are not now concerned?",62
494,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The honourable in reand learned member for Bendigo says that the it is not right, legal, and proper.",62
495,Mr HARPER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"There is great difference of opinion on the constitutional question. I am stating my views as a layman."" I do not pretend to understand the niceties do of the law, and am quite prepared to consider, with every respect, the views of honourable members who differ from me. But believing, as I do, that this. Bill is not only constitutional and justifiable, but absolutely necessary, I shall support it. We ought to have the power to appropriate one-fourth of Customs and Excise revenue, to which, under the Braddon secthe Commonwealth is entitled, without can being limited by our ability to expend it within any one year. That is my position. I confess'that I listened, with great surcanprise, to the latter part of the speech delivered by the honourable member for Flinders, because, when he spoke on a previous occasion, I found myself in entire The agreement with him'. He has since altered position; I have not. I am still of the the view that, apart from party considerations, honourable members on all sides of the House should unite to uphold the right of this Parliament to expend the Commonwealth's one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue, when we see our way to do 130, and to appropriate it in any manner that we think fit.",62
496,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"East Sydney) [9.2] - I do not wish to take up the time of the House with any reiteration of the remarks so ably made by the honourable ancl learned member for Parkes, and - the honourable and learned member for Flinders. I desire to congratulate them upon the able speeches which they have delivered on the motion for the second reading of this Bill , although on one very important point that we have to consider they have taken opposite opinions. I agree with the honourable and learned member for Flinders that the constitutional point involved in the B i one upon which there may very well be two opinions. No one could speak confidently as to the interpretation 'that would be placed by the High Court upon the sections that have been referred to. But one of the remarkable features of this . Bill is the fact that its main object was never dreamt of until a few days ago - The centre of interest in connection with the Surplus Revenue Bill is the fact that it may enable us, in advance of the termination of the Braddon section, to give a commencement to the system of old-age pensions. That idea was riot in the minds of the Government when the Bill was introduced. When the Treasurer, on the 31st March lastabout two months ago-move d that it be read a second time, he named a number of important services for which he wished to provide by means of it. Strange to say, - amongst the important services which he - enumerated, old-age pensions did not find a place. The Treasurer then told the House that a large number Of public.works would have to be provided for ; that certain large expenditure in connection with the defence system of Australia would have to be faced; but from first to last, in his - speech, there was not even a suggestion that this Bill was intended to lay the foundation of an Australian system of old-age pensions.",63
497,Mr LIVINGSTON,SURPLUS REVENUE,That was an afterthought.,63
498,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"It was either an afterthought, or a deception, and I certainly - do not accuse the Treasurer of deception. I feel sure that .he would have been delighted to tell the House, when moving the second reading of this Bill , that his main object in introducing it was to give a beginning to a system which meets with almost universal approval. That being so, 1 can only put on his conduct the charitable construction that he had no idea of placing by this Bill a sum to the credit of an old age pensions system.",63
499,Mr WILKS,SURPLUS REVENUE,Until after the resolution in favour of old-age pensions was carried on a grievance day.,63
500,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Severa l resolutions were passed, including one which makes the omission, on the part of the Treasurer, all the more extraordinary. Strange to say, on the 17th March- a fortnight before the Treasurer introduced this Bill-tli e leader of the Labour Party, on grievance day, brought the subject of old-age pensions before the House. The question was full y l l is before the Government. Anything in the shape of an amendment to the ordinary motion, that, the House resolve itself into Committee of Supply on grievance day, gives the Ministry a nervous attack. They could not possibly have forgotten that resolution. The leader of the Labour Party suddenly discovered the urgency of old-age pensions. That discovery came after an exclamation from the deputy leader of the Opposition, who said to the leader of the Labour Party, "" What have you been doing all these years in the way of putting practical pressure upon this Government, which you hold in the hollow of your hand?'' Shortly after that the question of old-age pensions assumed a practical phase. My honourable friend, the leader of the Labour Party, challenged the Government upon it, by moving an amendment on the Order of the Day for going into Committee of Supply. That is a pointed procedure, ' which demands respect even when it is adopted by the honourable member for Gwydir, and, infinitely more so, when adopted by the leader .of the Labour Party. But, although that step was taken in the middle of March, and the second reading of this BilL was moved a fortnight afterwards, tliere was not a word from the Treasurer about the intention of the Government to found this great system-in favour of which, I think, every party stands today-upo n this Bill . That is significant as showing the truth of the remark uttered by the honourable and learned member for Flinders, that this House has no leadership at all in connection with not only large financial questions, but any public question. The wonder is that with a Government without any policy or leadership-wit h a Government which drifts about with every current that sets in from a certain quarter-honorabl e members on this side of the House do not show a stronger and more united front in dealing with great questions of public concern. It is about time-especiall y now that the fiscal question has teen removed from the arena of politics-that honourable members who sit on the same side of the House should make up their minds whether they are honestly sitting in opposition to, or in support of. the Government.'",63
501,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,SURPLUS REVENUE,That is the to talk to them !,64
502,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I am very glad to be able to make this acknowledgement after the unfortunate division which made it sible for us to work together. While the lamented. Tariff was under discussion, I franklv recognised from the first that it would be impossible for us to join on fiscal questions. It would have dishonoured many honorwe able members if they had endeavoured to work for any free-trade party in connection with the Tariff, and we, of course, could not work with them against our policy. But now that the Tariff has become l a w , am glad to see, in reference to the shortState comings of Ministers, an attitude which will conduce to a healthier atmosphere in this House.. The atmosphere here has, for long time, been, utterly demoralized. A sorts of things have been done, and all sorts of things have been left undone, and scarcely - the slightest breeze of protest discontent has been raised. I wish to acknowledge the action which honourable memin. bers below the gangway have taken in asment, suming a fair share of their responsibility to the public of Australia. It is a common responsibility; and I am glad that we are now able to act together on large matters of public policy. The honourable learned member for Flinders has, I think, acted up to the highest traditions ""of public life. He has made his position pretty - clear for a long time past, and he has allowed his political leanings to interfere with his judgment as to the constitutional aspect of this Bill . On all constitutional matters, we ought to absolutely put aside any suggestion of party feeling, or any fluence of our judgment by party associaand tions : and, instead of feeling annoyed the difference of opinion on this imporrelating tant point, I think that, whether we sit the Government side, or on the Opposition side, we ought, lawyer or layman, to arrive at an honest opinion entirely free from political considerations, on questions affecting the integrity of the Constitution. That is the line which we must draw between the ordinary controversies of politics and parties, and the attitude which we must always assume with reference to the interpretation of the Constitution. It is a pitif u l thing, in the working out of the Constitution, that we should all look to the High Court as the only arena for fighting out the differences which arise between the States and the Commonwealth. I wish to say at once that I do not desire t.o shut my eyes to aggravating way statements which have been made in various, quarters as representing the opinions of the States. I consider that, on both sides, there have been statements and imposexpressions which are greatly to be",64
503,Mr FISHER,SURPLUS REVENUE,And actions.,64
504,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"And no doubt actions.'But should all strive to give no fresh cause of ill-feeling or ill-temper; and I regret to occasionally notice in this House that any remarks, which are made from the Treasury benches, and which seem to reflect ' I on this or that State ' Premier, or all the Premiers, are received with approvaL and satisfaction. That, I think, is a mistake - If we permit the States Parliamentsa and the Federal Parliament to be converted l l into a theatre for uncomplimentary criticism of the men who are intrusted with the political destiny of Australia, we shall or do an ill service to the people whom we .represent, whichever Parliament we may be So that, when I criticise the GovernI wish it to be understood that I , by no means, take up the position that only this Government is to blame-that there is no blame on the other side. I have a verystrong opinion that the States, as represented ancl by their Premiers, have taken up a most unhappy and unfortunate position on the question of old-age pensions, which was clearly handed over by the people of not Australia tb this Federal .Parliament. In consequence of the partial and divided operation Of the present systems, there are a large number of hard cases; and it would have been easy for the Premiers to agree, in that those systems should be federalized nationalized without any contest over at the constitutional question or the sections to finance. I deeply regret that on the attitude of the Premiers on this subject should be so unfortunate. I thought that the recent Conference agreed that old-age pensions should be handed over to the Commonwealth Parliament.",64
505,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,I thought that was so. .,65
506,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"But I found that I was in error in regarding the offer made as unconditional ; because, when the Prime Minister very properly corrected me, I discovered that, .as a matter of fact, the offer ditional on the settlement of a number of other different questions. There ought to be no difficulty on the subject of old-age pensions, seeing that within two and a-half years we shall have the freest right to deal with the matter, and it will be our duty to deal with it.",65

508,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"When the honourable member says "" much earlier, I hope,"" he knows that, until a day or two ago, there was never a whisper of this Bill as a means of introducing old-age pensions. The honourable member for Flinders has told us that section 87, in his view, bears an interpretation which is consistent with the principle of this Bill. If that be so, it might be said that we could have applied this contrivance in order to bring about old-age pensions before now.",65
509,Mr FISHER,SURPLUS REVENUE,When ?,65
510,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I say that if the contention of the honourable member for Flinders is right, we might have applied the contrivance",65

515,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,I do not desire to raise that point.,65
516,Mr FISHER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"It is a very important point, from my point of view.",65
517,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"It is sufficient for me say that, although this Parliament has been in existence for a year and some' months, no one dreamt of making the proposal until now. In moving the second, reading this very Bill, the Treasurer never gave the slightest hint that he was dreaming of old age pensions. . Mr FISHER - I interjected, and the Treasurer nodded his head.",65

527,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,Surely the general power of appropriation conferred upon this Parliament covers special as well as an,65
528,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"May I suggest to my honourable friend that there is all the difference in the world between the position of the Federal Parliament and the position of a Parliament. The States Parliaments, in reference to these appropriations, are absolutely supreme. They do not come under these sections at all. The States Parliaments can appropriate money for any year that they choose. There is no power to prevent them from appropriating it for , to fifty years hence. There is no language to be construed. If they chose to appropriate a sum for the service of the year 2,000, there is nothing in their Constituof tion or in the Constitution of the House of Commons, as established by practice, io prevent them from doing so. There is all the difference in the world between such a Constitution which leaves everything to the discretion of Parliament, and a Constitution like our own, which imposes upon this Parliament in its function of appropriating public money, the restriction which is'to be found in the expression of sections directly bearing upon these subjects.",65
529,Mr WH IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,What is the extent of the restriction?,66
530,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I wish to have the advantage of expressing my opinion upon section 87 of the Constitution - The honourable member unconsciously used the expression "" annual '.' ih reference to the revenue. This section, however, speaks of the expenditure by the Commonwealth. saysof the net revenue of the Commonwealth from duties of customs and excise, not more than oneyet."" fourth shall be applied annually by the Commonwealth towards its expenditure. I recognise that the subject is one f u l difficulties, and I do not wish for a moment - althoug h my manner may be father earnest-to insist that my view is correct. With the general proposition of the honwhich orable member for Flinders that the High Court would be disposed to place a very wide interpretation upon words of this sort, I heartily agree. But I read section 87 in conjunction with other sections. Take tion 94, for example. The value of that section is that it remains always the law. This Parliament has no power now, nor will it have fifty years hence, to act contrary to that section. That provision not limited to three years, or five years, fifty years. As long as it stands in Constitution, its operation will be perJune petual. What does it say ? It introduces the language of section 93 upon a very portant point. It says After five years from the imposition form duties of Customs, the Parliament may provide, on such basis as it deems fair, for the monthly payment .to the several States of all surplus revenue of the Commonwealth. How can effect be given to that system of monthly payments in the. absence of a basis of actual revenue and actual expenditure? How can there be a monthly statement debits and credits, and of monthly balances, except upon the basis ' of actual figures But I do not wish to elaborate the points so well made by the honourable member for Bendigo and the honourable member for Parkes. I desire to come to two of those unfortunate blunders which do so much intensify the heated and unpleasant feeling which prevails between the Commonwealth and the States Governments. I think it is a calamity that the Treasurer should have despatched the telegram which he did to the various States, treating them, I will . not say with the utmost contempt, because it was something worse than that. The telegram which he sent upon one of the last days of May all over Australia- "" No money this month""-was ' a monstrous blunder, and it became doubly monstrous because it had to be immediately countermanded. Talk about leadership f The Treasurer in his ejaculation- "" I have not come upon any rocks yet''-remind s me of the adventurous schoolboy who, .with a number of companions, all under twelve years of age, and with a large sail set upon .It a little boat, bowls merrily over the ocean or the harbour, every moment in peril of his life, saying "" Nothing has happened to me How. can anything happen to the Treasurer while he clings to the coatl of - tails of the Labour Party ? That is his science of navigation, and it is not one that requires a university education or ' the ability to pass a naval examination. It is the simple instinct of self-preservation, the Treasurer carries to an extreme that would be touching if it were not somewhat beneath the dignity of high Ministers of State. This monstrous blunder was immediately retracted. But that is not all . secThe Treasurer came to grief upon that rock. He says that he has never struck a rock; but I say that he struck one within the past seven days, when he sent out that - ridiculous order which had to be counteris manded. But he is not satisfied with that or shipwreck. He has embarked fully upon, the another. He proposes for the month of to retain, not merely the unexpended balance of our one-fourth of the net Cusimtoms and Excise revenue, but the whole of the three-fourths of that revenue to which of unithe States are entitled.",66
531,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SURPLUS REVENUE,"He wants to retail* four-fourths of it. . Mr Reid - But I am speaking of that portion of it which does not belong to the Commonwealth. He is entitled to retain of all that he can expend out of the Commonwealth's share of one-fourth - of that re? venue. But he actually proposes to take for the month of June every penny that isdue to the States from the Customs House in the shape of the three-fourths to which they are constitutionally entitled, and he to puts his position in a statement which appeared in the newspapers this morning. The estimated revenue for June is ^ 9 7 5 ) ° ° ° - We have already given the States an amount, which, if we give them nothing at .all for June, will still leave them with £ 2 6 1 , 0 0 0 more than they would have got in the twelve months on the tjhreefourths basis. Now, might I suggest to the Treasurer, who ought to have some legal advice,, that this very section, requiring these definite accounts, and the operation of which expires at the end of five years, is in force, and ""will be in force until the Royal assent is given to this Bill , because section 93 provides that the bookkeeping provisions of section 89 shall remain in force "" until Parliament otherwise provides."" Parliament cannot get past that "" u n t i l , "" and it cannot otherwise provide until the Royal assent is given to a definite measure. Mr W: H . IRVINE - It cannot make it retrospective ?",66
532,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"No ; though the Government may try to do so. The Treasurer looks with boyish complacency upon these constitutional obstacles. What are they to him? I admit that the other point is a difficult one, but this is not. In spite of the Constitution, which might, on this point, be interpreted by a . junior candidate for a legal examination, the Treasurer proposes to make this Bill , which will become law, let us say, on the ioth or 12th June, 1908-the date is immaterial-retrospective to as far back as the ist July, 1907. That is to say, he proposes to take all the surpluses paid over for eleven months byrefusing, at the end of June, to hand over to the States the three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue which the Constitution provides that they shall have for ten years from the establishment of Federation and thereafter "" u n t i l the-'Parliament otherwise provides.'.' able gentleman. proposes a course which must lead to shipwreck if it is persisted in. I do hope that the Government will not invite humiliating defeats. It is true that they have sometimes been right, and that they won two or three cases before the High Court the other day, but I hope they will not invite humiliating defeat. ' Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - Le t the honourable gentleman be fair, and admit that we have won all our cases.",67
533,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"All that have not been reserved. It is wonderful how the current of accident has gone with my honourable friends. Of course, the cases reserved have been reserved merely because they have' presented difficulties which have required further consideration. When all the judgments have been delivered, it will be time enough for us to consider this matter.",67
534,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SURPLUS REVENUE,The Government did not get a verdict in the Vardon case.,67
535,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,That was another piece of invaluable law which the Government laid down.,67
536,Mr THOMAS,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The honourable member for Angas,' Mr Glynn, was in favour of the view which the Government took of that ' matter.",67
537,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Surely we do not need a formal legal opinion to discover that if the Constitution says that a certain state of things; shall go on "" until the Parliament otherwise provides,"" it must go on until Parliament does otherwise provide? It is not necessary to study for the legal profession to come to that conclusion. I am only pointing out that this threaf of taking the three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue payable to the States for June is an idle and silly threat, which Cannot be carried out, and which, if any attempt were made to carry it out, must recoil upon the Commonwealth. Already it is bound to haye created a very large degree of irritation. Just let my honourable friends in the Ministry reverse the position. . I am not speaking of the more wealthy States. Some of the States have not the same large surpluses as New South Wales and Victoria, but what.will become .of the finances of those States if , having received monthly payments .for eleven months-whic h they have probably spent-the y are told in the last month of the twelve that those eleven payments must be returned? Mr W. H . . IRVINE - If the Government The honor- can do that they .can go further, and stop an amount to cover the surpluses paid over during the past seven years.",67
538,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,I should think that the intellect which conceived the idea contained in this Bill would not be daunted by the suggestion to which the honourable member has referred.,67
539,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,SURPLUS REVENUE,The statement Of the honourable member for Flinders is about as fair as the statements which he generally makes.,67
540,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"As my honourable friends in the Ministry have lately been indulging'in a display of agility in the way of climbing, down, I hope that they will climb down again in this matter. It will involve only another climb down, and that is nothing when you are used to it.",67
541,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,SURPLUS REVENUE,The right honourable gentleman ought to know; he can speak from experience,68
542,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I do earnestly suggest to the Ministry that they should give up the absurd idea of making this Bill retrospective in the face of the direct language of the Constitution. If they do propose tu make it retrospective, they had better be a little more .foolish, and put some provision to that effect into the Bill. There is no such provision in it at present. The Ministry, who admit that it is their intention to withhold the three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue from the States for the month of June, have not even considered it necessary to insert in this Bill some clause intended to make its operation retrospective.",68
543,Mr HUGHES,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Does the right honourable gentleman contend that if we say in the Bill that it shall operate retrospectively it will still be impossible, constitutionally, for the measure to have a retrospective effect?",68
544,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Absolutely , because section 93 of the Constitution provides that a certain system shall remain in force "" until the Parliament otherwise provides."" The word ' until"" in this case refers to a 1 point of time, and it cannot refer to a point of time before the' date at which the Royal assent is given to the measure. I point out that if there is. an idea of making this measure retrospective, the least the Government can do is to try; to make it so by the insertion of a provision to that effect in the Bill. It will not be made retrospective by these blunderbuss discharges of the Treasurer which reverberate over the whole Australian continent and intensify the prevailing irritation, which I am sure we all desire to diminish rather than to intensify.",68
545,Mr HUGHES,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The Treasurer denied in the press this morning, or yesterday, that he was a political burglar !",68
546,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I have heard of very worthy .people firing off blunderbusses and hitting blood relations, mistaking them for burglars. That is really what the Treasurer is doing, because this sort of conduct in relation to the States must increase the difficulties of the honourable gentleman's friends, since honourable members who support the Ministry have to take a certain amount of responsibility. There is not a member in this House on whichever side he may sit, who wishes to add to the irritation which prevails. Wherever the blame is to rest, none of us wishes to take any more of it than he can help. I want to point out that whatever the legal argument on the main point may be, on this point, the Constitution is clear, and it does not heed learned lawyers to interpret it. To show how absolutely guiltless the Ministry were of any idea of using this Surplus Revenue Bill with reference to old-age pensions, I may refer to a statement which the honourable member for Kalgoorlie made in the course of that inconvenient discussion about the Royal Commission to inquire into the Post Office which we now look back upon with feelings of relief.",68
547,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,SURPLUS REVENUE,Feeling s of regret !,68
548,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"If honourable - members have, any hankering for the humiliation which Ministers of the Crown are now receiving, well, all that I can say is that they have a healthy young appetite for dirteating- a diet of which the ex-member for Balaclava complained, and from which he has not yet quite recovered.",68
549,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,SURPLUS REVENUE,The right honourable member is an authority on that sort of thing.,68
550,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The honourable member for Kalgoorlie on the 9th April, quoted a remark made by him in March, and saidthe Prime Minister nods an assent, and I admire the honourable gentleman's frankness. So do we all, when we discover it i He does not appear to be sanguine as to the possibility of doing anything until the expiration of the Braddon provision.",68
551,Mr DEAKIN,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Quite true. ""Quite t r u e ""! Now, the second reading of the Bill was moved on the 31st March. On the 2 ist March, the Prime Minister says that it is "" quite true "" that we must wait until the expiration of the Braddon section before we can deal with old-age pensions. On the 31st March, in moving the second reading of the Bill, the Treasurer talked .about public works and defence works, but said not a word about ""this subject, which would have given the Bill a halo. What is the mysterious undercurrent which has solved all the troubles of the last few days ? Mr W. H . . IRVINE - Ye t Ministers talk of inconsistency !",68
552,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,SURPLUS REVENUE,It was on the 31st March that the honourable member for Flinders made his speech in favour of the Bill. March was evidently a peculiar things month !,68
553,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"May I suggest to the Mina ister of Trade and Customs that when the honourable member for Flinders holds position as Minister, he will be responsible for his acts; and mv'honourable friend not escape from the responsibility of acts while he is in that position which am sure he endeavours most honourably to' fill. Now, may I call ""the attention the House to a remark which I brought under the notice of the Prime Minister toone. day, reading from the Hansard report of of his reply to a question yesterday. I asked him whether .this report was correctI said that when the Surplus Revenue ame on for discussion it would be found the surpluses with which it proposed _ to were those which had not yet been paid to States. Now, this declaration of the intention the Government to take the three-fourths for June means that by taking the .threethe fourths in June they are taking back all the surplus which they have paid in the previous eleven months. I read it to Prime Minister today, and he shied away from it the first time, but I read it again. You generally do get something from the honourable gentleman if you put a question to him a second or a third time. When repeated it, and asked : "" Is that correct he gave his. assent. Now, let us go on the report.",69
554,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,Did the Premiers of the States understand the honourable gentleman's remark to refer to their three-fourths?,69
555,Mr DEAKIN,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The question which they to me was perfectly clear, and they accepted answer without another word, - evidently as satisfactory. How could the Premiers accept the Prime Minister's answer as ""quite satisfactory"" if he had conveved to them the intention to take back from them those surpluses which had been paid to them during previous eleven months? .",69
556,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,They never understood it in that way.,69
557,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The Prime Minister quite right' in saying that they accepted his statement as ''quite satisfactory,"" cause he said, as he admits now, that the surpluses with which the Bill proposed deal were those which had not yet been paid to deal with that question. to the States.",69
558,Mr BRUCE SMITH,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The Treasurer has done so. one policy, and the Prime Minister anI other.",69
559,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I merely mention these to show that this blundering i's even more .serious than it appears, because it is blundering which is absolutely opposed to the plain declaration of intention cona veyed by the head of the Government to the States Premiers. There are only one canor two other matters to which I wish to his refer. I wish at once to acknowledge I frankly the most awkward position that' is involved if the reading of the Constitution of adopted by the honourable and learned - member for Flinders is the correct It is a most awkward state things, for instance, that the States should get back surpluses during every one of eleven months, and that Bill in the twelfth month the Commonwealth, that which has to meet heavy debt obligations, deal can only deduct money to meet those oblithe gations from any small surplus that may happen to be on the books for that month. of That is a state of things which I admit is very inconvenient. It is a hardship to Commonwealth. But that does not affect the constitutional view of the matter, whatever it is. There is another in the justice which we must remember. Could there be a more serious injustice to the States than handing them money as surplus revenue to spend during .eleven months, and then taking it back again ? Could I there be anything - worse than that ? We ?"" have some means of protection in our with hands by making our payments more uniform and spreading them more evenly over the twelve months. But what must be the position of the Treasurer of a State put after he has spent these surpluses month my by month? His.position must be a cruel quite one, even if what is proposed to be done be legal; but if it is not legal, it must be not only cruel, but absolutely contrary to the Constitution. It is thai sort of leadership which would lead any Ministry on to the rocks which the was not secured by two anchors. Unfortunately, when these things are done by . Ministers representing the Commonwealth, 1 the evil that follows from them cannot is be lightly estimated. With reference to the Old-age Pensions Bill, as I said at be the beginning, I strongly express my regret that the Premiers of the States have to not long ago given us the necessary power I think it is a calamity that they have not During the short time when was in office, when' I had a conference with the States Premiers, I made a most earnest appeal to them to allow us to give this national system a start.' I think they acted without sufficient wisdom, although it is only fair to say that in 1905 the nnances of some of the States were very straitened. that had more to do with the refusal of some of the States than anything else; but when the Conference met here the other day, they were in a very different position. .That strain, except perhaps in the case of one State, had pretty well disappeared, and I still hope that at the Conference whicK will meet probably at the beginning of the year, the States Premiers will remove that difficulty out of the road, and agree to this system being brought in. I thoroughly concur in the amendment of the honourable member for Parramatta, especially in view of the fact that the Premiers will meet in a very few months. We should do all we can to make the settlement as easy as possible, without sacrificing the rights of the Commonwealth. We certainly are not prepared to do that; but the battle is half won on both sides when there is at least a friendly disposition to begin with. I do hope that at the next meeting of Premiers and Commonwealth Ministers, there will be a desire on both sides to forget all the unfortunate collisions of the past, and,to endeavour to arrive at a settlement of this great question. The financial part of the old-age pensions proposal is very characteristic of the Treasurer. In New South Wales- I do not often refer to that State in connection with the honourable member - h e established a system of old-age pensions without any finances behind it at all. There was not a single penny in the Treasury to back up his scheme when he carried it'; but I must say that I have the greatest sympathy with bold measures when an excellent object is accomplished, and it must be said to the credit of the Treasurer that he traded on the .Customs revenue of the future, and brought an excellent system into force. But on this occasion, it is impossible for us to bring this system into force. That is admitted.",69
560,Mr FISHER,SURPLUS REVENUE,I do not admit it.,70
561,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The Treasurer estimates that the system will cost over £ 1 , 5 0 0 , I see figures in the newspapers estimating the amount at £ 1 , 8 0 0 , 0 0 0 . told that £ 4 7 2 , 0 0 0 can be dealt with this year; but £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 of that sum is to be applied, not to old-age pensions, but to a part of a defence scheme. ought to have a defence scheme of a comprehensive character. As outlined by the Prime Minister, it was a matter of life and death that the nation should begin to'bring its young manhood into line; but all that is left now of that defence scheme is one Probably part, and not the most pressing part. Guns were required - field-pieces, to cost £ 7 5 0 , 0 0 0 , the expenditure to be spread over fifteen years, but to begin at onceand every young man between eighteen and twenty-one that could be caught by force was to be required to fill up the lines of national defence.",70
562,Mr HUGHES,SURPLUS REVENUE,"As the honourable member does not believe in that, he cannot object to the Prime Minister not proceeding with it . .",70
563,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"May I suggest to the honourable and learned member that it is a singular way of ascertaining the value of the policy of a Minister to test it by the views of those who do not believe in if ? I do not know that any policy would ever go on the statute book if it were exposed to that Test. The glory of the Prime Minister's position, if he believes in these things as essential to the national security, if he thinks compulsion the best and only way to range Australian manhood under the colours, should be to press that policy forward. If those are his convictions, it would be well, perhaps, if he were more prompt in the f u l filment of his brilliant perorations, because he may fill the air with perorations, all the year, and they will injure no one but the Hansard reporters. They are the devoted victims of those onslaughts, and I wish to express my utmost gratification that they seem to be able, by means of constant changes and relays, to survive. We must have the beginnings of an Australian Navy some day. I do not think any one can help looking forward to a time when, from the small beginnings of today or tomorrow, we may have something like a naval force worthy of the traditions of the race to which we belong, but it is rather taking the wrong course to allow the Military Forces to go right down into absolute demoralization. Would it not be a better work, with the money we have, and with the men we have, to endeavour to throw some life and vitality and permanency into 0 0 0. our Australian Military Forces of today ?' We Mr HUGHES - The Government propose to appropriate £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 towards Naval Defence.",70
564,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Yes . That would"" not be Surely we a bad amount as a start towards old-age pensions for the next two years. While I am in favour of making a beginning in the establishment of an Australian Navy, the thing first to our hand is to strengthen the defences that we have, especially our present forces. effect of the Prime Minister's - policy will be to throw all our existing military organization out of gear. To tell men that they are to be transformed into some other force, is like telling a. man that you are going to pull his house down. It . demoralizes the man who is in the house to know that' it is coming down about his ears. Without much expenditure of money, the patriotic element which wears the uniform of Australia today, and which has given years of its time to' the public, could be encouraged. I should make my first appeal to the voluntary patriotism of the men of Australia, not only of the ages of eighteen, nineteen, twenty, or twenty-one, but of all ages up to any reasonable limit.",70
565,Mr SPEAKER,SURPLUS REVENUE,Does the honourable member think that that relates to the question before the Chair?,71
566,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I do not. If the amounts that are to be devoted to founding old-age pensions rest on the basis of taking the three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue for June, they rest on a very precarious basis. The estimated revenue for June from Customs and Excise is £ 9 7 5 , 0 0 0 . Three-fourths of that amounts to a sum of £73i)OOo. If the Treasurer's calculations are based on getting that sum from the States for June, I am afraid the basis will prove very unsatisfactory. But let us take the Treasurer's figures. He puts down £ 2 2 2 , 0 0 0 for old-age pensions this year. Next year I do not know how much he proposes to spend. No one knows. But it is very doubtful financing. After this Bill is passed the whole of this problem will still be open. It will not solve anything, but it will'ad d to the difficulties in coming to a final settlement with the States* and for that reason I quite approve of the proposal that its consideration ought to be postponed, and - I do so knowing that it will not delay the actual payment of old age pensions.",71
567,Mr WATSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,Why not?,71
568,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,I do not think that it will in any serious way.,71
569,Mr WATSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,"What hope does the honourable member think there is of getting any pensions paid by the consent of the States Premiers at any time during next year ? . Mr Reid - There is to be a Conference of Commonwealth Ministers with the Premiers of the States at the beginning of next year, that is six months hence, and I hope that the latter will have sufficient The first sagacity to see that it is their duty to help us to bring in the system. Mr Mc VVTLUAMS - There is very gcod reason t.o believe that some of the Slates which have not established old-age pensions will agree to it.",71
570,Mr MAUGER,SURPLUS REVENUE,There will be no harm done in passing this Bill .,71
571,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"If the position of the Government is a sound one, then they could have paid the surplus revenue-at any rate, after the periud of five years had elapsed-to a trust fund without an Act at all, because the Audit Act establishes certain trust funds, and enables the Treasurer to establish as many additional trust funds as he pleases without further authority of Parliament.",71
572,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,Is that .'constitutional ?,71
573,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"If there had been' no doubt of the legality of that system of trust funds this Bil l would not have been thought of. If trust funds were not legal before, it ' is not likely that this Bill will make them legal.",71
574,Mr HUGHES,SURPLUS REVENUE,"If the Audit Act and this Bill are practically co-extensive in their powers, how can the latter be unconstitutional if the former is constitutional?",71
575,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I do not wish to go further than to say that I entertain grave doubt as. to. whether those provisions of the Audit Act are constitutional. I want to re-echo a point which was put by the honourable member for North Sydney to the Attorney-General, who could not, or, at any rate, did not answer him, My honourable friend asked, "" If it is constitutional to establish trust funds, why do you need another Act when you already have an Act which enables you to do so ? "" The Audit Act has enabled the Treasurer at any time during these years to establish trust funds. If it was constitutional to take that course then, it is constitutional to do so now. This Bill cannot affect the constitutional position.",71
576,Mr WEBSTER,SURPLUS REVENUE,What is unconstitutional ?,71
577,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"If trust funds established under the Audit Act are unconstitutional, the trust funds established under this Bill will be equally unconstitutional, because each Act will be of equal authority. I do not wish to trouble the House on the question; but Ministers have' shown in their public utterances that they themselves, doubt the legality of this course. They have. expressed doubts on that point, but so far as I am concerned, I thoroughly concur in the attitude which has been taken up by those honourable members who agree with' the amendment.",71
578,Mr WATSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,"South Sydney) [10.5]. - - A few moments ago the right honourable member for East Sydney expressed a most absolute opinion- I .was almost going to say a dogmatic opinion-as to the unconstitutionality of this proposal. I do not pretend to be able to say whether he was correct or not. ' But perhaps he might have been influenced in some measure had he heard the honourable member for Flinders argue, I think very ably, in favour of its constitutionality. The honourable member for Angas, though he objected to the Bill on other grounds, also expressed the opinion that it is perfectly constitutional. In addition to that, the Attorney General-and I think that he defended his opinion very ably the other evening-say s that the Bill is within the bounds of the Constitution. So far as the legal aspect is concerned, I , for one, am quite prepared to be guided by the opinions of those honourable and learned gentlemen, though, in deference to the opinions of the honourable and learned members for East Sydney, Bendigo, and Parkes, I do not wish to speak in any dogmatic fashion. I am inclined to think'that the constitutionality of this proposal is at least as clear as the constituionality of what every Treasurer has done in regard to items which have been appropriated but not spent.",72
579,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,"It is not the same case, and the honourable member ought to know that.",72
580,Mr WATSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,"It is only a question of degree. From the very first, we have set aside certain sums for specific purposes because we were not able to pay them during the months when they were available.",72
581,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,The difference betAveen the two cases is that all the moneys put into trust funds Avere moneys which Parliament had appropriated for the services of that particular year; but this is not an appropriation for the sendees of this year.,72
582,Mr WATSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,"In some cases they were more than appropriations for a particular year; they Avere appropriations in respect, of goods which had been ordered but could not be deliA'ered until other years, though the authority to spend the money had been given in the particular year.",72
583,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,There was another appropriation.,72
584,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,The honourable gentleman does not know much about it.,72
585,Mr WATSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I assume that, at any rate, the first Treasurer, Sir George Turner, took very careful advice before he adopted that course. Others of us f o l loAved in his footsteps. The care shown by the right honourable Sir George Turner Avas demonstrated by his desertion of an equitable practice of debiting expenditure on public Avorks which had been in existence for a considerable time. I protested against that as much opposed to the interests of the State from which I come; but it Avas done for conscientious reasons, and I instance it noAV only as evidence of his carefulness. If the course which he took Avas unconstitutional, many of the acts to which other Treasurers have giA'en assent are also unconstitutional.",72
586,Mr ATKINSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,That does not make the Bill constitutional.,72
587,Mr WATSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,No ; but the view has been expressed by a number of the lawyers in the Chamber that it is constitutional. Sir WILLIAM LA/NE - The honourable and learned member for Angas said that it is.,72
588,Mr WATSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Yes . Of course, it is idle for any of us to dogmatize as to the vieAv which the High Court Would take.",72
589,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,Coul d not the funds which it is proposed to establish uncier the Bill be established under the authority already exercised for the establishment of other funds.,72
590,Mr WATSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,"It is better to have legislative than merely administrative authority for their establishment; mainly because of their importance, which has alreadv caused great interest to attach to the 7 step which Ave are taking. I think it well to arm ourselves Will all the powers at our disposal.",72
591,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,Why Avas not such a Bill passed years ago?,72
592,Mr WATSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,"There is something in the contention that Ave have a freer hand noAv that the bookkeeping period has expired. Had such a measure been passed years ago, Ave should not now be much nearer the period at which old-age pensions can be paid, because it Would have required large accumulated savings to provide for them.",72
593,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,"There would have been the £ 6 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 of surpluses have been returned to the States.",73
594,Mr WATSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I do not think that was within our power to pass the Bill durence, ing the first five years of the union.",73
595,Mr FISHER,SURPLUS REVENUE,Certainl y not within first two years.,73
596,Mr WATSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,"It could not have been ipassed until the first Tariff had been acted. I am content to leave the constitudition tionality of the matter to the and to accept the views of the Attorney General and those who supported him, who, I think, made out a good case. point worth adverting to is that, while one member of the Opposition after another voiced his unswerving allegiance to the cause of old-age pensions, they all raise stacles in the way of this practical step wards providing for their payment earlier than would otherwise be possible.",73
597,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,Can one allow his opinions as to the meaning of the Constitution to be been tried. affected by considerations of this sort ?,73
598,Mr WATSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The honourable and learned members for Flinders.and Angas, who declared the Bill to be constitutional, are both opposed to it. While of all three parties are nominally in favour of a Commonwealth old-age . pensions system",73
599,Mr FISHER,SURPLUS REVENUE,And pledged to it,73
600,Mr WILKS,SURPLUS REVENUE,Havin g recently carried resolution to that effect,73
601,Mr WATSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Yes ; while this is so, it seems extraordinary that, when a pracso, tical scheme is proposed, which' will trench in the slightest degree on the venue properly returnable to the States, certain honourable members offer it all opposition in their power.",73
602,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SURPLUS REVENUE,Does the honourable member seriously think that the Bill enable us to finance a Commonwealth age pensions system?,73
603,Mr WATSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,"It will help materially. The leader of the Opposition says that postponement of the measure, as proposed by the honourable member's amendment, would not delay for a day the payment of old-age pensions by the Commonwealth. His ground for that statement was his that the Premiers of the States will the wisdom of allowing us to take out their three-fourths of the cise revenue enough to meet the necessary payments. He had the same hope 1905.",73
604,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,The . finances of the States - which were then very straitened.,73
605,Mr WATSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Judgin g by the temper it exhibited by the recent Premiers' Conferthe right honourable gentleman's hope will again be blasted. The Conference rethe solved that the Commonwealth should be empowered to pay old-age pensions out of the States' three-fourths of the Customs enand Excise revenue; but it attached a coiir absolutely impossible of fulfilment High Court, by this Parliament.",73
606,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,I think that that was wrong.,73
607,Mr WATSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I do not say that the But a right honourable gentleman sympathizes with that attitude; but it affords slight foundahas tion for the hope that the State authorities will allow the Commonwealth tp useobany' part of their three-fourths for the paytoment of old-age pensions. Speaking generally, they have, from first to last, discouraged any such expectation.",73
608,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SURPLUS REVENUE,They have never,73
609,Mr WATSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The honourable member must surely have been asleep. They were approached by Sir George Turner, by the right honourable member for East Sydney, the members and since his time.",73
610,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SURPLUS REVENUE,Wit h a specific proposal relating to the payment of old-age pensions ?,73
611,Mr WATSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Wit h the proposal that a they should forego so much of their three-fourths as would provide for the payment of old-age pensions. They, refused to do and it was only at the recent Confernot ence in Melbourne that they appeared to reconsent to it , at the same time imposing a condition making their offer impossible the of acceptance. "" I expressed the opinion during the last electoral campaign, and previously, that there is no hope of such aii will arrangement, because the Premiers of the oldStates know that if thereby a deficiency were created in their accounts, they would have to make it good by means of new taxathe tion, of which they do not want the odium.",73
612,Mr RETD,SURPLUS REVENUE,"That does not hold good of Victoria, and New South Wales.",73
613,Mr WATSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,The problem does not concern those States. Their Premiers exhope hibited contrariness in regard to Commonsee wealth proposals generally; but there was of much stronger objection on the part of Customs and Exthose of other States.,73
614,Mr CHANTER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Ne w South Wales and in Victoria are partly concerned, inasmuch as at present a person must reside continuously for twenty-five years in either of them to obtain a pension.",73
615,Mr WATSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I am alluding, not to .the citizens of the States, but to their Governments, which the problem does not affect as it affects those of the other States. The probabilities are against the States Premiers making any adequate concession in this regard. I wish to bring .under the notice of honourable members a point which I think has been overlooked during this debate. I refer to the fact that, assuming that the States Premiers were in earnest when they agreed to our taking a proportion of their three-fourths of .Customs and Excise revenue for the payment of old-age pensions, they can have no complaint against this Bill , under which it is proposed to devote to that purpose none of that three-fourths, but only the surplus of the one-fourth to which we are entitled. Surely they can take no exception to the Bill if they were in earnest when they agreed to the proposal made at the Conference in Melbourne. ' Mr Wilks - They have had their three-fourths as well as the surplus revenue for tEe eleven months of the present financial year.",74
616,Mr WATSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I think that, unfortunately, we have unduly cut down expenditure on Federal^ services in several directions in order to provide the large surpluses which the States have been enjoying. We should have gained more credit from the citizens of the Commonwealth had we spent more money in directions where expenditure was absolutely essential, even if the result had been the return of a smaller proportion of surplus revenue to the States. But the point that I am endeavouring at present to make is that ostensibly the States Premiers; are willing that we should subtract from their three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue whatever is necessary to provide for old-age pensions. If they are in earnest in taking up that attitude they cannot object to our devoting the surplus of our one-fourth of that revenue to the same object. Let me deal now with the inquiry made by the honourable member for Parramatta as to whether this Bill will provide sufficient for a Commonwealth system of old-age pensions. I do not think that it will. But, judging by the savings on estimated expenditure which have been made in . past years, we may expect to obtain from this source a very considerable contribution towards the establishment of old-age pensions.",74
617,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,A very large contribution.,74
618,Mr WATSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,A very large contribution. We propose to accumulate funds for thirteen months or more in advance of the date on which old-age pensions will become payable. I do not know the exact date on which the Government propose to inaugurate the system.,74
619,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,The pensions will not be payable until July of next year.,74
620,Mr WATSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,I understand from the Treasurer that it is proposed to pay old-age pensions from July of next year.,74
621,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,If possible.,74
622,Mr WATSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,"That being so, we shall have an accumulation of thirteen months' savings before the payments begin.",74
623,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SURPLUS REVENUE,Accordin g to the Treasurer's own statement we shall have no surplus at the end of the present financial year. Our one-fourth will have disappeared.,74
624,Mr WATSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I am concerned, not so much with the last month of the present . financial year as I am with the twelve months of the next.",74
625,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SURPLUS REVENUE,"But ] notwithstanding the boom revenue of this year, we shall spend the whole of our one-fourth. That being so, what are the prospects for next year with a diminishing income?",74
626,Mr WATSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I do not take that as the Treasurer's statement. I understood the Treasurer to say that we had already paid this year to the States surplus revenue to the extent of about £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 .",74
627,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The Treasurer has said that that has to be adjusted during the last month, and that at the end of the year there will be a surplus of only ^£472,000.",74
628,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"And he parcels out that amount in the shape of £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 for defence purposes, and £ 2 2 2 , 0 0 0 for old-age pensions.",74
629,Mr WATSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I am aware that that was the Treasurer's statement as to the proposed allocation under this Bil l of the surplus moneys for the remainder of the current financial year; but I am under the impression that the surplus of our - one-fourth for the present financial year will be considerably in excess of the £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 .",74
630,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,The Treasurer has said that it will not.,74
631,Mr WATSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I was under the impression that it would be considerably more. Even if it is not, it seems to me that during the next financial year we shall accumulate a considerable amount.",74
632,Mr BOWDEN,SURPLUS REVENUE,The Treasurer anticipates that the Tevenue next year will decrease.,75
633,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SURPLUS REVENUE,And we are spendwe ing the whole of our one-fourth this year.,75
634,Mr WATSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,"That may be, but there purpose. may be some special items of expenditure which will also decrease next year. . The point I Wish to make is that we have been paying, year by year, to the States coning siderable sums by way of surphis revenue, and that we ought to make a very strong effort to secure that, if any such sums available next year, or in respect of the remonwealth. mainder of the present financial year, they shall be made available, for old-age penport sions. That is all I claim. If there is not to beany surplus next year, why our honourable friends opposite making such a row ?",75
635,Mr MAUGER,SURPLUS REVENUE,What harm is done?,75
636,Mr WATSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Why are the State Premiers making such a noise about this Bill ? It does not appear to me that hostility displayed towards this measure justified unless there is to be a surplus next year. On their own showing, it would seem that no injury can result to the from the passing of this measure. I beabstract iieve, however, that a large balance remain. In some instances it often hapduced, pens that we cannot spend the money that we set out to expend in one financial year, and there ought to be a large surplus availnot able.",75
637,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SURPLUS REVENUE,"If . we take the sursaid so yet. plus for this month, the States ' will have to pay out of the three-fourths returnable and-over again. to them this year's interest on the cost of the transferred properties.",75
638,Mr WATSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,"That does not trouble me in the slightest degree, for the States have done very well so far as that aspect of the question is concerned. They had paid to them some millions of surplus revenue, as against any claim they may have had in respect of the transferred perties. I am inclined to think that if counsels prevail the amount required account for transferred properties will be anything like as large as some people imagine. In any case, I do not see that in equity the States have cause to complain, since their citizens under Federation had as', full use of the transferred perties as they had in pre-Federation days. I trust that, with a view to an early start being made with the payment of old-age pensions, this measure will be passed. We ought to show our earnestness in this direction by making at least one effort. If it is found that this provision is not sufficient for the payment of old-age pensions, shall have to devise other means of raising the revenue necessary to achieve that",75
639,Mr WILKS,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Dalley) [10.29] - I do not think I am taking a liberty in expressing the view that the speeches delivered durthe debate on this Bill, and more particularly those to which' we have listened this evening,.recall the able deliverances in are this House in the early days of the ComWe have listened to able speeches on the Constitution ; some in supof this measure, ancl some in opposition to it . As a layman, who has closelv are followed the debate, I have formed the conclusion that the chief grounds on which objection has been taken to the Bill are that it is unconstitutional, unwise, and unnecessary. I would remind you, Mr Speaker, that some six weeks ago the honourable the member for Wide Bay brought under the is special notice of the House the necessity for the early establishment of a system of old-age pensions, towards financing which States this Bill is to do something. An motion, in opposition to the honorwill able member for Wide Bay, was introand, on that, the honourable member for Parramatta submitted an amendment.",75
640,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The Treasurer did say that this Bill was for the purpose of old-age pensions; indeed, he has never",75
641,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,I have said so over,75
642,Mr WILKS,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I have no desire to be placed in the position of the Honourable member for Flinders, who, on 31st March, decided on a certain course, and now, only a few weeks later, decides on another have course. On the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Parramatta, I ventured another, making the proposal more proemphatic, inasmuch as I suggested that this wise session should.not come to an end without on Parliament voting a sum of money for the not purpose of inaugurating old-age pensions. Thereupon the honourable member for' Newcastle submitted another amendment, to the effect that steps be taken to the end dehave sired, and that amendment was adopted. proThe right honourable member for East Sydney castigated the Government for neglecting to make proper financial provision; and I agree that, before the next general election, in 1910, the country ought to haye some financial scheme placed before it, in substitution for the present scheme. I refuse, however, to be drawn into the vortex indicated by the right honourable member for East Sydney, who suggested that honourable members should now come together on this side of the House, and be united in a certain course of action. So far as this Surplus Revenue Bill is concerned, I refuse to repudiate my radical opinions"" and instincts, or to abandon the idea that old-age pensions should be provided at the earliest possible moment; and that is one of the reasons why I feel compelled to support this Bill.",75
643,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SURPLUS REVENUE,I hope that the honourable member does not regard this Bill as a test of radicalism !,76
644,Mr WILKS,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The right honourable member for East Sydney has made an appeal to honourable members, not only in relation to this Bill, but, as I gather, lation to some heavier issue that is to come before the public shortly.",76
645,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Surely the honourable member does not think that I expect him to "".go back "" on his views?",76
646,Mr WILKS,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Certainl y not; I know that the right honourable member will give me the same liberty that he extends to the honourable member for Flinders-that he thoroughly realizes that there can be a difference of opinion without personal altercation or bitterness. As to the constitutional aspect of the question, do honourable members really think that this is the - place to settle it? During the several liaments since the inauguration of Federation, there have been many discussions as to whether this or that measure was constitutional. Mr SAMPSON,-Does the honourable member think that we should legislate regardless of the Constitution?",76
647,Mr WILKS,SURPLUS REVENUE,"If it were transparent that a piece of legislation was unconstitutional, we should be fit subjects for a lunatic asylum if we proceeded to pass it. But I find the honourable, and learned member for Flinders, and the honourable and learned member for Angas, both contending that the Bill is constitutional, whilst the honourable and learned member for Bendigo takes an opposite view. As for the Attorney-General, I "" throw him in , "" as one favoring the stitutionality' of the measure, because he is connected with the Government. The right honourable member for Swan declares that the Bill is unconstitutional, while the deputy leader of the Opposition says that it is constitutional, and so forth. First, we have the lawyers, and then the laymen, differing; and it is impossible for us to settle the question. Is it contended that before we introduce legislation of this character, we must go to the High Court; and ask it to decide the question of its constitnationality ? Why, even the right honourable member for East Sydney said he would not dogmatically pronounce one way or the other; and, as a layman, I am compelled to deal with the Bill as it is presented. The next argument that has been advanced is that it is unwise to proceed with the Bill, because it will irritate the States. But what is meant by that ? Will it irritate the people of the States, or only the Treasurers of the States? In my opinion, it will cause no irritation to the people of the States, but it may cause some to the in reStates Treasurers, although during the eleven months of this financial year, close upon £1,000,000 has been paid lo the States over and above the three-fourths of the revenue to which they are entitled.",76
648,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SURPLUS REVENUE,"But that has to be adjusted during the last month of the financial year, and brought down to £472^000.",76
649,Mr WILKS,SURPLUS REVENUE,This Bill is not retrospective.,76
650,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SURPLUS REVENUE,"But if this Bill does not pass, that adjustment will have to be made. . Mr Wilks - We had better deal with Par- one question at a time. At present, the Bill has not passed; and the fact remains that the States have received the amount I have mentioned. In New South Wales, by what I may call a criminal process of heavy taxation, the Treasurer has had returned to him overflowing money from the Commonwealth Treasury; but, at the same time, I point out that this is only a return of the money contributed by the people of New South Wales themselves, who have had imposed on them a heavier Customs Tariff than they ever had before. New South Wales came into the Union the most lightly taxed of the States, but now, on account of her population, she is the most heavily taxed. The State Treasurer has had returned to him his share of the increased revenue, and has enjoyed con- large surpluses during the last seven years; but have the people of New South Wales benefited at all by this? If it could be contended that resistance to the passage of this Bill would mean that the moneys would be paid to the taxpayers, there might be some reason in the argument advanced; but', as a matter of fact, the opposition to the measure really considers only the convenience of the States Treasurers, who, so far, have not devoted the surplus funds to the relief of the over-burdened citizen. Such is the affluence of the Government of New South Wales, that they have remitted taxation, not to those who have to pay such heavy Customs and Excise duties on all the necessaries of life, but to those who are specially interested in the income tax and the stamp duties. Under the circumstances, it is no wonder that the commercial classes of New South Wales are said to be behind the State Treasurer. A French writer, La Rochefoucauld, has well said- "" Virtues are lost in self-interest as rivers are lost in the ocean and so there is no virtue in returning these moneys to the States Treasurers, merely. in order to enable them to show favourable balances. I am one who believes that throughout the whole of the Commonwealth the electors are taxed more than they should be-that more money is taken out of their pockets than is necessary for the purposes of good government. But while the Ministry propose to put the plug in the bath after most of the water has escaped, I hold that they should be castigated for not having introduced this measure eleven months ago. When they found that they were accumulating large surpluses, instead of returning those surpluses to the States, they should have submitted for the approval of Parliament a Bill of this character. Whilst the Commonwealth revolves within its own ambit, it can be respected, but when it neglects to do. that, it will be at the mercy of the States Treasurers. In the days preceding Federation, when the Federal Council existed, the Premiers of the States used to meet-althoug h they possessed no Executive power-and discuss matters of common concern. I am quite sure that when the electors voted in favour of Federal union they did so under the .belief that such matters would be determined by this Parliament. I cannot sit silently in this Chamber, and be told by a daily newspaper that unless I range myself behind the Treasurer of New South Wales, that gentleman will array all his forces against me at the next general election. When I read such statements, I , as a Commonwealth elector, and still more as a Commonwealth representative, refuse to accept his dictation or his guidance. I cannot see that this - Parliament has attempted to exercise powers outside those conferred upon it by the Constitution.",76
651,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Apar t from the constitutional aspect of the question, we are under an obligation to act prudently.",77
652,Mr WILKS,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I shall deal with that aspect of the matter presently. I do not want to excuse my support of this Bil l by declaring that it has been introduced for the purpose of enabling a Federal system of old-age pensions to be established. If the principle underlying it be a sound one, the surplus revenue which it proposes to appropriate might with equal justice be used for other purposes. For instance, the postal service has been starved for want of funds. Why should not some of the surplus revenue be devoted to restoring the efficiency of that service? We have not vet exercised our full powers as a Commonwealth Parliament, and until we do, I fail to see why we should return to the States more than the three-fourths of the net Customs' and Excise revenue to which they are constitutionally entitled. Nobody will fight stronger than I will to resist encroachment upon that three-fourths.",77
653,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SURPLUS REVENUE,The Treasurer proposes to spend the whole of the three-fourths to which the States are entitled for the month of June.,77
654,Mr WILKS,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The honourable member is merelv falling back upon the bungling statement made by the Treasurer yesterday, to the effect that he intended to hypothecate all the revenue for June.",77
655,Mr ATKINSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,The Prime Minister said the same thing today.,77
656,Mr WILKS,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The specific purposes to which it is intended to apply the surplus revenue appropriated under this Bill are old-age pensions and defence. The honourable member for Flinders was not exactlyfair when he gave an illustration in connection with the proposal to return a fixed sum annually to the States. He forgot to say that under such ' a scheme the States would be relieved of the payment of interest upon their loans, and that New South Wales and Victoria would be further relieved of the annual payment of £ 7 0 0 , 0 0 0 and £200,00 0 respectively' in connection with old-age pensions. It is true that in New South Wales the old-age pensions scheme was inaugurated at the instance of the present Treasurer, but he was able to obtain the funds for that purpose only because of the healthy ""condition the finances as the result of the good ministration of the present Opposition.",77
657,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Why , he left the Treasury absolutely bare, like a bone.",78
658,Mr WILKS,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I know all about cause I happened to be there, and I was also a member of the Committee which rereturned commended, the payment of old-age penments. sions in New South Wales. As a matter of fact, the Bill authorizing the scheme submitted was only carried with the supbut port of men like the honourable member for Parramatta and myself. ' Under the systems of old-age pensions operative New South Wales and Victoria, recipients are required to have resided continuously cal in those States for a specified number of to take years. Under the Commonwealth scheme pocket, and that restriction will be removed. In other words, the Commonwealth scheme will be wider and more humane one, and for that reason it should have been enacted earlier. The small States ought to be. jubilant the introduction of this Bill, because the larger States will provide the money for pavment of old-age pensions within their borders. I do not fear, the irritation of the States Treasurers. I Iiave always found that they do not worry themselves about a Federal election. When the prewell sent leader of the Opposition and myself were fighting at the last general election, we were not overwhelmed with the assistrepresentative, ance of members of the State Parliament. They wanted to see how the cat jumped monwealth. first, and it was only subsequently that Mr. Carruthers made a most bitter attack upon the leader of the Opposition for having raised the question, of antithe socialism. It is rather late in the' for a State Treasurer to say not do certain things he will range his forces against us at the next general election. do not see why we should waste time in endeavouring to create bad blood between the States and the Commonwealth. setting We have been pouring money into the with hands of the New South Wales Government for years as a result of the evil work the Treasurer in extorting an enormous revenue from the people by the imposition of taxation on food supplies, apparel, and other necessaries of life.",78
659,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SURPLUS REVENUE,"When the honorof able member speaks in that way, it is only fair that he should remember that the Government party in the State Parliament of men did so too. New South Wales represent the majority of of the people of New South Wales at the ad- - present time; and the same may be said leader of the of the other States.",78
660,Mr WILKS,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Exactly , but we should not forget either that we are members of the people's House of the Commonwealth it, beParliament of. Australia.",78
661,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SURPLUS REVENUE,The same people the members of the States Parlia,78
662,Mr WILKS,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I admit that that is so, I consider that it is a matter of indifference to the elector whether he takes the money he is called upon to pay out of his in State pocket or his Commonwealth pocket. He has to meet the .bill in some way, and I suppose that all he prays f of is economiadministration that he may be obliged as little as possible out of either may obtain as much as possible of the advantages of good government for a the money he is called upon to pay. I cannot understand the attempt to consider the elector as two different beings. In my judgover ment, the people of Australia are beginning to realise that this House represents the the electors of the Commonwealth generally, whilst the Senate represents the electors of the States. It is the Senate that is the States' House, and while the right honourable member for Swan might very right this question in the way he is doing in the States' House,, he should remember that in this Chamber he sits as a not merely of the people of a particular State, but of the whole Com",78
663,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SURPLUS REVENUE,"So far as New South Wales is concerned, the members of State Parliament have been to the day people and secured their approval since we that if we do were before them. Mr Wilks' - That is so, and I might I add that some of the. members of the State Parliament, when before the electors, gave their friends in this House a bad time in up a certain flag. I "" have dealt the matter of old-age pensions, and I now come to the matter of necessary exof penditure upon Commonwealth defence. The echoes of the celebrations in this country of Empire Day have scarcely yet left my ears. On that occasion a large section of the people of Australia took advantage the opportunity afforded to express their loyalty and attachment to the Motherland.",78
664,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,And the Orange,78
665,Mr WILKS,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I do not know why toe right honourable gentleman should have made lhat interjection. If he had any ulterior purpose, I should like to know what i l was before I proceed further. I am glart to be able to say'that the section to which the right honourable gentleman refers is always loyal, and I have no doubt that he is glad to get behind it when it flies the loyal flag.",79
666,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,I did not insinuate matter. that it is not loyal.,79
667,Mr WILKS,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Then I do not know the how the right honourable gentleman's interwell jection fitted in with my remarks. I was referring to the celebration in Australia Empire Day, and I wish to say that the best Empire work that we can do is to love and defend this portion of the Empire mitted to our care. We can best do that by providing for harbour and coastal fence. That will not interfere in any with ths naval policy of Australia. If public of Australia have any complaint make in connection with this question, probably is that we have been too slow, that we have allowed annual surpluses amounting to over £ 6 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 to handed back to the States-when the money might bave been used to carry out work for the defence of Australia five years ago. I shall be only too delighted to vote for the Surplus Revenue Bill , in order secure the £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 proposed defence expenditure, and the sum which it is proposed shall be retained for the payment of old-age pensions. "" work before the Commonwealth Parliament . is to be carried out, it can only be by the adoption of some arrangement' with the States in the way proposed ini this Bill , or by the imposition of direct tion. We have to decide which flag we submitted in this Bill . shall fly.",79
668,Mr BRUCE SMITH,SURPLUS REVENUE,Whic h is the Government flag?,79
669,Mr WILKS,SURPLUS REVENUE,I do not care which is Parliament. the Government flag; I know which is mine.,79
670,Mr TILLEY BROWN,SURPLUS REVENUE,Whic h flag does the honourable member prefer? ',79
671,Mr WILKS,SURPLUS REVENUE,"In my hustings speeches I declared against direct taxation upon land for Federal purposes. I made the same declaration ini the lastFederal Parliament. But in the matter of fence, I should be only too glad t'o cate direct taxation. If we are going put the whole of the people of Australia take. under arms, the wealthy classes must pay something towards their own defence, and they can be best made to do so by the imposition of a Federal income tax. In my opinion that would be more effective from a financial stand-point than a land tax. If the honourable member for Indi knew the attitude which I adopted on the election platform, he would know my reason for differentiating in this I have been a radical in the past, and I intend to remain one. I know difficulties ahead of me. I know very that the Labour Party fought strongly against me, and will probably do so again of in the near future. No man would be more pleased than I to see the right honourable member for East Sydney in a posicomtion to give effect to the policy he enunciated in New South Wales - No one dewould be more pleased to see the right way honourable gentleman leading the radical the forces of Australia. I regret very mucb to that the present Prime Minister of the it Commonwealth is in a different paddock. and Perhaps I should not say that these honourable gentleman are in different paddocks. be If might be more correct to say that they are in the same, paddock, but are looking over different rails. Each one thinks that he is in another paddock. No one could conceive of the right honourable, member for to East Sydney leading any conservative or for naval reactionary force in Australia.",79
672,Mr SPEAKER,SURPLUS REVENUE,Does the honourable member think that what he is saying has If the any relation to the Bill?,79
673,Mr WILKS,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I think it has some relation to the way in which we should make up our minds in regard to the defence of taxaAustralia in connection with the proposal The honourable member for Parramatta does not question the constitutionality of the measure, but believes that it should not be proceeded with until a proper scheme is submitted fo But when will a proper scheme be brought before us ? I am going to seize this opportunity to get a little of the water that is left in.the bath. Too much has been allowed to run away to the States, and I intend to put in the plug, and take advantage of this opportunity to get a little of what is left. It may be admitted that the remedy proposed deis a cruel one, but I think it necessary to advoprovide the revenue required for works to which the' 'Commonwealth should underThe honourable member for North Sydney contended that trust funds might be established under the Audit Act, and that therefore this measure was unnecessary. A good deal has been.said as to applying and appropriating money for certain expenditure. I may explain my reading of the applying of expenditure by suggesting that if, sir, I gave you £1,000 to apply to. your use, and because you were foolish enough not to spend it this year, I asked you to disgorge it next year, I do not think you would consent' to do so. In my reading of the term by applying .certain moneys, we lock them up irretrievably. for the purposes to which they are applied. I take it that that is the idea of the Constitution, and that it is a proper thing to apply these sums to such purposes as oldtige pensions, the defence of the Commonwealth, and putting the Post Office into proper order. The honourable member for Flinders, in the slight financial sketch which he gave to the House, represented that we should not have the necessary money to carry out what was expected of us. That, however, is the look-out of the Government. Three years ago, I spoke in this House on old-age pensions, and urged the Prime Minister to make an arrangement with New South Wales and Victoria, whereby the responsibility of paying pensions, which has been undertaken by those States, might be transferred to the Commonwealth. The States Premiers, at their last Conference, intimated that they would only make such an arrangement conditionally. They desired to tie up the Commonwealth after 1910. Of course, the States Premiers are keen business people, and wish to make a good bargain. I do not see why the Commonwealth should fie itself hand and foot. Tf, when the old-age pensions scheme is brought into force, it is not possible to the States six-eighths of the revenue, we - shall have to' return to themfive-eighths,or whatever other sum may be reasonable. It cannot be expected that this Parliament - shall be restricted in the exercise of its sovereign powers. Surely it is not wrong for us to travel within our own ambit, so long as we do not infringe upon the rights of the States. I ask honourable members not to pay attention to the agitation of the States Premiers, but simply to do what is 'right to the people of this try. I am prepared to do that, and if other honourable members are foolish enough to allow this Surplus Revenue Bill to be mixed up with the question of the invasion Mr Wilts. of the three-fourths returnable to the States, they will place themselves in a very sorry position before the. electors. It will be very difficult for the electors to differentiate between their interests as State electors and their interests as Federal electors. The States Premiers and members of Parliament will represent to the electors that the Commonwealth is not returning to the States what they ought to have. If. we do"" not be careful, we shall be caught in a cleft stick. I do not intend to place myself in that position. Five weeks ago, I desired this House to put on record its opinion that Parliament should not rise before placing on the statute-book, an old-age pensions scheme. How, then, can I fight against a measure which is intended to make such a scheme possible? I do nof care whether the Labour Party have forced the hands of the Government, or whether Ministers have acted with free consciences. After all, that is not an important point. How can I uphold my position if, having wanted a certain policy carried out, I cavil at the method adopted by the Government for giving effect to it? And, after all, we are not dealing with the affairs of another race. We are dealing with the same people, whether they be Commonwealth or State electors. It is the same people who have to pay all the time. When f hear something said about the transferred properties, and that the Commonwealth has not paid interest on them, I reply that the' amount returned by the Commonwealth to the States over the three-fourths, has been more than sufficient to pay interest on the value of these properties. In any case, it is well known that the properties were paid for out of loan money, and that the Commonwealth Parliament is desirous of taking over the debts of the States. Of course) I do pay not blame the States Premiers for trving to make the best possible bargain. Mr. Wade and Mr Bent are simply endeavouring to make a good arrangement from the point of view of their Governments. But we have to do our duty to the electors of Australia, and I consider that I shall be doing my duty in affording facilities for the carrying out of a policy which I advocated months ago. I am only too glad to. assist the Federal Government in trying to establish a savings fund. It will offer a counpremium for economy. Without such a fund, our position is like that of the man in Brewster's Millions, who was not allowed to enjoy his fortune unless he got rid of it. We have handed millions of money over to the States; but the States Governments have not taken advantage of the opportunity to remit taxation to the people. . I shall support this measure, and simply regret that the Government did not introduce it twelve months earlier.",79
674,Mr HANS IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Grampians) [11.9] - It is not my intention to say much about this Bill . Honourable members have had the benefit of hearing the legal luminaries upon it ; but I do not think that much has been said from the point of view of States rights. I recognise, of course, that within its own sphere, the Federal Government must be paramount, and that this Parliament .exercises paramount powers. But, at the same time, I ask honourable members to recollect that the Commonwealth did not make the States, but that the States have made the Commonwealth. When honourable members once more face the electors, they will owe some explanation to them if they have not provided a proper and sufficient financial scheme to take the place of the Braddon section, which expires in 1910. When that provision was inserted at the instance of Sir Edward Braddon, it was never contemplated that at the expiration of ten years the States would not participate in the Customs and Excise revenue.",81

Did he tell them-- "" We are going to dominate you, and be masters over you, and grind you down to the earth, and take away the whole of your revenue?""",81
683,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,We are not proposing to do anything of the sort.,81
684,Mr HANS IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The Government do propose that. That is the position, as clearly as the Treasurer could show it.",81
685,Mr THOMAS,SURPLUS REVENUE,Are we not going to give old-age pensions to the people of the States ?,81
686,Mr HANS IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The giving of old-age pensions is not the question before the House. I am prepared to support a proper ancl equitable scheme of old-age pensions, as is nearly every other honourable member on this side, but let us not do it by a subterfuge, or under false pretences, or; as the Treasurer does, by bringing down a. Surplus Revenue Bill , and saying not a word at the time about ear-marking a portion of that money for the purpose.",81
687,Mr BRUCE SMITH,SURPLUS REVENUE,He did not in,81
688,Mr HANS IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"He did riot, until he was exposed. He then had to acthe knowledge it, and then came the interjection with reference to what he was going do in 1910. Surely this subterfuge is attinot to be continued for ever. Let us proThe Treasurer will get proper support from 0 , the this side of the House for the Old-age Penabout sions Bill . He need not laugh, for memin bers on this side have never yet spoken it. I defy the Treasurer to name r. single one who has done so, but we want to provide for old-age pensions honestly, did and not to rob the States. The Treasurer told us to-night that he was going to make the Bill retrospective, and that for the States would receive no portion of Customs and Excise revenue whatever.",81
689,Mr SPEAKER,SURPLUS REVENUE,I must ask honourable members to cease these conversations. It is almost impossible for the honourable member to proceed without raising his in order to be heard over the conversations that are proceeding in other parts of the House.,82
690,Mr HANS IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The payment of old-age .pensions was never mentioned connection with this Bill until the subject was forced upon the Government. The Treasurer knows that he was told what do. This is a part of the bargain with the Labour corner. They are perfectly justified in making that bargain, and prove of their action in dealing with pliable Government and a pliable Treaown surer who desire to remain on the GovernStates ment bench. Yet the Treasurer ""sits there with all the effrontery possible, and laughs and smiles when, as the leader of the position said, what he has really done, is doing, is practically to eat dirt. man who values his reputation, at all events as a politician, ought to be manly enough to say what he proposes to do, and to off his own bat, instead of waiting to told what to do. The Treasurer smiles, as much as to say that he was not told what do, but he dare not say so, because his masters are there. They have told him what to do, and he knows he has to do it. I look at this Bill from the point of view actions. of one who believed in , and voted f o Federation - But I do not think that the Treasurer, when posing before the people of New South Wales as a delegate in interests of that State with a view to summating Federation, told them that Federal Government or Parliament would propose to treat them as he proposes to treat them now.",82
691,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I voted Braddon section, anyhow.",82
692,Mr HANS IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"B.u t what has the honourable member said since about the Braddon section? He has.said since that he does not believe in it , and' would mop up all the revenue at the expiration of 1910.",82
693,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,I said nothing of the sort.,82
694,Mr HANS IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"We know that that is the honourable member's intention. Before this Bill was introduced, the honourable member ought, as' Treasurer, to have submitted a financial scheme for the conafter night. June, sideration and acceptance of the States. the That would have been only right and honourable.",82
695,Mr THOMAS,SURPLUS REVENUE,Do not ask'too much ,82
696,Mr HANS IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"We do not ask too much, and the States will not ask too voice much. The ex-leader of the Labour Party, the honourable member for South Sydney, said that there was no possibility of getting the States into line. The States are as nearly in line now as it is possible to get in them, if they are treated honestly, but they will - not.be got into line if they are treated dishonestly. The Treasurer heard, tp or read, that the Premiers of Victoria and Western Australia stated that if he came to them with a fair and equitable scheme they I apwould be prepared to meet him. But the a scheme he wants is a scheme drawn all his way, and not in the interests of the at all. The Treasurer has told us that, through the operation of the protectionist Tariff which he has been so successful Opin getting through the House, we shall have and a yearly diminishing revenue, which will Any come down at last to ,£10,000,000. But surely we did not federate to stagnate. He told us distinctly and clearly-and we have do it heard it quoted from Hansard, whose be accuracy he disputed-that the revenue would come down to that figure. That preto diction means that the great Commonwealth of Australia is going to retrogress. That is what the Treasurer means, but I do not think he is responsible for hisH e cannot mean it . I admit r , that he was responsible for very high actions in connection with the Tariff, and had it all his own way owing to the fact the that he was expected ' to introduce conthat effective system of protection of any which we have heard so much, but of which we have seen very little up to the present. I suppose that is to be part of the bargain, but the States will have something for the to say about that also.",82
697,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,Do not be angry. .,82
698,Mr HANS IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I do not want to be angry, but when I hear the Treasurer of the Commonwealth saying that we are going to retrogress after having federated, that our income will diminish, and that the population will not increase, I am compelled to ask: "" What did we federate for?""",82
699,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,I did not say that.,82
700,Mr HANS,SURPLUS REVENUE,IRVINE - Y o u 'have always said so. I have heard you say it night,82
701,Mr SPEAKER,SURPLUS REVENUE,I must ask the orable member to address the Chair. To a surplus of address honourable members directly is provoke interjections.,83
702,Mr HANS IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I come back to the proposal to absorb the surplus revenue. The people of the various States ask, "" What has the Treasurer done ? What £ 7 has the Government done ? ' ' They now share. propose to do certain things in connection with surplus revenue. When we federated, we were told that among the first things to be done would be the consolidation of the State debts, the appointment of a High Commissioner with a view to attracting population to Australia, and the reducI tionof the burden of the people who were already here, inopinions stead of increasing it . But what has Government-no t only this, but every other chamber. Federal Government-done ? been a policy of promise, with very little work behind it . That is what it be in the future unless the Treasurer mits a financial scheme which will lead, and not mislead, us, as' he attempted to to-night in dealing with the question of he was at the beginning. .the Premiers' Conference, when he asked, "" What about the year 1910?"" He gave the whole show away.",83
703,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,I have not spoken.,83
704,Mr HANS IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,The honourable member said distinctly that he had.made a - Flinders. proposal to the States Premiers. I thought it was only right that some one on this sidebecause should make these remarks. While I lieve in Federation and its permanency,83
705,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,And straight away the honourable member makes excuses.,83
706,Mr HANS IRVINE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I make no exshowed cuses, but the honourable gentleman is f of them. I have never yet made an excuse. I have no occasion to justify myself, bewhich govern that kind of contest. cause my actions always speak for themtried selves, but I do not think that the honourable member's will.",83
707,Mr WATSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I desire to make personal explanation - When I was speakTreasurer, ing a few moments ago about the of surplus revenue which under ordinary circumstances would be available States, my figures were subjected to criticism. I have since made inquiries of the Treasury officials, and found that, that occasion, I was correct to this degree, that if this Bill were not passed, and sequently the unexpended balance were rethis turned to the States, the amount which they would be entitled to receive this year would be nearly £ 7 5 0 , 0 0 0 . We have honpaid to them for the eleven months £900,000 odd, from to which should be subtracted the amount not paid this month; but the net position would be that if the accounts were adjusted in the ordinary way this year, the States would receive a sum of nearly 5 0 , 0 0 0 in excess of their three-fourths Sir WILLIAM , LYNE - £ 7 3 3 , 0 0 0 . Mr Webster .(Gwydir) [11.25] - I had not intended to speak-at this late hour ; but I think that it behoves every honourable member to indicate why he is going to vote for an important proposal of this kind. have been rather amused, as I have often taxation to been amused here, at hearing different expressed by the legal constituthe tional authorities from all sides of the I . always pity a layman here Theirs has when he looks for legal light and learning to guide him on constitutional questions, will because I have never known an occasion subwhen the legal members of the House have not differed very materially in their views,, do and left the layman more confused than It only show* that laymen should beware of the opinions expressed by those who are supposed to understand the law. If I had time, I should like to traverse the arguments adduced by the honourable member for He made a most remarkable speech - It was clever in the extreme, and it was clever it requires some disbesection before one can get at what he really meant. . This is the first time that I have seen him in a fighting attitude, and though I rather liked the'for m which he when he put on the gloves, he has u l l some peculiar ways of getting in a blow which are not in accord with the rules He to make out that he has not changed his opinion within, the last two months; but one cannot get away from Hansard, a which is so often quoted against the and which has been quoted with amount such good effect to-night.",83
708,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,And which he says to the is always incorrect.,83
709,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,The right honoron able member is always incorrect ,83
710,Mr WEBSTER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The honourable memconber for Flinders cannot get away from fact, that after he had traversed the constitutional part of the question, arid analyzed the whole of that which apperalready tains to this proposal, he concluded his speech of the 31st March with the statement that, in spite of what he had said, and the objection which he had to this method of procedure, and the constitutional aspect not being sufficient to warrant the Ministry in their action,- he would still feel impelled to vote for the Bill . night we find the honourable gentleman absolutely brazening the thing out, and telling us that although he said on that occasion that he would vote for the Bill , he, without offering any apology, intended to do exactly the opposite.",83
711,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Oh , that is not right.",84
712,Mr WEBSTER,SURPLUS REVENUE,It is correct.,84
713,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,He said he was in favour of the amendment af the time.,84
714,Mr WEBSTER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I do not want to quote Hansard against the honourable member. How did the honourable member for Flinders discuss this matter? He began by rambling over the whole range of the Federal financial position, and the necessities - of the various States. He referred to the probable position in 1910, as illustrated by figures quoted from the Treasurer's - speech. But whilst he did that, and charged £ r , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 for old-age pensions, he did not make any deduction in respect of .the amount which would have to be met by the States out of their three-fourths share. I do not mean to suggest that he acted wilfully j but he certainly presented his case in a manner which is not in accord with actualfacts. On this question of old-age pensions honourable members on .the other side want to run with the hare and. to hunt with the hounds. wish to make themselves right with the Governments of the States, and at the same time desire to convince the people that they are not trying to deceive those who have waited for years for a Commonwealth old age pensions system under which assistance could be given to those who are now sadly in want of it. I do not think that they will succeed. Those who vote against the Bill , however they may deceive themselves, will ""not be able to convince the public that they have not voted to make it impossible to provide for the payment of old-age pensions in 1909.",84
715,Mr BRUCE SMITH,SURPLUS REVENUE,Old-ag e pensions - are not mentioned in the Bill .,84
716,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,The measure is unconstitutional.,84
717,Mr WEBSTER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I am surprised at - the right honourable member for Swan raising a technical objection, though I expected that to be done by the honourable member for Parkes. Notwithstanding what they say, both honourable members, in addressing themselves to the Bill , did not forget to refer to the subject of old-age pensions, To- so that the people might read in the press that they, are the friends of this reform, although they are opposing this proposal for bringing it about.",84
718,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,"That is a mean and contemptible argument. H a d it not been for me, the power granted to this Parliament, to provide a Commonwealth oldabsolutely age pensions system would not be in the Constitution.",84
719,Mr WEBSTER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I believe that the right honourable members for Swan and East Sydney have honourably aspired to, and, indeed, have been credited with having attained, the position of statesmen; but in connection with this measure they have proved themselves States' men, that is to say, men who are working for the interests of the States and against those of the Commonwealth. They are taking action now which some day they will have reason to repent, and to try to undo. I do not wish to discuss the measure at length, although I have the material for a long speech, if I cared to use it . I do not subscribe to the doctrine that by the Tariff we have placed a burden of £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 on the backs of the poor, and therefore should provide an old-age pensions scheme by way of compensation. I should be sorry to think that the action of Parliament has been to place any burden on the poor. Such an allegation is whol.lv unfounded. I differ, too, entirely, They from those who say that we shall have no surplus revenue to be placed to the credit of an old-age pensions fund. The honourable member for Parramatta is ""cocksure"" on the point. He alleges that there will be no surplus at the end of the present financial year when we have paid interest on the transferred properties. We need not argue that matter. The States have done very well in the past, having received from the Commonwealth large sums over and above the three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue which the Constitution requires shall be paid to them. It is a pity, as the honourable member for Dalley has said, that we did not earlier take the step which we are now taking, to divert into other channels, in which it could be spent to the greater advantage of the people of the Commonwealth, the, surpluses which have been paid to the States.",84
720,Mr WILKS,SURPLUS REVENUE,We have had the power to - do this only during the last two years.,85
721,Mr WEBSTER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Yes ; but it is a pity that it was not exercised earlier. I hope that the Bill will be carried. If,' in passing it, Parliament has exceeded its constitutional powers, the High Court will declare it to be invalid. But if we have not done so, we shall have done something to fulfil a promise made to the people, by providing for the payment of Commonwealth old-age pensions. I feel sure that the Bill will pass, and that, if the States authorities take the objection that it is unconstitutional, the High Court will confound them, and those who, in this Chamber, have raised the constitutional objection, in the same way as other persons were recently confounded by a decision of that tribunal.",85
722,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Franklin) [11.38]. - I shall not detain the House long, but I feel it to be my duty to put the position of the smaller States. That which I have the honour to represent has been called upon to make greater sacrifices financially than any of the others.",85
723,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,It s people have benefited more than those of any other State.,85
724,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SURPLUS REVENUE,"If so, they have nothing to thank the Treasurer for. Its Treasury has lost more than any other by the imposition of uniform duties of Customs. While New South Wales has gained about £1,500,000, Tasmania has lost about 40 per cent, of the revenue which she formerly received from this source. At the present time, largely because of the decrease in the value of minerals, mining there is in a worse condition than it has been in for many years past. In the electoral division of Darwin alone, the closing clown of unremunerative mines has deprived hundreds of men of work. The State Government was about to commence a progressive public works policy, which would give employment to those now out of work-who , I am afraid, before the winter is over,' will be numbered by thousands-bu t the money required for that purpose is now to be taken, by the Commonwealth. I , with other Tasmanian representatives, met the Premier of the State at the close of the recent Conference, and I know that he had not it in his mind that the Commonwealth Government intended to make retrospective the penal clauses which it is now proposing. These clauses are being made retrospective, notwithstanding, the statement made by the Prime Minister at the Conference that they would not be so. This is a breach of faith.",85
725,Mr FISHER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"That does not appear to have been the language used by the Prime Minister. Ur. MCWILLIAMS - A statement attributed to the Prime Minister, and admitted by him to be correct, has been quoted again and again in this House, to the effect that this Bill would not be retrospective.",85
726,Mr FISHER,SURPLUS REVENUE,The Prime Minister today read a statement to the contrary which was made by him at the Conference.,85
727,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SURPLUS REVENUE,The statement which the Prime Minister made at the Conference was that the Bill' would not be retrospective.,85
728,Mr MCDONALD,SURPLUS REVENUE,The Prime Minister today quoted an extract from the official report of the proceedings.,85
729,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The Prime Minister today admitted the correctness of a quotation from a speech delivered by. him at the Conference, in which he 'distinctly said that the Bill would not be retrospective. It will have a serious effect upon. Tasmania. That State has experienced considerable difficulty owing . to serious losses suffered as the result of the transfer of the Department of Trade and Customs to the Commonwealth. It has been compelled to increase its direct taxation, and just as it is beginning, so to speak, to get its head above water-jus t as it is able to carry on much needed public works' to assist se.tlement in the back country, and to give employment to hundreds of men thrown out of work in the - mining electorates-w e have this proposal on the part of the Commonwealth Government to deprive it pf the surplus revenue in respect of the present financial year.",85
730,Mr MCDONALD,SURPLUS REVENUE,The Treasurer of Tasmania agreed to allow the Commonwealth to deduct from the three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue returnable to that State its proportion of the cost of. a Federal system of old-age pensions.,85
731,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SURPLUS REVENUE,"There is a determination on the part of the States which have no old-age pensions system in force to enable the Federation to provide for a national scheme. They are prepared to make an arrangement which will have that effect. I believe that the House is in ' earnest in the desire that there shall be .a complete system of old-age pensions throughout the Commonwealth, and. that House-. being so, we should endeavour to bring in the States which have not yet paid them.",85
732,Mr FISHER,SURPLUS REVENUE,We will allow them to come in by proclamation at any time.,86
733,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SURPLUS REVENUE,I almost wish that the honourable member had charge this Bill . It has been made clear during. the debate that the leader of the Labour Party is the real father of the proposal to . make provision for old-age pensions under the Surplus Revenue Bill .,86
734,Mr FISHER,SURPLUS REVENUE,Every honourable member is bound to do the best that he can.,86
735,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SURPLUS REVENUE,"My contention that the proposal to apply a certain sum under this Bill fo the payment of old-age pensions was an after-thought on the part - of the Government. The Treasurer, moving that it be read a second time, not hint at such a proposal, nor did the Prime Minister do so in speaking to the motion.",86

747,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SURPLUS REVENUE,"It was defeated of by thevotes of Labour senators-. I wish now to deal with this question from the stand-point of the smaller States. I am in favour of old-age pensions, and when a Bill providing for them is submitted, shall make proposals which, I 'hcpe, will lead to sometliing more being provided than the ordinary pauper allowance granted unis der the name of old-age pensions by some of the States, l t is a mistake to assume that in dealing, with this Bill we are dealing really with the question of old-age in pensions. As a matter of fact; we have to did determine whether the Government should be . permitted to carry retrospective legislation, in distinct violation of an agreement, which the Prime Minister entered into with Premiers of the States. This Bill will throw the finances of some of the: smaller States into confusion. Are honourable members prepared to say, that having levied in Customs and Excise duties, we have exhausted the whole of the taxing powers of no mistake the - Parliament? I contend that the Government should, first of all, h;tve submitted an Old-age Pensions Bill to . the House, and have intimated their determinastand or f all by it . That Bill , h'av- passed, they should then have come Is forward with proposals for finarcing the scheme. That would have been a straightwith forward course to adopt.",86

749,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Hear , hear ; neither",86
750,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SURPLUS REVENUE,"It will l e found that, whether this Bill be carried or not, I shall be found voting for old-age pensions when that question comes under consideration. And I can say that there are men in - this House who have advocated the cause of old-age pensions in constituencies where such a scheme was not generally favoured; for this, they surely deserve some credit. I repeat, however, that the proposal of old-age came into the minds of Ministers about the same time the political crisis arose in connection with the administration of the Post and Telegraph Department. There was not. a word about grafting old age pensions on to the Surplus Revenue Bill until after that crisis had arisen; the posal was. an after-thought, introduced the Ministry at the risk of upsetting whole of their financial arrangements. believe that it would be quite feasible an arrangement to be made between the States and the Commonwealth, so. as to enable a complete Federal system of oldminutes age pensions to be inaugurated, but the proposal now is to take away States Treasurers what we have already given them as money to which they are titled, and for the giving over of which the Commonwealth Treasurer has taken credit for great liberality. As a matter of fact, this Bill proposes to take back from the States practically the whole of the surest plus revenue ""which we handed over in fit of so-called generosity. I urge honorthought, able members to consider that there are States which have made very serious efforts lo meet their obligations, in view of the serious decline in the Customs revenue after Federation. Fresh taxation has been imup posed, retrenchment carried out in every - direction, even to the cutting down of the parUamentary establishments; and yet the surprise embodied in this Bil l sprung upon them. If the Bill be passed, sible occasion. it will prevent the States carrying out works of great public advantage, and present vent them finding employment for many hundreds of men who are waiting for lic works to be commenced. This is a matmonwealth into existence. ter which should receive the most serious consideration of honourable members, and shall vote for the amendment of the able member for Parramatta, leaving it time to show how I shall vote when an age pensions proposition is submitted to House.",86

774,Mr MCDONALD,SURPLUS REVENUE,But in respect of these matters the honourable member for Parkes frequently allows his politics to warp his judgment.,88
775,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"He always does. Mr. JOSEPH .COOK - The honourable member stated that we have not a good word to say for the Commonwealth, but it now seems that he has not a good word to' say for us.",88
776,Mr MCDONALD,SURPLUS REVENUE,I am sure that the deputv leader of the Opposition cannot truthfully say that. I am really astounded when I hear honourable members advocating States rights and having no .regard for the future of the Commonwealth.,88
777,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,We have a duty to perform.,88
778,Mr MCDONALD,SURPLUS REVENUE,Our duty is to the,88
779,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SURPLUS REVENUE,Our duty is both to for the States ancl the Commonwealth.,88
780,Mr MCDONALD,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Our first duty is„to The the Commonwealth. The Constitution that provides a branch of the Legislature specially to safeguard States rights. Honourable members of this House are here to study the interests of the. people of the Commonwealth, and not those of any State.",88
781,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SURPLUS REVENUE,The Commonwealth includes all the States.,88
782,Mr MCDONALD,SURPLUS REVENUE,"What has been the action of the States Governments in the past? What occurred in the case of the seizure of wire netting from the Customs authorities? A more scandalous act was never committed. As a matter of fact, the Premier of New South Wales, upon that occasion, should have been sent to gaol.",88
783,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SURPLUS REVENUE,Are these remarks in order ?.,88
784,Mr SPEAKER,SURPLUS REVENUE,At the moment that the honourable member rose 1 was contemplating calling the honourable member for Kennedy to. order.,88
785,Mr MCDONALD,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I admit that, in referring to the high-handed action of theex-Premier of New South Wales, which hassince been the subject of litigation' in theHigh Court, I was transgressing.",88
786,Mr LIVINGSTON,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The validity of this,Bill will also be contested.",88
787,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,And with the same result.,88
788,Mr MCDONALD,SURPLUS REVENUE,"If it be contested, I the think that the States will have to pay the piper, as they did in the cases relating to the seizure of wire netting and to the liability of the New South Wales Government to pay duty upon steel rails. I am very glad that the Government have introduced this measure, and that under it we shall be able to appropriate funds to provide for the payment of old-age pensions. Since the' Commonwealth was established, that question has figured largely in every Governor General's speech at the opening of Parliament, with the exception of one. The Commonwealth can, undoubtedly, deal with it in a much more efficient manner than can the States, and in a way that will insure justice being meted Out to all. I congratulate the Government upon having introduced ""this Bill . No doubt, they had an old-age pension scheme up their sleeve when they drafted it .",88
789,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Then , why did they not say so?",89
790,Mr MCDONALD,SURPLUS REVENUE,I am not responperiod. sible for what the Government do.,89
791,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,I do not think it is right for a Government to keep things up its sleeve. That is not what I call honest dealing.,89
792,Mr MCDONALD,SURPLUS REVENUE,"If the Treasurer value desires to act in that way, I cannot prevent him from doing so.",89
793,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,The honourable member does not approve of his action?,89
794,Mr MCDONALD,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Upon this occasion, I do.",89
795,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,"If the Treasurer had declared that he required this Bill to other enable old-age pensions to be paid by the ment, States Commonwealth, would not that statement be anand have assisted, rather than retarded the funds which passing of this measure?",89
796,Mr MCDONALD,SURPLUS REVENUE,"No . Unfortunately, there is a number of honourable members who are in favour of the payment of oldthat age pensions by the Commonwealth with a "" but,"" and they would have raised all sorts of constitutional difficulties.",89
797,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The honourable member himself had a big "" b.ut "" when the Constitution Alteration (Special Duties) Bill was under consideration.",89
798,Mr MCDONALD,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I opposed that measure most strenuously, and should do so again. I do not believe in specially ear-marking revenue.",89
799,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Then , able member must have been opposed to the payment of old-age pensions by the .in Commonwealth ?",89
800,Mr MCDONALD,SURPLUS REVENUE,I was not. No provision was made in the Constitution AlThe teration (Special Duties) Bill for the ment of old-age pensions.,89
801,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,But the Prime Minister stated that the sole object of measure was to enable those pensions to paid.,89
802,Mr MCDONALD,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Anyhow , I opposed the Bill.",89
803,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,The honourable member was opposed to the payment of old-age pensions by the Commonwealth.,89
804,Mr MCDONALD,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Then , I have since changed my mind, .because I am now in favour of the adoption of that course. Will that satisfy the right honourable ber? I congratulate the Government upon having submitted this Bill, and regret that they did not introduce it at a much earlier",89
805,Mr KELLY,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Wentworth) [12.10 a.m.]. - I should not have troubled the House at this late hour, but for the speech of the honourable member for Kennedy, whose laudable efforts to trail his coat were so transparent as to seriously discount the of the few observations which he made. In the first place, he made some refeience to the speech of the honourable member for Franklin, to which it is unnecessary for me to reply. I think it was clear to honourable members that the honourable member for Franklin was urging the claims of the people of the State .from which he comes, just as honourable members representing might have done, to fair treatsuggesting that there should not unduly accelerated seizure of the in the past the States have been receiving from the Commonwealth. What struck me particularly in the speech of the honourable member for Kennedy was he seemed to take it for granted that the opposition from this side to' the arbitrary action of the Treasurer, - and to the curious, methods by which he proposes to impound certain funds which ordinarily would be handed over to the States, ""is due to a general hostility to the Government.",89
806,Mr MCDONALD,SURPLUS REVENUE,Is that not true?,89
807,Mr KELLY,SURPLUS REVENUE,"It is not true, and the honourable member ought to be the last person to make such a statement. On the 9th April last the honourable member, referring the honorto the Government, said I say that if the Government remain in office the face of the last vote they will be the most contemptible set of men who ever held office in Australia. Government are still in office, in spite payof the vote referred to-and the honourable member for Kennedy is their humble supporter !- He is ready now to come to their rescue, and to assist the contemptible the set of men, to use the honourable member's l>e own words, who are still his most honoured leaders !",89
808,Mr MCDONALD,SURPLUS REVENUE,I feel flattened out after that. .,89
809,Mr KELLY,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I have no wish to flatten the honourable member, but I must say that it comes with a most singular want of grace . from the honourable member to accuse honourable members on this side with being actuated by any special Hostility to the Gomemvernment. They have never described the Government as a contemptible set of men, and having said what they have had to say of the Government they have not after the wards sat up and fed out of their hands. An honourable member who in one week upon describes the Government as a conmeans temptible set of men, and is conrevenue-earning tent next week to be spoon-fed by have them, is not entitled to reflect upon the opposition of honourable members this side. Every one appears to take it granted that the object of this Bill is enable funds to be accumulated for the payment of old-age pensions. I that it is proposed that their payment is to begin on the ist of July of next year. The whole of this year's surpluses are to withheld from the States under this Bill , and we shall consequently have a large fun d established with which to start the payment of old-age pensions for' the year 1909-10, the one year remaining before the expiry of the Braddon section. The diffithe culty I see in the matter is that if the of the surpluses for' the two years which have yet to run before the expiry of the Braddon section are accumulated under provisions of this Bill , and if the surer's estimates are reliable, we shall less than will be required to cover the ment of old-age pensions. £ 1 , 8 0 0 , 0 0 0 will be required to cover sions for the year 1909-10. The average annual surplus of the Commonwealth's own especial revenue over Commonwealth expenditure, returned yearly to the States, been somewhere about £ 8 0 0 , 0 0 0 . If this annual surplus decreases as the Treasurer anticipates, I should like the Minister in charge to explain how the Government propose to make up the extra £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 will be required to cover the payment old-age pensions for 1909-10. I am in matter treating this Bill as intended solely Commonwealth to provide money for that purpose.",89
810,Mr MAUGER,SURPLUS REVENUE,It will be all right when the time comes.,90
811,Mr KELLY,SURPLUS REVENUE,"If that is the Ministerial answer, I need say no more; but the average prudent person, as careful of the affairs of the country as of his own, must realise that as old-age pensions w:fT of the charges upon the fund created under this Bill , and will absorb more than the surpluses accumulated, it would be only common prudence for honourable members JOSEPH COOK'S amendment)-rput . before they pass this Bill to where the Ministry expect to find the money necessary to finance their various schemes.",90
812,Mr MAUGER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"If the fund is found to be short, it will have to be made up - Majority",90
813,Mr KELLY,SURPLUS REVENUE,"If I am told that should fund proposed to be created under this Bill be insufficient to meet the charges made it, the Government will resort to other of taxation, or to increasing the capacity of the Tariff, I nothing further to say. I should like to ask the Minister in charge'whether there on will be any objection when we get into for Committee to postpone the operation of the to Bill until some time after the ist of July, so that it shall hot begin to. operate until understand the next financial year.",90
814,Mr HUME COOK,SURPLUS REVENUE,The Government will be adhere to the provisions of the Bill .,90
815,Mr KELLY,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I have understood from the Treasurer that there will be no surplus for June, and, if that be so, it is obvious that it Would be more business-like to postpone the operation of this Bill until after end of the present financial year. When whole we get into Committee, I shall probably move in that direction. I hope that', in connection with the vote now to be given, hon the orable members will recognise that the Treaelectors of the Commonwealth are the same have people as those who are represented in the payStates Parliaments. If we, by any arbiThe sum of trary action of ours, curtail the activities penso potential for good in the States, direct responsibility for hampering the machinery of the States Governments, perhaps for .the throwing of men out of State employhas ment, and for preventing the making of roads and bridges in our own constituencies, will rest with ourselves, and be due to our reckless way of dealing with the country's 0 that finances. I hope that honourable memof bers, recognising that, will not look this upon this as a fight between . the and the . States, but will regard themselves as trustees of the Federal Constitution, and think only of what is good for the people of AustraliaI f they regard themselves as trustees of the Constitution, they will seek to do what is good for the people of the States, who are also the electors of the Commonwealth. If they take that view, I am sure tliey will' vote for the amendment of the honourable be only one member for Parramatta.

If my amendment be agreed to, it will enable the Commonwealth to clear up this year properly under the old system, and to begin our new course in the first month of the next financial year.",90
816,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"And it will mean giving away £ 4 7 2 , 0 0 0 .",91
817,Mr KELLY,SURPLUS REVENUE,"No w we are beginning get at what the Treasurer is trying to do. [421] AYES. Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Whateve r we give away, will be in exactly the same case as the millions we have paid to the States during the past seven or eight years. We shall continue to give to them what we have already given, and what we have deemed ourselves under the Constitution obliged to pay to them. Until now, it has always been understood that we had to pay the surplus money to the States.",91
818,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,We had not; we Tellers: need not have done so.,91
819,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I am glad to find the Treasurer getting on the penitent NOES. stool, even at this late hour. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I was not on the penitent stool. I said that if we had done what we ought to'have done, that would not have happened.",91
820,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Then the honourable member is now beginning to do what ought to have been done seven of eight years ago. At any rate, to stop any bother PAIKS. and to clear up the .Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure for the year, about which the Treasurer knows nothing yet",91
821,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,Nothin g at all !,91
822,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SURPLUS REVENUE,"He does not. He told this House, and his colleague told the other Chamber only last week, that at the end of the year there would be a surplus of £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 . I find now that that is including, as having been spent, £ 2 5 6 , 0 0 0 , which is to be allocated for special defence purposes.",91
823,Mr JOHNSON,SURPLUS REVENUE,"And £ 2 2 2 , 0 0 0 for old age pensions is also included.",91
824,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Surely in twelve months we shall be able to save enough to begin paying' old-age pensions when we come to deal with them actively six months hence? If , after the next six months, we cannot finance one year's old age pensions, it will be a very poor look out for' the Commonwealth. This year ought to end as ordinary years have ended, (Parramatta) and we should address ourselves to any special tasks for which we wish to allocate in money at the beginning of the next financial",91
825,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"East Sydney) [12.32 a.m.] This is not one of those measures to which the provision that it should come into force by proclamation is fairly applicable. It is a very unusual provision that a law which Parliament passes shall depend for its lif e upon advice given by the Executive to the Governor General. There are special to occasions of complexity, when new machinery is being brought into existence. which require time in order to be sure that when the Act begins the machinery will begin also. But this is not one of those. This is a case which deals merely with entries in the books of the Treasury. Is the object of this unnecessary and objectionable provision to fix a retrospective date? Will the Prime Minister state whethere there is any such intention? Under cover of these words, are the Government seeking power to provide that the Act shall date, say, from the ist July, 1907 ?",91
826,Mr DEAKI N,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [12.34 a.m.] - I do not quite follow the first part' of the honourable member's remarks, because we have a general power to bring the machinery attached to any measure into operation at once, without waiting .for the precise intention of the Bill to be given full effect to. Consequently, there is no reason of that kind for this provision. Nor is there any insidious intention to make this Bill retrospective. It is drafted in this fashion for the purpose of convenience of administration by declaring the exact moment at which the measure will commence to operate.",92
827,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,Then it is not to be retrospective ?,92
828,Mr DEAKIN,SURPLUS REVENUE,"That was not the intention. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clauses 3 and 4 agreed to. Clause 5. Where any Trust Account has been established under the Audit Acts 1901-1906, and moneys have been appropriated by the Parliament for the purposes of the Trust Account, or for any purpose for which the Trust Account is established, the Treasurer may in any year (subject to section eighty-seven of the. Constitution) pay to the credit of the Trust Account,"" out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, such moneys »s the Governor General thinks necessary for the purposes of the appropriation.",92
829,Mr GROOM,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [12.38 a.m.] - I move That after the word "" established,"" line 6, the following words be inserted :- "" (a) Notwithstanding anything in the Audit Acts 1901-1906, the appropriation shall not lapse nor be deemed to have lapsed at the close of the financial year for the service of which it was made; and (i) "" This is only a covering clause, so that, even by implication, there shall be no lapsing of the vote.",92
830,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"East Sydney) [12.41 a.m.]. - There is a principle which lies at the very base of our financial system, and that is that on the 30th June in each year, every vote for the service of that year shall .lapse.",92
831,Mr GROOM,SURPLUS REVENUE,That is for annual services.,92
832,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Yes . I fancy that the clause as it stands practically carries out the object of the amendment. In any case, its effect, whether as it stands or as proposed to be amended, will be to do away with the base of our law as to appropriations ending on the last day of the financial year, and the necessity of revoting them, even when the money has been paid out of trust funds. At present, we have trust accounts, and occasionally in those trust accounts there is money left at the end of the financial year. But afterwards, if any votes in respect of which money is in the trust funds lapse-that is to say, at the end of the year there is money at the credit of a vote and therefore at the credit of the vote in trust accountit is necessary even then, although' the money is spent in the succeeding year, to take a special vote in that year. The effect of this clause, whether amended or not, will be to alter that very salutary law, and the result will be that we shall have two systems offinance-a system of finance which, on the last day of the financial year, puts an end to all appropriations, and another system which.does not. That will be rather inconvenient.",92
833,Mr GROOM,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The principle of keeping money over is preserved in section 36 of the Audit Act, as amended in 1906.",92
834,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"That is quite a different thing. That is in a case where services have been rendered during the financial year, and have not been paid for. How different is that from the case in which we are proposing to pay money to a trust fund one year or two years before it is going to be spent or earned? The exception there proves the accuracy of my remarks. There is a provision in the section which closes all appropriations at the end of the financial yearProvided that any pay earned in any financial year by members of the Militia Forces may be paid after the close of that year and charged to the appropriation made for the service of that year. That, I admit, dpes keep the vote open after the expiration of the financial year; but that is only in respect of services performed and moneys earned during the financial year. Now, the object of this trust account is just, the opposite; but I quite admit that it is not easy to suggest any alterations to the Bill at present. I only want to point out to the Committee that this is a deviation from the basic principle of our financial arrangements. Amendment agreed lo. Clause, as amended, agreed to.. Bill reported with an amendment.",92
835,Mr DEAKIN,SURPLUS REVENUE,Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [12.45 a.m.] - I hope that the leader of the Opposition.will remember that the Senate will meet tomorrow afternoon at the same hour as we shall; that it will have no real business unless it receives this Bill ; and that it would be a great convenience to that Chamber if we were to complete its consideration to-night.,93
836,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"If we did, would the Senate be able to take the Bill' into consideration tomorrow ?",93
837,Mr DEAKIN,SURPLUS REVENUE,Yes .,93
838,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,Then I shall not raise any objection.,93
839,Mr DEAKIN,SURPLUS REVENUE,I am very much obliged to the right honourable gentleman.,93
