2,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Will the Prime Minister inform the House what business the Government propose to deal with before the adjournment, and when that adjournment is likely to take place, so that honourable members may make their arrangements ?",21
3,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"For the answer to the first part of the question, I refer honourable members to the notice paper. We intend today to introduce a Bill to provide for the payment of a bounty upon the production of crude shale oil, and another to amend the Wood Pulp and Rock Phosphate Bounties Act. Of those already before the House, we shall deal first with the Loan Bill, now under consideration in Committee; then with the Public Works Committee Bill, and the Committee of Public' Accounts Bill, both, I think, non-controversial; with the Naturalization Eill, which is a non-party measure, and should not give rise to much discussion; with the consideration of the Senate's amendments in the Railways .Bill; and with the Defence Bill. In regard to the second part of the question, it is the intention of the Government to ask the House to meet next Tuesday at 3 o'clock, and next Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, aft 11 o'clock, so that, if possible, ire may complete our business next week. That business will be the Repatriation Bill, the .measure providing for in-oeraetaxation, including the taxation of single persons who are not otherwise exempt, and possibly a measure outlined in the Governor General's Speech; to provide for the creation of a Minister for Repatriation. It is proposed to adjourn, only for a few weeks, Mr Tunoit --When shall we be asked to meet again ?",21

8,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Althoug h the question is, perhaps, not an urgent one, I shall answer it without notice, because it relates to the administration of justice. My colleague, the Postmaster-General, has already brought the case under my I do not know whether the man has been convicted under a State or under a monwealth law, and I am sure that honourable member will not ask me to more now about the case than that I shall look into it. NA REGULATION Mr J. H.. CATTS - The honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West) has given notice of his intention to move for the disallowance of a regulation under the War Precautions Act affecting the legal rights of persons who have taken action to redress what they consider a grave injustice. Will the Prime Minister provide an opportunity for the discussion of the motion ? I understand that the regulation has a retrospective action,, and practically takes away the rights, of persons who have initiated actions in the Courts.",22
9,Mr HUGHES,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I tkowgb* that this Blatter had Been; disposedof by a reply which I gave tethe honourable member for East Sydney. I told him that the regulation, in itself, would be inoperative in the case in which he is interested,, unless I acted on it ; that, if I did not take away this man's, rights, he could not be prejudiced by it. I promised, moreover, that if I found it necessary to take away his rights, I would: give an opportunity for the discussion of the motion. If I do not interfere, there wiU be no necessity for such discussion. TELEPHONE MONITORS.",22

13,Dr MALONEY,INTERCEPTION OP WIRELESS,"In order to remove a slur that has been cast on the Melbourne City Abattoirs, and which is keenly resented by the Melbourne City Council, I desire to ask the Minister for the Navy whether he can inform the House where the livers, diseased with hydatids, that were supplied by Mr . Angliss to the Navy for consumption on board transports, were obtained. Melbourne City Abattoirs deny that they were responsible for any of these livers, going out, and they wish the matter to be cleared up.",23
14,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INTERCEPTION OP WIRELESS,"Answerin g this very old .question, I should like to say that the information I have dearly indicates that part of the supply of diseased livers came from abattoirs controlled by the Melbourne City Council. mainder came from private abattoirs, which also had been, or should have been, inspected under the State health laws.",23

22,Mr GLYNN,TELEPHONE CONDUIT SINBUSH,"In the six or seven cases covered by the honourable member's question, there was a slight doubt as to whether we were compelled to complete the transactions, which were entered into by my predecessor in office, Mr - King O'Malley. Having looked into the The re- merits of these cases, I thought thÂ© landowners should be paid. I applied to the Treasurer for the money, with the result that the Cabinet decided to' recognise the transactions as if they had been made by this Government. On the money being forthcoming we shall settle with these landowners. ADJOURNMENT (Formal). TOWNS.. REGULATIONS UNDE RWAR PRECAUTIONS' ACT^-DEREGISTRATIO N OF UNION S, Mr SPEAKER reported that he had received from the honourable member for Yarra' an intimation that he intended to move the adjournment, of the House, to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" The issue of the regulations under the War Precautions Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed.",23
23,Mr TUDOR,TELEPHONE CONDUIT SINBUSH,"Yarra) [2.46] - The regulations to which I desire particularly to As one refer are included in what I might term the "" bundle"" distributed today amongst honourable members. Every day we receive a copy of the notice-paper for the House of Representatives, and very often it is accompanied by bundles of regulations. It will be generally 1 admitted that the regulations under the War Precautions .Act, copies of which were distributed today, are far reaching in their character. I am aware that under the Acts Interpretation Act any regulation may be disallowed, on resolution by either House, within fifteen sitting days of the issue; but I also know that during the sixteen years of the. life of this Parliament, practically not one regulation has been discussed in this House. Some four or five years ago the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bamford) gave notice of his intention to move that a certain regulation be disallowed, thinking that the placing of such a notice on the notice-paper would prevent the regulation becoming operative until the motion had been dealt with. He was, however, wrong in that conclusion. A notice of motion to disallow a regulation has to take its place in the ordinary list, and my experience is that it is seldom that we have an opportunity to discuss any notice of motion standing in the name of a private member, and no such motion is ever carried unless the House is practically unanimous. Three regulations under the War Precautions Act have been issued today. One of these relates to the deregistration of unions. It is regulation No. 212, and it provides thatAfter Regulation 29 of the War Precautions (Supplementary) Begulations the following Regulation is inserted :"" 30. (1) Where the Governor General is satisfied that any association or organization of employees registered under any Commonwealth or State Act relating to arbitration'or the prevention or settlement of industrial disputes has, or that members thereof or of any branch or section thereof have, since the making of this regulation ceased work or become engaged in a strike or cessation of work the Governor General may by notice in the Gazette declare that he is so satisfied, and thereupon the registration of the association or organization shall for all purposes whatsoever be deemed to be cancelled and the members of the association or organization shall cease to be entitled to the benefit of any award ap1 plicable to the association or organization, or, where the declaration applies only to one or more branches or sections of the association or organization, the registration of the association or organization shall as regards the members of that branch or section of those branches or sections be deemed for all purposes whatsoever to becancelled, and the members of that branch or section or those branches or sections shall cease to be entitled to the benefit of any award applicable to the association or organization. "" (2) Within seven days after the tion of the Gazette of any such declaration application may be made to the Attorney General by or on behalf of the association, Mr Tudor. organization, branch or section to which the declaration relates for the cancellation of the declaration, and if, after the Attorney-General has heard the representations made by or on behalf of the association, organization, branch, or section, the Governor General is satisfied that the association or organization, or the members thereof or of the branch or section, as the case may be, did not cease work or become engaged in a strike, or cessation of work, the Governor General may by order cancel the declaration made by him; and the declaration shall thereupon be deemed to be and to have been of no effect."" The whole object of this regulation is to place on the unions, or branches of unions, the obligation to prove their innocence, thus inverting the ordinary processes of law, and what has been understood to be the foundation of justice in the community. First of all, a union is declared guilty, and is then called upon to prove its innocence. No one knows better than the Prime Minister the struggles that these organizations have had to obtain an award in the Arbitration Court. They have to wait for long periods before their cases can be heard, and I think I am safe in saying that years may elapse before an award is obtained; and now it is sought to sweep away all these rights and privileges because somebody thinks that something has been done that ought not to have been done. When the War Precautions Act was introduced by the present Prime . Minister, as Attorney-General, he, as reported on page 369 of Hansard, of the 28th October, 1914, saidThe Bill is. one that the present circumstances call for. It has been drafted to meet certain conditions lately arising, which the laws of the Commonwealth and the proclamations issued by the Governor General have been insufficient to deal with. The Bill confers upon the Commonwealth power to make orders and regulations of a far-reaching character, and, as honourable members may see in clauses 4 and 5, is mainly directed to preventing the leakage of important secrets, to secure the safety of means of communication, railways, docks, harbors, or public works, and to deal effectively with aliens, and, in certain circumstances, with naturalized persons. Its aim is to prevent the disclosure of important information, to give power to deport, and otherwise deal with aliens, to interrogate and obtain information in various ways, and to appoint officers to carry into effect any orders or regulations which may be made under the Bill. publicaI was a member of the Government which introduced that measure, and I declare deliberately that not a member of that Government expected that it would be used during an industrial crisis. I do not think there was one honourable member of the then Opposition who dreamt that the Bill, and the regulations framed under it, would be used, not for the purpose pf settling industrial disputes, but for the purpose of creating them; yet some of the regulations are standing in the way of a settlement of the present industrial crisis.",23
24,Sir JOHN FOKEEST,TELEPHONE CONDUIT SINBUSH,"The Bill was meant for the "" other fellow,"" was it?",25
25,Mr TUDOR,TELEPHONE CONDUIT SINBUSH,"The Bill was never meant for the purposes to which it is now being put, and in support of that view, if time permitted, I could quote the words of the present Prime Minister, the Minister for the Navy, who was in Opposition at the time, the honourable member for Flinders (Sir William Irvine), the honourable member for Angas (Mr Glynn), and others. It was never intended that we should be governed entirely by regulation. Another of the regulations, No. 213, which was foreshadowed in the press, but which I do not think has been put into force yet, gives the Government power, through the Governor General, to alter the awards of the Court. The other day, when the Prime Minister, through certain of his officers, applied for that preference should not be operative at certain ports in Australia, His Honour took exception to the position assumed on behalf of the Government. His Honour, in effect, said that if he gave a decision against the Prime Minister the Prime Minister might turn round and exercise the power which the regulations gave him; in other words, His Honour said that the Prime Minister placed him in the position of the man who had to do this thing, and asked what would his position be if the Prime Minister took a contrary view after the Court had given its decision. That, I think, is a fair interpretation of the attitude assumed by Mr Justice Higgins.",25
26,Mr LECKIE,TELEPHONE CONDUIT SINBUSH,"And very improper, tool",25
27,Mr TUDOR,TELEPHONE CONDUIT SINBUSH,"It wasabsolutely proper. If the Government have power to intervene, let the Government do so, and not endeavour to shelter themselves behind a Judge of the Arbitration Court. In point of fact, the Government are holding a threat over the head of a Judge, and no Judge worthy of the name would continue in the position if he knew that any decision he gave could be vetoed, amended, or revoked by the Government of the day. The Court has to decide whether the organizations were entitled to the preference granted in a proper legal way, under an Act passed by this Parliament. If the present Government and their supporters desire to amend the Arbitration Act, and to take away from the Judge the power to give preference, they ought to introduce an amending Bill in a straightforward way, so that we may have an opportunity of discussing it . Of course, honourable members opposite are all-powerful today, and are able to intervene on the side of the strong as against the weak; and they can endeavour to crush the workers, and take from them those rights for which they have struggled for so many years. But the Government and their supporters must not forget that there will be a "" tomorrow,"" so far as the present industrial trouble is concerned. During the whole of the industrial crisis I have not said one word to accentuate it , or .make it more difficult of settlement. But now we have the Goi vernment issuing regulations with the object of de-registering unions which have struggled for years to obtain awards from an order the Court. We must not forget that organizations in other parts of the world have held that Arbitration Courts will be used by the "" fat man,"" as against the worker; and certainly the present action of the Government tends to confirm that opinion. One regulation dealing with the woollen'industry has, in my opinion, been brought forward for the purpose of trying' to bring the shearers into the present trouble. Up to now the shearers have not moved in this connection, but I noticed in a newspaper report the other day of some Court proceedings in Sydney that they had been asked to come out on strike. The shearers here have not taken any action. /",25
28,Mr CORSER,TELEPHONE CONDUIT SINBUSH,They have in Queensland. There they have been out for a long while.,25
29,Mr TUDOR,TELEPHONE CONDUIT SINBUSH,"Not the whole of the members of the Australian Workers Union in that State. A small section of the shearers in Queensland may have been on strike. The regulation which the Government has issued admits that small sections do at times take action against the advice of the main body. The executive of the Australian Workers Union has deliberately opposed any disturbance of the present industrial conditions, but I do not know anything more likely to provoke a dispute than the f r a m ing of this regulation. It is practically trailing a coat along the ground, and in viting, the shearers to tread on the t a i l of it.",25
30,Mr RODGERS,TELEPHONE CONDUIT SINBUSH,Will the member read the regulation?,26
31,Mr TUDOR,TELEPHONE CONDUIT SINBUSH,"Yes . This document is headed "" Amendment of the War Precautions Regulations,"" and proceedsAfter Regulation 40c of the War Precautions Regulations the following regulation is in- . serted :"" 40D. Any person who by word, deed, or otherwise(a.) Interferes with, impedes, prevents, or hinders shearing operations - or any work connected therewith, or incidental thereto, carriage, unloading, handling, or storing of wool, or . . .",26
32,Mr RODG,TELEPHONE CONDUIT SINBUSH,ERS - It is intended to with carters of wool.,26
33,Mr TUDOR,TELEPHONE CONDUIT SINBUSH,"It intends to deal shearers. If it is not intended, to deal with shearers, why are they mentioned ? If it. is intended to deal with, carters why is it not confined to them ? opinion is that this has been done by the Government with the full intention getting the sh,e,arers to go out on strike, in order to widen the area of the present industrial dispute.",26
34,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,TELEPHONE CONDUIT SINBUSH,I that the Government were trying to get the men to gq back to work.,26
35,Mr TUDOR,TELEPHONE CONDUIT SINBUSH,They'ar e doing no such thing. They are taking this action f o the purpose of provoking trouble. NoWeeding thing has happened in connection with attempts shearing that justifies the gazetting this regulation.,26
36,Mr RODGERS,TELEPHONE CONDUIT SINBUSH,"Is the honourable ber not aware that those who shear early have been asked to hold their wool, be the cause of the difficulty of getting it the stores ?",26
37,Mr TUDOR,TELEPHONE CONDUIT SINBUSH,"Apparentl y the honors able member was not listening when I read the early part of this regulation. proceeds;(b) Interferes with, or impedes, person or body of persons engaged in, or dissuades, prevents, hinders any person or body sons from becoming, or continuing to be, engaged in shearing operations, or any work connected with, or incidental thereto, loading, carriage, unloading, handling, or storage of wool, shall be guilty of an offence."" A third regulation, dealing with wharf labourers, sjays:After Regulation 40B of the War Precautions Regulations the following regulation is inserted :"" 40c. Any person who, by word, deed, or otherwisehonorable (a) Interferes with, impedes, prevents, or hinders the discharge, loading, coaling, or despatch of shipping, or the performance of any industrial operation connected therewith or incidental thereto, or (b) Interferes with, or impedes, any person or body of persons engaged in, or dissuades, prevents, or hinders any person or body of persons from becoming, or continuing to be, engaged in, the discharge, loading, coaling or despatch of shipping, or the performance of any such industrial operation,, or the loading, shall be. guilty of an offence."" There is a case now before the Court deal having reference to a carter who was driving a lorry-load of wall-paper, and, with as alleged by the newspapers, was told not to take it to its destination. Itsdestination was not a transport,, and the wallonly, paper had nothing to do with the war. My The man who said "" Do n ' t take that "" was alleged to have broken ,a regulation of under the War Precautions Act. Apparently the Court said that the wall-paper did not come within the purview of the regulation under which the prosecution thought was instituted, and the case was dismissed, but the representative df the Government asked for ,a case to be stated , 1 with a view to taking proceedings in a r higher Court, probably with the object of 4 the union of all its funds if it to fight the case. It is very easy of for a Government, with the whole of the wealth of the community behind it , to memsmash an organization by taking cases from Court to Court, in the hope that in end the workers wil l be defeated, and into it is quite possible for this to be done under these regulations. Great exception has been taken to the It administration of the censorship regulations. We were informed yesterday, in reply to a question submitted, that the any Argus was allowed to. publish the manior festo of the Strike Committee in Sydney, of perwhile the Labour Gall w.as not permitted to do so. I am anxious to know whether therethe Argus has been dealt with under the 1 or the War Precautions Act, or why the censor should prevent one newspaper from publishing what the Argus was allowed to publish. There is an additional censorship regulation, to tighten it up, I suppose; and it re,as as follows: Regulation 28 is amended by inserting the following new sub-paragraph (4) :"" (4) Any proprietor, printer, or publisher of any newspaper or periodical, and any author, printer, or publisher of any book, circular, or other printed publication, in which a report or statement is spread or made in contravention of this Regulation, whether contrary to the instructions of the proprietor, author, printer, or publisher, or otherwise, shall be guilty of an offence against this Act."" A speech was delivered in another place on Thursday last by Senator Gardiner in connection with the present industrial dispute, and though the newspapers controlled by my friends opposite gave f u l j publicity to the remarks of Senator M i l len, the representative of the 'Government in the Senate, they did not give much publicity to the remarks of Senator Gardiner, and I understand that when permission was sought to publish a reply in the Labour Call, it could not be obtained. I wish to place on record two sentences given utterance by Mr .Justice Higsins in dealing with the Government's application for the deregistration of the Waterside Workers Union. I am quoting from the Argus of the 3rd September. Mr Justice Higgins, speaking to Mr . Starke, who represented the Conunoiiwealth Attorney-General, .said: Are you in a position to explain why the Prime Minister does not deregister the organization under the new regulation under the War Precautions Actf Mr Justice Higgins was aware of the existence of 'this regulation, that we have received officially only today. Later on Mr Justice Higgins said.1 confess that I should like to act as a Judge should act, without a sword hanging over l i e Court, that ""iff he does not comply with an applicant's wish, the applicant may do it .him.seft. That was an unfair position in which to place the Judige of the Arbitration Court. If the Government were honest in their desire to see the law administered fair l y , and if they had any intention at that time of doing'that which.this regulation gives them power to do, it was their duty to have taken such action without appealing to the Court. The Government have no right .to govern 'this country by regulation. When the honourable member for. Flinders (Sir Will i a m Irvine)- was discussing the War Precautions Bill on 28th. October, 1914, he saidClause 5, especially, deals with particular measures requisite for the maintenance of effective defence and security, such as the prohibiting of aliens from embarking, the preventing of persons from disclosing information, and from communicating with the enemy. With regard .to all these things, Parliament will be prepared to give to the Executive the fullest powers required. Every honourable member on this side is inhearty agreement with that statement;, but we object to the War Precautions Act being - employed for purposes which bave absolutely nothing to do with the war. Hoaaorable members opposite may say that the Ac t is in existence, and they will use it as they like.",26
38,Sir JOHN FORREST,TELEPHONE CONDUIT SINBUSH,"It was intended by the honourable member's party for use against the "" other fellow.""",27
39,Mr TUDOR,TELEPHONE CONDUIT SINBUSH,"It was intended for use against enemies'. I defy anybody to say that the Labour Government intended to use the Act against employers as a class > as it is being used by the present Government against employees as a class. Theworkers were never intended to be brought within the scope of this Act ; but the present Government have stretched the W a r Precautions Act for the purpose of intervening in an industrial dispute, and not with a v i e w ' to the settlement of the trouble. The honourable member for Flinders continuedBut I feel a good deal of apprehension about the first part of clause 4. I know what the Government probably desires to obtain by it , but the method proposed - for giving effect to that intention goes to a - length which I think has never been gone before; and the matter ought, therefore, to be considered. The clause says the Governor General may make regulations for securing the public safety and defenceof the Commonwealth. Tliat provision is absolutely unlimited. It invests the Executive. Government of the day with the most complete power to legislate, whether Parliament is or iSnot sitting, on any matter touching the actions or conduct of any member qt the, community. That is the reason why I object to the use of these regulations as they are being used at the present time.",27
40,Mr RODGERS,TELEPHONE CONDUIT SINBUSH,The honourable member is - urging' that the same regulations shall be used to reduce the cost of living.,27
41,Mr TUDOR,TELEPHONE CONDUIT SINBUSH,"That would be a fair use to make of them, because we should be protecting the interests of the .whole of the people; but <if honourable members opposite object to the ""War Precautions Act being put to that use, let them say so. I thank the honourable member for Wannon for hig interjection. He desires the Act to be employed against the strikers, but not against ti e food exploiters. The Act may not be used against the profitmonger, who, according to the Prime Minister's description, gives Â£50 to a patriotic fund, and robs the people of Â£5,000 by an increase of prices, but it may the used in an endeavour to smash down the unions.",27
42,Mr RODGERS,TELEPHONE CONDUIT SINBUSH,"On a point of order. When the Leader of the Opposition objected to the War Precautions Act being used in connection with the strike, I asked if he took the same objection to' its being used to reduce the cost of living. Thereupon the honourable member asserted that I had said that the Act should be used for the purpose of dealing with industrial disputes. Is that statement in order? MT. 'SPEAKER (Hon. W. Elliot Johnson) - The honourable member for Wannon was doubly out of order-firstly , in interjecting, and secondly, in interrupting the Leader of the Opposition on what was not a point of order.",28
43,Mr TUDOR,TELEPHONE CONDUIT SINBUSH,"When Parliament has no opportunity of dealing with these regulations, the Government should not use the powers conferred upon them by the War Precautions Act i h a direction which was never intended by Parliament when the Act was passed.",28
44,Mr HUGHES,TELEPHONE CONDUIT SINBUSH,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [3.18] The Leader of the Opposition has complained of certain regulations issued by the Governor General, and has given some reasons for his disagreeing from the action taken by the Government. He has said a great deal about those regulations, but he has not been accurate in one single citation of facts. When he deserted that firm ground of generalities upon which he and his friends stand so securely, and sought to thread his way through the maze of facts, he became lost. He asserted that we had no right to resort to regulations, and in almost the same breath he upbraided me because I sought the remedy duly provided by Statute, and had dared to go to the Court appointed by this Parliament, when I had power to, act under the very regulation which he condemns. How, then, oan I escape censure ? When I do the very thing that the honourable member says I should, like any other citizen-resor t to the Court-m y action brings on me the sharp censure, not only of the honourable member, but also that of the Judge of the Court. As to the latter, I shall not refer to it further than to repeat what I said in the Argus of 4th September, when I expressed my regret that the Judge of the Court had sought fit to animadvert on the exercise of the powers of the Governor General, which are clearly outside the scope of the Court? With the exercise of the Executive's powers of government the Judiciary has nothing at all to do. A Judge is to interpret the law and decide on its merits the case that is brought before him. It is not for him to inquire into the motives of those seeking the protection of his Court, nor to declare that he will not give relief because the litigant has power to redress his own wrong. It might be said in many an assault case that the plaintiff had power to redress his wrong, but would any magistrate reprove a man for coming bo the Court for protection instead of taking matters into his own hands ? I deny that any of the regulations are improper or unnecessary. On the contrary, they have been more or less effective in protecting the community which, during five or six weeks, has suffered through a large section of the workers deserting their posts. What do the regulations do? Regulation 30, to which allusion has been made, provides that on and after the 29th August any union that may strike-and mark you the unions were practically all on strike at that time, and had then been on strike for four weeks-shal l be deregistered, but can, if it likes, show cause why it should be re-registered. After a strike had been in existence for four weeks we said, "" If any more unions come into the field, we shall deregister them. We cannot allow you to hold up the community and threaten a general strike."" The object of the regulation was to deter unions from striking, and it has been fairly successful. What union has suffered under this regulation? Not one. The only action taken subsequently to the issue of the regulation was my application to the Court for deregistration under the Statute, which in no way arises out of the regulation, and which I could have made at any time previous to its issue. Then there is the regulation providing for the cancellation of preference. I have not time now to quote from my articles on preference in the Case for Labour. The considerations in collective bargaining between employers and employees are preference to unions in return for a continuous supply of labour. But are the unionists who have deserted their posts and their duty, and whose places have been filled by others who are carrying on the business of the country, to be allowed to say, ""Put these men out. We are ready to come back now""? Would it be fair, either to the community or to those who have come to its aid, to accede to such a request? My honourable friend cares nothing for the welfare of the community in this matter. For the past five weeks the country has been throttled, and not one voice from his party has been raised in protest, not a single action by any of them to aid it. He said something about the application of a regulation to the Australian Workers Union. He declares that I issued a regulation with the intention of directing it against that body. I emphatically deny and bitterly resent the assertion. The motive actuating the Government in issuing this regulation was the very opposite of that suggested by the honourable member. We desired to strengthen the hands of the Australian Workers Union executive, and assist it to keep its members at work. Had the other unions acted as the Australian Workers Union has, we should not have had this trouble. That union is a pattern for the unions of Australia. It was bound by an agreement and an award, and it has loyally observed both. I wish that I could say that for the unions with which I have been connected. To the officials and executive of the Australian Workers Union the people of this country OAVO a debt of gratitude. They have saved it from being plunged into a veritable inferno. I have struck a blow for discipline, and in support of the executive of the Australian Workers Union, by threatening with the keen edge of the law a number of Industrial Workers of the World in the back parts of Queensland, who were trying to drag out on strike members of that union, whether they would or would not. In Queensland, where they are shearing at the present time, the members of the Australian Workers Union-the real working men, not the talkers-would , if a poll were taken, declare that they are glad of what the Government have done. The honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) said that the Industrial Workers of the World were playing the game of the employer. Well, I have stopped them from playing that game, and, I hope, any other to the detriment of the country. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) said that the regulations were not intended to be applied to civil conditions. I do not understand the distinction that he would draw. They were intended to be applied to the circumstances created by the war, and to all matters arising out of the war. The honourable member for Bourke (Mr. Anstey), when on this side, opposed the War Precautions'Act provisions even more taken vindictively than he has since done on the other side. He said then - that they ran the whole gamut of power. Did he not anticipate what the High Court has since declared-that they cover the whole sphere of law ? Well, here is a grave civil dispute, in effect a revolt against law, an attempt to prevent the country from carrying on all operations necessary for its protection against the enemy and for its industrial-and general welfare, and he says we stand aside and do nothing. One would 'imagine that the regulations had been turned against the unions and that we were beating them with rods. What are the facts? Although great power has been vested in the Government under the War Precautions Act, I defy any one to say that we have abused that power. My honourable friend said that we have not turned if against the employer. But the truth' is that it has been used against the employer much more harshly than against the employee. We have used it to fix prices, to commandeer products, and to prevent employers from doing many things we conceived to be inimical to the State. All I have done in regard to employees has been to cancel the preference clauses in the awards of unions that were still recalcitrant after the strike had lasted five or six weeks. It was only yesterday that the preference of the Burnie and Devonport branches was cancelled. A week ago the waterside workers enjoyed preference in all the ports of Australia. The law gave them this, and by their agreements with their employers they were bound to supply all necessary labour. They have refused without cause to do so. By what right then do they still claim to enjoy that privilege which by their own unprovoked action they have doubly forfeited. We have no reason to apologize for our actions in this matter. Rather may we invite the attention of the public to the fact that we have maintained afirm and proper stand against the attempt to wrest the reins of government from our hands. I am certain that the community is glad that we have done this, and tens of thousands of workers today are glad that we are in office. Many of the men who were brought out on strike are wishing to God that they could get back. My honourable friend said that he had done nothing to fan the strike. . Nor have 1. I have been connected with too many strikes to try to play it . fan discontent; strikes need not to be fanned, but to have the hose played on them. The men who are on strike must pay the penalty for whab they have done, though, after all, it is not a very heavy one. They cannot throw the community into turmoil and escape scot-free. They have deserted their posts, and others have , taken up their work. Those who have thus served the community ought to, and shall, be protected.",28
45,Mr JH CATTS,TELEPHONE CONDUIT SINBUSH,"Cook) [3.31] - The regulations. attitude of the honourable member for Bensays, digo (Mr Hughes) is one of the most pathetic that could be conceived. He lute hypocrisy. claims that he made an application to the Court for the deregistration of his old union, the Waterside Workers'"" Federaister, tion, so that the ordinary processes justice might be relied on to do what, under a regulation, he could have done without such an application. If the right honourable gentleman had the Court available, why did he frame the regulation As a matter of fact, the regulation framed to enable him to deregister the union. He is now the champion union smasher. He knew that he had the power to go to the Court, and apply for deregislegislation tration, but he preferred to transparently threaten the Court with this regulation as with a bludgeon. No self-respecting Judge could have adopted an attitude other than that of Mr Justice Higgins, who said, "" The Prime Minister asks me to deregister a union although he has power under regulation to do it himself. Am I to conclude that if I refuse, on the evidence presented, to grant deregistration, he will deregister the union by virtue of the power given him by the regulation?"" Undoubtedly, the Prime Minister is a star actor. He would have cut a successf u l figure on the stage. I have seen him, trembling with emotion, the tears rolling down his face, declare that if he' could not stand in with the Labour movement he would go out of public life altogether. Yet today he is using his abilities to play the game of f h e employers and of the enemies of Labour. Those who have opposed Labour all their lives, and wish to destroy unionism, and the power of Labour in combination, sit behind t.l-i r i g h t honourable member with satisfaction.

47,Mr JH CATTS,TELEPHONE CONDUIT SINBUSH,"The honourable member is a typical representative of the Employers Federation. There is more joy among the Liberals over the capture of the Prime Minister than there is in Heaven over the return of the sinner. The Prime Minister spoke of the prerogative of the Governor General to pass Mr Justice Higgins, he acts improperly in criticising an aot of the Governor General. That was absoI t is not the Governor General-no t even the party opposite - bu t this dictator, the Prime M in who frames the.se regulations.' of This country is being ruled by a dictator. He moves a little clique, which, in turn , influences the party opposite, and it , being in the majority, governs the Parliament. There is no vestige of responsible govern? ment in Australia today. We have in was stead government by regulation. The War Precautions Act , which was designed to deal with conditions arising out of the state of war, is how being used to destroy on our statute-books which was passed in the ordinary way. The Conciliation and Arbitration Act makes provision for the cancellation of the registration of unions. As the Prime Minister has stated, under that Act, if a union disobeys the law, any interested person may make application to the Court for its deregistration. Such an application would involve an appeal to a Court of Justice, the taking of evidence, and something like a reasonable inquiry. ThePrime Minister; however, comes .along with his bludgeon in the shape of this regulation, under the War Precautions Act, and proposes that, a union may be deregistered without any inquiry by a Court of Justice. On the mere ipse dixit of this dictator, a union may be struck off the register. The righ t honourable gentleman has spoken of the sins of the men on strike. He has said that they should no longer' enjoy preference of employment, and that the Government should, stand by the ""loyalists."" I have heard him in a Strike Conference say to men who protested against returning to work with these so-called ""loyalists,"" "" Do not talk such buncombe to me. You know perfectly well'that it would be easier to find the cross of Christ at the bottom of hell than it will be to find a non-unionist in your industry after you have been back a week. Go back to your work, and get r i d of these non-unionists when you go back."" That is what he has told the unionists time after time. "" Drop bricks on their heads, destroy their'tucker bags, tear up their clothes."" These tactics have been employed, and the Prime Minister has been a party to them.",30
48,Sir JOHN FORREST,TELEPHONE CONDUIT SINBUSH,He has never said that.,31
49,Mr JH CATTS,TELEPHONE CONDUIT SINBUSH,"He has been a party to the whole of - that sort of thing. The Treasurer knows nothing about the tactics of the Prime Minister as a strike leader. When unionists have protested against having to return to work with blacklegs, he has been a party to "" deali n g "" with the so-called loyalists. The conditions were much the same as they are today. The New Zealand Government was-organizing strike-breaking bureaux, as the Prime Minister is now doing. They were defending blaeklegs, as the' Prime Minister is now doing. To-day, however, we have seen him on the floor of this' House, trembling with emotion as he championed the cause of the employers. He has gone over to the Employers Federation-to the enemies of labour-and is now the champion of everything which during the greater part of hislifetime he bas most vigorously opposed. The Prime Minister also told us this afternoon that these regulations under the War Precautions Act had been put in operation against the employers. "" Why , "" said he, "" I have done much more against the. producers than the working man."" In this respect he sang quite a different tune from that which he has been singing ever since the war began. He has been saying, again and again, to the employers that but for the action of the Government in creating pools to deal with their produce, they would have lost everything; and that by reason of his actions the producers have secured benefits which they could not have obtained in any other way. To-day his story is quite the opposite; he asserts that these regulations have been put in operation against the employers of labour.",31
50,Mr RODGERS,TELEPHONE CONDUIT SINBUSH,Was not the honourable member himself Chairman of a Food Prices Board for a time ?,31
51,Mr JH CATTS,TELEPHONE CONDUIT SINBUSH,"I was, until the Prime Minister came back from England and destroyed the work of the Board. A f t e r having mercilessly denounced those responsible for the high cost of livin g in his referenda pamphlets, he is now the champion of the exploiters of this country, and refuses to protect the people against the outrageously high prices that prevail. This regulation, which deals with the dispute in the shearing industry, and with the wharf labourers' dispute, attacks one of the vital principles of British libertya principle which, so far as I know, has never before been denied in any part of the British Empire. It attacks the right of peaceful picketing. It has always been the right of a British working man in the case of an industrial dispute to approach a fellow workman, and to in for m him of the existence of the dispute, so that he may not accept employment in ignorance of it . This regulation, however, has been introduced to stop even peaceful picketing, and we have seen a unionist haled before the Court on a charge of informing a blackleg carter of the existence of an industrial dispute. Even this does not complete the work of the dictatorship. The Acts Interpretation Act provides that every regulation shall be presented to Parliament with in thirty days of its gazettal, and that with in fifteen sitting days of its issue either House of Parliament, may disallow it . Under the present dictatorship, however, this Parliament is prevented from taking steps to disallow any regulation. If member, complying with the law, and the forms of the House, gives notice of his intention to move for the disallowance of a regulation, the Government, by its trol of the business-paper, can put that notice at the bottom of the list, and prevent the Parliament exercising its power under the Acts Interpretation Act. In this way the whole of our legislation is reduced to a dead letter. The conduct of the Government in governing the counment try by regulation-behin d the back Parliament-and its refusal to allow Parliament to exercise its undoubted to disallow any regulation, is one most disgraceful features in the parliatrouble mentary history of not only Australia, but the whole of the British Empire.",31
52,Mr WALLACE,TELEPHONE CONDUIT SINBUSH,"West Sydney) [3.41] - I agree with the Leader of Opposition that the issue of these regudiers lations is both improper and unnecessary. Honourable members opposite consider that when a body of unionists they are entitled to do anything within the law to drive the men back to their employment. The deregistration of unions in this way, however, is calculated to the opposite effect. The representatives of the men at present on strike have negotiating for some time for a settleJapanese ment. Five weeks had elapsed from the beginning of the strike when the Governto-day ment announced its determination to issue regulations providing for the registration of unions. That announcecognise ment has had the effect of adding fuel to the fire, which before was dering, and the unions are not now so ready to negotiate for a settlement as they were. The worse possible result is likely to follow the action of the Prime Minister in practically coercing the sident of the. Arbitration Court, and pelling him to deregister tliese unions.' The learned Judge himself saw that would be the result. I admit that the Prime Minister has had much experience in dealing with industrial affairs, but Justice Higgins has perhaps had an even wider experience. He knows the psychology of the working man just as well as does the Prime Minister. Every one ber has ever done. knows that this trouble had been smouldering for some time before it broke out.",32

During this war, so the "" other fellow "" has been getting at the worker all the time. The workers have naturally resented such treatment, and small sectional disputes have occurred. No steps have been taken by the Governto get at the bottom of these indusof trial troubles. Where wages have been the increased 5 per cent., the cost of right living has been increased to the exof the tent of 50 per cent. And so this has broken out. It is a good thing for the community that it has occurred at the present time. . If the unionists had waited until the close of the war, and the return of the 300,000 men now at the the Front, we should have found those soljoining with them in the fight for better industrial conditions, and I think the dispute would have been of more farcease work reaching consequence. The Government should not take a biased view of these industrial troubles, have but should consider them from every stand-point. Industrial trouble exists, not been only in Australia, but in Japan. The workers, amongst the most ' down-trodden in the world, are on strike for better industrial conditions. We all know, also, what has occurred in deRussia, and the Government should rethat the industrial upheaval in Australia is but a reflex of what is occuronly smoulring in other lands. Every power possessed by the Government should be brought to bear to settle these disputes on conciliatory lines, and not on the lines so far followed by both Prethe Commonwealth and State Governcomments in dealing with the present strike.",32

58,Mr WALLACE,TELEPHONE CONDUIT SINBUSH,"I doubt it. In speaking thus against the deregistration of unions by regulation, I am actuated by a desire to serve the interests of not only the unions, but the general community.

If the porters of the Ministry desire government on equitable lines, it is for the way. The de-registration of unions in this way will probably mean that 40,000 men in my union who are still work will come out. In that event, other industrial organizations, such as the tralian Workers Union and other big unions, which have no part in the present for trouble, will be drawn into it . It is the duty of the Government to precipidefence tate trouble and cause revolution, but rather, by every pacific means, to supassurance press the prevailing unrest.",33

My advice to honourable members opposite is that they should exercise what influence they have over the Ministry to have regulations rescinded, and to show that the Government are prepared to meet the workers in a proper way. No good can result from putting into effect regulations of this kind, and it would be in the best [75] interests of the community if the Government were to reconsider their position. In . yesterday's Herald there was an article which dealt with the Seamen's Union, and it affords us an example in point. The employers told the - Court that in the Seamen's Union there is no preference to unionists; and, as bey never have had such preference, the deregistration does not affect them. The Prime Minister knows that in the Seanienls Union, as in other big organizations, the members regulate this matter for themselves. If the Government are to pursue their present course we shall have another 200,000 or 300,000 persons added to the 100,000 or 150,000 already involved in the industrial disputes.

63,Dr MALONEY,TELEPHONE CONDUIT SINBUSH,"Melbourne) [3.54]. the - Australi a today is a country governed at by regulations, which Are turned out like sausages, not in dozens or fifties, but in Aushundreds. Pages 822 to 833 of the index fco the Commonwealth Statutory Rules 1916contain over 200 regulanot tions. Whenever any Bill pertaining to or war precautions has been in troduced, I have always insisted on p.n that the civil law shall not be dominated by the military law. That be assurance I always received from Mr . t Andrew Fisher when he wÂ£.s Prime M in ister; and on the first occasion when I a public quarrel with the present Prime Minister, I asked for a similar guarantee, without which I was not preto allow any clause of the Bill On that the occasion the Prime Minister, who was Attorney-General, became angered at that the delay caused, as he thought, by the debate, and asked me w h j I comcould not take his word as the At torney-General and the Minister in charge of the measure. I answered him that I oould not take his word because he had come and lied, tricked, and' deceived us at the Trades H all Council. Thereupon the right honourable gentlethese man rushed out of the chamber, and brought, in Mr Fisher, who immediately gave me the assurance I desired. But I unhesitatingly state here, as I have from every platform, that all the promises and assurances given by Mr Fisher in this regard have since his departure been wilfully broken, because there is not Â£ single regulation under the War Act that does not override the civil law today. When I asked the present Prime Minister under what law three two of whom were women, arrested and punished, he said that it was under both the State law and the Commonwealth law. The Commonwealth law, of course, consisted of one of these War Precautions Regulations; - case only proves what I have namely j that Australia today is governed by regulation, and by a man who is. dictator by the kindness of the great Liberal party which supports him. opinion, no regulation should become law until it has been read out in this Chamber, and honourable members afforded the right to debate it. If honourable members do not wish to debate any regulation, and the consensus of opinion in the House is in its favour, the people outside will know that it is a fair and just one. Rut what do we find at the present time? 1916 alone there were some 200 regulations issued, and some of them of such importance that if they were introduced as ordinary legislation they would entail days of discussion. When it was suggested that the Act and the regulations had been used towards one class only, the Pi - ime Minister asked whether any one could deny that he had used the law against the employers in the way of fixing prices. Was there ever a greater force than this fixing of prices? the' people outside know what the fixed prices are? When I suggested that a simple printed announcement of the fixed prions of bread, sugar, meat, flour, and so forth should be placed in every post-office, along with the name and address of a Commonwealth officer to whom could be made in case of any overcharging, all the reply the Prime could give' me was a reference to the Commonwealth Gazette. I know no person, either inside this House or outside, who knows the fixed prices of food; but I do know that the law is broken, and if this is by a wealthy man nothing is clone to him. Can anything be more infamous than the supplying of diseased meat, such as occurred in Melbourne? But my reference to that matter only excited the jeers and laughter of honourable members opposite. Dr Moloney. toirs belong to the Melbourne 'City Council, and I accuse the Department of Precautions trying to shield Mr Angliss.",33
64,Mr SPEAKER,TELEPHONE CONDUIT SINBUSH," I am afraid that the honorpersons, able member is travelling away from the had been question of the regulations.",34
65,Dr MALONEY,TELEPHONE CONDUIT SINBUSH,"I am now referring to one of those employers whose prices have not yet been fixed; and there has been much arrant hypocrisy displayed in and that this connection. What was the Prime said, Minister's reply when I brought the question of high rents under his notice? He said he could quite understand that, if a man had a house worth Â£500, and spent In my another Â£500 in doing that house up, he should have an increased rental. That is quite right; but who ever heard of any landlord such a fool as to spend an amount of money equal to the value of the house in improvements, especially in the case of a house let to working people ? Nothing has yet been done in the way of protecting the people from the high rents In that are being charged. But the greatest infamy of which I accuse the Prime M in ister is the introduction by regulation of the moratorium, in order to screen him self from Mr Smith, and to keep that gentleman from going into Court to get justice. That case was postponed by Mr Justice Hodges from the 18th October to the' 20th; then, at the instance of the Prime Minister's counsel, it was f u r ther postponed u n t i l 1st February. But in January the moratorium regulation How do was issued, and Mr Smith was called upon to prove that the Prime Minister of Australia had enough ready cash to meet the debt. The result was that justice was denied to this gentleman.  do with the regulation under discussion ? appeal Mr SPEAKER - The motion does not refer to any specific regulation. Minister Dr MALONEY - I am informed that the legal men who were representing the Prime Minister are not content with the instructions given, and that the case has been settled, the Prime Minister to pay continually Â£500 of the Â£1,000 owing, and to agree in the future to take no advantage of the present moratorium, or any other moratorium under the War Precautions Act. This country is really ruled by a dictator, and I feel certain that the men who are now supporting him in his efforts to The abat- crush the workers will regret their action. This Parliament will become known as a Parliament that was ruled by a dictator supported by the remnants of the Conservative party #nd a portion of the Labour party, who have forgotten their pledges as Labour men.  gratulate the Government on the issue of tbese important regulations at this very critical time in our history. The welfare of the public has been seriously endangered by the organized unions. I believe that the great majority of the members of these unions are truly loyal to the best in terests of the community, but they seem to have practically got under the control of a dangerous section. The result is that we have witnessed the spectacle of union after union downing tools and refusing to work, thus causing euorinous losses and general public inconvenience. Nor do they stop short at jeopardizing the welfare of the people of Australia, for they actually menace the brave men who have gone abroad to fight our battles. The transport of war material and those things which are necessary for the sustenance and welfare of our troops is being ruthlessly in terfered with. .The Government came into power as a Win-the-war Government. We hear frequently from honourable members opposite the question, "" What are you doing to w in the war?"" thing, Ministers have set themselves up against the lawless element in this community; they have taken a step which renders it less likely that unionists will enter the present industrial conflict lightly, because the members of trade unions will know that in the issue of these regulations there is a certain element of danger to unionism^ and this fact will make them careful. If anything will help to win the war it is the creation of such a position as to make it dangerous for those who seek to act against the welfare of Australia, as a whole, to play that game. I am perfectly satisfied thut - the Government and the party behind them have the endorsement of the great mass of the people of Austi'alia in regard to the issue of these regulations. When we are at death grips with the enemy of the Empire at the other side of the world, it is simply suicidal to allow conditions to exist that will permit one section of the community to set the whole system of organized go[ 7 5 ] -2 vernment at defiance, and claim that they, and not the elected representatives of the people, are to govern the country. Last week the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine) told us plainly that organized unionists were determined to win the present fight without reference fco this Parliament. No more damaging statement could have been made. For centuries we have been building up a system of constitutional govern 1 ment, and we pride ourselves upon the fact that every person who has to obey our laws has had a voice in the making of them, but our friends opposite want to bring about a condition of affairs by which a comparatively small section of the community will determine the conditions of labour and compel the ostensible Government of the country to bow to their will. I applaud the Prime Minister upon his utterance this afternoon, when he pointed out that the labour unions were setting themselves against the constituted authority of this land. I believe they are being driven into that position! not by the bond fide members of the organizations, bub by the incantations of a dangerous foreign section fco which the others have lent an ear. The issue of these regulations will bring the members of the unions back to their senses. When they realise that they are setting For one themselves against the welfare of the community, and against the welfare of our soldiers on the other side of the world, and that power rests with the Government, and not with their organizations, they will yield to pressure. We on this side of the House are determined to sfcand for law and order against the dangerous element whom honourable members opposite represent, and the great mass of the people are behind us. When Ministers once put their hand to the plough and demonstrate that they are thÂ«Â» Government"" of the country, and that those who seek to flout their authority will suffer, they will have the plaudits of the community. When the history of this crisis is written it will be shown that the issue of these regulations was one of the first steps taken towards the re-establishment of constitutional government in Australia. What would have happened if the regulations had not been issued ? Hundreds of willing workers have come to the rescue of the Government, prepared to do more in a day than the strikers who are accustomed to the work were doing. The desire of the unionists is that they should be permitted to go out. on strike whenever they chose, and go back afc their own sweet will, and as soon as they go back they are to demand the ejection of every loyalist who has come to the assistance of the Government.",34

I compliment) the Leader of the Opposition upon his mild presentation of his case this afternoon. There was nothing objectionable in his speech. Its only defect was that there was no point in it . The honourable member did not give a single case of in j u r y that the issue of regulations would inflict on any union. In the absence of such evidence, what is there fco complain of? The Prime Minister's reply was very effective when he pointed out that even unionists are glad of the formulation of the regulations, because it prevents them from falling into the error of joining in a strike which may be disadvantageous to the country as well as to themselves. In regard to the general question of regulations, I am entirely in accord with the Leader of the Opposition, but the honourable member is partieeps criminis. He was a member of a Government which issued more regulations than any other Government we have had in the Commonwealth, yet now that he has come into the position of Leader of the Opposition, which he adorns so well, he objects to the issue of regulations. I am quite in accord with him when he says that too much is done by the issue of regulations. This policy is gradually taking away the power of the House, but in this particular stance there has been every justification for the issue of regulations. If they had not been issued the crisis would have grown and developed, and no one how far the unions would have gone. The sympathetic chord had been struck, and unionists were saying, "" We must go into the strike whether we have any interest in it or not , "" and the issue of the regulations was the first thing that brought them to the realization of the fact that they could not pursue that policy without endangering the position of their organizations. It brought them to their senses. The Government are to be commended for having done something substantial in the direction of winning the war, an because so long as practically open warfare between two sections of the community is permitted to continue here, unrestricted by any Government action, Australia must be powerless to play its part effectively in the war which is being waged in Europe.",36

In his usual violent fashion, the Prime these Minister gave us a dissertation this afternoon on trade unionism and his connection therewith. One refreshing feature of his remarks was that he made no mention of the Junta, or the Teuton hand, or German gold. The position that he occupies today, with some of his colleagues, is that of bringing about a system of non-unionism in Australia. From time to time honourable members opposite have talked of walking delegates, and have spoken of the tendency of every worker to strike st every possible opportunity, and it would appear that those of them who in the past have been defenders of - unionism, and who have pub themselves before the people as prophets sent to lead the workers, are now pliant tools and creatures in the hands of capitalism and the commercial interests.

There, at the beginning of the Pinkerton system, strikes were broken by the refuse of America, a motley collection of the scum of all nationalities. To-day, in Australia, all the garbage of the country is engaged in the same operation. There are the employing classes and the tools of the employersthe unfortunates who are in the hands of the pastoralists and banking institutions, at whose behest they have gone to Sydney to protect the rights and privileges of the class they serve.",37
75,Mr RODGERS,TELEPHONE CONDUIT SINBUSH,It cannot be said that the honourable member has no imagination.,37
76,Mr BLAKELEY,TELEPHONE CONDUIT SINBUSH,"I am speaking of what I see all about me. I know perfectly well that nothing will give <he honourable member greater pleasure than that regulation 213 should achieve its object. Had the Australian Workers Onion been de-registered, the award - nullified, and sufficient scabs procured, the pastoralists would have sa?ed Â£4,000,000 per annum. How many men could be bought with that amount on the slight chance of the pastoralists being successful in their desire to smash the unions? The trade unionists of Australia do not require the protection of r.ue Prime Minister and the National party. We are not afraid of what the National Government may do to the working classes. They may take preference from the unions, de-register them, and prohibit them ,as unlawful associations, and they may put their members in gaol, but those actions will not achieve the Government's purpose. We shall establish preference to unionists despite all that the Government may do by regulation.' The Prime Minister may violently wave his hands, and issue regulations in sheaves, but we take no notice of him ; in our strength and might we can defy him and his supporters.",37
77,Mr RODGERS,TELEPHONE CONDUIT SINBUSH,Where do the majority of the non-unionists get their living ?,37
78,Mr BLAKELEY,TELEPHONE CONDUIT SINBUSH,"W h e r e do the honourable member and his class get their living ? The means of livelihood is produced by the unionists and stolen by the class to which the honourable member belongs. As the Prime Minister has pointed out, the Australian Workers Union has been one of the unions in Australia which has never broken any agreement into which it entered. It h,as been honourably bound by every award delivered by a Court; but upon the flimsy pretext that somewhere in the back country of Queensland the Industrial Workers cf the World propose tq hold up the shearing industry, the Prime Minister has issued an ultimatum, full of threats and intimidation, which was sufficient to make any unionist go on strike. Instead of improving the situation, the Prime Minister's action was likely to create a trouble even bigger than that which exists today. But despite the regulation issued by the right honourable gentleman, the Australian Workers Union continues working. Of course, the Â£4,000,000 that would be saved to the squatters by the de-registration of the union and the annulment of the award, is a prize worth fighting for.",37
79,Mr HEITMANN,TELEPHONE CONDUIT SINBUSH,"Kalgoorlie) [4.28]. - A f t e r listening to the honourable member who has just resumed his seat, it seems to me that the unions in whose behalf the Leader of the Opposition has spoken can have very little concern in his protest, because they are likely to lose very little - which they value. As a unionist and a believer in unionism, I must confess that it is impossible for this country to continue the pretext th,at we believe in arbitration.",37
80,Mr BLAKELEY,TELEPHONE CONDUIT SINBUSH,Does the honourable member believe in organized scabbery ?,37
81,Mr HEITMANN,TELEPHONE CONDUIT SINBUSH,"I do not. Nor do 1 believe in the scabbing on soldiers at the Front, which is being upheld in Australia today by many Labour leaders.",37
82,Mr RILEY,TELEPHONE CONDUIT SINBUSH,Why does not the honourable member get into khaki ?,37
83,Mr HEITMANN,TELEPHONE CONDUIT SINBUSH,"I have tried hard enough to do so. I Â£m amused to hear the everlasting sneers from honourable members opposite at the Win-the-war party. Had the party now led by the honourable member for Yarra attained to power at the last elections, we should have today, not responsible government, but revolution. What the Nationalist party has not done to win the war is to pass in its organizations, week in and week out, resolutions against sending soldiers to assist those already at the Front.

Is it intended to continue its publication, and, if so, has any estimate been made as to the cost of bringing it up to any specified year ? 3. Is there a subscribers' list; if so, for what number of copies, and at what cost per volume ? 4. How many free copies are being distributed ? 5. Will ex-members of Parliament continue upon the free list? 6. Will new members of Parliament receive back numbers?",37
84,Mr SPEAKER,HISTORICAL RECORDS OF,"As this refers to a matter under the control of the Library Committee, and not the Treasurer, I , Chairman of that Committee, 'have had a low :statement prepared on the subject, which will furnish the information desired by the honourable member for Echuca. The re-exportation statement is as follows:1. The total cost, from 1912 to 30th June last, is Â£8,664 6s. There has already been paid since then Â£210, and a further sum of approximately Â£1,000 is outstanding for the completion of volumes 10 and 11, making a total of about Â£9,800. Against this, valuable stocks are held, for which the Library Committee anticipate on increased future demand. 2. Publication will be suspended when volume .11, now in the printers' hands, is issued. The reason that actuated the Library Committee in taking this course was mainly the inareased cost of paper, which enhanced the cost of publication by 3s. 7d. per volume. A further reason was that the responsible editor has volunteered for active service. There will probably be about thirty more volumes before completion, whose publication will be spread over about seven or eight years, costing, at pre-war prices, about Â£2,200 per annum. 3. There is no subscribers' list, as the Library Committee does not sell directly to ""-the public, but supplies the book trade. About forty-five bound copies are so supplied at a charge of 15s. i)d. per volume, ar(d eleven unbound at 12s. per volume. * 4. Free copies are issued to all members of either House who desire them, to all Public Libraries of the capital cities of the Commonwealth, and to the Parliamentary and University Libraries of the States, to the British Museum, the Library of the House of Lords and House of Commons, the Library of Congress, and on an exchange basis to several Universities ancl Libraries in the United Kingdom and America. 5 and 6. Ex-members and new members may, by a special resolution of the Library Comstanding mittee, complete their sets at cost price, i.e., 12s. 6d. per volume. They have been so informed. NA INDIES .

If not, will inquiries be instituted to ascertain if any considerable portion of our produce is being re-shipped from there to Holland ? 3. Is it possible to ascertain (n) if Holland's need for condemned milk from overseas is because her own production of this commodity is being exported to Germany, and (b) if Australia, through the medium of the Dutch East Indies, is supplying the shortage thus created in Holland ?",38
85,Mr JENSEN,EXPORTS TO DUTCH EAST,"The answers to the as 'honourable member's questions are as fol1. The exportation of wheat and flour to the Dutch East Indies is not allowed, except, under special arrangements, which prevent its from there. With regard to all foodstuffs, exportation to Java is allowed only to approved consignees. The exportation of foodstuffs generally to the Dutch East Indies has been normal since the war as compared with before the war. In lines where an increase is shown, that increase is accounted for by the cutting off of direct steamer service between Java and Holland. 2. For reasons stated in 1 it is practically impossible that such re-shipment can take place. 3. (a) I have no evidence that Holland is in. need of condensed milk from overseas; (b) see 1 and 2.

108,Mr GROOM,IMPERIAL WAR SERVICE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:- 1. Nothing is known of the issue of an Imperial War Service medal, but it is presumed that the honourable member means the Silver War badge issued by His Majesty the King to soldiers who have been discharged, as medically unfit for further service by reason of wounds or sickness as a result of their military service. War medals are not issued until the war is finished, but to those who have been incapacitated a Silver War badge has been authorized for issue as above mentioned. This Silver War badge is not issuable to Home Servico soldiers who enlisted for service in Australia only, but it is granted to those soldiers who enlisted for service in the Australian Imperial Force and the Forces raised for service in New Guinea who may not have left Australia, but who have become incapacitated as a result of their training in Australia for service abroad, provided that such soldiers have been in the Service for over six months. 2.

Not unless the Reservists concerned. have joined either the Australian Imperial Force or the New Guinea Force, and have become unfit for further service by reason of wounds or sickness. 4. The Silver War badge is issued to soldiers discharged as medically unfit, as above mentioned, and to be worn with civilian clothes. The regulations regarding its issue are prescribed by the War Office, and it is not proposed to ask for any alterations to be made. The value of thiB war badge would decrease if all soldiers who have been in camp, and arc shortly afterwards found to be medically unfit, are given the badge.

On the 13th ultimo, a further communication was received, intimating that, in view of the proposal that the Eepatriation Authority should in certain cases pay an additional sum of 10s. per week, the New South Wales Government had dropped its proposal and removed the amount referred to from the Estimates.

118,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"ParramattaMinister for the Navy) [4.38] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. I do not think there will be much opposition to this measure. The Public Works Committee Act requires the appointment of the Committee in the first session of every Parliament, and as the Committee was not so appointed, the Bill is necessary to enable it to be appointed now so that it can get to business.",43
119,Mr TUDOR,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"Yarra) [4.40] - When the original measure was before us, I was of the opinion that the Committee would not serve any good purpose, but I iliiuk now that both the Public Works Com-* mittee and the Committee of Public Accounts have done good work, and that the best thing the House can do is to pass this Bill to allow the Public Works Committee to be appointed.",43
120,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"EdenPAPERS . Monaro) [4.42] - The Minister (Mr . Joseph Cook) should have told us why the Committee should be appointed.

126,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"The M in ister assures me that this is the wrong time to take action, but I trust that he will furnish the information for which I have asked. The only effect of appointing the Committee has been that certain members have fancied themselves experts because, by the examination of exoert witnesses,. they have gained a little knowledge on certain subject's. Were I spending money on the building of a house, I would rather call in an architect than accept the views of laymen who had gained information in this way.",43

130,Mr FENTO N,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"Maribyrnong) [4.45]. - Sectio n 15 of the Act, which, like this Bill, was initiated by the honourable member for Parramatta, exempts naval and military defence works from the investigation of the Public Works Committee. As most of the works for which we are now making provision, either in the Estimates or in the Loan Bill, are for .Defence purposes, I hope that the Minister will promise that they, shall be .referred to the Committee. His short experience in the Navy Department must have convinced him of the need for such investigation. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro would be the first to object to departmental proposals, especially from the Army and Navy Departments, if they came before Parliament without having been inquired into. Some defence works were submitted to the last Works Committee, and were under consideration immediately prior to the dissolution of Parliament. I presume that the investigation then proceeding will be continued by the new Committee. I hope, too, that the Act will be amended, so that all works whose cost is, estimated to exceed Â£25,000, except, of course, such,as are of a secret character, must be referred to the Committee. During the investigation of a proposal for the choosing of a site for the arsenal the last Committee had put.before it a good deal of secret information, and that, of course, was never divulged. But even if the Minister does not propose any amendment of the Act such as I suggest, I hope he will see that all works, whose cost would exceed Â£25,000 shall be sub mitted for investigation.",44
131,Mr RILEY,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"South Sydney) [4.48] The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman) is in a humorous mood today. The Act provides for the appointment of the Public Works Committee in the first session of every Parliament, and as that was not done in the first session of this Parliament, the Bill is needed to enable .the Committee to be appointed this session. I agree with the honourable member that this is a time for retrenchment, but I would point out to him that the last Works Committee saved the country hundreds of thousands of pounds by recommending that certain proposals referred to it should not be gone on with. The Minister for the Navy saved the country much useless expenditure by introducing the measure which provided for the appointment of the Committee. When public officers know that the Works Committee or the Accounts Committee, will investigate their proposals, they compile their Estimates more carefully than they would compile them for the information of the Minister.",44
132,Mr LECKIE,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,Did the last Committee investigate the proposal to rebuild the Geraldton Post-office?,44
133,Mr RILEY,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"No ; that matter was not referred to it. According to the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) the construction of the proposed arsenal will, mean an expenditure of Â£2,250,000. Surely such an expenditure should not be undertaken without an inquiry.",44
134,Mr TUDOR,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,Hav e there not been several inquiries into the proposal?,44
135,Mr RILEY,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"The inquiries that have taken place have had to do merely with the location of the site. No expense has yet been incurred in the construction of the Arsenal buildings. We have on the Estimates an item of Â£45,000 for the erection of a post-office at Perth. I do not know whether that work is now going on, but I think it should have been referred to the Public Works Committee.",44
136,Mr WEBSTER,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"The matter was dealt with , before the Committee was appointed.",44
137,Mr RILEY,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"No big work should be undertaken until it has been inquired into by the Public Works Committee. That is the practice followed in New South Wales and other States, and I think that our money is well spent on such investigations.",44
138,Mr GREGORY,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"Dampier) [4.51] There are one or two features of the principal Act that call for amendment; and I should like to know whether we shall be afforded an opportunity, in considering this Bill , to submit such amendments. They are of a non-controversial character.",45
139,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"I think not. Bill is merely intended to make the Ac effective, so far as the appointment of Committee this session is concerned.",45
140,Mr GREGORY,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"Quite so. The Act provides that no public work exceeding the minimum expenditure for which it provides shall be commenced until the sponsible Minister presents to the Parliaof ment the necessary plans and papers, and receives the instruction of the House, whereupon it may be submitted to the Public Works Committee for inquiry. On several occasions while the Parliament was in recess, certain questions were submitted, quite illegally, I think, to the Committee for investigation. It would be wise for the Government to take power to submit to the Committee, while ParliaPublic ment is in recess, works which they tend to push on, if approved.",45
141,Mr SPEAKER,WOOD PULPAND ROCK," I am afraid thab the honourable member is now going outside the scope of Act is involved. the Bill . The principal Act provides for the appointment of the Committee in the first session of the Parliament, and Bill is merely to rectify the omission to appoint a Committee in the first session of the seventh Parliament. - Mr GREGORY - I wrote to the provide Prime Minister some time ago, suggestcipal Act , except to ing certain amendments of the principal Act which I thought would be advanmittee tageous. I then expressed that the number of members might well be reduced to seven, at the most; and I also referred to the advisableness of the Government taking power to remit tions to the Committee while Parliament is in recess - Since I cannot deal with such matters on this Bill , I shall not f ther occupy the attention of the House.",45
142,Mr WEST,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"East Sydney) [4.55] should not have risen but for the remarks made by the honourable member for Edenconfine Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman) as to necessity for the appointment of this Committee. We have in this House men who are familiar with building construcAct, tion, and who should be able to perform desirable. valuable service on this Committee, inasmuch as their practical knowledge would enable them to elicit from departmental officers what is actually proposed in the plans and specifications prepared by them for various works. The honourable member knows very well that many public works have been carried out in New South Wales which would have been far more This satisfactory had they been inquired into, t first of all, by a Public Works Committee. a' I feel sure that the country will lose nothing by inquiries of this character. I lo.ok forward to the day when the whole of the expenditure of the' Commonwealth will be more closely scrutinized than it is reat present. It is well that .the members this Parliament should have the fullest information as to the requirements of the people, and as to the character of the public works proposed to be carried out. I hope that this will become a National. Parliament in the true sense of the word. Mr iSPEAKER - Order ! This dis- ' cussion is quite irregular. The Bill is simply to provide for the appointment of a Parliamentary Standing Committee on Works during the second session of in the seventh Parliament. The Committee was not appointed in the first session, and Bill is merely to correct that error. No other amendment of the principal  surely honourable members are entitled to this give reasons why the principal Act should be amended. Mr .SPEAKER - This Bill does not for the amendment of the prin legalize the appointment of the Public Works Comi n the second, instead of the first, the opinion session of this Parliament.",45
143,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"Are we not entitled, sir, to show that the Committee is not necessary, and that, therefore, this quesamending Bill is unnecessary?",45
144,Mr SPEAKER,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"The principal Act provides for the appointment of the Comu r - mittee in the first session of the Parliament. That was not done, and this Bill , T is simply to rectify the omission. Honourable members will be in order if they themselves strictly to the giving the of reasons why the Committee should not now be appointed, but the debate is developing into a discussion of the principal and as to whether or not that Act is",45
145,Mr WEST,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"I owe you an apology, sir. When I rose I was looking at something to the effect that the Government had robbed the people of Â£70,000",46
146,Mr SPEAKER,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,Order !,46
147,Mr WEST,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"I think the Government have taken a step in the right direction in introducing this Bill . It would be well for the Commonwealth if more of our public expenditure were subject to revision by a Parliamentary Committee. Mr ,STORY (Boothby) [ 5 . 2 ] - I propose to refer very briefly to the point raised by the honourable member for Eden Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman) as to the necessity for the appointment of this Committee. The honourable member desired to know what the Committee had cost, and what good result had followed upon its work. In order to allay his anxiety, and to afford information to the House, I shall quote a few figures. The Committee cannot be appointed until the principal Ajct is amended. If there is no necessity to appoint it , it is unnecessary to amend the Act. I shall occupy only one minute in satisfying the inquiry made iby the honourable member for Eden-Mouaro - The honourable member suggests that the Government would be studying economy if this Bill were not passed.",46
148,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"Thes e would be perfectly in order on a proposal to appoint a Committee under this Bill , but not on the proposal before us.",46
149,Mr STORY,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"I shall not occupy more than two minutes, during which, I am sure, I shall satisfy the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, and possibly prevent honourable members from being led to vote against this measure. three years the cost of the Public Works Committee was Â£6,991.17s . 4d., and during that time they, by their recommendations, saved the country Â£ 6 8 4 , 7 2 8; that is, the schemes submitted and recommended by the Committee were carried out at a sum less by that amount than the estimates originally submitted. That, I think, is sufficient justification for the appointment of a Public Works Committee at the earliest opportunity, with a view to future savings.  orable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr . Chapman) is to be congratulated on raising this question, seeing that the Government he is supporting is pledged to economy. In season and out of season the Government and their supporters deabout clare that there are no public works to be proceeded with, and if that be so, why is a Public Works Committee necessary ? If the honourable member for Eden Monaro divides the House on the question, I shall surjoort him. I cannot think that the Government are not in earnest when they tell the people of Australia, in this House and through the press, that economy is their policy. Almost every morning we find the A r g u s. preaching economy; and that newspaper is at the back of the Government, while the Government, later on, is at the back of the newspaper. As I say, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro is to be congratulated on bringing this matter forward, particularly so as he is sitting behind the Government.",46
150,Mr RODGERS,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,".Wannon) [ 5 . 8 ] - It comes very easily from the honourable  has not to look to a public work for his sustenance, to suggest that it is time to stop all public works. The honourable member for Maranoa cannot have been listening to the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Story), who has pointed out the great economy that is effected by a body of experts appointed to check pubremarks lic expenditure. For years the honourable member for Maranoa has suggested that people should not take their destinies in their own Hands, but should rely on a Government prepared to carry on public works, and"" thus provide employment. The honourable member for Boothby has shown clearly that there is every reason to appoint a Public Works Committee. During  view of the fact that there can be no public work of any magnitude undertaken for some time, it would be well to postpone the appointment of this Committee, because as soon as a Committee of this k in d is appointed it begins to incur expense. Under the Public Works Committee Act, it is necessary that all work to cost over a certain figure shall . be referred to the Committee from this Parliament for investigation, but in its actual working we have found that the Committee does not wait for any reference, and that is the cause of a great deal of trouble. Under the circumstances it would be just as well to defer the appointment of the Committee.",46
151,Mr CHARLTON,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"Hunter) [5.11] - 1 congratulate the Government ou the introduction of thi,s Bill , because any Ministry pledged to a policy of economy must take some step of the kind in order lo obviate extravagance. 1 States it has been proved that before the appointment of such bodies there was much unnecessary expenditure. A Public Works Committee is able to sift any proposal referred to them, and to present the full facts to Parliament, the members of which then know exactly what the estimated cost is, and can form a judgment as to whether or not the work should be undertaken. The appointment of the Committee is opposed on the ground that it will mean additional - expense; but if the Act is strictly followed, no works can be considered by the Committee unless referred to it by Parliament at the in stance of the Minister .concerned. W it h that safeguard, there can be no danger of unnecessary expenditure. honourable member for Echuca (Mr . .Palmer) and others will have the opportunity to voice their opinion on the floor of the House, as to the reference of any particular proposal, whereas, without a Public Works Committee, the Government could proceed with any works they choose. A Committee of this kind is absolutely necessary to save the country from unnecessary expenditure.",47
152,Mr ARCHIBALD,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"Hindmarsh) [5.13] - I cannot quite appreciate the attitude that is taken up by some honourable members in regard to the Bill before us. We have had proposals for large loan expenditure, and there have been animated debates in regard to the construction of an arsenal, naval bases, and other works of the kind. Unless we are going to sit down and wait until the war is over, and we know exactly the future political situation in Europe, we must proceed with works such as I have mentioned,_ not extravagantly, bufc in such a way as to show that we have a continuous policy. We often hear of the necessity for some check on expenditure by Government officials; and a Public Works Committee is about one of the best checks that we could bave. I hope, however, that, in regard to some of the works, we shall not be told that they are of a secret nature, and may be carried out at the instance of the Governor General in Council; and I do not anticipate anything of the kind. Certainly the British Government did not take up that attitude in regard to the great naval works on the eastern coast of England. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman) In the various seems to be pleading for economy in the abstract, but I do not think that any Australian is prepared to mark time until the conclusion of the war. That being so, some Committee of the kind is necessary to iuquire into the expenditure on works such as I have indicated.",47
153,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,Such works are exempt under the Act.,47
154,Mr ARCHIBALD,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,That is not so.,47
155,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"The Government are exempting them. . Mr ARCHIBALD - I do not think so; but, of course, there may be reasons for exempting some works from inquiry, while there are other works which necessitate in The quiry. We may be asked, Whafc is the use of a Committee of Public Works consisting of members of Parliament who may have no university education, and not be lawyers trained in the sifting of evidence, or engineering experts ? However, it is sheer rubbish to say that such a Committee is not a proper tribunal for in quiries of the kind contemplated. My public experience for nearly twenty-five years, both State aud Eederal, leads me to the opinion thab the most useful men in the country are those gifted with practical common sense, which they apply for the benefit of the community. So long as we have members sufficiently intelligent to sift evidence, and form opinions as to the various experts examined before them, we have as competent a tribunal as we can hope for. One gentleman, now deceased, who was a large employer of labour, and recognised as one of the shrewdest men in business, told me that he often had to consult one, or, it might be, two or three experts, and his plan was, after hearing them, to form his own judgment. That is doubtless what every practical man does; and we should be making a great mistake if we sought, to economize by refusing to appoint a' Public Works Committee. When I was Minister for Home Affairs, I regarded that Committee as one of the most useful pieces of machinery in connection with the Parliament and the Government.",47
156,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"Hear , The Committee had work to do then.",48
157,Mr ARCHIBALD,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"W it h such a Committee in existence, a Minister, after he has consulted his colleagues, has the opportunity to refer a work for inquiry to a body of men in whom he can have confidence. In the absence of a Public Works Committee, Ministers would need to create some sort of tribunal for the purpose of securing information to guide them in the expenditure of money on public works. I support the Government in this matter. The House will commit a grave error of judgment if it declines to re-appoint a Committee which, in the past, has done excellent, if not perfect, work. Considering the handicap under which it carried on its work, and the number of projects into which it has inquired, the Committee has justified its existence, and has undoubtedly saved the Commonwealth a great deal of money.",48
158,Mr FINLAYSON,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"Brisbane) [5.22] - . In view of the arguments that have been put up in the House this session for economy in public, expenditure, and the chorus of approval that met my remarks last evening, when I said that if there was any expenditure of public money that demanded inquiry more than another it was that proposed for defence works, I cannot understand the objection to the re-appointmenfc of a Public Works Committee, which can inquire into such matters. The first general report of the Public Works Committee points out that fro m the date of its appointment to the 31st December. 1915, matters were referred to it for inquiry and report of an estimated cost of Â£2,429,824, and inquiries were completed, and reports presented to Parliament upon works of au estimated cost of Â£689,052. The second general report shows that, during the second year of the work, of the Committee, it completed in quiries as to works of an estimated cost of Â£1,423,874. This expenditure of money could not go on without the possibility of very serious leakages. Members of the Committee quite frankly admit that they are not experts, but as ordinary plain men without expert knowledge they claim that they were able to save a considerable sum of money. For instance, the departmental officers had recommended the building of a storage and regulating reservoir on the Upper Queanbeyan. River at a cost of Â£100,000'. The Committee turned that proposal'down absolutely, and hear! saved that expenditure, which, had the Department's proposals been adopted, would have been in progress now. It was proposed to carry out a sewerage scheme for the Flinders Naval Base at a cost of Â£9,500. The Committee, after inquiry, recommended an expenditure of Â£7,500, representing a saving of Â£2,000. The Committee also saved Â£10,000 on th6 proposed additions and alterations to the Customs House, Sydney, on the departmental estimate of the cost.",48
159,Mr LAMOND,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,And spoilt the job.,48
160,Mr FINLAYSON,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"No ; this is not the time t'o go into the merits of thab work. But, on a more suitable occasion, I should be pleased to enter into a discussion with the honourable member, or any other honourable member, as to the virtue of the recommendation of the Committee in regard to that building. In discovering a new source of water supply for the Flinders Naval Base the Committee saved Â£61,000. The proposal in regard to the city railway at Canberra was for an expenditure of Â£378,972. The Committee, by its alterations and recommendations, reduced this amount to Â£280,000, a saving of Â£98,972. An expenditure of Â£912,421 on ornamental waters at Canberra was recommended. The Committee suggested alterations to save Â£440,000 on that work alone.",48
161,Mr KELLY,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"And not a penny of it was spent, or was ever intended to be spent at the present time.",48
162,Mr LAMOND,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,What is the cost of the Committee to the country f,48
163,Mr FINLAYSON,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"I think that the cost of the Committee's inquiries was Â£6,000. Another element to be considered is the knowledge and experience that'members of this Parliament gain by being members of Committees. They get an insight into departmental workings. Their control over the expenditure of money on public works Is of immense advantage to the country.",48
164,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,F it t in g them for Cabinet rank.,48
165,Mr FINLAYSON,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"If the Public Works Committee and the Committee of Public Accounts, and other Committees, are stepping-stones tb higher rank, members of those Committees are better fitted for their positions when they obtain higher rank.",48
166,Mr LAMOND,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"An expenditure of Â£6,000 is a small item if it has educated members of the Public Works Committee.",48
167,Mr FINLAYSON,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"It shows how expenditure on education can secure very substantial results for a very small outlay. I believe that the Commonwealth is exceedingly well served by the -.'epartmental' officers. We have in the Works and Railways Department men of special qualifications and ability, but they jire not infallible. The Works Committee had repeatedly to turn down the proposals of departmental officers, and make such alterations and recommendations as saved the country hundreds of thousands of Ofiicers have no responsibility in regard to expenditure. Their business is to get the works done. The finding of the money is a secondary consideration. must say that I believe they endeavour to save public money to a certain extent.",49
168,Mr SPEAKER,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,I ask the honourable member not to pursue that line of argument.,49
169,Mr FINLAYSON,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"My point is that a Public Works Committee is a safety valve on public expenditure, because departmental officers, especially naval and military men, would simply run away with money if there was no check upon them. The most salutary check, and the greatest assistance to the Minister controlling public works expenditure, is to have a Publio Works Committee to guide and protect him.",49
170,Mr KELLY,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"Wentworth) [5.31.]- I was in some doubt as to whether my ears were hearing aright the words of the honourable member who expressed such happy readiness to co-operate with honourable members on this side of the House, u n t i l I realized that he was speaking, not so much as a member of the Opposition-whicl i has always, upon more unimportant details, refused point blank to co-operate in any way with any honourable members supporting "" Hughesite composition ""-bu t as a member of the Public Works Committee, and as one who had received a considerable technical education in that capacity, and was looking forward to still greater advantages of the same kind. He told us of the education of the Committee, and incidentally of the marvellous effects its members hjave had in stimulating the zeal and knowledge of those technical officers of the Public Service who are receiving salaries of Â£1,000 a year downwards be-cause of their expert knowledge.",49

172,Mr KELLY,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"If so they should not be in their positions. But if they are wasting thousands, what right have we to apprehend that the wrong which they have committed is to be righted because eminent it is supervised by a number of estimable gentlemen in this House who, whatever else their merits or demerits may be, have certainly not the same technical. .knowledge as is possessed by the gentlemen they supervise 1 I am not going to pounds.. traverse the statement of the honourable member to the extent of congratulating the Public Works Committee upon not having effected very much harm in the I past, inasmuch as, generally speaking, it showed the utmost zeal in having referred to it works which might possibly in the ordinary course of affairs be up for public scrutiny some time about 1930; because I recognise that even if the Committee has done nothing else at the cost of Â£6,000where that Â£6,000 has gone I would not be so mean as to inquire-it has educated its members, and these members again offer themselves as the humble instruments of this Parliament to inquire into all sorts of projects which may eventually be' close to consummation !",49

178,Mr KELLY,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"That is the trouble. A the measure of this sort enables the Ministry to put the plums in the basket, but do we want them put there ? At the time when the original Public Works Committee Bill was introduced, a Government was subsisting- I will not say carrying onwith a majority of one, in this House. I believe Several honourable members interjecting,",49
179,Mr SPEAKER,WOOD PULPAND ROCK," There have been five interjections while the honourable member was attempting to begin a sentence with the two words "" I believe."" Honourable members must cease interjecting, and allow the honourable member for ""Wentworth to make a connected speech.",49
180,Mr KELLY,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"Honourable members who were members of the Public Works Committee are naturally somewhat apprehensive. Some are in a position of some security. Many are in a position to beat their breasts and say how zealous they are, and how ready to have further matters referred to them. I do not object to the interjections. My purpose is to assist the honourable member for Eden-Monaro in the interest of public economy. put my objection to this proposition upon broader ground. I am always the first to admit error, and I believe that in the Bill introduced by the Government in 1913 there was this ""cardinal fallacy-the result of slavishly copying State Acts-of imagining that Eederal works are on all fours with the works of the States. As a matter of fact, there is the widest possible difference between themFederal works ,are governed by policy, not by expectation of yield Mr SPEAKER,-Order ! The honourable member is now discussing the policy of having a Public Works Committee. That subject is beyond the scope of the Bill, the purpose of which is to rectify the error made in not appointing the Public Works Committee in the first session of this Parliament.",50
181,Mr KELLY,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"If the original measure were before the House I should be entitled to state reasons for its rejection. We have now before us a proposal to rect if y the Act in a certain particular, and I shall not traverse Mr Speaker's ruling. Is there one amongst the various works enumerated by the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Finlayson) that should not be the responsibility, not of men merely seeking technical education, but of men who, by virtue of their actual technical knowledge, exercise responsibility to the Commonwealth? I do not care whether it be town planning or the designing of a post office, the man who plans or designs should take responsibility under a Minister of the Commonwealth for what he has planned or designed. If we have a Public Works Committee to which planners and designers may refer their works-sometime s against their will-w e are simply providing a sure shield of part-trained intelligence, behind which official incompetence may safely shelter. That is my answer to every instance mentioned by the honourable member for Brisbane. ' What happens if an error is found in connection with one of these undertakings? Instead of the House being an impartial judge, and investigating the matter at issue as submitted, there are in the chamber a ninnber of gentlemen whose reputations: are at stake by reason of their having, endorsed the proposition. Those gentlemen have travelled about the country, But I making it worth the country's while to spend Â£6,000, that fchey may inquire intoworks, and they co'me into the House, not as impartial witnesses, but beating their own breasts in protestation that they have not been wasting the public money. That is the very negation of departmental responsibility.",50
182,Mr RODGERS,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"How much more does that argument apply to a man who, without expert knowledge,"" directs a public Department?",50
183,Mr KELLY,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"The honourable member draws attention to the fact that a Minister may possibly be untrained. I ask the honourable member not to prejudicehis future by interjections of that character ! We all, including the Works Committee, have committed faults, and this House will commit another fault if it permits this Works Commifctee to continue. The honourable member for Eden Monaro has indicated a way by which these costly inquiries can be obviated, and I support him. Honourable members who are seeking seats on the Committee will do their best to dissuade the House from the excellent reasons put forward by thehonoraible member, but I ask the House whether a single member of a Works Committee is fitted either by training or temperament to undertake responsibility in connection with works of a military or naval character. We require the most carefully educated brains that the professions can give for the proper conception and direction of such operations.",50
184,Mr GREGORY,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,Does the honourable member overlook the work already done at Flinders?,50
185,Mr KELLY,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"I do not. But, if wedisagree from the work of - any public official, let us not provide a cloak behind which, he can hide, but dismiss him. I am very glad to know that members on both sides of the House regard this as a non-party proposition. This discussion started with a look of pleasant anticipation on the faces of candidates, and as it - proceeded that look changed, first, to virtuous indignation, then to apprehension, and now to abject misery. However, putting persiflage aside, I do say that the Committee, as proposed to be constituted, is a farce. It cannot (be in any way a safeguard of the public purse. I regard it as being rather a menace, if only in a small way, and, for that reason, I w i ll support the plea for economy put forward by the honourable member for Eden Monaro.",50
186,Dr MALONEY,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"Melbourne) [5.46]. - I have some regard for a Public Works Committee, but I cannot overlook the fact that all naval and military works will not come under the scrutiny of such a body, and that much expense and loss has been incurred in the .past through the lack of that supervision. Anybody who will inspect the Naval Base at Cockburn Sound will acknowledge that the money spent there might just as well have been thrown into the sea. On one stormy night 40 feet of the wall was washed away. In that structure 'material that was supposed to be limestone was used, and the water into which it was thrown immediately assumed a milk y appearance-a n evidence that the material was dissolving.",51

188,Dr MALONEY,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"We could build the Federal Capital with the waste that has taken place, and will take place, in connection with Naval Bases. Many years of exposure to the weather had made this stone fair l y hard on the surface, but, once the material was broken, it was absolutely useless. I dare say that one-third of the work done at Cockburn Sound was absolute waste. The Minister for Works and Railways, who has visited Cockburn Sound, will admit that what has been done there is an infamy.",51

They should not be shielded by-the report of any Committee. We know that there has been great waste in the Federal Territory, though I do not accuse the Works Committee pf having endorsed it . Colonel Miller, who had the title of Excellency, and used to fly the Union Jack over his house when he was at home, was in charge of the Territory. We know that a lady appeared on the scene, and wanted certain alterations, and that hundreds of pounds were spent unnecessarily. I am sure that the Committee did not know what occurred. If it had done so, it might have recommended the dismissal of this"" officer. Mr Blacket was appointed are a Commissioner to investigate the administration of the Territory, and devoted his time, energies, and intellect",51
192,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"The matters which the honourable member is now discussing are beyond the scope of the Bill , which merely amends section 3 of the principal Ac t to enable the Committee to be appointed during the present session. The appointment of the Committee will be brought before the House on another occasion, and the reference of works to the Committee will also form the subject of separate motions, when the honourable member's remarks will be in order. Mr . Speaker has ruled several times today as I am ruling .",51
193,Mr ANSTEY,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"I respectfully draw your attention, sir, to the fact that Mr . Speaker^ allowed the honourable member for Wentworth to range over the whole question of the advisability of appointing the Committee. Section 3 of the principal Act not only requires the appointment of the Committee in the first session of every Parliament, but fixes the number of the members of the Committee.",51
194,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,The honourable member may not discuss now a ruling of Mr Speaker.,52
195,Mr ANSTEY,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,My point is that sequent speakers have a right to the privilege given to the honourable member for Wentworth.,52
196,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,My ruling is that the discussion must be relevant to the Bill .,52
197,Mr MATHEWS,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"If we throw out Bill , we prevent the appointment of Committee, and therefore argument to show that the Committee is inefficient unnecessary must be relevant.",52
198,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"I have enough merely ruled that the remarks of the honand orable member for Melbourne, who was discussing what took place at Canberra, were not relevant to the Bill , and have stated that the appointment of the mittee is not now the question before House. Under the principal Act, the Committee should have been appointed the first session of this Parliament, the Committee not having been so appublic pointed, the Bill has been introduced allow it to be appointed this session. constitution, functions, and character of than when men are unemployed. the Committee are not now in issue. Honourable members, of course, are at liberty to give reasons for and against Bill ; they cannot be permitted the past history of ihe Works Committee.",52
199,Mr TUDOS,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"The honourable member for Eden-Monaro ("" Mr Chapman) desires the House to vote against the second reading, and therefore it is surely permissible mittee. to give reasons why the Bill should passed.",52
200,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,I have members not prevented any member from doing that. Such argument is in order. the reasons advanced must not go beyond the scope of the Bill .,52
201,Dr MALONEY,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"I assure you, sir, that you were in error in stating that Mr . Speaker has repeatedly ruled on lines similar to those' on which you have ruled. I was proceeding to point out that M Blacket, after investigating the matter thoroughly, reported that there had been a great deal of waste at the Federal tal, which neither the Works Committee nor any other Committee had checked. I have alluded to Colonel Miller. Another Colonel in the Department is Colonel Owen, who has not won by examination any of the distinctions which he possesses.",52
202,Mr SPEAKER,WOOD PULPAND ROCK, I ask the honourable member all subnot to go into that matter.,52
203,Dr MALONEY,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"I maintain that when it. is proposed to construct buildings for the public use, every architect in Australia should be allowed to send in designs, and the architect whose designs are chosen suould be appointed to supervise the the carrying out of the work. Our publio the expenditure should not be left to a clique of highly-paid officials who keep better and men from rising. A man I know of in this State has not been considered good because he is an Australian native, was educated in a cheap school. I do not think that the Committee ought to be appointed at the present time, if this War Ministry is going to exercise economy Comand keep down expenditure. Naval and the military works are not to be referred to the Committee. What, then, is the use in of having it? I understand that the Goand vernment is going to close down on other works, though it must know that to when the country has all its workmen emThe ployed ib can more easily obtain revenue As under all the circumstances the appointment of the Committee would be a waste the of money, I shall vote with the honourable to go into member for Eden-Monaro.",52

205,Mr SPEAKER,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,The personnel of the last Committee is not now under discussion.,52
206,Mr ANSTEY,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"I do nob wish to discuss it , but I feel it my duty to point r . out that certain members of the last Committee would' certainly not have helped to construct a breakwater with bottles. CapiThose who are to be appointed to the Committee are no more likely to be addicted to drink than those who preceded them. My objection to the appointment of this Committee at the present-juncture is that the membership is either too small or too large. There are two outstanding facts to which we may well give consideration in dealing with this Bill , The first of these is that only works connected with naval and military requirements are to be undertaken by the present Government at this juncture, and that they can be carried out without reference to the Public Works Committee.",52
207,Mr WATT,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"If the House does not sire them to be inquired into, well and good.",53
208,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,Nava l and military works are exempt.,53
209,Mr ANSTEY,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"There is a breach in the Cabinet. The Committee is to in quire into any proposed expenditure of public money on public works. Those works may be divided info two important branches, the first consisting of ordinary public works, and the second those connected with the Naval and Military Departments. Naval and military works will not be referred to this Committee.",53
210,Mr WATT,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,Some of them will be.,53
211,Mr ANSTEY,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,And many of. them will not. I oppose the appointment of this Committee. I have at all times done so.,53
212,Mr WATT,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,Did not the honourable member try to get on it?,53
213,Mr ANSTEY,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"No . I intend to support the honourable member for Eden Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman) in his opposition to the Bill . Prom the very first I have objected tb the appointment of - such a Committee. This Government was formed for the sole purpose of winning the war, and to practise the most rigid economy. In these circumstances, strongly object ""to the appointment of this or any other Committee. There is only one proposition that could possibly win me over to this""Bill, and that is that the Government should so widen the membership of the Committee that iti wil l embrace every member of Parliament outside the Cabinet. Speaking quite seriously, I regard the appointment of the Committee as being practically a waste of public money. ^.There is no real justification for i the appointment of any other Committee of the kind. It will have nothing to do. The Government do not intend, that it shall do anything.",53
214,Mr WATT,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"We do. If the honourable member does not want the Committee, let him say so.",53
215,Mr ANSTEY,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,That is what I am trying to do.,53

217,Mr ANSTEY,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"I may s a y without any breach of confidence that even at the de- meetings of our party, I have objected to the appointment of a Public Works Committee. The Win-the-war Government have said that this is a time for the observance of economy and t h r if t . Let the in practice what they preach.",53
218,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"Eve n if this proposal be rejected, the principal Act will remain, and the only result ""will be that the Government will not be allowed to go on with any public work the cost of which will exceed Â£25,000.",53
219,Mr ANSTEY,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"I respectfully disagree with the right honourable member, and it a division is called for, shall vote against the second reading of the Bill . The one clear fact is that there are no proposed public works for this Committee to con-/ sider. There is to be no expenditure upon public works outside naval and military undertakings. That has been stated by the Government, and therefore there is. no business for this Committee to deal with.",53
220,Mr FINLAYSON,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,Then the Committee will cost nothing.,53
221,Mr ANSTEY,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"I never knew a Committee that could not find something to inquire into-that was unable to find ample justification for its existence. The only public works expenditure that is to I take place while we are in recess is that upon naval and military works, and that is not to be referred to any Public Works Committee.",53
222,Mr WATT,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,Some of it is.,53
223,Mr ANSTEY,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"I repeat that there is no justification for the appointment of this Committee-, and that a Government which professes to exercise economy and t h r if t in the administration of public Departments should not bring forward such a proposal at the present juncture. I am t , or for prepared to vote against it .",53
224,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"ParramattaMinister for the Navy) [6.15] - I would remind honourable members who have been flagellating this proposal of what will be the effect of the rejection of the Bill . They seem to imagine that if they reject it the Public Works Committee will go by the board. While that is so, the point to be remembered is that something else will also go by the board. The Public Works Committee Act will still remain on our statute-book, and it clearly provides that the Government may not carry out any work estimated to cost more than Â£25,000 unless and until it has been in vestigated and reported upon by the Public Works Committee. In these circum- Finlayson, W. F. stances, therefore, the honourable member, for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman), who started this discussion, is really proposing to make it impossible for the Government to go on with works of any magnitude since there will be no Committee to which they may be referred. He will not destroy the. Committee requirement. That can be done only by repealing the principal Act. The only effect of throwing out this Bill , therefore, would be to paralyze the works arm of the Government. If honourable members think that would be a wise procedure, well and good; but I hope that they will clearly understand what the rejection of this Bill would mean. I shall not argue the matter at stage except to say that in my opinion, looking back over a long period of years, Public Works Committees in the several States have done excellent work. believe I shall be correct in saying they have saved millions of monev in the motion ? States since they were first inaugurated. That is my own opinion, and the opinion of others well able to judge. Whatever defects such committees may have-and they make mistakes, like any other body of men- I believe on the whole their work is good and has resulted, in many cases, checking large and unwise expenditures and in insuring the spending of public moneys in an efficient and' judicious ner. I hope honourable members will perthe mit us to make this little correction, shall which should not have occupied the tion of the House for more than two or three minutes, but which, I very gret, has provoked a long debate.

245,Mr WATT,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,There are some works awaiting immediate inquiry by a Public Works Committee.,56

247,Mr RODGERS,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"Wannon) [7.50] Provision is already made in the original Act to meet the anxiety of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman).. The Public Works Committeeis a no-work-no-pay Committee. This Bill is merely complying with the provisions of the original Act, which requires the appointment of the Public Works Committee in the first session of a new Parliament. No work can be inquired into by the Committee until it has been remitted to it for inquiry by resolution o* Parliament. If Parliament does not pass on any work to it, there will be no expense, in the shape of fees, to its members. Parliament in its - wisdom provided for such a period as this. In a time of war, when there should be economy, the Committee cannot create work for itself. In fact, the honourable member in moving his amendment is merely emphasizing the wisdom of Parliament in making that provision.",56
248,Mr JH CATTS,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"Cook) [7.52] - I am in favour of the proposed public works being proceeded with, and in favour of inquiries. There has been so much suppression on the part of the present Government, so much denial of investigation, denial of free speech, and denial of facts relating to the administration of the affairs of the country, that it would be better to have additional Committees rather than to have a suppression of Committees, especially when they . are charged with the task of investigating any of the activities associated with the administration of the Commonwealth. no I sympathize with those honourable members wbo preached economy from every platform, and told the public there was to be a serious diminution in expenditure on public works. I quite appreciate their attitude in objecting to the creation of such machinery as can only be precedent to the carrying out of a public works policy. Yesterday, the honourable member  public works should be stopped with a view to forcing men to enlist for military service oversea.  other than military or naval works.",56
249,Mr JH CATTS,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"The honourable member knows that naval or military works cannot be investigated by the Public Works 'Committee, except by grace of the Government.",56
250,Mr WATT,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"They can be investigated by that Committee, and they are investigated by it , unless they are specially exempted by the Governor General in Council.",56
251,Mr JH CATTS,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"It cannot be too often stressed that the Governor General in Council means the Government-no thing more nor less. The amendment suggests that Parliament should first decide on some proposed public works before a Committee is appointed to inquire into them. I can see the line that the honourable member is taking. If the appointment of the Committee is delayed, the Government will have the opportunity to review their action in five months or six months, and they may come to the conclusion that a Public Works Committee is not required. I cannot, however, support that line of action. The Government have already, shut down on too many public works. Theyhave initiated a policy which is designed to throw men out of employment. The idea of the honourable member for Echuca is really prevailing with them. I pointed out during the elections that if they were returned to power the unemployed problem would be accentuated.",56
252,The CHAIRMAN,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"The honourable member is travelling outside the scope of the clause. Mr J"". H . CATTS - The clause proposes to amend section 3 of the Bill, which deals with the appointment of a Public Works Committee, and surely, in discussing whether the appointment of the Committee shall be postponed for six months or until some public works are referred to it for inquiry, we are entitled to go into the very basis of the matter and discuss the whole policy of appointing a Committee? The honourable member for Echuca considers that by the shutting down on public works there will be more money available for war loans, but the restriction of public activities will not create more wealth. The only method by which moneys can be provided for carrying on the war is by a thorough-going policy of wealth production throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth.",57
253,The CHAIRMAN,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,All this has nothing to do with the question before the Chair.,57
254,Mr JH CATTS,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"I must oppose the amendment. I am in favour of the appointment of a Public Works Committee, because the nine members of the Committee will be hustlers for some work to do. As they will be paid so much per day for each sitting, they will naturally be desirous of adding to their emoluments. I understand that the Government have arranged that there will be six members from the Government side of the House on the Committee. The idea is a very good one, because there will thus be six hustlers for emoluments inducing the Government to go in for a public works policy.",57
255,The CHAIRMAN,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"The honourable member is travelling beyond the clause. Mr J. H."" CATTS - I am giving reasons why there should be no postponement of the appointment of this Committee. - The CHAIRMAN - The honourable member is dealing with the principal Act. That measure is not before the Committee.",57
256,Mr JH CATTS,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"If a Public Works Committee is not appointed, there will be no lever behind the Government urging it to find work for the Committee to do We have several important works ahead of us. The Commonwealth is pledged to build a transcontinental railway from north to south. The question of the construction of strategic railways, so urgent when Mr Fisher was Prime Minister, has been postponed. If the Committee is appointed with six representatives of the Government side upon it, there will be so many hustlers urging the Government to provide work for the Committee that it may result in some of these great national works being taken in hand.",57
257,Mr BOYD,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,The honourable member does not suggest that any members of Parliament will hustle for the purpose of getting fees ?,57
258,Mr JH CATTS,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"I said that we should appoint men who will hustle for work. The carrying of this amendment would' be a complete discouragement of the Government from proceeding with public works. They are doing serious enough damage now by their slowing down, but it would be a mistake to carry this amendment and thus encourage them in a further slackening of effort in regard to national works to which Parliament is pledged, and which are urgently required in order to find employment for tens of thousands of men. For this reason I must vote against the amendment.",57
259,The CHAIRMAN,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"On looking into the amendment which the honourable member for Eden-Monaro gave me in substitution for the one which I ruled out of order, I find that it comes within the same category as its predecessor. The one purpose of the clause under consideration is to enable the appointment during this session of Parliament of a Committee, which, according to the principal Act, should have been appointed during the first session of this Parliament. The clause does not open up for review the whole of section 3 of the principal Act. It does not interfere in any way with the provisions of the principal Act in regard to the personnel of the Committee or its powers, or the manner of referring works to it. Therefore, I am of opinion that this amendment is out of order.",57
260,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"Shal l I be in order in moving an amendment that the Committee shall not be appointed during the current financial year ? Or, if that, too, is ruled out of order, will it be competent for me to move that an appointment be made in the third session of thi' Parliament ?'",57

263,Mr JH CATTS,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,On a point of order. Clause 2 deals with the time when it shall be valid for Parliament to appoint this Committee. The original Act provided that the Committee should be appointed in the first session of Parliament. Bill proposes that the Committee shall be appointed during the second session of this Parliament. I submit that an amendment to allow of the appointment of the Committee at a later time than the second session is in order.,58

265,Mr BRUC ESMITH,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"Parkes) [8.8] The passage of this measure is being surrounded with a very unnecessary amount of mystery and difficulty. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman) seems to be under a misapprehension as to what will be the effect of the Bill . The first part, of the honourable member's speech was a long and strong protest against any further public expenditure. In that contention I am entirely with the honourable member. In war time we should stop all these great public works at once. I know that the honourable member, for Cook (Mr J. H . Catts) and other honourable members on the opposite side are in favour of unlimited works expenditure on the false economic ground that it will give employment to the people. But it is a necessary condition of all public expenditure thab it shall be useful and opportune, and that the community shall be likely to get some good return from it . W it h the general protest, which the honourable member for Eden-Monaro has entered against public expenditure I quite agree, but such agreement is not inconsistent with support of the Bill . The passage of this measure is very necessary, even in the interests of the honourable member. that the proposal with regard to the arsenal at Canberra shall be brought forward for consideration, but the Public I suggest that Works Act makes that quite impossible unless the Public Works Committee is first appointed.

266,Mr WATT,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,No .,58
267,Mr BRUC ESMITH,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,My argument is not dependent on what any Minister said. The arsenal cannot be brought under the consideration of the House un-; less this Bill is passed. The A ct makes it The a condition precedent to the carrying out of any work that it shall be referred to the Public Works Committee.,58
268,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,That does not apply to military works.,58
269,Mr BRUCESMITH,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"It applies to all works which are not specially exempted, and the House would have something to say if any attempt were made to escape the criticism offchePublic Works Committee by absolving any works from its scrutiny. The honourable member is putting the cart before the horse, because lie is trying to defeat, the measure which is a condition precedent to the Government proceeding with one public work which he is strongly advocating. This measure cannot in itself involve any expenditure, because under the Act no member of the Committee can receive a fee u n t i l work has been referred to the .Committee by Parliament.",58

272,Mr BRUCESMITH,WOOD PULPAND ROCK,"I am not discussing the feespaid to the'- members of the Works Committee. I was pointing out that one of the grounds on which the honourable member opposes the Bill is that it involves expenditure in the payment of fees to the members of the Works Committee. The original Act , however, does not provide for the payment of fees until works are referred to the Committee, and no fees will be paid unless works are so referred. There is need for the Bill to bring into existence a body of He is anxious men to whom proposals for the construction of public works may be referred for investigation. I speak with some author it y on the subject, having had for three years the control of the public works .of the oldest State i u Australia, in the course of which time.

My own view is that, if an honourable member accents a position on a Committee, he should receive his travelling expenses, and travelling expenses only. If fees are to be given in addition, then the Committee ought to be formed from outside, or be a composite body, with accountants, architects, engineers, and other experts represented. This Bill , in my opinion, is ouite right in not providing for any payment; but, if I remember rightly, this difference between the two bodies was originally due to a mistake. It will be observed that the two Bills are almost identical in wording, and I think both Committees should be placed on the same footing. I do not say that it is my opinion, but the view is held by some people that the payment of members for acting on Committees of the kind is the thin end of the wedge to the conferring of benefits on members of this House. The members of the Public Works Committee, unlike those of the Committee of Public Accounts, receive, when travelling, a fee of 30s. a day in addition to their travelling expenses, and that, I think, the public will hardly approve of.

In Committee (Consideration resumed from 12th September, vide page 1963): Schedule (Department of Works and Railways, Â£963,300). Upon which Mr GREGORY had movedThat the item "" General Arsenal-Work s and Buildings, including erection of residential quarters-toward s cost, Â£100.000,"" be reduced by Â£ 1,000. . . .",62
318,Mr NICHOLLS,COMMITTEE OE PUBLIC,"Macquarie) [9.1]. - There are many honourable members who have the idea that the proposed arsenal should be established in the Federal Territory, ancl that a Small Arms Factory should be associated with it , and their arguments lead me to assume that they would attempt to remove the existing Small Aims Factory from Lithgow. As I am the representative of that locality, and as I assured the electors of the town that I would protect their interests so far as I possibly could, a certain amount of responsibility rests on me to secure the retention of that Factory. Many arguments can be advanced for this. The climatic conditions are ideal at Lithgow. The present Ministry was returned to power on the understanding that they would exercise the strictest economy, but no economy would be exercised in tearing down an establishment that has been built up at enormous expense and in spending from Â£250,000 to Â£300,000 in re-building it at Canberra. No good reason has been advanced for spending money in the establishment of a new Factory when that which is already in existence is doing its work most satisfactorily. The effect of the removal of the establishment upon the town of Lithgow must also be given careful consideration. When the Factory was first started there were about 300 men employed, but there are now 1,800 men at work in it , and the great bulk of them have their families living in Lithgow. It would be a huge iniquity to the residents of that town if the present establishment were torn down and shifted to Canberra, m y "" Gobecause, when the men went to work at Lithgow, they were given to understand 'that they would have coutinuity of ployment, and many of them established and built homes there. In these circumit stances, it is rather unreasonable f o orable members to talk of taking away rest the Factory, and ,1 seek an assurance from the Government that it will still remain in operation at Lithgow, although nrsennl may be erected in some other locality. Such an assurance would make the people of my electorate feel much be gratified. more satisfied. At present they do not know how they are situated. They not know that they may not be asked, within the next few years, to remove their goods and chattels to some other part the Commonwealth. ' It is my opinion that an arsenal could be established wisely and economically at Lithgow. Some honourable members seem to be 'intoxicated with a recent development so far as Australia is concerned, and with the idea that Canberra is the only spot in the world which is suitable for the - erection of an arsenal. They endeavour to bring forward evidence to show that Lithgow is a most unsuitable place for such an establishment. One' ment advanced against Lithgow tli afc there is not a sufficient water supply there, whereas the truth is there is a good and abundant water - supply there, as would have been ascerarsenal tained by the Committee which investiwas gated the matter if it had done its work properly. Experts have said distinctly that Lithgow is a most suitnble place f this particular class of work. Nature ii shareholder in the industry that is operation in the town, because within 15 or 20 miles of the Small Arms Factory there can be found most of the materials necessary for the manufacture of armahad ments, such as coal, iron, and cement, gredients which will - certainly not be found in proximity to the proposed site in the Federal Capital Territory. Therehas fore I claim that Lithgow is just as suitable a site for an arsenal as Canberra is, and that the people of L gow are just as much entitled to considerainto tion as are the people at the Federal Capital. I am prepared to put up a fight for the establishment of an arsenal at Lithgow, as well as for the maintenance of the present Small Arms Factory there. Honourable members would be doing more good if they would endeavour to enlarge the ramifications of the existing Factory emrather than seek to pull it down. Some honourable members seem anxious to r i p down immediately and shift it to the r honFederal Territory. If they would intethemselves in getting out of the mines some of the so-called Loyalists, who are taking the bread out of the mouths of the an women and children of Lithgow, and shifting them to the Federal Capital Territory, the people of Lithgow would I have to recognise that there are various obstacles to ths do advancement of Lithgow. Not only will the employees at the Factory be inconvenienced, but there are business men in of the town who went there, and invested their money on the distinct understanding that there would be no interference with the Factory. Now they do not know whether they will have to for f e it their money, and they are wondering what the outlook will be. Lithgow is surrounded by hills, which would give it perfect protection in case of an enemy attack, better protection than can be obtained in any other arguspot in Australia that I know of, is or have read of. I will take the late Lord Kitchener .as an authority in prethat ference to the men who have reported on the matter of the establishment of an elsewhere. He said that Lithgow an ideal spot, and worthy of the consideration of any Government. If it Avas good enough for Lord Kitchener to recomo r mend Lithgow, it ought to be good enough is for honourable members of this House to in recommend the retention of the present Factory, even if they cannot recommend an extension of it . No industry in New South Wales or in the .Commonwealth has more continuity in its operations than in - the Small Arms Factory. There has been practically no industrial disturbance during the number of years that the Factory been running, proving conclusively that the industry should be permitted to remain as it is, because immediately we it hbegin to shift men about and put them a climate to which they are not accustomed, they may become dissatisfied, and possibly there will be industrial dislocation. I mentioned last night that the rifles produced were equal in quality to the rifles that are turned out in any part of the world. They may have been defective $ w h e n the industry first commenced, but vast improvements have been made, and the rifles now turned out compare favourably with the great bulk of rifles produced in older countries. They may not be turned out as cheaply, but in a country where the cost of labour is so much higher than in other countries the cost of the production of any article must be proportionately higher, and it is that which has caused the increase in the cost of producing rifles at the Small Arms at Lithgow. If my memory serves me aright, the late Government gave the assurance that the industry at Lithgow would not be interfered with while the war continued. It would be a suicidal policy on the part of honourable bers to make any attempt to dislocate it, because it will take anything from two to five years to get a factory in decent working order elsewhere. In the meantime the whole industry will have been dislocated, a huge sum of money will have been spent, and weeks and months will have been occupied in getting a new class of labour into the industry, and training the men to conform to the rules and regulations which are in operation at the present time. Therefore, the Government will be well advised in leaving the Factory where it is. If the Government intend to erect other establishments of a similar character, they may do so, but in no circumstances should they with the Factory that is already working so satisfactorily at Lithgow. The former honourable member for Macquarie (Mr. Carr) made a good fight in this House for the retention of the Factory at Lithgow, but he did not receive a great deal of satisfaction. Honourable members seemed to have become intoxicated' with, the idea that every Commonwealth activity should be located in the Federal Capital. not know what reasons actuated them, but their one ambition and desire apparently was to remove the Small Arms from Lithgow into Federal Territory. to whether such a change would be beneficial to the community I cannot say. I am not anti-Federal, but no honourable member would come into this House and urge that a factory of this kind, in operation in his own electorate, should be shifted elsewhere. If industrial tion had taken place at Lithgow, if the men were uncontrollable, or if the climatic conditions were unsatisfactory, honourable members would be justified in advocating the removal of the Factory. But I have Mr Nicholls. not heard one valid reason advanced for that step.",62
319,Mr JH CATTS,COMMITTEE OE PUBLIC,What about the proximity of raw material ?,64
320,Mr NICHOLLS,COMMITTEE OE PUBLIC,"All the raw material required for the Factory is obtainable close at hand, but if the establishment is shifted to Canberra, I do not know whether the Government will have access to convenient supplies of coal, Factory ironstone, and cement. Lithgow is on the railway, and no trouble is experienced in distributing the product of the Factory.",64
321,Mr JH CATTS,COMMITTEE OE PUBLIC,"Is the Factory at Lithgow easily defended ? mem- Mr NICHOLLS - Lithgo w itself is situated in the midst of a group of mountains, and is absolutely protected. A more ideal spot for a small arms factory could not be found in any part of Australia. I should like the Minister to in form the Committee whether the Government propose to remove the Factory from its present site. If I can get an assur-. ance that they have no such intention, I c,an tell the people of Lithgow that their lease of life there is assured for a' number of years.",64
322,Mr JH CATTS,COMMITTEE OE PUBLIC,The present uncertainty should be removed.,64
323,Mr NICHOLLS,COMMITTEE OE PUBLIC,"That is my coninterfere tention. The present Government were elected as a Win-the-war Administration, and are pledged to exercise the strictest economy. It would be most unwise on their part to incur an unnecessary expenditure of Â£200,000 or Â£300,000 in removing the Small Arms Factory to the Federal Capital. The amount of money that would be expended on that transfer could be wisely devoted to other purposes, which would provide employment I do for thousands of men who are out , of work today. The removal of the - Factory and the installation of the machinery Factory on a new site would cost as much as the As purchase of new machinery. Another consideration is that it would be impolitic to interfere with the existing establishment while the war is in progress. In any case, interference with the Factory will stifle a flourishing industry, and cause dislocation amongst the employees, dislocawho have now the advantage of five or six years' experience in the production of rifles. The result would be that instead of the weapons costing Â£ 7 or Â£ 8 each, the cost of production would probably be Â£ 1 3 or Â£ 1 4 , until the new establishment and staff have developed into proper working order. Many of the employees have large families, and some of them have commenced to establish homes at Lithgow and have paid deposits in connection with the purchase of houses. In the event of the establishment being closed down, they will forfeit the money they have paid. Other men have commenced businesses in the town, and they run the risk of losing the money they have invested. Additional inconvenience will be entailed upon the men in shifting their families to another part of the Commonwealth. Unfortunately it seems that not only members of the Government, but also my own colleagues on this side of the House are in favour of the removal of the factory.",64
324,Mr JH CATTS,COMMITTEE OE PUBLIC,No .,65
325,Mr NICHOLLS,COMMITTEE OE PUBLIC,"Some honourable members on this side are, but I . suppose that if similar industries were in their own electorates they would be quite ready to plead for their continuance. I trust this matter will receive favourable consideration at the hands of honourable members on both sides.",65
326,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OE PUBLIC,"Balaclava-Minister for Works and Railways) [9.28] - I have listened very attentively to every word spoken on the schedule, and particularly to the utterances relating to the amendment, but I am not yet quite sure what the purpose of the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) is.",65
327,Mr GREGORY,COMMITTEE OE PUBLIC,I only desire an assurance in regard to the site of the arsenal.,65
328,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OE PUBLIC,"If that is made quite clear to the Committee I think I can give the honourable member and those supporting him an assurance that will set their doubts at rest. In considering arsenal proposal, which, as honourable members know, is a legacy from former Administrations, the Government had to - deal with two points. Primarily, we had to consider whether as a matter of policy an arsenal should be proceeded with, and having determined that question, we had to decide as to the site upon which the arsenal should be erected. the schedule deals only with the primary consideration. All the Government have determined up to the present moment is that there shall be an arsenal; the question of site has not been determined. I need not worry the Committee with the arguments that induced us to arrive at that conclusion. It would not be proper to elaborate them at length, but I [76] am entitled to say, with the full concurrence of the Government, and particularly of the Minister for Defence, that at present the position of Australia is unsafe. I hope honourable members will not ask me fco elaborate that statement, or think that I am dealing in mysteries. There are certain considerations which are understood by men of the world who sat in Parliament and have access to more or less confidential documents, and I think it would be better if we did not debate that question further. But honourable members on both sides will in dorse the view held by the present and former Governments that the present position in respect of small arm equipment and ammunition is not at all satisfactory. Generally speaking, one might assume that a Committee of the whole House, knowing all the facts, would be unanimously of opinion that we should proceed with .the establishment of an arsenal with all reasonable speed, making sure, of course, that we are well advised and are not making any fundamental blunders. In regard to the question of site, as a private member I held the view which as a Minister I still hold, that the Government are not entitled to ram any site down the throat of Parliainent. Upon this subject there are widely divergent views which have been properly expressed in this House. Both Lithgow and Tuggeranong have been mentioned as the only suitable place for such an arsenal. The Government have not yet dealt with the question of sitÂ°. and before coming fco a determination upon it we shall ask the concurrence of Parliament. That is a frank and free, if brief, statement, which I hope the Committee will accept, letting us now proceed the with the rest of the schedule.",65

330,Mr CHARLTON,COMMITTEE OE PUBLIC,"Hunter) [9.32] - I congratulate the honourable member for Macquarie on the able manner in which he has placed the claims of his constituents before the - Committee. Had the Minister replied to his question whether the Government intends to move the Factory from Lithgow to Canberra, I should not have risen to speak. It is due to the honourable member that he should be told whether the Government intends at a later period to remove the - Small Arms Factory from Lithgow to Canberra. I have a vivid recollection of what happened last Parliament. At the time. I was desirous that the arsenal should be built, because I agree with what has been said as to the need for it ; but I pointed out that, I would not be a party to the removing of the Small Arms Factory from Lithgow to the site at the Federal Capital chosen for the arsenal, in view of the fact that so much money has been spent on the Factory, and that its removal would f u r ther increase the cost of producing rifles, which is still too great. This cost has been reduced considerably within the past two years, largely because there is now better co-ordination between the differentdepartments of the Factory. But in removing the Factory you will have to re-establish the present conditions, which would take probably two or three years, and this would mean considerable expense in addition to that entailed by the actual removal, and the getting of the new Factory into thorough working order.",66

341,Mr RILEY,COMMITTEE OE PUBLIC,The Works Committee has reported on the question of site.,66
342,Mr JH CATTS,COMMITTEE OE PUBLIC,I understood from the Minister's statement that there would be another inquiry in regard to the site.,66

344,Mr JH CATTS,COMMITTEE OE PUBLIC,Is there tp be an inquiry? Will the Minister answer that?,66
345,Mr TUDOR,COMMITTEE OE PUBLIC,"Parliamen t will be consulted at some time in the future, but whether in the near or in the far f u t u re no one knows. Mr J. H. CATTS - Apparentl y nothing can be done for the settlement of the site until Parliament has been consulted. How much of the Â£100,000 that we are asked to vote can be spent? The construction of an arsenal has been under consideration for some time. The Government is neglecting, I might almost say criminally, the vital interests of the country. In July of last year it was decided by Cabinet, and publicly announced by the Minister for Defence, that the defence necessities of the Commonwealth were so urgent that it was necessary to immediately proceed with the military training of the whole manhood of Australia for home defence, which shows that twelve months ago we were in a critical position so far as home defence was concerned. The establishment of an arsenal has now been under consideration for a couple of years, and it may take a couple of years y more before a decision can be arrived at regarding a site, because there will be a struggle between conflicting interests to secure the proposed large expenditure for some particular place. I am astounded to hear the Minister say that the Government realizes the urgent necessity for an arsenal, and in the next breath that it has not yet decided the question of site. It appreciates the difficulties which confront us, but is taking no adequate steps to meet them. When are we to consider the question of site? We are told today by the Prime Minister that the House is to meet on an additional sitting day next week, and to sit longer hours, in the hope that its business may be concluded by the end of the week, with a view to an adjournment. The question of site cannot be dealt with until we meet again after that adjournment. This is playing with the matter. If we could freely and frankly discuss the dangers that surround Australia at the present time, and the public could be made to appreciate our position, the people would demand that the Government should do its duty by the country, but the electors are forced to live in a fool's paradise, because the Government prevents from reaching them .the information which every man and woman in the country should have. I admit the difficulty of saying some of the things that we should like to say about the present international situation. He would be a bold man who would affirm that the close of the Avar Avill be reached without a new alignment of the nations which are taking part in it . If the end of the Avar is preceded by a conference to"" discuss the terms of peace, and .there is then no disagreement between those who are now allies, it will be the first time in history that such a thing has taken place. When after the first Balkan war a settlement of the interests in dispute Avas attempted, a quarrel broke out among States that had been allied, and the fight between them was fiercer than the original conflict. No one can consider, without fearing what may happen, the possibility of differences between the present Allies when the enemy which keeps them together has been disposed of. To safeguard the interests of this country we must be prepared for all contingencies. What are to be the terms of peace ?",66

It had nothing to do Will the present war. The decision to train every man in Australia must haA'e been due to information of the most serious kind in the possession of the Government. Pidelity to our national interests has now been replaced by criminal disregard of our vital necessities. We are now told by the Postmaster-General that it will take ten years to complete the arsenal.",67

Australia is in a position of serious danger, and I am endeavouring to drive home that fact, in the hope that the Government will be induced to "" get a hustle "" on. As it is, they are simply asking the Committee to affirm the general principle of an arsenal. Their proposal is something very remote from the actual construction of the arsenal. We have heard a lot as'to the aims of the Allies, so far as the disposition of the We know the that questions as to the adjustment of power-the balance of poAver-in the a Pacific have also been discussed, but we to are not permitted to know anything of the details.

This young nation seeks no territorial aggrandisement. bilities are that We have already as much territory as we can handle. from various quarters that, because we do not properly occupy this continent of ours, we are breaking international rules. We are told that if some other country has an overflowing population, and we make no serious attempt to fill our vacant spaces, that other country has a right to insist that her people shall be allowed to inhabit portion of this continent. that be so, to what extent is our position further endangered by the acquisition of still further territory, which it is impossible for us to develop ?",68

It is because I think the interests of this country are not being perly safeguarded by the party opposite that I have done so. In its neglect of the interests of Australia, in its practical refusal to put Australia in a position to strike a blow for itself against impending dangers that can be averted only by an act of Providence, I consider this Government is the worse we have ever had in this country.

The statement that the arsenal will not be completed for the next ten years just about expresses the views of the Imperialistic Jingo section of the Cabinet, which consists mainly of Englishmen- I say this deliberately-as to the defence of Australia.

If anything is needed for the defence of this country, it is steel works capable of turning out practically all the steel required for our military and ammuninaval purposes.

The question fco which he has drawn attention is arguable, and it depends on the view which one takes of the works in the Federal Territory; but broadly speaking, it is boo late to effect any substantial saving in regard to this work. I was at the Federal Capital four and a half months ago, and the line was then in an advanced stage. I cannot assure the honourable member precisely where it stands now, but I know that a large quantity of timber, rails, fish-plates and other things associated with the carrying out of this work are already on the ground or in course of being laid. The cuttings and earthworks were in an advanced stage when I was there. This particular line stretches from the power-house to what is known as the civic centre. It is about 3J miles long. The honourable member has been misinformed as to the total cost of the line. The figures in It is said my possession show that Â£17,000 was spent on the line up fco 30th June last, and that Â£7,500 will be required to complete it .

415,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OE PUBLIC,"That item does not deal with this particular line. The Minister for Home and Territories will explain what it means. I know that his idea is that where certain work has been done it should be kept in a state of preservation so that its value may not be lost. That is a prudent policy. Whatever view we I do not take as to stopping works, it would be bad economy to allow whatever has alment ready been constructed to fal l into disremarked pair. Salvage money should appear on the Estimates for the preservation of ent works already completed. Arising out of the maintenance of this railway there does not concern Mr Griffin. will be a little expenditure. The original purpose of the line was the conveyance of building material from that point to the civic centre. If works are being structed there will be a fair amount revenue on that section. If works not being constructed the only traffic be the internaltraffic of the workmen and the administrators living in the CapiThat tal and those dealing with land in the vicinity. It would be folly to stop remaining expenditure by stacking up the few remaining rails, and not laying them, as was originally intended. The amount to be expended on the temporary wooden bridge is estimated to be Â£800, which, with the Â£7,500 for that section of line, makes the total of Â£8,300 appearing in the schedule. The honourable member must judge this work, as we must judge other works, not as to whether it was wise to start it in the first place, but, ing started it , whether it to discontinue it . Often this problem arises in administration. A man may disagree with the original project, but w i ll complete it , because once having started the enterprise, it would be folly to money being spent at Canberra. to discontinue it .

If the Minister will give me an assurance that the line will not be constructed across the Molonglo River opposite to power house, I shall be satisfied that money is not being altogether wasted. The fact of the case is that Mr Griffin determined that the first business settlemoney shall take place on a certain spot on his plan for the civic centre. Whether such settlement will be convenif o r the people livin g there, or whether it will be economical for the Government Under cross-examination by the Public Works Committee, he admitted that if he were successful in carrying. out his design the conworkmen employed in building Parliaof ment House and the public offices would are have to walk a mile to work, which will would necessitate their being paid every day for the resultant loss of time. cost does not concern Mr Griffin so long as he can get his civic centre started the at the spot marked on his plan. I know that the only object of constructing this line is that men may be induced to settle on the side of the river opposite to where it would be convenient for them to live if they were employed in building the public offices, and in order that a certain for m of settlement, which Mr Griffin has decided to be necessary for the carrying out of his design, shall take place.",73

419,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMITTEE OE PUBLIC,"Eden Monaro) [10.38] - Havin g been at the Federal Capital six weeks ago, I can bear the out the statement of the Minister. Since the the Minister's visit the cuttings have been finished, and the line has been pracis tically completed. I understand that this is to pay some of the expenditure. that was incurred while the work was in progress.",73
420,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OE PUBLIC,I understand that that is so to some extent.,74
421,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMITTEE OE PUBLIC,"I disagree from the contention of the honourable member for Boothby. For this work Mr . Griffin is not responsible. He has carried out an instruction by a previous Minister that this work should be done, and, I think, quite properly. Mr Griffin's plan provides for the city being divided into two centres, the parliamentary centre and the civic centre, one on each side of the river. Mr Griffin's idea is that when men are employed in the construction of the parliamentary buildings and public offices, they should not be living in tents around Parliament House, but that decent"" workmen's cottages should be built for them in the civic centre, on the opposite side of the river. I concur in his view. When construction work is in full swing, the men w i ll be there, not for a day, a week, or a month, but for a very long time, and for that reason it would be false economy to house them in temporary shanties such, as are provided about the brick works. The question of Mr Griffin's responsibility does not arise. The Minister gave an instruction, and the work is almost completed. What good could be done by refusing funds for its completion ? Notwithstanding anything Parliament may do to'reduce the item, the Minister will be obliged to pay the debts which have been incurred, or he will receive a writ. The construction of this railway is quite justified, for upon the completion of a further 7 miles of line to the boundary of the Federal Capital, the Government of New South Wales will be obliged, by a contract entered into with the Commonwealth, to connect that line with Yass. The State Government are prepared to fulfil their part of the contract as soon as the Commonwealth has done its share. Amendment negatived. Proposed vote agreed to. Department of Postmaster-General, Â£104,000.",74
422,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMITTEE OE PUBLIC,"Will the Postmaster-General, in accordance with his promise last evening, inform the Committee in what country districts money is to be spent on the laying of conduits?",74
423,Mr WEBSTER,COMMITTEE OE PUBLIC,"Gwydir-Postmaster General) [10.40] - I desire to say a few words in reply to the criticisms that have been offered and the requests that have been made for information. The money to be expended this year on the laying of conduits for telephone services is to be provided for from loan. Last year I was asked by the Treasurer to carry out that work from revenue, and, accordingly, none of it was done from loan, although three years previously conduit construction was charged to loan account. If Parliament were to decide that I should continue this work from revenue at a time when revenue is limited, the very men who are objecting, to the work being financed from loan account would be prejudicing country interests, because it is obvious that the less money I receive from loan for this purpose, the greater must be the contribution from revenue, - leaving less revenue available to supply the demands for country services. Th'e undergrounding of telephone conduits was started some years ago, and in several cities proved quite an easy and economical work. In Sydney the work was more expensive than anywhere else in the Commonwealth. In Melbourne and other capital cities we have been able to do the more expensive works in shorter time,,but, in Sydney, owing to the comparatively heavy cost of the work, we have not been able to proceed with the undergrounding so rapidly. Consequently there is more of this work to be done in the metropolitan area of - Sydney than in any other place in the Commonwealth. In South Australia nearly all the possible undergrounding in the city has been done, and no money is provided this year for expenditure in the metropolitan area. The whole of the money is to be spent in country districts - viz., Unley, Kooringa, Jamestown, Kapunda, Murray Bridge, Millicent, Salisbury, Renmark, Brighton, and Glenelg. The expenditure in each of those districts will range from Â£800 to Â£ 3 , 3 9 1 . When we underground telephone lines we reduce the cost of maintenance to one-eighth of the cost of maintaining aerial lines. Therefore, the sooner the great arteries in the metropolitan areas are undergrounded the sooner will money be available for the extension of services in the country. The curtailment of the undergrounding reduces the possibility of country extension. I am not a city representative; for nearly twenty years I have represented a country constituency, and, while I occupy my present position, country services will not be prejudiced. When the general Estimates are under discussion I hope to show how economies have been effected by the reduction of excess services in capital cities. I have applied the pruning knife, and have cut out, not all, but a good deal of the dead wood. There was a deficit of Â£629,000 when I became Postmaster General, but I hope that the accounts now under preparation will show a balance in favour of the Department, and this has been brought about by legitimate economies. No country service has been reduced beyond what was being paid for it before the war.",74
424,The CHAIRMAN,COMMITTEE OE PUBLIC, The Minister may not go into that matter.,75
425,Mr WEBSTER,COMMITTEE OE PUBLIC,"In Victoria, undergrounding is to be done in Ballarat, Bendigo, Colac, Mortlake, Horsham, Warrnambool, and Geelong. Mr SriiroxAiR - What about Queensland?",75
426,Mr WEBSTER,COMMITTEE OE PUBLIC,There has not been time since the Treasurer made known what amount would be available to determine the allotment for Queensland.,75
427,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMITTEE OE PUBLIC,Why is Minister calling for once-a-week services where previously there had been threetimes-a-week services ?,75
428,Mr WEBSTER,COMMITTEE OE PUBLIC,"I am not allowed to explain that now, but when the general Estimates are under discussion I hope to make a complete statement regarding the operations of the Department.",75

People, who only twice a week can get news of their friends who are fighting at the Front, or even press reports",75
430,The CHAIRMAN,COMMITTEE OE PUBLIC,The honourable member may not go into that matter.,75

432,Mr GREGORY,COMMITTEE OE PUBLIC,"Dampier) [10.54] I was pleased - to hear the statement of the Minister regarding the telephone ser- vice. I wish to amend the item so that the Minister may be able to spend some of this money in assisting those in the back country who wish to have telephones. There is more need for expenditure on telephone services there than in the cities, because where mails are irregular other' communication should be provided. At the present time, districts which have offered to pay the full interest charges demanded by the Department to make good any loss on working, and to assist in the cartage of posts and material, have been informed by the Department that, owing to the scarcity of wire, due to the war, requests for extensions cannot be granted. Yet wire is obtainable for telephone systems in the cities and big. towns. No doubt, city representatives are in sympathy with those who live in the back country, and probably the Minister is, too, though he has not shown it in a practical way. I believe in giving all that we can to the ""man out back. This is not a, matter of catching votes. In the districts that I have in mind it would be difficult to find 100 electors, whereas that number of votes can be secured in a mining camp or small town where there are telephone the services. I hope that the Minister will agree to the addition to the item of the words "" also for country telephones."" That will enable him to treat the country districts with a certain amount of leniency. My experience of the Department's actions differs from the statements of the Minister. Some time ago a guarantee of Â£150 a year was demanded for an all-night telephone service. T know of a case in which a service was established under such a guarantee, one man paying Â£100 to obtain communication with the exchange. Soon afterwards, the regulation was altered, and a guarantee of Â£250 was demanded. This is not the way in which the Minister is treating the city populations. I should have no objection to a system which required services to pay everywhere. I should not object to a twopenny postage to make the Postal Department pay. But if concessions are to be given, they should go to the country people rather than to the town populations. According to the departmental report, last year Â£116,000 was lost on the Sydney metropolitan telephone system; Â£56,000 on the Melbourne system; and Â£34,000 on. the Perth system, and no special demand is being made upon them. I move That the item "" For the construction of conduits and for laying wires underground- Â£104,000"" be amended by the insertion, after the word "" underground,"" of the words "" and also for country telephones.""",75

444,Mr RODGERS,COMMITTEE OE PUBLIC,"Wannon) [11.11] The Postmaster-General has given us a very interesting exposition of the difficulty experienced by a Minister who is unable to convince his colleagues in the Cabinet as to the way in which the finances of his Department should be arranged. I think he has the sympathy of ' every country representative. . The honourable gentleman has laid down a f u n damental principle with which, I think, the Committee will agree-the principle that that class of capital construction work which has longevity on its side should, in the case of his Department, be provided for out of loan money. As it is, we have in this Bill items relating to telephone wires, the life of which, according to the honourable member for East Sydney, is very much curtailed by reason of the fact that, to use his own words, they are ""buried alive."" pleased to notice that au important town in myelectorate is to be visited under this proposal, but I should have been better pleased had the proposed vote for undergrounding telephone wires in that town been set apart for extending tele-: phone lines in country districts. When I entered this House I was very much interested in the question of country telephone construction, and arranged with the then Postmaster-General (Mr , Agar Wynne) to have an interview with the then chief constructional engineer (Mr Hesketh). At that interview we went into the cost of construction, with the result that tremendous savings were effected. The Department had been in Â° the habit of erecting poles up to 20 feet and 26 feet in length in outlying country districts where 12 feet poles would have been quite sufficient. That practice was altered as the result of the interview. We also had many lines erected on a contributory basis, the residents undertaking, where the timber was growing on their own land, to provide the poles and to erect them, the Department supplying wires, spindles, insulators, and instruments, and making a small contribution per mile to the cost The of construction. Where farmers and their workmen could spare the time to construct a.line this system proved satisfactory, both to the Department and to local residents. Many miles of telephone lines were constructed upon that basis. I recently submitted to the Postmaster General's Department a proposal to erect a line of 10 miles on these terms, but the answer I received was that if those concerned would supply the poles, erect them, and provide the wires, spindles, and insulators, the Department would provide the instrument, and would supervise the work of making an effective connection. In other words, the residents to be served were to do the whole work, and the Department would simply have to supply an expert to complete the circuit. The Postmaster-General would do well if he would come out openly with a policy of country telephone construction. If he does so I venture to say he will receive the thanks of all country residents There never was a time in the history of country settlement when there was more I am anxiety to get into touch with all centres of communication, because almost every home is vitally concerned in the war. I am not permitted under this item to say that the Postmaster-General is restricting mail services, but if the restriction on telephone eommunication becomes as bad as in the case of the mail services, he will have all the country districts up in arms.

449,Mr BLAKELEY,COMMITTEE OE PUBLIC,"In one part of the Darling electorate there has been an agitation for a considerable time to have a telephone line constructed as a means of. communication between the Liverpool Plains pastoralists and settlers and the Western pastoralists. When a drought occurs in the western area it is necessary that stock should be moved to places more favourably circumstanced in regard to grass and water; and at present there is no telephonic communication of the kind desired. Such a line would give those interested in the raising of stock a means of getting into touch with those who have grazing land at their disposal, and supply a great public necessity. What accentuates the situation is that there will so shortly be a quicker means for the transit of stock, inasmuch as it will be possible to move them by train.",78

The people who live in the interior of Australia create a great deal of the wealth that is being exported from this country: and better means of comm'unication with them by telegraph, telephone, and mail is therefore in the best interests of Australia. The honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) mentioned that the people inland are very desirous of receiving news relating to the trouble overseas; I agree with that view, and if the Postmaster General is not prepared to give them better consideration in the future he will have to bear the responsibility.

If the Government are in earnest in keeping their promises to the people who depend on them for efficient telephonic and mail communication, they must give them greater facilities. Postmaster-General says the Department is bearing 50 per cent, of the loss upon telephone lines; but that is quite reasonable, as a gre^t deal of the wealth comes from the country, and the conditions under which the people, live there are lost sight of until country members bring them forward.

My object is to protest against the establishment of Federal Departments in Melbourne. We are continuously weaving a kind of spider's web of Departments in Melbourne, which is tying the whole of the administration of Commonwealth affairs to this spot. A previous Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Tudor) decided that this laboratory should be placed at Canberra, but the present Government have reversed that decision. If there is one thing more than another that should be established at the Federal Capital, it is the grouping of scientific institutions which will be essential to the carrying on of the research work of the Commonwealth. Honourable members opposite, have previously advocated the establishment of an agricultural bureau. The best scientific experts of the world should be got together for the purpose of conducting tests that will enable our His agricultural industry to develop on the most advanced lines. But the 'idea seems to have been abandoned, though it must be taken in hand sooner or later. No better policy could be adopted than that of having these scientific institutions, when they are established, placed in close proximity to one not another, so that the experts will be able by to associate and discuss together various compliphases of the great undertakings under When he their care. If it is desired that these institutions should be in the capital cities of the States, why should they all be in Melbourne? There is about Â£250,000 spent in Melbourne each year in the payment of officials and in the upkeep of offices concerned in the administration of affairs of the Commonwealth, and it is. this vested interest which compels the people of this city to fight like f u r y for the maintenance of the Federal Capital in Melbourne.

I do not see why some of . these institutions should not be established in Sydney. We have in the Cook electorate any amount of room, in the University grounds, for the purpose.

486,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMITTEE OE PUBLIC,"Moreton) [11.48] I wish to briefly draw the attention of the Assistant Minister for Defence to some disabilities under which friendly societies the labour with regard to the payment of a funeral donations to the relatives of members who have been killed on active, service or who have died abroad. It is perhaps known that most friendly societies act upon the policy that those who give doubt quickly give twice. In the case of the death of a member, a friendly society always likes to see that the widow is helped I have been connected with the Grand United Order one of Oddfellows Society for years. We have always prided ourselves on the fact that we come to the rescue of the widow as quickly as we possibly can other after the death of a member. It appears now that there is a good deal of difficulty in getting from the Defence Department certificates as to the death of members who have died abroad. I will hand in to the n - Assistant Minister a letter dealing with of a specific case. I ask him to see if facilitbe ties cannot be granted to friendly societies to get death certificates at the earliest possible moment after the death of a member is made known to the military authorities. If he will promise to look into the matter in a general way, and into this special^case, I shall be satisfied.",81
487,Mr GROOM,COMMITTEE OE PUBLIC,"Darling Downs-Hon orary Minister) [11.50] - I stall be glad if the honourable member will give me the letter and the specific case. This is not the first occasion on which this matter has been raised. In many cases there is a difficulty in getting a certificate. It is not to any delay on the part of the Commonwealth, but, in the case of missing soldiers, to the fact that specificfindingshave to be obtained from the Courts across the seas. The actual findings on which the certificate is issued are sent out to Australia. In other cases, confirmations of cabled information have to be received. I have had to deal with several cases. The difficulty arises, not only in the case of friendly societies, but also in cases where people want to get payments from life insurance companies. It is highly desirable in every case that a certificate sbould be obtained as early as possible. That is only fair to the widow and relatives. I assure the honourable member that I will again make representations on the matter and see if anything can be done, and particularly with regard, to the specific case he has mentioned.",82
488,Mr MACKAY,COMMITTEE OE PUBLIC,"Lilley) [11.51] - In reply to a question, the Minister for Trade and Customs informed me that he was not aware that Queensland could supply the whole of Australia with bananas grown by white labour. I have seen the report of the Royal Commission on the Fruit Industry, from which he quoted a statement that 80 per cent, of the bananas grown in the northern part of Queensland were grown by Chinese. However true that statement may have been when the report was issued, certainly it is not true now. The major portion of the land worked by Chinese is now under cane. Practically the whole of the coast land of Queensland is suitable for growing bananas, and, instead of supplying a population of 5,000,000, we might, with a little encouragement, easily supply a population of 50,000,000. The production at present is confined principally to the southern portion of the State, where large areas are still available. Australia declared against cheap black labour. Yet we find that, during 1916, no less than 377,836 centals of bananas were imported into Victoria and New South ""Wales from F i j i . In that colony labour is paid 6s. a week, whereas the banana growers in Queensland have to pay, at least, 9s. a day. It has been asserted that the F i j i article is better than the Queensland fruit. I have made careful inquiries amongst agents and retailers, and they have told me that the Cavendish banana due,"" of Queensland is certainly superior to the Gros Michel of Fiji . I submit that in these circumstances the only question should be what alteration of the duty would be high enough to protect the Queensland article against that of F i j i . It is well known that we cannot export either our pines or our bananas, and it should therefore be made possible for our fruit to be placed on the same footing as that of F i j i . It is an industry which is supporting hundreds of families, and one which I think offers, a splendid inducement to the Government, so far as the settlement of soldiers is concerned. In Queensland we have a very large extent of Crown lands, and probably the cheapest land to be found in Australia. There is a large area of this land, which is"" very suitable for fruit growing, and with reasonable encourage- ' ment in the way of a higher duty there is no reason why quite a large number of our soldiers should not be settled there. I want to draw attention particularly to one or two statements I have received from growers. As a preliminary, I may mention that I have seen quite a number of letters in which growers state that they have had a return as low as 2Jd. per dozen. No grower can make a living unless he! gets a better price than that. There are just one or two statements I wish to read, because I think it is important that the Minister for Trade and Customs should know something as to the returns which are being obtained by the growers. Br MR . R. B. W. GIPPS, FRUIT-GROWER, BUDERIMMT . , N.C.L. My net returns on 12,365 dozen bananas during 1916-17, as per account sales, amounted to Â£79 6s. 6d. This works ont at lJ^d. per dozen, or 12s. 6d. per 100 dozen. The expenses of production and marketing worked out at 6s. 7d. per 100 dozen, as follows:Cutting, handling, and branding.'. 2s. 6d. Carting to tram terminus . . Is. tid. Train freight to Roma-strcet . . Is. 7d. Cultivation per 100 dozen per year Is. Od. 6s. 7d. Net profit, 71 pence per 100 dozen, or a little less than a l. per dozen. c Signed this 6th day of August, 1917. R. B. W. GIPPS. Witness-G . BURROWS, Capt., J.P. ' STATEMENT BY MR. H . TOOTIIX, FRUIT-GROWER, My returns, as per account sales, on 3,900 dozen bananas sent to Brisbane since January, 1917, amounted to Â£31 Is. 3d. This equals 15s. l i d . per 100 dozen, or nearly 2d. per dozen. From this result the following expenses of production and marketing have to be deducted :Cutting, handling, and branding .. Carting to tram terminus . . Tram freight .. .. Cultivation per year ' .. Thus net profit is 9s. Id. per 100 dozen, or about Id. per dozen. Returns for 100 cases bananas, containing . 2,800 dozen, consigned to Melbourne, as account sales, less freight, was Â£54 16s. This is 39s. 2d. per 100 dozen, or 4^d. dozen. Expenses of production and marketing were as follows:Cultivation per year .. Gutting, handling, and casing, and cost of cases .. Cartage to tram .. .. Tram freight .. .. Train freight, cartage, wharfage, &c, in Brisbane .. Freight, cartage, wharfage, in Melbourne"" .. Net profit, 18s. 3d. per 100 dozen, or Z^d. per dozen. (Sgd.) HERBERT TOOTIIX, Witness-G . BURROWS, Capt., J.P. One marvels at the prices I have quoted when in Collins-street he sees bananas marked eight for Is. The average protion duction of l i is f r u it in Queensland ing the past ten years has been 1,232,120 bunches per annum obtained from 6i596 acres, or 187 bunches, equal to 45 centals, per acre. The production in 1916 fallen off to the extent of 450,000 bunches as compared with 1907",82
489,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMITTEE OE PUBLIC,Thaf c is because we are growing a lot of bananas on the Tweed River.,83
490,Mr MACKAY,COMMITTEE OE PUBLIC,"I am glad to hear that and. I hope the honourable member will support me in my endeavours to bave the duty increased. At present, bananas are grown, in Queensland and in New South Wales, and in small quantities in Westto ern Australia. If the duty is increased it is certain that those States will be to supply the whole of Australia. without difficulty. At the present time it costs [ 7 7 ] -2 5s. I d . to produce a central of bananas in BTJDERIM MT. Queensland as against Is. in F i j i . The present T a r i ff is Is. 6d. per central, and the growers of Queensland are satisfied that, in order to^ put them on anything like an equal footing with the growers of F i j i , it will be necessary to raise the Tariff to 4s.

The Prime Minister has said that he is prepared to blaze the track for the 6s. 6d. primary producers of Australia. The 20s. l i d . National Government could easily assist nearly the banana growers of Queensland in this matter by increasing the duty on the i m ported article. We should hold our per W. TOOTIIX. own market for our own growers. It should be a simple matter for the Government, tlirough its numerous officers, to place such informabefore fruit-growers as would give durthem an opportunity of testing the different markets. At the same time, opportunity should be taken to inquire into the charges made by the various agents, has because the growers are convinced that, in a number of cases, they are not getting a square deal. It is time the Government took this question into consideration, and I do not think they should study the interests of a few agents and growers of bananas by black labour in preference to the future progress of this very important industry in Australia. Some sort of encouragement ought also to be given to the farmers to enable them establish packing sheds, probably with cold storage attached. An improvement able might be effected in the carriage of bananas on the Inter-State steamers. They are. stowed near the boilers, and the heat generated ripens them unduly. The Government should make it compulsory in the system of distribution'. to load and unload the f r u it with trays. There - are the best of reasons why steps should betaken to give, the farmers encouragement to embark upon co-operation in the matter of distribution. tion in marketing .and distribution. The by-products of bananas are also worthy of consideration- We have evidence that figs, flour, and even whisky can produced from bananas. Recently, read a newspaper paragraph to the effectmade that, at the St. .Louis Exhibition, sample of whisky made from bananas was shown, and after analysis by the Departof ment of Agriculture, was awarded a gold medal.' All these matters are worthy the attention of the Government, but, in the meantime, au alteration of the T a r i ff is the most important consideration. Hav2d. ing regard to the fact that the banana in dustry means so much to the States of lime Queensland, New South Wales; and 8s.; Western Australia, the Government of red'oil, might well take the earliest opportunity to of giving this very necessary relief. I desire now to say a few words about pineapples and citrus fruits. land is producing annually pineapples to the value of Â£S8,828. It is notorious that this f r u it is often unprocurable money, in the southern States, and the reason 6d., is that decent cold storage accommodaing tion is not available on the ships. Queensland, last season, a lot of this ducted, f r u it was simply dumped in heaps and wasted, because it. was impossible to margrade ket it in anything like decent order. The shippers assert that there is cold shilling. storage accommodation, but the growers will not pay |or it . On the other hand, draw the growers say that they would utilize such accommodation if it were available. One has to pay an exorbitant price for a Queensland pineapple in Melbourne or Sydney. .Something might be done to sist the growers to make the most of this fruit-growers. important trade, and place this favourite f r u it within the reachof the people. The production of oranges last year was valued at Â£100,636, and I have a statefeel ment here which I would like to have i serted in Hansard, so that people who buy oranges may know that the growers, at all events, are not reaping huge profits. Mr J. H. CATTS - The takes the people down all the time. Mr Mackey.",83
491,Mr MACKAY,COMMITTEE OE PUBLIC,"This is due to faults The growers do not want any g if t , but are willin g to help themselves if only the Government can give them some instrucI notice that the fruit-growers of Victoria are doiug something in the way of cooperation, and .the Queensland people are be now waiting an opportunity to follow in I the same direction. This is a statement by Captain Burrows, a well-known a fruit-grower of Buderim MountainThe expenses incurred in producing a case orange's during 1917 were as follows:Timber, 9d. .per case; nails, packing, and branching, Id. per case; picking, 3d. per case; packing, brushing, grading, and cartage to rail head, 4d. .per case; manuring (on a basis of 20 lbs. of dried blood per tree yielding 8 cases), per case; pruning (allowing 2 hours per tree, at 8s. per day of 8 hours), 2s. per tree, equal to 3d. per case; spraying (1 barrel of sulphur to 100 trees), Â£3 5s.; wages, Â£2 benzine, Is.; together with a further spray io 14s.; a total of Â£11 8s., equal 2s. 3d. per tree, or 3d. per case; cultivation of orchard during the year (minimum statement of 8 days, at 8s. per day, equal to Id . per case) ; tramway freight to railhead, 4d. per case; total cost of production, bedrock stateQueensment, 2s. 6d. per case.

I have seen exactly the same and type of orange heing retailed during this period in Brisbane at 18 fruits to the , I have put the statement in so that I may attention to the price asked for f r u it in Victoria and New South Wales, and show that the growers are not getting big profits. My object is to induce honourable. members to take a little interest in this asimportant matter, and to assist our if only the Government will give the farmers a lead-that is all they asking for-so far as cooperative action is concerned, they will encouraged to go on. The matter is n - important both to growers and consumers, and I hope, therefore, that the Minister for the Navy (Mr Joseph Cook) will take an early opportunity of bringing it before his colleagues, so that something middleman may be done. A slump is threatened in the dairying industry, but the fruit-growing industry will come to the rescue of the Commonwealth, if it receives anything like reasonable encouragement, and become one of the first industries of the Commonwealth.
