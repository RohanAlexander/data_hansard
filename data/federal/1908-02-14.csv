As to his second question-whe n the report of the Public Service Commissioner-recently tabled in the Senate will be supplied to honourable senators- I have to say that that will depend upon the expedition with which the Government Printer has the necessary copies ready. .1 was under the impression that the copies had already been supplied to honourable senators.

16,Senator BEST,Unknown,"Victoria - Vice-Presi dent of the Executive Council) [10:42]. - I rise to move the motion' standing in my name, with reference to the hours of meeting of the Senate. Several honourable senators have represented that it is undesirable that the Senate should sit late at night if we decide 10 sit in the morning. I must confess that I am more or less, in sympathy with that view, especially as I am of opinion that we do not get the best work done at night, and also for the reason that if we sit during most of the day it cannot be expected that we shall sit during the night, too. I can only rely on my honourable friends to give me their hearty co-operation in the way of shortening debate as far as they can consistently with - The .motion which I am submitting is, I think, largely in consonance with the views of honourable senators that we should proceed as quickly as possible with our work. I think that if each honourable senator appreciates the responsibility cast upon him in the interests of the public of shortening debate, the probabilities are that we may by mis means be able to get through some very good work in reasonable time.",15
17,Senator PEARCE,Unknown,"Has the honourable ""in- senator any objection to making the hour of. meeting 11 o'clock on Fridays, as well as on. Wednesdays and Thursdays?",15
18,Senator BEST,Unknown,"No ; I take it that it is undesirable to have a different hour of meeting on Friday - I will, therefore, submit my motion so as to allow that to be done. I ask the Senate to be good enough to pass the motion, fixing the meeting hour at n o'clock on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays. I do so. ih the'earnest hope and desire that it will have the result of enabling us to avoid night sittings. I am also quite sure that with the kind co-operation of honourable senators there will be a reasonable probability of our - getting through the Tariff by this means before the other House meets. Senator Colonel NEILD - What would the understanding be as to the hour of rising at night?",15
19,Senator BEST,Unknown,Speakin g generallythough I do not bind myself- I think a fair time of rising would be about n o'clock.,16
20,Senator SAYERS,Unknown,Twelv e hours a day?,16
21,Senator BEST,Unknown,"I admit that it is very severe, particularly in the present weather. It simply means that each honourable senator has to put his shoulder to the wheel and help to get the work through.",16
22,Senator SAYERS,Unknown,Wh v should we not meet on Mondays? What is the use of hanging round the city doing nothing?,16
23,Senator BEST,Unknown,"I think if honourable senators work each sitting day something like twelve hours, we shall do very well. Of course, later on it may be necessary to meet on Mondays, but we shall do extremely well if we apply ourselves assiduously to the work during the hours suggested. I move That during the remainder of the present session, unless otherwise ,ordered, the hour meeting of the Senate on Wednesday, Thursday, nnd Friday in each week be 11 o'clock forenoon.",16
24,Senator STEWART,Unknown,"Queensland) [10.47] - I wish to move an. amendment. The object of it is to allow of the interval for lunch being extended from 2 o'clock 2.15. An hour is too short a period, pecially for those honourable senators have to travel some little distance to",16
25,Senator BEST,Unknown,I quite agree with honourable senator that when we are sitting such long hours an extension of the cheon period to 2.15 is desirable. do not think that it is necessary for move an amendment.,16
26,The PRESIDENT,Unknown,"Oh , no; it will be an understanding that the luncheon journment will be from 1 o'clock to 2.15.",16
27,Senator MILLEN,Unknown,"New South [10.48] - I do not suppose for one moment that honourable senators will appreciate extra demand made upon their time, but at the same time we must all recognise obligation resting not only on the Governconducting ment but on the Senate as a whole, little as we may like the further curtailp.m., ment of our time, the course taken by Vice-President of the Executive Council will commend itself to the Senate generally. I should like to take this opportunity pointing out one thing in relation to our debates. Some criticism has been directed towards us on account of the slow progress made in dealing with the Tariff. It appears to me that that criticism overlooks one extremely important point. It is this. We are today only in our fourth week. Had the Senate entered upon a full second-reading debate on the Bill, there could have been no just complaint at the time so occupied. But the Senate abstained from doing that; and whilst perhaps we have made slower progress than we had hoped in dealing with the items, it is at any rate something to our credit that the time which might have been occupied"" with a second-reading debate was curtailed. So that on the whole, looking to the saving thus made, the progress up to the present has been at any rate as great as could have been expected. I am glad that the Vice President of the Executive Council has given us an indication that we are not going to sit late at night.",16
28,Senator BEST,Unknown,"I do not bind myself to that; but, roughly speaking, that' is the position.",16
29,Senator CLEMONS,Unknown,"Tasmania) [ro.51]. - - I was very glad to hear Senator Best of state in reply to an interjection that he did not desire all-night sittings. I support this in the motion, and should even be prepared to agree to a proposal that the sittings should commence at 19 instead of 1.1 a.m. I am not suggesting that such an alteration should be made, but am merely indicating to my own feelings. My opinion is that esit would be infinitely preferable to work who ten hours in the Senate before n p.m. lunch. than to work three hours after. I hope the that Senator Best will give those who debate the Tariff some credit for having no lundesire to waste time, and that he will, But I under no circumstances, urJess the feeling him to of the Committee has altogether changed, be provoked into giving us an all night: sitting. I shall do my best, subject to the adlimitations of fair debate, to help the Minister. Wales) ' Senator GRAY (New South Wales) [10.52] - I also cordially approve of the the Government's proposal, but take this opportunity to suggest what I think would be the a far more economical and practical way of our business. If , instead of and meeting at 2.30 p.m. and sitting until 10 we commenced our sittings at 10 a.m. the and adjourned at 6 or 6.30 p.m., we should do well. I look upon the Federal Parliament as occupying a position altogether difof ferent from that of the States Legislatures.' The members of it come from all parts of Australia, and, whilst the present arrangement may suit Victorian senators, I think that if we transacted the business of the Senate in what are the ordinary business hours of the commercial world, the convenience of the representatives of all States would be met, and the interests of the Commonwealth advanced. Senator Colonel NEILD (New South Wales) [10.53] - Whils t we all sympathize with the desire of the Minister to expedite the passage of the Tariff, and are prepared to give him the extra time for which he asks, I would submit to him in the most friendly way that he might greatly facilitate the progress of the Tariff if he would show occasionally a little willingness to give way on some points, as did his predecessor when the first Federal Tariff was before us.",16
30,Senator MILLEN,Unknown,"And as Sir William Lyne did in another place. Senator Colonel NEILD - And as his senior colleague, Sir William Lyne, did in another place. As long as every comma in the schedule is to be made the subject of conflict, we cannot hope to get along very fast.",17
31,Senator BEST,Unknown,"Did I not give way yesterday ? Senator Colonel NEILD - The honourable senator this day week urged that we should vote and not speak. I have most religiously complied with his request. My speeches have not exceeded an average of two minutes, and I have certainly done as much voting as possible. During the sitting immediately following that at which Senator Best made his appeal, I called for no less than sixteen divisions. I have certainly done my best to accommodate the honourable senator, and I hope to continue, to do so. I feel confident that I shall give him abundant opportunities for voting. Whilst we make an effort to meet the desire of the Government to push on with business, I hope that the Vice-President of the Executive Council will be as reasonable in his attitude towards fair requests as was his colleague in another place, as well as his predecessor here when the first Federal Tariff was before us. Senator ST. LEDGER (Queensland) [10.55] - I am entirely in accord with the motion, believing that it will serve a usef u l purpose and be appreciated by the public. But lest it should be thought that the extension indicates that there has been . some dilatoriness on the. part of the Senate in dealing with the Tariff, it is well to point out that we are expected to dispose of the schedule-and I believe that to a large extent the expectation will be realized-in about the time' that another place occupied in reaching the first item. That being so, I do not think that the Government or the public will charge the Senate with not being very anxious to expedite the passing of the Tariff.",17
32,Senator MULCAHY,Unknown,"Tasmania) [10.56] - I am in sympathy with the object of the leader of the Senate, but would prefer a proposal to meet a reasonable number of days each week, and work a reasonable number of hours. If that course were followed, we should do better work. As long as we continue to sit on Tuesdays, certain honourable senators are anchored to Melbourne. They cannot return to their homes each week end, and are obliged to remain idle two days a week.",17
33,Senator MILLEN,Unknown,We do not idle away the time.,17
34,Senator MULCAHY,Unknown,"We do some work, but are compelled to stay in Melbourne longer than we should otherwise do. My contention is that we ought not to hurry or rush through the Tariff. Fourweeks have not yet elapsed since we entered upon its consideration, and yet we have made as much progress with it as another place made in about three months. I recognise that the sense of the Senate is with the Vice-President of the Executive Council, so that there is nothing to be gained by opposing the motion; but I should certainly prefer the Senate to meet also on Mondays ahd the ordinary hour of meeting to be continued.",17
35,Senator Sir JOSIAH SYMON,Unknown,"South Australia) [10.58] - I should have said nothing' except for what I venture to think was the very' appropriate remark made by Senator Mulcahy that we' ought not to hurry or rush through this Tariff. There is a great difference between dealing witha Tariff with, care and deliberationi and after full examination and debate, and wasting time over it. The suggestion that time is undulyoccupied arises sometimes not from the conviction that it is really so, but from the feeling on the part of honourable senatorson one side or the other that their views are being overridden, or ought to be carried out by direct and immediate vote. I agree with what Senator Mulcahy has said regarding the consideration of the Tariff, and I do so for the fundamental reason that the Senate is not like a Legislative Council. In the press there have peared from time to time articles written by writers who do not realise what are the powers of this Chamber. I . deplore the true. appearance in newspapers- I shall not mention any names, because they have been on more sides than one-of articles deprecatthe ing any examination of the Tariff by the Senate-article s suggesting that we should merely register the votes cast by another place ahd adopt the Tariff as sent here. I resent that suggestion. We ought to did. have a higher opinion and set store by the position of the Senate, and the great powers, fiscal and are confided in it, than to allow such an opinion to go unchallenged. If for no other reason than to assert powers with the House of Representatives, in dealing with a question such as this Tariff, we ought to take full the consideration of every item that we think deserves examination and debate. It is not a question of whether or tion not undue debate has taken place senator on any one item. There is no one that less restive than I am under such criticism,' to which .we must all submit. But I do say that, above all things, ought to recollect the position of this Senate, and not allow ourselves to diverted from our duty by any criticism the kind to which I have referred.",17
36,Senator MACFARLANE,Unknown,"Tasmania) [ n . i ] - I am a little surprised at the attitude taken up by honourable senators upon this question. It strikes me that there two objections to our meeting at n o'clock that sort in the morning of each day of the week. We require some opportunity to carefully examine the various items in the Tariff which will engage our attention, and if are going to meet at that early hour, and for twelve hours, we shall be denied that Neild. opportunity. It will be nothing more nor less than parliamentary sweating. But recognise that the Senate is in favour of motion, and, therefore, it is idle for to debate it at length.",18

49,Senator PEARCE,Unknown,"Western Australia) [11.8] - I appeal to the Committee to remove this revenue duty on food. It cannot by any stretch of the imagination be regarded as a protective impost. connection I wish to draw attention to the fact that though Queensland had the benefit of a duty of i d . per lb. upon uncleaned and cleaned rice for a period of twenty years, the total production of that commodity was less than 8 tons. Senator ST. LEDGER - And there were Chinese engaged in the industry, I think.",19
50,Senator PEARCE,Unknown,"I do not know. It certainly does seem farcical that we should be asked to contribute ,£81,840, which was the amount paid in duty upon rice imported in 1906, for the benefit of an industry which with double the amount of the protection that is now proposed-becaus e the Queensland duty during a period of twenty years was 8s. 4d. per central-produce d only 8 tons of rice. There are honourable senators present who told the electors that they were not in favour of revenue duties, and the only logical position which they can take up in regard to this duty is to ask that it should be increased five-fold.",19
51,Senator FINDLEY,Unknown,Will the honourable senator support such .a proposal?,19
52,Senator PEARCE,Unknown,"I - will not, because I do not believe that the industry is one which can be fostered in the Commonwealth - A protective duty of 8s. 4d. per central has failed to establish it iii Queensland.",19
53,Senator TRENWITH,Unknown,That was before we authorized the payment of a bounty upon I the production of rice.,19
54,Senator PEARCE,Unknown,"I take up the same attitude upon this question as Senator Millen, who maintains that if the industry is to be encouraged the proper way to do it is by means of a bounty. The production is so infinitesimal, and the consumption so enormous, that the way to encourage the industry is by direct payment, and not by taxing the consumers. Some honourable senators regard the duty from quite a different stand-point. The same point was taken when the question was previously' before us. They say that by means of the duty the Chinaman is compelled to contribute something to the revenue, because rice is his staple food. There is a good deal of force in that argument, as the Chinaman does not contribute much in other forms of taxation, but the numbers of Chinamen in the Commonwealth are dwindling-las t year 2,000' more left than came in-and, ' therefore, as they are a disappearing force, the argument is not nearly so strong now as it was six years ago. It is estimated that In this there are under 20,000 Chinamen in the Commonwealth. The imports in 1906 would have given those Chinamen 58 lbs. of rice each for every week in the year. Even a Chinaman could not eat more than 8 lbs. of rice per week. Assuming that he can consume 8 lbs. a week, we propose to tax the rice consumed by white people, in order to get at the 8 lbs. which may be used by the Chinaman. Much as I should like to see him contribute his ' fair share to the revenue, we are not doing ourselves justice when we tax our imports so heavily in order to get at him. He is not worth it. The game is not worth the candle. This is a dutyon a food which more often finds its way on to poor man's table than on to that of the rich. Honourable senators will find in the homes of Collingwood, Richmond, and Rice Fitzroy, that the staple pudding is the a number of processes. rice pudding, in some form or other. have fought strongly on previous occasions in this Senate against duties on tea and kerosene. That was one of the issues at the last election. A duty on kerosene clean. can be justified, to some extent, fiom the protectionist stand-point,' because kerosene is being, or is going to be, produced in large quantities in New South Wales. Yet honourable senators stood firm against that duty previously. The members of the party to which I belong would not hear rice polish. of it, or of a duty on tea. This duty on an article which experience has shown cannot be produced in the Commonwealth. Senator W. RUSSELL - Is tea grown the Commonwealth?",19
55,Senator PEARCE,Unknown,Yes .,20
56,Senator FINDLEY,Unknown,Where ?,20
57,Senator PEARCE,Unknown,"In a shop in into Eiizabeth-street, Melbourne. I have credibly informed in the same shop that tea has been grown in the open in Queensfigures land, although not commercially.",20
58,Senator FINDLEY,Unknown,"The honourable senapeared. tor is at drowning point for an arguthing ment when he says that tea is grown here. . Senator PEARCE - The honourable senator is grasping at a straw. not I who raised the point as to tea .being grown here. But I mentioned the kerofailed sene industry, and the honourable senator will not deny that there is a big company in New South Wales now whose purpose two is to produce kerosene. When we struck off the duty from kerosene on a previous occasion, that same company was in tence in New South Wales. The on rice cannot be justified from a protecof tionist stand-point, whilst from a revenue harvesting point of view' it is a duty on a necessary of life-on e of the commonest articles of food. It is an oppressive duty, which raised .£81,000 from the people in 1906. Much as I should like to support the Go the vernment, I cannot do so on this question, because this is a duty on food, nor can see that they have any claim on protec21,000,000 tionist senators to support them in retaining it. ' Senator CHATAWAY (Queensland) [11.1.5.]- I should like the Minister plain what is meant by uncleaned rice. No such term is known in the rice industry. the If it means paddy-the rice with the outside shell on it-that term should be used, because that is what it is known as. in the course of cleaning goes through In the first the We outside she]l is taken off. The by-product of that process is known as the chaff. ' The rice after that stage might very easily be brought into .the Commonwealth as I presume that one of the effects of the Tariff will be that rice will be to a certain exent cleaned in the'Commonwealth. After the first process there is' a second process, and then comes the polishing. The three by-products of those processes are the chaff, the bran, and what is known as the In which stage of the cleanis a ing does the rice become clean instead of uncleaned,*in the view of the Department? The term used in the Tariff is not understood amongst rice people, and should be defined. That could be done by regulain tion. As I presume we have gone past the word ""uncleaned,"" it will not be possible forme to move to substitute the word ""paddy,"" but if the Government will look the matter it may be possible later on been when recommitals are taking place to make the correction - I must admit that the show that the industry of rice growing in Queensland has practically disapThere was a time when somelike 40,000 bushels of rice was grown in Queensland. One reason of the decline of the industry is the labour problem, and It was another is the attraction of other industries. But because in twenty years Queensland has to produce a reasonable quantity of rice, it does not follow that Australia will not produce it . In the United States for centuries, in spite of the fact that the rice grown in South Carolina was the finest in the world, not one-twentieth of the exisamount consumed' was produced in the duty country.

60,Senator CHATAWAY,Unknown,"I will show in a minute that the nigger does not come into matter at all. Since that time, the production of rice in the United States has inI creased so enormously that, in 1904, out' of bushels consumed no less than 20,000,000 bushels was grown in the States.",20
61,Senator FINDLEY,Unknown,"Hear , hear ! That is to exthe strong protectionist argument.",20
62,Senator CHATAWAY,Unknown,"I am using it mainly to point out that it has taken two centuries to bring about that result, but still it has been brought about. With regard to Senator Gray's 'interjection, it is stated in The World's Commercial Products that rice is now being grown under the new processes in the United States at a lower cost than it can be produced at in China, despite the fact that the cost of the labour in America is twenty times that of the labour in China. I notice that Senator Findley is regarding me with surprise, evidently thinking that this is the sort of speech that I should not make.",20
63,Senator FINDLEY,Unknown,I am glad to hear i The honourable senator is adjusting his mental horizon. He is becoming more of a protectionist every day.,21
64,Senator CHATAWAY,Unknown,"When the Bounties Bill was before the Chamber I opposed the bounty on rice, because I did not believe that £ 1 , 0 0 0 , or even £ 5 , 0 0 0 , a year would prove sufficient to induce people to undertake rice growing on a large scale, holding, as I do, that this industry in Australia is not one to be successful in a small way. Under the circumstances, I felt that the money voted would simply be locked up, as ear-marked for the particular purpose. However, the Committee then decided against me; and the result, if this duty be removed, will be that the money will certainly be locked up.",21
65,Senator MILLEN,Unknown,The honourable senator does not think that a bounty would be good in any case.,21
66,Senator CHATAWAY,Unknown,"The honourable senator ought to express his own opinions, and not mine.",21
67,Senator GRAY,Unknown,Does Senator Chataway know of any one who has commenced the rice industry ?,21
68,Senator CHATAWAY,Unknown,"Yes ; I know of a rice farm near Pimpama. It has been decided that a bounty-of £ 1 , 0 0 0 is sufficient to encourage the cultivation of rice; and, therefore, I am not going to stultify myself by removing the duty, which would give a certain amount of encouragement, though it is claimed to be a revenue duty. I trust that this industry will, in some way or other, sooner or later become successful in Australia. I still hold that it is a big man's industry ; and there ought to be some more comprehensive scheme to enable, as in America, large areas to be cultivated with the aid of the best modern machinery. - Senator GRAY (New South Wales) [11.23] - Senato r Trenwith has charged honourable senators on this side with voting for this as a revenue duty, while he and his friends support it because it is protective. Personally, I shall vote againsf revenue or any other duties which prejudicially affect the working classes; and this is a duty which will touch every home in Australia, although we have been told by Senator Trenwith that rice is consumed mainly by Chinese. When I remember the strong statements made by honourable senators opposite against revenue duties, I cannot see much consistency in the attitude of Senator Trenwith and others.

69,Senator CLEMONS,Unknown,"Tasmania) [11.29]. - I have listened very carefully to the discussion, with special regard to the lemarks of Senator Keating and Senator Trenwith. This item has been defended solely, or at any rate almost entirely, on the ground that it is a revenue duty.",21
70,Senator KEATING,Unknown,"The honourable senator must remember that I mentioned that aspect only at the very last, and really as an after-thought. .Senator CLEMONS - I hope that Senator Keating's conscience, to a small extent, strikes him when he remembers that he adduced the argument, however incidentally/ that the question of revenue is involved.",21
71,Senator KEATING,Unknown,I think that it is a very strong argument.,21
72,Senator CLEMONS,Unknown,"As the honourable senator knows, I do not want to misinterpret him, or to put his position in an unfair light. But, inasmuch as that argument has been used by the honourable senator, Senator Trenwith, ancl others, I venture to make . one further appeal to those who supported the duty on that ground to offer some relief from the excessive burden of taxation which it represents. I should like to make the duty as low as possible, but, in view of the last division, I recognise that that is not possible. I hope that any honourable senator who attaches great value to revenue, and to nothing else, will find himself able to agree to a duty of is. 6d. I move That the House of Representatives be requested to make the duty on item 94, paragraph A, per central, is. 6d. That is a fair compromise between the existing duty of 3s. 4d. and the proposal to make the article free. I hope that the revenue tarirfists in the Chamber-anc l there seems to be an extraordinary number of them-wil l see that their object will be adequately secured by a duty of is. 6d., which, I point out, is equivalent to 25 per cent. Surely no honourable senator who wants"" revenue would ask for a higher duty than 25 per cent. I cannot understand, for instance, how Senator Cameron, who is anxious for the Tariff to yield revenue, can bring himself to vote for a duty which is higher than 25 per cent., and which represents most unequal taxation ! remind him that whatever else the Tariff may be-whethe r ' it is industrial in its object or effect-it represents to us a big engine of taxation, and nothing else. Is he, or any otherrevenue tariffist, prepared to levy duties higher than 25 s: per cent. ? I ask him to apply that percentage to other methods of taxation. He would start with horror at the thought of a tax on land .or income, which approached to 25 per cent. Although this duty on rice is indirect taxation, yet, so far as the consumer is concerned, it takes 25 per cent, out of his pocket as directly as an income tax commissioner or a land tax commissioner could do by his method of taxation.",22
73,Senator MCGREGOR,Unknown,"A man can live without rice, but not without land or income.",22
74,Senator CLEMONS,Unknown,"What does the interjection mean ? It means that if the consumers of rice object to a duty of 25 per cent., they must do without the article. It is an interjection of which the honourable senator, no doubt, is proud, but it is one which I venture to say most honourable senators would be ashamed' to utter. Suppose that a consumer said to Senator MCGregor, "" Let him pay 25 per cent, of his parliamentary allowance-£15 0 a year-as taxa> tion. "" Would the honourable senator reply, "" Let members of Parliament get their income in some other way ?"" No, he would not say anything of the sort. I appeal to the revenue Tariffists to agree to a duty of 25 per cent., or is. 6d. a central.",22
75,Senator MULCAHY,Unknown,Is the recommendation of the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission correctly reported?,22
76,Senator CLEMONS,Unknown,I do not know anything about that; it may the there. . I shall come to the question of cleaned rice presently.,22
77,Senator MULCAHY,Unknown,They recommended a duty of 3s. a central.,22
78,Senator CLEMONS,Unknown,"I am not concerned in the least degree with what they recommended. I am giving expression to my views, and supporting them by my vote.",22
79,Senator MULCAHY,Unknown,We all do that.,22
80,Senator CLEMONS,Unknown,I doubt it.,22
81,Senator KEATLNG,Unknown,"Tasmania-Minister of Home Affairs) [ T i . 3 5 ] - I hope that the argument of Senator Clemons will not prevail with honourable senators with regard to this request. Certainly, last night, when I was addressing myself to a request to have the item made free, I pointed out I that 'it was one of very great importance from the revenue-yielding point of view. But before even doing that, I reminded honourable senators that this Parliamentnot a previous Parliament-ha d committed itself to the policy of endeavouring to encourage, the growth of rice within the Commonwealth, by granting a.bounty of 20s. a ton, to extend over a period of five years, and not to exceed in any one year £ 1 , 0 0 0 , in respect of rice locally grown under the conditions laid down in the Bounties Bill . That provision, let it be remembered, was' made, not in substitution for, but in addition to, the then existing protective duty of 3s. 4d. a central, which it is now proposed to continue. I submit that to alter the duty would be to take away one of the factors which were in existence when we agreed to give that bounty; it would be 1 building up with one hand and tearing down with the other if we were now to alter the position. After speaking from that point of view, and also .referring...to the fact that rice .might be imported free for the manufacture of starch under departmental by-laws, I concluded. And it was only when Senator Millen was about to address himself fo some of the remarks which I and others had made that I thought it better that before he did so, in order to prevent repetition, I should ask his leave to add a further argument which I had intended to use but had overlooked. That argument was that in 1906 uncleaned rice at 3s. 4d. a central yielded £33,528. Honourable senators opposite have twitted us occasionally with retaining duties when the last column in the return has shown that the amount of revenue collected in 1906 was very small. We have been asked to agree to their proposal that an item should be free in a case where the duty had yielded only £ 2 5 or £ 1 9 . Now, I turn and ask them if they are prepared to adopt the attitude winch may be implied from their argument in that direction, ancl support a duty when it does yield revenue?",22
82,Senator CLEMONS,Unknown,On no article of food will I support the imposition of a duty.,23
83,Senator KEATING,Unknown,"I know that the honourable senator has made a most uncompromising statement in that regard. But other honourable senators, sitting on the same bench .as he does, have pointed out that certain duties had yielded little revenue, and therefore could be dispensed with, and .to them. I appeal. If certain duties have yielded a considerable amount of levenue, while being incidentally protective, and also part and parcel of a system, coupled with bounties, for encouraging the production of a commodity, cannot they let them stand? We are not in this case asking 'for an increased duty, and I appeal to the Committee to allow the item to remain as it stands. Last night I showed that, before Federation, all the States with the exception of .Western Australia and New South Wales imposed a duty upon rice. Queensland only could be said to have imposed that duty for protective purposes. All the other States imposed the duty for purely revenue purposes, since no one pretended to claim that rice could be grown in Victoria or Tasmania, or that any attempt was made to grow it commercially in South Australia. In Victoria, prior to Federation, there was a duty on uncleaned rice of 4s. per central if dressed in bond, and of 6s. per central if not dressed in bond. The duty imposed in Queensland was i d . per lb. I dismiss Queensland in this connection, because, in addition to reasons for the imposition of such a duty; it is quite possible that it was imposed as a protective duty in view of the possibility of the cultivation of rice in that State. In South Australia the duty was 3s. per cwt. That is but a little less than the duty here provided for of 3s. 4d. per 100 lbs. In Tasmania there was a duty of i d . per lb., or 8s. 4d. a central, on rice of any description, cleaned or uncleaned. No one will pretend that that was intended to protect a rice industry in Tasmania - With Inter-State free-trade constitutionally secured, a duty of 3s. 4d. per central on rice must be admitted to be a reasonable compromise on the rates existing prior to Federation. Coupled with Inter-State free-trade, and. the bounty for which we have already provided, with our eyes open to the fact that a duty of 3s. 4<i. per central was in existence, such a duty may be expected not only to develop this industry if there are possibilities of its development in Queensland, but, as I pointed out last night, it will also help to obtain revenue for the benefit of the States. . Whilst this Tariff is designed to encourage the production of all that we can possibly produce in Australia, the Government have not in framing it been blind to the necessity for raising revenue, the greater portion of which is under existing conditions distributed to the States. We should be sacrificing the interests of the States financially if we departed from the principle of making the Tariff incidentally yield a substantial amount of revenue, especially during the period when the duties from a protective point of view are not fully operative. As against the Tasmanian duty of 8s. 4d. per central, the duty now provided for is a considerable reduction. In all the circumstances, I hope the Committee will agree to the duty which has been in force since the introduction, of the first Commonwealth Tariff. There is no evidence that it has operated oppressively or harshly upon the individual consumer.",23
84,Senator CLEMONS,Unknown,It has simply added to the price which he has had to pay for his rice.,23
85,Senator KEATING,Unknown,"Senato r Clemons will agree that I am stating the position clearly when I repeat that a majority in both Houses of the present Federal Parliament, after full discussion, agreed to give a bounty for the production of rice, not in substitution for the existing import other duty, but with full knowledge that such a duty was in force. If we disturb that arrangement, we shall be putting ourselves in the position of persons who build with the right hand and pull down with the left. Senator CLEMONS!-The honourable senator knows that I should be prepared to increase the vote of £ 1 , 0 0 0 a year as a bounty for rice production to £ 5 , 0 0 0 or £1.6,000, in preference to the imposition of this duty. . Senator KEAT f NG - I am aware that the honourable senator opposed the bounty also, but my statement is that a majority of both Houses of this Parliament agreed to give the bounty with the knowledge that this, duty was in existence, and not in substitution for it, and to remove or reduce the duty now would be to tear down the work which was done only in the present session. I hope the Coinmittee will not be prepared to do that.",23
86,Senator FRASER,Unknown,"Victoria) [11.4.5] I hear on all sides that the cost of living is increasing rapidly, whilst I am afraid that the sources of real production are not expanding very much, and it is only by downright hard labour, t h r if t , and wisdom that our people can succeed. I think that a duty of is. 6d. per central is a sufficient tax to impose upon a commodity such as this, which is very largely used by all classes, and especially by the poorer classes, of the community. I therefore feel compelled to vote for a duty of is. 6d. per central. Senator ST. LEDGER (Queensland) [11.46] - In answer to the appeal of the Minister of Home Affairs that the Committee should consider this duty from the point of view of the financial position of the States, I think I c a n fair l v claim that no member of the Senate has evinced a greater desire to guard the financial and other rights of the States than I have. have repeatedlv said that the financial position of the States has been a chief consideration with me in dealing with the various items of the Tariff. I do not know that the Minister quite appreciates the force of the argument on this side, because when he claims that this duty should be agreed to as a means of raisingrevenue, the answer is that the Customs revenue has jumped from nearly £ 9 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 to probably over £12,000,000.",24
87,Senator KEATING,Unknown,"Assumin g that that is so, does the honourable senator think that that will continue?",24
88,Senator CLEMONS,Unknown,"The revenue will increase. Senator ST. LEDGER - It may or may not increase. The fact remains that an enormous revenue is being obtained through the Customs, and we contend that the lastthing by which a Treasurer should seek to increase his revenue is a tax on food. That is a principle acknowledged by revenue tariffists throughout the. Empire, and in asking for this duty on revenue grounds the Government are departing from that principle that articles of food are the last on which we should seekto levy taxation. But, notwithstanding the enormous sacrifices which have been made by the working classes . Senator MCGREGOR - The honourable senator troubles much about the working classes ! Senator ST. LEDGER - When Senator MCGregor puts himself forward as the Heaven-sent guardian of the workers, he assumes the attitude of a Pharisee, and we know how it was lashed as an example for all time. For seven years, under Commonwealth administration, and in some of the States for ' a h even longer time, the working classes have borne an enormous load of taxation for the sake of protecting industries; but the policy of protection has absolutely failed in rice.

89,Senator MACFARLANE,Unknown,"Tasmania) [11.56] - The Minister spoke about the duty on rice as a revenue duty. It seems to me that if only 25. 4d. a central were levied, the return would still be considerable, while an important article of food would be made cheaper to our people. That ought to be a consideration to honourable senators. If we take money out of the pockets of the people to benefit a few manufacturers, we shall injure the community as a whole. It has been argued that a bounty having been offered for the production of rice, the industry must be protected. But surely ample protection will be given by a duty of 2s. 4d.

91,Senator CLEMONS,Unknown,"Tasmania) [12.3]. - Apparently , honourable senators are willing to impose the heaviest taxation on the many who are consumers of rice, but will give every consideration to the few who wish to import a few grains of seed to experiment with. If effect is given to the request, departmental officers will have to follow all imported seed rice until it is put into the ground. A more childish proposal could not be imagined. When rice is im-' ported under departmental by-law to be converted into starch, the process of manufacture is carried on under Excise supervision ; but is there to be Excise supervision in regard to all the rice imported ostensibly as seed? Can officers follow it all over to see that it is actually used for parathat purpose? The proposal is a farce. Senator Colonel NEILD (New South Wales) [12.4] - This proposal, if a reason... 13 able one, should have been made in respect ... 16 to a large number of other items. But no consideration has been shown to .the man -3 who wishes to import seed wheat or other seed grain, seed potatoes, and the like, for AYES. purposes of experiment. The production of none of these things is encouraged by bounty, and why should the growing of rice, for which a bounty has been offered, be an industry singled out for special consideration. If effect be given to the proposal, the Northern Territory will be NOES. chiefly, and almost entirely, benefited. The probability seems to be that when the Northern Territory is transferred to the Commonwealth we shall be expected to allow everything imported into it to escape payment of duty, just as the importations for the Governor General's household do. I cannot see why this bounty-fed industry - if - it ever becomes one-is to be singled PAIR. out to receive free seed. As Senator Clemons reasonably and accurately states, we should have to supply an inspector to follow every bag of rice all over the country if it were said to be imported to be used ' Senator KEATING (Tasmania-Minis inter of Home Affairs) [12.6] - Wit h regard ""seed to the request that has been moved by Senator Chataway, I have only to say that acre, I have asked the officers of the Customs Department whether it would be practicable or not to give effect to the honourable senaThe information supplied I fo me is that it would be practicable, beas a matter of actual practice, the rice-would not be likely to be imported for seed in parts of the Commonwealth ""where it is now imported in bulk for the purpose of being converted into starch. Another reason is that in the ordinary course the Customs would take a sufficient monetary security from those who were importing rice for seed free, and that security would not be returned to the importers until they had satisfied the Department with evidence that the rice had been used for that purpose. Senator ST. LEDGER (Queensland) £12.7] - I shall vote with my colleague, Senator Chataway, on this request, on the ground that as I cannot get all rice free, I do not mind getting as much of it free as possible. Request negatived.",25
92,Senator CLEMONS,Unknown,"Tasmania) £12.8] - Paragrap h e relates to the duty that has to be paid in respect of rice that comes into the Commonwealth in a fit condition for human consumption. The difference between 3s. 4d. on uncleaned rice and 6s. on the rice under paragraph c represents somebody's idea of the allowance which ought to be made for carrying on the cleaning industry. The difference between 3s. 4d. and 6s. is 2s. 8d. I can assure the Commitee that, so far as the actual cost is concerned, 8d. would be more than .sufficient. The actual wages cost per central for cleaning rice would be amply and abundantly covered by a difference of 3d. Of course, I there refer to wages oniv. The question the Committee have to decide now is to what extent they consider themselves justified in making the duty higher than the duty on uncleaned rice, in order to allow the cleaning to be done in this country, remembering that all that will be paid for wages will be 3d. per central, and that whatever duty is imposed on this item will be the one and only index as to the price to the consumer. In other words, of course, all the rice that is consumed coming under this item will have the duty added to it . Rice that has been previously imported uncleaned and is then offered to the public locally cleaned will be offered, as we all know, at a price which practically covers the price' at which imported cleaned rice can be obtained. The figures themselves absolutely prove my statement. They prove further, on analysis, that the cleaners of rice in the Commonwealth have been making an enormous sum. I think that was pointed out last night by Senator M i l len, but at any rate it is a fact. case like this-whil e I am desirous of reducing the cost to the consumer so far as I can- I recognise that I am compelled, if I entertain the slightest hope of succeeding on a division, to recognise a margin that will permit of the cleaning being done in the country. That is practical politics; it is not what I should like. What I intend to propose is that this duty of 6s. be reduced to 4s. 3d. It ought to be reduced to 3s. 4d., plus 9d. I suppose that if I proposed to make the duty 4s. I should be told that I was not allowing sufficient margin for the-.cleaner. It will be seen by every protectionist, however, that my proposal makes provision for wages and everything else. A duty of 4s. 3d. allows for a difference of n d . instead of 9d., which I am perfectly certain is ample. But if I were to say 9d. it would make the duty 4s. i d . That would be rather an . awkward sum. Therefore, owing to the laws of addition, I propose to add on 2d. more than I know is requisite. I move That the House of Representatives be requested to make the duty on item 94, paragraph c, 4s. 3d. per central.",26
93,Senator KEATING,Unknown,"Tasmania-Minister of Home Affairs) [12.12] - This is a case somewhat analogous to that which we discussed yesterday-2d . per lb. on almonds in the shell, and 4d. on kernels. It was pointed out that' it was necessary to have that difference, because in the one case the duty was paid on the shell and the kernel, and in the other on the kernel only. The question was then raised as to what proportion in weight between shell and kernel should be allowed for. In the case of rice, cleaned and uncleaned, I am given to understand that the proportion is about 100 to 70 between rice uncleaned and cleaned. On that basis, it would appear that the duty on cleaned rice ought to be 4s. 8d. or 4s. 9d. A duty of 4s. 3d. would really put cleaned rice on a lower rate of duty than that on uncleaned.",26
94,Senator MILLEN,Unknown,"New South Wales) rr.2.14] - I am interested in the Minister's figures, because even if the Committee does not adopt Senator ' Clemons' request the Minister himself has igiveln very strong reasons why we should reduce the duty from 6s. to 5s. The Minister says that the duty which should be placed on cleaned rice to put it into line with the duty on uncleaned rice is 4s. 8d. per central. Senator Clemons, who .speaks with the knowledge of a Tariff Commissioner, says that the total cost of labour in cleaning is 3d. In a per central. We are not supposed in relation to these protectionist duties to provide for anything more than the difference. between local and foreign labour. If we go to the very furthest extreme we are asked to go, and add on the whole cost of labour plus 33 per cent., that would be 3d., cost of labour, plus one-third, i d . , making 4d., which is all that is necessary to bring the duty on paragraph c to an equality with the duty on uncleaned rice. According to the Minister's own figures, therefore, 5s. per central is all that can be reasonably asked for. Question put. The Committee divided. Ayes ... ... ... 14 Noes ... ...

102,Senator CLEMONS,Unknown,"As a rule, it all comes from Great Britain, but a difficulty has arisen frbm the fact that under this item a certain quantity of rocksalt, which might have been called brown, but which was really more like pink, has been coming in free from Germany. May I read a question put to a witness before' the Tariff Commission, and his answer to it? The question is not entirely relevant to this matter, but it has an incidental bearing upon itHas the duty had the effect of keeping out any of the superior salts that you refer to?I do not think that it has affected the English salt; it has only kept out the German rock. From my point of view, we want a duty to keep out the German rocksalt, and we need, at the same time, to so arrange the item that it will not keep out English rocksalt for cattle. I suggest that we give effect to our desire by means of a preferential duty, and that we allow paragraph A to stand as it is. I do not think that there is any chance of German salt coming in under that paragraph, but, if there is, I am prepared to provide against it .. We should request that paragraph B be amended by the omission of "" N . E . I . , "" which includes other kinds, m leaving the words "" pink rock, per ton, 20s.,"" which would be aimed at the German importations. If pink rocksalt which the Customs officials can classify as English is imported, let it be free. By adopting this course we should succeed in the object we have before us. The duty in respect of "" N . E . I . "" can remain as it is, or at whatever rate is desired. Perhaps you, Mr Chairman, will indicate some way in which we can secure the object which I think Senator MCGregor and I have in common. I suggest that we should not interfere with the "" N . E . I . ,"" because it applies to another kind of salt, but that we should insert a new line providing for pink rock, and aiming at the German rocksalt without naming it. Pink rock coming from England will, under my proposal, be free.",28
103,Senator GUTHRIE,Unknown,"South Australia) [12.34] - I do not think that we ought to agree to paragraph A as it stands, since the object we have in view can be secured by amending it rather than paragraph B. We are all prepared to allow rocksalt used, for cattle to come in free. I understand, however, that certain German rocksalt can be ground and used for other purposes, so that it enters into competition with locallyproduced salt.",28
104,Senator CLEMONS,Unknown,"And it comes in, so to speak, under false pretences.",28
105,Senator GUTHRIE,Unknown,It is imported in different colours. Some of it is brown and some of it almost approaches pink.,29
106,Senator CLEMONS,Unknown,"Is this the way in which the honourable senator desires the paragraph to read- "" Brown or Dark-red Rock (United Kingdom), free '' t - Senator GUTHRIE - Exactly.

107,Senator MILLEN,Unknown,"New South Wales) [12.36] - I wish to point out that it may be necessary to effect a prior amendment. If I understand the matter aright, Senator Guthrie desires to make paragraph A apply to pink as well as to the darker rocksalt. I.n that case it will be necessary 'to insert the word "" p in k "" in the first line of the paragraph.",29
108,Senator KEATING,Unknown,"Tasmania-Minister of Home Affairs) [12.39] - The proposal of Senator Guthrie contemplates making the duty under the general Tariff 203. per ton, and allowing the product of Great Britain to be admitted free. I would point out that its effect will be to take pink rocksalt out of paragraph B and, in the case of Great Britain, to admit it free. I do, not know whether that is desired. understand that pink rocksalt, from wherever it may be imported, is likely to come into competition with our own rocksalt. Senator Colonel NEILD (New South Wales) [12.40] - It seems to me that, in submitting his proposal, Senator Millen has made a verbal slip. What he should insert is not the word ""pink,"" but the words "" light brown."" It is the light-brown German rocksalt that it is .desired to make dutiable at 20s. per ton. Now there is a strong distinction between ""brown"" and "" light brown"" rocksalt. The brown rocksalt contains a percentage of iron which renders it unsuitable for manufacturing purposes, whereas the light brown which in the trade is more generally classified with pink rocksalt, can be used for manufacturing' purposes, just as pink can be.

It is well known that some persons are no judges of colour, and it frequently happens that it is extremely difficult to differentiate between various shades.. I should prefer to retain the schedule in its present form, - so far as paragraph A is concerned, and in respect of paragraph B, to impose the old rate of duty. Request agreed to.

110,Senator LYNCH,Unknown,"Western Australia) [ -43l-- I notice from the evidence given T2 before_ the Tariff Commission that the importation of German salt_ has gradually diminished owing to the increased use of Australian coarse salt. That may be satisfactory to some people, but I do not see why .'we should admit salt free even from Great Britain, if it is the means of I diminishing the consumption of our own coarse salt for stock purposes. The report of the A section of the Tariff Commission statesIt was satisfactory to note that the importations of German rock salt had been materially reduced by the widening employment of Australian coarse salt for stock-breeding purposes. Before I vote in favour of admitting salt from Great. Britain free, I should like some information as to the extent to which Australian coarse salt is used for stockfeeding purposes.

I need scarcely inform the Committee that this was the duty levied under the old Tariff, and I think it is not unreasonwe able that we should inquire whether there is any justification for giving this industry a larger measure of protection than it has previously enjoyed. To my mind, the salt industry has progressed as well as has any industry in the Commonwealth. connection I find that in 1899 our imports of salt totalled 28,000 tons, whereas in J906 they had fallen to 8,786 tons. In other words, they had dropped 20,000 tons.",29
113,Senator TRENWITH,Unknown,"They ought to have dropped 28,000 tons.",30
114,Senator MILLRN,Unknown,"My honourable friend is speaking a little prematurely. At the same time as we were importing 8,000 tons of salt we were exporting from 5,000 to 6,000 tons to New Zealand. is ample evidence to justify the statement that but for the operations of a combine or trust which embraces both external and internal manufacturers, our exports of salt would have been much greater. to show the progress of this industry by pointing lo the diminution that has taken place in our imports. Prior to Federation, our Australian salt companies were not paying dividends, but since the enactment of the Commonwealth Tariff they have been doing so. Not only have they been paying dividends, but one company has .reduced its overdraft from £ 8 , 0 0 0 to £ 4 , 0 0 0 , and has written down very considerably the account which represents the cost of its plant ancl good-will; With all these facts before us, it is abundantly evident that the measure of protection which the industry has enjoyed since the establishment of Federation has been ample not merely to insure its steady growth, but to afford those engaged in it a generous measure of profit. The extent to which we are protecting the industry is another matter to which I should like to direct attention. The old rate of duty, namely, 12s. 6d. per ton, represents nearly 50 per cent, upon the value of the product. such circumstances, it must be admitted that it affords our manufacturers a generous measure of protection.",30
115,Senator TRENWITH,Unknown,Does the honourable senator say that the price of salt is only 24s. per ton?,30
116,Senator MILLEN,Unknown,"I am speaking of the f.o.b. price. The duty of 12s. 6d. per ton, added to the freight and other transit charges, represents a protection of from 75 per cent, to 150 per cent., according to the quality of the salt. ' It is no wonder that with such heavy ad valorem duties the industry has made steady progress, and the manufacturers handsome profits. another way of viewing the measure of protection which would be afforded by a 12s. 6d. duty. The cost of producing the salt, including the "" harvesting "" and all In this charges, is nearly covered by it. In other words, the whole cost of harvesting the salt and making it available is only a little more than 12s. 6d. a ton. Senator W. RUSSELL - The salt must be easily obtained if it can be got for 12s. 6d. a ton.",30
117,Senator MILLEN,Unknown,"It is. All I have said is that the cost of production, harvesting, and all other charges was nearly covered by that duty. A few honourable senators may explain or minimize it, but it There substantially represents the true position. I wish to say a word about the combine. There has been outside Australia for some time a very powerful trust controlling the salt market of the world. That trust has I wish undoubtedly entered into some arrangement with the Australian manufacturers of salt. It is known-althoug h no one ever gets to know exactly the details of any such arrangement-that it covers New Zealand, a country to which Australia exports saltOne of its terms is that only a limited quantity of salt is to be exported from Australia to New Zealand. The Australian manufacturers, who could send more salt to New Zealand if they liked, have entered into an arrangement by which they leave the New Zealand market practically to the big salt combination, in return for which only a limited quantity is to be sent by the combine to Australia. In these circumstances, there appears to be no justification for giving an increased duty. Every additional penny on the duty will enable the manufacturers, by means of that arrangement, to add that amount to the price charged to the consumer. That argument would not have much weight if it could be shown that the inUnder dustry was in financial difficulties, but it is not pretended that it is. Rather, it is on a sound financial basis. As it has attained to that satisfactory position, we should be false to our duty to the taxpayers if we approved of the proposal of the Government, knowing that any additional duty will not' be minimized by competition, but will simply be an additional bounty paid into the pockets of. those people. If further proof is wanted of the existence of the combine, I may state that the original duty in New South Wales was25s. a ton, and, immediatey the duty was lowered to 12s. 6d. by the first Federal Tariff, the local companies reduced their There is prices by 'ios. That incidentally throws a new light on the argument that duties do not raise prices. The companies reduced their prices when the duty was lowered, but shortly afterwards, when the combination got to work, and the arrangement I have spoken of was made between the Australian manufacturers and the outside Salt Trust, prices were raised again to a figure far beyond that from which they had previously been lowered. I have only touched briefly on the more salient features of the case. I know the strength of the protectionist feelings of some honourable senators. But there must be some limit to them.",30
118,Senator CLEMONS,Unknown,"Oh , no !",31
119,Senator MILLEN,Unknown,"I thought I observed a slight tendency to sweet reasonableness in Senator Findley's face, and fancied that I could catch him at the psychological moment! It should be remembered that salt is used in one of our big primary industries-that of dairying-wit h which Senator W. Russell is concerned. Senator W. RUSSELL - And in preserving hay.",31
120,Senator MILLEN,Unknown,"It is used also in bacon-curing and other industries. I should not ask for any reduction of the proposed duty if the old one had been insufficient, but it has been proved to be sufficient. There is, therefore, no justification for tectionists or any one else, seeing that the industry has already sufficient protection to enable it to carry on and pay decent dividends, to place the company in a position to levy toll on much larger and equally deserving industries.",31
121,Senator TRENWITH,Unknown,"Victoria) [12.56]. - Senato r Millen has made several statements, one of which is that there is a combine. There may be a combine for all I know, but, if there. is, a duty has a tendency to protect the would be local producer against the influence of the enormous crushing power from without. I can easily understand a power, strong enough to crush out local industries if it likes, saying, ""You can remain in this industry on our conditions, or be crushed out."" Australia ought to be able to make salt enough, not merely for itself, but for the world. With its 8,000 miles of coast line, it could make solar salt enough for the universe, but there are also in Australia a considerable number of natural salt farms, the utilization of which we want to encourage. They have been created for us by nature, and we want to be protected in developing them from the external combine. It is not pretended that that combine originated here. It is obvious that it began outside, and operated in Australia, if it operated at all, as a compelling in- fluence that this duty ' would protect us from.",31
122,Senator STORY,Unknown,"South. Australia) [12.59] - The contention of Senator Millen, and a number of other honourable senators, on the other side, is, that the protective cluties which have been already passed have raised the cost of living to the whole of the people of Australia.",31
123,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"The time for suspending the sitting having arrived, I wish to. draw the attention of the Committee to the fact that the sessional order fixes the time for the resumption of the sitting on Fridays at 2 o'clock. The suggestion thrown out this morning that an hour and a quarter should be taken for luncheon will therefore not operate on Fridays. Siding suspended from 1 to 2 p.m.",31
124,Senator BEST,Unknown,"[2.o] - I am afraid, Mr Chairman, that some honourable senators have gone away under the impression that we were to meet again, not at two o'clock, but at a quarter past the hour. Under the circumstances, I suggest prothat you suspend the sitting for fifteen minutes, and in the meantime I shall prepare a notice of motion altering the time for meeting after lunch on Friday.",31
125,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"I take it to be the wish of the Committee that the sitting be suspended until 2.15 p.m. Honorable SENATORS - Hear , hear 1 Sitting suspended until 2.15 p.m.",31
126,Senator STORY,Unknown,"South Australia) [2.15] . - Jus t prior to the adjournment, I referred to the fact that Senator Millen and others who sit with him contended that the increased protective duties necessarily raise the cost of living. With that contention I , to some extent, agree-protectio n must increase the cost of living, at least temporarily, in many cases. But the facts discount in some degree Senator Millen's argument that the old duty of 12s. 6d. is sufficient. The honourable senator pointed out that under the old duty the importations have decreased very considerably; but something over 8,000 tons are still imported. Some little time ago, in South Australia, an increase of wages was granted to the men employed in this industry, and if the cost of living is still further in-. creased, and a further increase of wages is necessary, the local producers of salt will be placed in a less advantageous position to compete with foreign producers. The probability is that an increase of wages would result in increased importation. This is really a protective duty, because there is no reason whatever for importing any salt intoAustralia. Every State of the union has thousands of tons of the raw material, and it only requires the application of labour to provide the finished commodity so necessary in every-day life. Senator ST. LEDGER (Queensland) [2.19] - Fro m information given to me, it seems that the natural protection, as represented by freight and other charges, amounts to about 320 per cent, on the price of salt on shipboard in England.",31
127,Senator STORY,Unknown,"But salt may be brought here as ballast. Senator Sir JOSIAH SYMON - That is what is said to do injury to local producers. Senator ST. LEDGER - At any rate, I am informed that the natural protection on salt is 320 per cent.",32
128,Senator MULCAHY,Unknown,What is the value of salt per ton?,32
129,Senator CLEMONS,Unknown,The very best quality of imported salt is 65s. per ton.,32
130,Senator MULCAHY,Unknown,"Then it would appear that it costs about £ 9 to bring a ton of salt to Australia. Senator ST. LEDGER - I am only saying that I am informed that such is the natural protection, and until I am assured that my information is incorrect I must conclude that the natural protection is very high. I shall vote for retaining the duty .as before. Senator Sir JOSIAH SYMON. (South Australia) [2.20] - When this item was before the Senate six years ago, I vbte""d for the duty then proposed, namely, 12s. 6d per ton. If any protection ought to. be extended - it is to the primary industries, and, although on that occasion I had the honour of being the spokesman of the free trade party-ther e was a free-trade party then- I supported the duty as it had been fixed after full investigation in the House of Representatives. I gave my vote on that occasion on the ground that the argument that freight is adequate protection does, not apply in the case of salt. At any rate, that was the view which was strongly placed before us, and, therefore, I am not quite sure that Senator St. Ledger has been quite correctly informed. I have always, understood that the great difficulty in connection with salt production is that the bulk of the salt is imported as ballast, or at a very low rate of freight, or no freight at all. I ask Senator Clemons, who represents the free-trade section of .the Tariff Commission, whether there was any evidence given to justify the increase of the duty to 20s. ?",32
131,Senator CLEMONS,Unknown,"None . Senator Sir JOSIAH SYMON - At any rate, the increase seems to be very large. I am not prepared to say that the duty ought to remain at 12s. 6d., because, regarding this as a pure matter of business, salt is similar to potatoes, bananas, or hops. There are elements that have to be considered from every point of view.",32
132,Senator DOBSON,Unknown,"The honourable senator is slipping. Senator Sir JOSIAH SYMON - I look to my friend, Senator Clemons",32
133,Senator CLEMONS,Unknown,To help the honourable senator out of his difficulty ? I do not think I can.,32
134,Senator Sir JOSIAHSYMON,Unknown,"I look to Senator Clemons to enlighten us as to the reasons for the proposal to increase the duty to 20s. At present, I do not think that a duty of 12s. 6d. is of any use; and, instead of imposing such a duty, it would be better to make the item free. Senator MACFARLA NE (Tasmania) [2.25] - I claim the vote of Senator Symon on the ground that salt is a necessaryarticle of food, and, therefore, ought to be admitted free-or at a low duty. I am perfectly sure that no salt comes out as ballast at the present time; and the ordinary freight is from 12s. 6d. to 15s., while in the larger boats it is higher. If there be a duty of 12s.' 6d. on an article sold in England at 305. to 40s - thoug h it used to be higher-the protection is ample.",32
135,Senator CLEMONS,Unknown,"Tasmania) [2.26]. - I should not have intervened in the debate but for the appeal .of Senator Symon for me to help him out of his difficulty, and show why the duty should be increased from 12s.' 6d. to £ 1 . .The imported salt, which competes with the Australian article, is practically of one brand only, namely, the "" Black Horse,"" which is sold at 65s. per ton. The witness who came before the Tariff Commission as'representing the Castle Salt Co-operative Company-the largest in the Commonwealth-admitte d that the cost of production, on a wide estimate, is 35s. a ton. The witness further admitted that the present duty represents 66 per cent. Therefore, I rise to assure Senator Symon that there is good ground for increasing the duty as proposed, seeing that in addition to the duty of 66 per cent., the freight represents only another 40 per cent. Senator Sir JOSIAH SYMON - I afraid those figures will not bear auditing.",32
136,Senator CLEMONS,Unknown,"I am trying to make the figures lean favourably to the view of the honourable senator; and I cannot go further with due regard to veracity. I Gan tell the honourable senator, however, that the present duty, plus the freight, represents only 106 per cent.; and, therefore, I suppose it is only fair that, as this is a South Australian industry, the protection should be raised to about 150 per cent. There is another reason that may appeal to Senator Symon. VVhen the witness, to whom I have piready referred, came before the Commission, we asked him what his trouble really, was, and it appeared to be the comnion trouble of manufacturers, especially in Victoria. In reply to a question as to the present duty on salt, the witness saidSo far as the South Australian internal trade is concerned, I am quite satisfied, and I do not want any more duty; but we want a higher - duty in the other Inter-State markets. The trouble with this and a number of other manufacturers is that the Inter-State competition troubles them in regard to prices; as Senator Millen said the other day, using a phrase which seems .very expressive, "" they cannot all turn cannibals."" Not being able to devour one another, and being reluctant to admit the necessity doing so, they conjure up a purely imagiAllen nary foe in the person of the man who sends from abroad. No matter what duty we impose this ""Blac k Horse "".sal t will continue to be imported. It has been sellbourne, ing for years at a price higher than that the best salt produced in South Australia.",33
137,Senator GUTHRIE,Unknown,No .,33
138,Senator CLEMONS,Unknown,"I can assure the honourable senator that what I say is a handicapped. fact. Senator MCGregor, who was a - Senator MILLEN member of the Tariff Commission, will remember that this was a salient point in the evidence we heard, namely, case of the imported salt there is no attempt to undersell the local production. The imported salt sells, I suppose, on an averwages age at £ 1 per ton higher than does the local production, and, no matter what duty may be imposed, it will still be bought the higher price by certain persons who carrv on primary industries.",33
139,Senator MCGREGOR,Unknown,"South Australia) £2.30] - T n the main the statements of Sencrease ator Clemons are true, but made as they of the article. were they may have created a wrong impression in the minds of some honourable senators. The balance of evidence given am before the Tariff Commission went to show that prior to the competition of the locally manufactured article Black Horse salt was sold at nearly 50 per cent, more than it has been sold at since the establishment of the Commonwealth. It is also quite true that the representative of the Castle Co-operative Salt Company stated that so far as South Australia was concerned, a duty of 12s. 6d. per ton might be considered high enough. Every, one knows, what that means. It means that just round where the salt is manufactured probably less than 12s. 6d. per ton might be sufficient. But it was clearly pointed out to the Commission that in most instances the freight from Victoria to Western Australia or from South Australia to Queensland was much higher than the freight from Great Britain or Europe to any part of Australia.. These are the points to be considered when we are endeavouring by a protective duty to secure the production of, salt, not in one State alone but in ali the States. Although Senator Clemons fairly stated the case from his own point of view, still I do not think that he stated the whole case to the Committee. I hope""that the duty will be agreed to.",33
140,Senator LYNCH,Unknown,"Western Australia) [2.33] - In the evidence given before the of Tariff Commission it was shown by Mr. that the freight per ton from England was as low as n s . to Brisbane and 7s. 6d. to Sydney, whilst from Edithburg in South Australia it was 7s. 6d. to Mel8s. 3d. to Sydney, 13s. 3d. to Brisof bane, 17s. od. to.

143,Senator CHATAWAY,Unknown,"Queensland) [2.40] - A short time ago, when I made a suggestion in regard to another item, it was described as being small, unnecessary, and contemptible. I draw attention to the fact that under this item it is proposed by the Government to admit cotton seed for the manufacture of - cotton seed cake and denaturated cotton seed oil, free, as prescribed by departmental by-laws. 1906, we imported from Egypt 10 centals of cotton seed, which yielded a revenue of £ 2 . Is it intended to retain this item and incur the expense of printing and circulating departmental by-laws at a cost of considerably over £ 2 , just for the purpose of enabling somebody or other to get in £ 6 worth of cotton.seed in the course of a year? In addition to that, we have decided to give for the next eight years a bounty of 10 per cent, on the market value of the ginned cotton produced in Australia. It seems to me that an error has been made in putting in this line. I cannot believe that, for the sake of saving to somebody £ 2 in duty, honourable senators will retain the line, especially in view of the fact that a bounty is offered for the production of this commodity. Therefore, I move That ihe House of Representatives be requested to leave out item 99. Senator Colonel NEILD (New South Wales) [2.42] - I quite agree with the proposal made by Senator Chataway to omit AYES. so ridiculous an item as yields a revenue of £ 2 a year. To show the absurdity of the proposal, it would hardly be possible for any. one to move a request for a preference to British cotton seed. If I did, I suppose I would be told that it was too paltry. The NOES. item is very paltry, and would not yield enough money to cover the cost of printing the departmental by-laws. The duty collected on the 11 centals of cotton seed in 1906 ought really to have been £ 2 4s., and not £ 2 . I hope that the Minister will consent to the item being placed on the free list.",34

149,Senator MILLEN,Unknown,"New South Wales) [2.45I-Unde r the old Tariff the duty imposed was 3d. per lb. on fancy soaps, and i d . per lb. on all other soaps. I intend to submit a request for an alternative duty of 20 per cent., or 3d. per lb., on fancy soaps. This industry is certainly not in need of any further assistance from the Legislature. I propose to quote some figures with a double object in> view, first as showing that the local soap industry is fairly well able to take care of itself, and then as showing that if we have any desire to give a preference to Great Britain it can be given in connection with this item with, so far as I am able to see, no injury whatever to local manufacturers. Quoting from the Trade and Customs Returns for 1906, I find that in that year the total imports of perfumed soaps amounted to 891,117 lbs., valued at £65,840, of which 583,918 lbs., valued at £38,989, came from the United Kingdom. Of ordinary soaps included under the heading n.e.i. the total importation was 1,474,486 lbs., valued at £13,642, and practically the whole of this importation came from the United Kingdom. Now, as showing the position of the industry in Australia, let me tell honourable senators what the exports were. Our exports of perfumed soaps in 1906 amounted to 104,618 lbs., valued at £ 4 , 6 5 6 ; and of ordinary soaps under the heading ""n.e.i."" we exported 4,658,195 lbs., valued at £44,184. It will therefore be seen that our export was as four to one when compared with the imports of this class of soap, and it will hardly be contended in the face of these figures that the industry in Australia is not well able to meet local requirements, and also to find a footing in the markets of the world. That is a very satisfactory position, with which I am sure we are all highly pleased, but it indicates that there is no necessity for an increase of duty, seeing that under the duty imposed by the old Tariff the industry has been making such very satisfactory progress.",34
150,Senator CLEMONS,Unknown,"Tasmania) [2.50]. - Senato r Millen has pointed out what I think we all - knew, that the localsoap manufacturers have practically Raptured the whole of the trade of the Commonwealth, and need have no fear of any competition. If I am asked how it is that some soap is still imported, the answer is perfectly simple, and has been supplied on other items even by protectionist senators opposite. It is that we may impose any duty we please short of absolute prqhibition, and there will always be a small importation of the article made dutiable.",35
151,Senator GUTHRIE,Unknown,"But in this case there is an - importation of over £80,000 worth of. soap.",35
152,Senator CLEMONS,Unknown,"But Senator Guthrie should know that many kinds of soap are included in the total importations, and amongst them the soap that does not wash clothes is responsible for some of the duty collected on this article. That soap is not made here.",35
153,Senator MCGREGOR,Unknown,"Yes , it is.",35
154,Senator CLEMONS,Unknown,Is Monkey Brand soap made in the Commonwealth ?,35
155,Senator TRENWITH,Unknown,No ; but a substitute for it is.,35
156,Senator CLEMONS,Unknown,"Here , again, is our old friend the substitute.",35
157,Senator MILLEN,Unknown,"And if it is not made now, it will be!",35
158,Senator TRENWITH,Unknown,Sand soap is largely h used as a substitute for Monkey Brand soap.,35
159,Senator CLEMONS,Unknown,Most of the revenue we collect from soap is from duties levied on soaps that are not made here.,35
160,Senator GUTHRIE,Unknown,Mostl y fancy soaps.,35
161,Senator CLEMONS,Unknown,"I admit that we import a certain proportion of fancy soaps, and a fair proportion of what are called medicated soaps. There will always be people in the Commonwealth who will buy some of these so-called medicated soaps that rightly or wrongly-and I cannot determine from personal experience-ar e asserted to have, wonderful effects upon the complexion, the growth of the hair, or in some other way. Honourable senators opposite know what human nature is, and they know that soaps advertised to possess certain qualities will continue to be bought by people in Australia. If they did not buy these soaps they would not purchase any soaps made here for the same purpose. This duty is, therefore, wholly and solely a class tax. I am not hypocrite enough to say that I object to class taxation which affects only the poorer classes. I object to class taxation of any kind. It may be said that the poor man is not concerned about his complexion and has no fads on the subject of the growth of hair, but we should not be influenced by class prejudices of any kind. From the revenue point of view, though I object to revenue duties, I admit that this item covers - what are practically luxuries, and in the interests of fair taxation, I do not therefore suggest that the item should be made free. Another reason is that it would be perfectly hopeless to submit such a request. I move That the House of Representatives be requested to make the duty on item 100, paragraph A, ad. val., 25 per cent.",35
162,Senator KEATING,Unknown,"Tasmania-Minister of Home Affairs) [2.56] - It will be obvious to honourable senators that the Tariff as first introduced provided for a duty of 25 per cent, on both paragraphs A and'B of this item.' In another place, it was decided in the case of paragraph A to add the words "" and on and after 6th November, 1907, ad. valorem 25 per cent., or per lb. 4d., whichever returns the higher duty."" I point out to honourable senators that this makes provision for an alternative duty. If 4d. per lb. on toilet, fancy and medicated soaps yields a larger revenue than would be provided by a duty of 25 per cent., the duty levied will be 4d. per lb., and if 25 per cent, will yield the higher revenue, that will be the rate adopted.",35
163,Senator MILLEN,Unknown,"That is to say, the cheaper soaps pay the higher duty.",36
164,Senator KEATING,Unknown,"That is an argument which applies to the principle of fixed duties rather than to this particular item. It was found that many toilet, fancy and medicated soaps coming in at a duty of 25 per cent, were paying less than they should pay. Senator Clemons has said that the local manufacturers have captured the local market.",36
165,Senator CLEMONS,Unknown,Practically .,36
166,Senator KEATING,Unknown,"They may have done so in the case of soaps, n.e.i., but they have not clone so in the case of toilet, fancy, and medicated soaps. from the Trade ancl Customs Returns for 1906, page 234, it will be found that it is perfectly correct, as Senator Millen has stated, that in 1906 Australia exported 1.04,618 lbs. of perfumed, toilet, and medicated soaps; but if honourable senators will look at the next column, they will find that of this quantity 51,632 lbs. were produced in countries other than Australia.",36
167,Senator MILLEN,Unknown,"Of course, they come under the exports.",36
168,Senator KEATING,Unknown,"E x a c t l y ; but the fact that we imported 51,000 lbs. and exported 52,000 lbs. of soaps of a certain quality does not show that we have captured the trade.",36
169,Senator MILLEN,Unknown,It shows that the net imports are not serious.,36

172,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"The notices of amendments which are circulated are not official papers, and I am bound to call upon the first senator who, in rising, catches my eye.

173,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"The honourable senator resumed his seat, and then Senator Millen rose.",36
174,Senator MILLEN,Unknown,"An honourable senator who was industrious enough to give notice of a sufficient number of requests could absolutely forestall every other senator, if to do so gave him a right of priority. However, I am willing to give way to Senator' Neild. Senator Colonel NEILD - As a matter of personal explanation, I wish to say that on many occasions honourable senators have asked me to allow them to move requests of which I have given notice, and in every instance I have allowed them to do so.

176,Senator DOBSON,Unknown,"Tasmania) [3.26] I move That the House of Representatives be quested to make the duty on item 101, paragraph B, per lb., 2d. We are dealing with a Tariff introduced by a protectionist Ministry, and we cannot go wrong if we adopt the measure of protection which they have asked us to support. Having agreed to. a request that unground spice, formerly dutiable at 2d. per lb., should come in free, I think we might well agree to this request, and so maintain the measure of protection originally proposed by the Government.",38
177,Senator KEATING,Unknown,Tasmania-Minister of Home Affairs) [3.27] - I hope that the Committee will not agree with the honourable senator's proposal.,38
178,Senator DOBSON,Unknown,It is practically the Government's own suggestion.,38
179,Senator KEATING,Unknown,"That is not so. The honourable senator bases his plea on the ground that since we have agreed to admit spices unground free of duty, we should now request that spices ground be made dutiable at 2d. per lb. Certainly the Tariff as introduced into this Chamber provided that spices unground n.e.i. should be dutiable atTzd., and that spices ground n.e.i. should be dutiable at 4d. But the reply to the honourable senator's argument is that the Committee has agreed, not to make spices unground free, but to request another place to do so. I take it that the fact that we have agreed to request another place ""to adopt this course does not necessarily mean that it will do so.",38
180,Senator DOBSON,Unknown,We must make the two paragraphs consistent.,38
181,Senator KEATING,Unknown,"The Government . oppose the request which has just been asked for, and I hope that another place will not agree to make unground spices free. There has been no departure from the pre-existing duty, and, as a matter of fact, most of the goods that come under this heading can very well bear a Customs impost. I do not think that the imposition of a duty of 4d. per lb. as against"" a duty of 2d. per Ib. on this item will press - harshly or injuriously upon any one.",38
182,Senator DOBSON,Unknown,Le t us divide.,38
183,Senator KEATING,Unknown,I am not at all averse to doing so. I hope that honourable senators will not agree to the proposal.,38
184,Senator TRENWITH,Unknown,"Victoria) [3.30]. - f am sure that honourable senators do not wish to be misled in this connection. Senator Lynch moved that the duty upon unre- ground spices should be abolished with a view to affording the spice industry a greater measure of protection by making its raw materials free. The duty which it is now proposed to levy upon ground spices can easily be avoided, because, if the House of Representatives assents to Senator Lynch's request, manufacturers will be able to import their spices free, and to grind them in the Commonwealth. Senator Lt - Colonel GOULD (New South Wales) [3.31] - Senator Trenwith has spoken of this duty as a protective one. But it was clearly.understood by a protectionist Government, and by a protectionist House of Representatives, that a margin of 2d. per lb. between the rates imposed upon unground and ground spices would afford the industry a sufficient measure of protection. Surely we are not called upon to make the duty upon ground spices 4d. per lb., when the protectionist members of this Parliament have, in effect, already declared themselves satisfied with 2d. per lb. 1 The Minister of Home Affairs has expressed the hope that the other .Chamber will not agree to the abolition of the duty of 2d. per lb. upon unground spices. But if the Government are satisfied that a margin of 2d. per lb. between the duties levied upon unground and grpund spices will afford the industry ample protection, as a logical sequence to the vote which has already been given, the proposed duty should be reduced to that amount. If the House of Representatives thinks otherwise., it has the power to deal with the whole matter. But, from every stand-point, it. is only logical to reduce the duty upon ground spices n.e.i. to 2d. per lb.

185,Senator CLEMONS,Unknown,"Tasmania) [3-3?]-This is an interesting item, and one with a history. I should like to make a few remarks concerning it, and I wish specially to address them to Senator MCGregor. The history of this item is interesting, not because of what we know, but' because. of what we do not know. It would be more interesting still, if we were privileged to read the hitherto unpublished memoirs of a prominent labour leader in this Parliament, disclosing the reasons why, in the first Commonwealth Parliament, he moved that sparklets should be admitted free. After the lapse of six years, the opportunity presents itself to Senator MCGregor to advance; not the reasons which he urged when the first Commonwealth Tariff was under consideration, but any other reasons, why he as a protectionist should move that an article which is used entirely by the rich, should be made free. If he desires to give those reasons fo the public, I shall be very glad to hear them.",39
186,Senator MCGREGOR,Unknown,The reasons that I would urge on the present occasion are precisely those that I advanced on a previous occasion.,39
187,Senator CLEMONS,Unknown,"When I extend this very open and public invitation to Senator MCGregor to assign reasons why he thinks that sparklets should be free, I have not the slightest doubt that he will repeat the arguments that he used six years ago. But I am quite sure that he is not prepared to add to them in any way. If he has nothing to say upon the subject, I shall now leave it alone.",39
188,Senator MCGREGOR,Unknown,"If a duty is proposed upon sparklets, will the honourable senator support it?",39
189,Senator CLEMONS,Unknown,Does Senator MCGregor think that that question supplies an adequate answer to what I have beenNOES. saying? It is very easy for him to talk now of imposing a duty upon sparklets.,39
190,Senator MCGREGOR,Unknown,"I always use the same arguments. W. A - Senator CLEMONS - But the lionorable senator will confine himself to the arguments which he advanced on a previous occasion. He will go no further. Dropping that question altogether, I movePAIR. That the House .of Representatives be requested to amend item 102, by inserting after the word ""Sparklets"" the word ""seltzogenes."" If sparklets should be admitted free, so should seltzogenes. Neither article is aerated made in Australia, and neither is likely to be. The seltzogene is a patent, and cannot be made in the Commonwealth. It serves precisely the same purpose as does a spark . let.",39
191,Senator KEATING,Unknown,"Tasmania-Minister of Home Affairs) [3.41] - It would not be advisable to make the amendment suggested, especially' as seltzogenes are included in item 251, under the division "" Earthenware, cement, china, glass, and stone."" Sparklets were included under this division, "" Agricultural products and groceries!"" in the old Tariff, perhaps because they were purchasable at grocers' shops. It would be better to discuss the question of admitting seltzogenes free when we reach item 251. Even if sparklets are out of place in this Division it will not help matters to introduce seltzogenes. Senator Colonel NEILD (New South Wales). [3.42] - We seem to be getting rather mixed.. I understand that sparklets are the bullets or charges with which the little glass affair is charged in order to make the liquid effervesce, whilst seltzogenes are machines in which, with certain chemicals, the same result is produced. We cannot include seltzogenes under the head of "" agricultural products and groceries,"" because they are nothing of the sort. Request negatived. Item agreed to. Item 103 (Starch) agreed to.

192,Senator MILLEN,Unknown,"New South Wales) [3-43]-- I wish to draw the attention of the Government to a matter connected with this item. If they do not feel disposed to accept my suggestion I do not know that I will delay the. Committee by' pressing it. I understand that what is known as potato flour is included for Customs purposes under this item. Potato flour is used.by twine makers, to polish twines, and also, I believe, in some other industries. If I should imagine that there was no desire on the - part of the Government to than make it dutiable. It is perhaps included in this item because of the difficulty of difestablished. ferentiating one kind of flour from the other. But that does not appear to be-a very serious difficulty, seeing that the Custhe suggestion. toms Department always - has at its command competent chemists and analysts. believe the trade name of potato flour farina. It is quite distinct from starch kind of flour. flour, which is useless for the purposes for which farina is used. I hope the Governflour. ment will accept my suggestion that farina should be .admitted free.",39
193,Senator KEATING,Unknown,No . It can be made here easily enough - regard to,40
194,Senator MILLEN,Unknown,"But it is not being made here. Sparklets could be but they are not. I do not deny the ingenuity and ability of.the Australian chanic and capitalist to do anything. But potato flour is not being made here. It is used by a large number of men in a multiplicity of small industries, and what is the use of placing a duty upon an article merely because it may at some future time be made here? The imports of it are not great, but the duty does represent an imindustry ? post upon an industry already established. If the two industries were already estabtuted lished I would not advocate disturbing balance between them, but when certain established industries are using an article which is not made here, what is the good, even from a protectionist stand-point, of objections. placing an impost upon them?",40
195,Senator KEATING,Unknown,"Tasmania-Minister of Home Affairs) [3.47]-- I hope Senament tor Millen will not convert his into a motion to exempt potato flour. It can be manufactured in the Commonwealth. It is proposed in this Tariff to raise duty upon twine. We have sufficient material in the Commonwealth to enable us to hope that before very long under the stimulus of a duty our own people will turn from the other. their attention to the manufacture of potato flour. The duty on it is proportioned to the increased duty upon twine. flour were made free, it is so difficult to differentiate these flours from one another that we might often be defrauded of reanalyze venue by it being introduced as a substito tute for others which are dutiable.",40

I have not heard any substantial reason why the free importation of the article should be interfered with in any shape or form, and therefore I submit this request. - Senator MILLEN - Suppose , sir, that the request be negatived, will it be competent for me to move a request to reduce the weight of the packet from 20 lbs. to 10 lbs. ?",42
227,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,I think so.,42
228,Senator FINDLEY,Unknown,"Victoria) [4.7] My support will not, of course, be given the request, and I intimate my to move later on a request for an increase of the duty from i d . to 2d. per lb.",42
229,Senator HENDERSON,Unknown,I would not have been surprised if the honourable senator had said 4d.,42
230,Senator FINDLEY,Unknown,"I am concerned about building up in Australia a large industry. The protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended that a duty should be placed on tea when imported in packages made up in different parts of India under conditions altogether different - from those under which tea is packed in various parts of Australia.' I know that a little time ago/ certain persons who are largely interested in the tea business, said-no t publicly of course-that if the conditions of the workers were to be improved in certain directions, they would have seriously to consider whether it would not be more advantageous to themselves to have the whole of their packing done where the tea was grown and prepared for exportation. The imposition of this duty gives an encouragement to the employment of local labour. Further than that, I am satisfied that the duty is insufficient, because it leaves an advantage in favour of the importer of packet tea, in respect of the employment of cheaper labour.",42
231,Senator MILLEN,Unknown,It costs id. per lb. to pack the tea.,42
232,Senator FINDLEY,Unknown,"He has his printing done abroad, too. I am looking at this - question, not only from the packing ' but also from the printing and other ; trades point of view. Printers and others complain, and with just cause, that the packing of tea abroad under conditions totally different from those obtaining here seriously affects them. [286]- 2",42
233,Senator CHATAWAY,Unknown,They are packing tea in every large town ih Australia.,42
234,Senator FINDLEY,Unknown,"Yes ; and if we are more concerned about having the article packed in other parts where labour is worked longer and paid - much less than it is here, we ought to admit that we are not protectionists, and seriously consider whether we are not coming close to the borderline of free-trade.",42
235,Senator SAYERS,Unknown,They were packing tea here before any duty was imposed.,42
236,Senator FINDLEY,Unknown,"Yes ; but the more facilities we place in the way of the importers to pack their teas outside of Australia,' the more they will take advantage of that practice. The public to will not in any way be affected by the imintention position of this duty. Progress reported. Senate adjourned at 4.12 p.m.",42
