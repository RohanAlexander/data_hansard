1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. J. S. Rosevear) took the chair at 2.30 p.m., and read prayers. BANKING . NATIONALIZATION :'PETTTION8-POLITICA L CRISIS IN VICTORIA. Petitions in relation.to banking in Australia were presented as follows:By Mr ANTHONY, from certain electors of the division of Richmond. By Mr Archie CAMERON, from certain residents of Macclesfield, South Australia. Petitions received and read. later:",11
2,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,"I have with me a number of forms signed by approximately 8,000 to 10,000 people of my electorate protesting against the proposed nationalization of banking, without a prior referendum being held, but I am unable to present them to the House in the form of a petition because the document is not worded in accordance with the requirements of Standing Orders. In order that 1 may discharge my duty to my constituents, will the Prime Minister intimate whether.he U prepared to reeeive the documents now or at some appointed time and place?",12
3,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"Member s of the Australian Oountry party, with the Leader of that party as their spokesman, took the opportunity last week, as' did the Leader of the Opposition today, to present to me petitions which had not heen prepared in a form suitable for presentation to the Parliament. I shall be quite willing to grant a private audience to the honourable member, in order that he may present to me the documents he has mentioned.",12
4,Mr DUTHIE,Unknown,"I received today a letter from a constituent, complaining that there is a persistent rumour in Tasmania that the Prime Minister is refusing to accept petitions and protests on the Government's banking proposals. ""Will the right honourable gentleman give the nssurance that those rumours are unfounded?",12
5,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"In no instance has * communication that has heen forwarded to me either as Treasurer or Prime Minister been rejected; all of them have heen received, and, as a matter of fact, read. I do not pretend for a moment that all of themhave heen studied in detail. The leaders of both the Opposition parties know that I have provided opportunities for them to present petitions on behalf of their constituents. The opportunity to present further petitions is still open.",12
6,Mr SPENDER,Unknown,What notice is the right honourable gentleman taking of them?,12
7,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,I helieve that I am entitled to keep my own counsel on that matter ,12
8,Mr EDMONDS,Unknown,"It has been brought to my notice that, in my electorate, particularly at sugar mills, the employees, when leaving the premises after they have received their pay, are met by the manager of the mill with a petition which he asks them to sign, almost placing, the pen in their hands for that purpose. Will the Minister representing the Acting Attorney-General say whether such acts of intimidation of employees are permissible? Can the Acting Attorney General do anything to prevent their continuance?",12
9,Mr HOLLOWAY,Unknown,"I have heard of the practice referred to hy the honourable member having .been followed in some places, but not in the Queensland sugar fields. I do not know whether anything can be done to prevent people from signing a petition if they feel inclined to do so. If I know the sugar workers, I do not. think that they will sign a petition against their will. Later:",12
10,Mr HOLT,Unknown,"It is reported from Victoria that an early' election will be held in that State at which the nationalization of the private banks will he the main issue. As this will be the first occasion on which a large section of the Australian people will have an opportunity to express their opinion publicly on this matter, will the Prime Minister defer the introduction into this Parliament of the nationalization legislation on this subject until the decision of the Victorian people has been given?",12
11,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I have no official knowledge of what has happened in the Victorian Legislative Assembly. I was too busy last night to listen to the news broadcasts and I have not read the newspapers today. However, I have heard from some of my colleagues that there has been some disturbance in the Victorian Parliament. I am sure that the honourable memher for Fawkner, having due regard for the sovereign rights of the States, would not wish me to interfere in such a matter. Further, I do not propose to engage in a discussion of a measure that is not yet before this House. The banking legislation will he presented to the Parliament as soon .as the draftsmen have finished their work. At the earliest, the hill will be introduced at the end of next week, but more probably not until the beginning of the following week.",12
12,Mr HOLT,Unknown,Why not defer it until the opinion of the people of Victoria has been expressed?,13
13,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I do not know what legislation passed by the Commonwealth Parliament has to do with any State Parliament. It would be presumptuous on the part of this Parliament, for instance, to tell the Premier of South Australia or of Western Australia or of Tasmania that we did not like certain State legislation and would therefore refuse to pass future States grants measures. Similarly, any action by a State government to influence the decisions of this Parliament would be political presumption. HOUSING.",13
14,Mr FULLEB,Unknown,"Will the Minister representing the Minister for Supply and Shipping direct that army huts at ivapooka military camp, near Wagga, New South Wales, shall be disposed! of locally, in order to ease the acute housing shortage in that district and elsewhere in the southern Riverina? Mr DEDMA.N - As I explained recently, the State Governments have first call on Commonwealth property that is sold by the Commonwealth Disposals Commission, a body which is under the control of the Minister for Supply and Shipping. Since the housing of the people is primarily a responsibility of State Governments, the correct approach to the matter is for the Government of New South Wales to lay claim on the huts referred to, with a view to provision being made to meet the housing requirements of the people of the Wagga district. I shall l-.efer the matter to the Minister for Supply and Shipping in order that attention may be given to any further aspects which should be considered. DOLLAR DEFICITS.",13
15,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"In order that an informed debate may take place on the extent of and necessity for the trade restrictions from dollar areas recently imposed or foreshadowed by the Government, will the Prime Minister present to the House a paper setting forth detailsof such restrictions and the reasons there for, and also indicating, in addition to the estimated dollar deficiency during 1946-47, the estimated dollar deficiency for 1947-48, with particulars under each heading included in the total deficiency,, and showing also how the dollar loan by the United States of America to Great Britain has been applied and what balance, if any, of such loan remains?",13
16,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"As to the dollar deficiency for the financial year 1946-47, I have already given the information in broad terms to the Leader of the Australian Country party. I believe that similar information was asked for, and supplied to, the honourable member for Warringah. I shall ascertain what further information I can obtain for the Leader of the Opposition. Only an approximate estimate of the dollar deficiency for the present financial year can be given, as I think the right honourable gentleman will realise. Before even an approximate estimate can be made we must know what our dollar earnings for the financial year will be. I am afraid that it will not be possible to give details of the final restrictions that may be imposed until after the dollar talks in London have taken place and a more complete examination of the whole position has been made. The Government's inability to give the information is a physical disability and is not due to any disinclination on its part to supply the information. I doubt whether, during the budget debate or in the immediato future, it will be possible to give anything like a reasonably accurate estimate of the dollar deficiency. The right honourable gentleman will understand that the expenditure of the dollar loan by the United States of America to the United Kingdom is a matter entirely within the knowledge of the British Treasury. It is true that I have been given, confidentially, a fairly accurate estimate showing how the dollars have been expended, but. I do not think that the information contained in the confidential document that. I have received has been published anywhere. As I thought that the Opposition parties should have the right background, I offered last week to let them see confidentially, some figures that had been sent to me for my own personal information. I could not publish a statement of that kind without the consent of the British Government. However, in response to the request of the right honourable gentleman I shall ask what portion, if any, of those figures can be released. I am willin g that the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Country party should, in their capacity as party leaders, examine the figures so that they may be as well in formed on the subject as I am. If necessary, I shall get the Secretary to the Treasury, Mr MCFarlane, who has just returned fro m abroad, to explain to the right honourable gentleman any matters relating to the documents which need explaining. IMMIGRATION. POLES AND MALTESE-ARRIVAL S ON "" TIDEWATER "" .",13
17,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,"In this morning's Canberra Times the following item is published:London, Wednesday - Migratio n authorities at Australia House stated that the Furious will leave with 1,750 permanent settlers for Australia. These include 280 Poles and between 250 and 300 Maltese. Mr N. W. Lamidey, chief migration officer, Maltese are British subjects. said that by the end of the year about migrants will have left for Australia. Will the Minister for Immigration say whether Furious is one of the ships about which he made arrangements when he was in England ? If so, can he plain why this number of Poles and other Maltese are to be carried, seeing that many British people wish to come to Australia?",14
18,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"I have not yet reDaily ceived any advice from my chief migramessage tion officer in London on the subjectBritish matter of the press report referred We have been negotiating with the Marseilles British Admiralt y for the use of a British aircraft carrier. If it be true that favormation able action has been taken by Viscount H all , of the British Admiralty, i probable that Furious is the ship tination which has heen made available. I have not approved of the immigration to Ausdepartment? tralia of 2S0 Poles and between 250 and 300 Maltese, but I did agree with British Government, as a condition obtaining Asturias, that 280 Poles, who had fought alongside the Australians at Tobruk, should be brought to Australia to work on the hydro-electric project at Butler's Gorge in Tasmania, and elsewhere-wor k which Australians do not want to do - because they can find more congenial work elsewhere. In regard to the - second trip by Asturias in 1 November, the British Government asked us to take another 2S0 Poles of a total of 900 which the Government of Tasmania wants to bring to that State. The British Government also asked us to accept some Maltese. The authorities in Malta are in difficulties because the island is over-populated, and much of the arable land was rendered useless by bombing during the war. The British Government has asked us to accept 100 Maltese, mostly women and children, who have relatives already in Australia, and who can be provided with housing. I accepted that condition because I wish Asturias to make more trips. Seeing that 1,678 persons were carried on this ship on its last trip to Fremantle, it is obvious that it brings a great many British migrants, even if we also get some migrants whom we do not ordinarily regard as British. At the same time, I point out that, legally, the The 6,000 arrangements that we make with the British Government are made as the result of negotiations. We do not own any ships, and we have to accept some of the conditions laid down by the British Goexvernment, which has responsibilities to people as well as those who want to so leave B rit a into come to Australia.",14
19,Mr HAMILTON,Unknown,"The Sydney Telegraph yesterday published a from London, stating that the Navy was shadowing the Panato. manian ship Tidewater, which left ostensibly for Sydney with 805 Jewish refugee.? on board. What inforcan the Minister for Immigration give on the matter? Will he ascertain t is whether Tidewater, which gave its desas Sydney, is, in fact, proceeding to Sydney by arrangement with his",14
20,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"Tidewate r is not the proceeding anywhere by arrangement of with my department. To date, we have made no arrangements in regard to the shipping of persons from Europe. When the first ship carrying displaced persons to Australia from displaced persons' camps in Europe leaves European waters, it will leave under an agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the appropriate body that has been set up by the United Nations to effect the transfer of people from displaced persons' camps to this country. I have read the account of Tidewater having left Marseilles. The honourable member for Moreton asked me a question about the matter recently, and F. am trying to get some information in regard to it. If the press statement be true-that the British Navy is shadowing Tidewater-obviousl y the vessel must be making for Palestine, and not for Sydney. The only reason for the shadowing of any vessel in the Mediterranean by the British Navy would be to prevent illegal immigration into Palestine. I have no further information to impart at the moment, but I hope that I shall have some a little later. DUTCH AIRCRAFT.",14
21,Mr FADDEN,Unknown,"I ask the Minister for A i r whether it is a fact that in August the Royal Australian Air Force refused to service Dutch aeroplanes in Brisbane? If so, was this action taken with the approval of the Minister, or any member of the Government or any high official of the Royal Australian Air Force? What was the reason for this reported refusal, and was the Commonwealth's intention communicated to the Dutch authorities?",15
22,Mr DRAKEFORD,Unknown,I shall answer the right honourable member's question in the same way as I answered a similar question which was asked on a previous occasion. No request was made to me for any assistance from the Royal Australian Air Force to fuel Dutch aeroplanes.,15
23,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown,That is not the question.,15
24,Mr DRAKEFORD,Unknown,"Well , it is the answer. If no request was made the answer is obvious. As the Dutch authorities possess both aeroplanes and petrol and have personnel available for fuelling aeroplanes there can be no cause for any complaint when facilities are available for that purpose. WHEAT. ADVANCE-STABILIZATION .",15
25,Mr LANGTRY,Unknown,"In view of the very high price ruling for sheep at present, will the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture recommend to Cabinet that the first advance payment on wheat be made as high as possible? Farmers requiring sheep are urgently in need of adequate finance to enable them to use oats and wheat stubbles, otherwise the grazing value of stubbles will be lost. I know many farmers who crop only fallow land and who intend to plant stubble land. The stubbles are burnt off in March and April. That means that only a limited period of time is available to farmers to derive revenue from stubble grazing. I notice from today's Sydney Morning Herald that ships will be made available immediately to lift a large portion of the wheat crop immediately it is harvested. In these circumstances will the Minister do his utmost to arrange a very substantial first payment on wheat?  to inform the honourable member that the Cabinet, realizing fully the difficulties confronting wheat farmers in the Riverina and other wheat growing areas, has already decided to pay a higher advance on wheat this year than that paid in the past. The amount of the advance will be announced at a very early date.",15
26,Mr TURNBULL,Unknown,"It is fairly well known that recently at Warracknabeal a mass meeting of wheat-growers carried a resolution supporting the stabilization plan of the Australian Wheat growers' Federation. Has the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture received a copy of the resolution, and what action does he contemplate taking to meet the desires of these producers?  honourable member, received a copy of the resolution carried by a meeting of wheat growers summoned by the political Country party to discuss the fixation of a home consumption price of wheat. I assure the honourable member that when the report of the commission inquiring into the cost of production in the wheat industry is received ful l consideration will be given to the matter raised by him. - OKONULLA FISHERIES SCHOOL. "" Mr FALKINDER - I ask the Mini-""ster for Post-war Reconstruction, what - is the position with regard to training - at the fisheries training school at Cronulla? Ex-servicemen selected for 'training at that school have complained that the commencement date of their training has been postponed on several occasions this year.",15
27,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"At present, it is not quite clear whether there will be opportunities for men who wish to be trained at the Cronulla Fisheries School to enter the fishing industry on the terms we expected they would be able to when the school was first started. It may be that a too optimistic estimate was made of the absorptive capacity of the industry. For that reason we are postponing the decision as to when the second school will commence. LOANS. OPERATIONS IN LONDON.",16
28,Mr LANG,Unknown,"I ask the Prime Minister whether the Government has engaged firm of underwriters in London in conarranged nexion with any loan floated in recent months, or for loans about to be floated? If so, will he indicate the names of the underwriters and the terms on which they have been engaged ? Has a report been received from the High Commissioner in London, Mr Beasley, recommending the underwriting of a renewal of a loan by the Government of New South Wales from the Bank of Westminster? I so, will the right honourable gentleman inform the House of the context recommendations made by Mr Beasley?",16
29,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"For some years it has been the practice for all Commonformed wealth loans to be handled by the monwealth Bank. I understand, however, that some time ago the Government's financial advisers in London reported that there might be some difficulty in regard to the conversion of future loans, and suggested that the underwriting such loans should be considered. I took the opportunity to discuss the matter with the State Premiers. The New South Wales Joan to which the honourable mempurchaser, ber referred is, from memory, for an amount of £17,000,000 and bears interest at the rate 5$ per cent, sterling. I have promised to consult with the State Premiers before any action is taken for the conversion in London of loans in which the States are interested. I am unable to give the honourable member any definite information as to when any new conversion loan may be floated or whether the Government, acting upon the advice of the Loan Council, may use some of its funds for the repatriation of small loans. The matter is quite fluid at the moment. I shall endeavour to let the honoi:ible member have advance information of any action proposed to be taken in this connection in the near future. It is not usual for governments to make public letters which it receives from its officers abroad. In broad terms Mr Beasley conveyed to me an appreciation of the general financial position in London as he saw it j and no moro. PETROL RATIONING.",16
30,Mr CONELAN,Unknown,"In view of the recent reduction of the petrol ration in this any country and as many motorists have trips for the Christmas holidays, will the Minister representing the Minister for Supply and Shipping ascertain whether favourable consideration will be given to extending the currency of October and November coupons which normally will expire at the end of November for a further two months.",16
31,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,I shall refer the honourable member's request to the f Minister for Supply and Shipping. of the REAX ESTATE TRANSACTIONS. PROCEDURE AT AUCTION SALES.,16
32,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"I have been in that when homes are offered for Comsale at auction under the Land Sales Control Regulations, the auctioneers issue numbered tickets to intending bidders but do not keep a record of the names of the individuals to whom the tickets are of issued. Several people may bid the ceiling price for a home, thus necessitating a ballot, and as a number of bidders often act as dummies for one intending he naturally has an unfair advantage over legitimate home-seekers. Will the Treasurer ascertain whether in future auctioneers could be instructed to obtain the names and addresses of intending bidders when he is issuing ballot numbers, and also a monetary deposit as a token of good faith, in an endeavour to stop the racketeering now taking place.",16
33,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I have not had brought to my notice any instances of the practice to which the honourable member has referred, but I shall examine the position and answer the honourable member's question as soon as possible. TELEPHONE SERVICES.",17
34,Mr DALY,Unknown,I ask the Minister representing the Postmaster-General how many applications for telephones are outstanding and what efforts are being made to overcome the shortage. What efforts are being made to obtain automatic telephone equipment to enable the necessary conversion of city telephone exchanges from the manual to the automatic system?,17
35,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,I told the honourable member for Batman yesterday that I would try to obtain a statement from the Postmaster-General indicating the present position and the difficulties confronting the Government in meeting the requests of so many people who are enjoying such a high level of prosperity that they can afford to install telephones.,17
36,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,Who can everything but what they want.,17
37,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"They have a good government at any rate. The department which is trying to cope with 100,000 applications for telephones installed 11,000 in July and August. I will try to obtain a statement of the position from the Postmaster-General and have it roneoed and distributed to all honourable members so that they shall all know what good progress is being made, the difficulties confronting the department and how lack of exchange facilities is preventing the installation of telephones in busy areas in all the capital cities of Australia. CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF LUGGAGE.",17
38,Mr HARRISON,Unknown,"In dew of the exposure made by me in this House of what became known as the "" Keane trunks case"" and subsequent court action, which implicated a late Minister of the Crown, can the Minister acting for the Attorney-General tell me what stage has been reached in the matter? If the case is still awaiting finality, will he state the reason for the delay in its completion?",17
39,Mr HOLLOWAY,Unknown,If the honourable member refers to the Goldberg case,17
40,Mr HABRISON,Unknown,"No , the Keane trunk case.",17
41,Mr HOLLOWAY,Unknown,"Is not that the same thing? The only case that has been delayed is theappeal by Mr Goldberg against a conviction in connection with the matter that the honourable member has in mind. That is the only conviction of which I am aware. The delay is not due in any way to action by the Government, or the Attorney-General's Department;, it is the result of a request for an extension of time by Mr Goldberg's solicitors.. NA GOODS.",17
42,Mr DUTHIE,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,"I direct a question to the Prime Minister with reference to the 24 business men who have gone to Japau to seek trade on behalf of Australia. Will the Japanese goods be distributed fairly between the States on arrival in Australia, and then will a fair distribution be made, through ordinary channels, between city and country storekeepers so that the large city emporiums will not be allowed to absorb the bulk of the conget signments ?",17
43,Mr CHIFLEY,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,"The Department of Trade and Customs has made arrangements for a fair distribution of goods . imported fromJapan. I could give the honourable member details of the channels through which the distribution is to be made, but I think it will be more satisfactory to him if I arrange for the Minister for Trade and Customs to give him a full explanation. I have taken a personal interest in this matter, and I have been assured that the arrangements that have been made are satisfactory to all retailers' organizations. However, I shall make certain that the assurance is correct and inform the honourable member later.",17
44,Mr CONELAN,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,Were the retailers in each State consulted ?,17
45,Mr CHIFLEY,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,"I understand that consultations were held with all representative bodies associated with the distribution of goods of the classes that will be affected and that these bodies agreed general principle with the department's proposals. I do not claim that every indithem vidual retailer is satisfied, but the zations concerned have signified their approval of the arrangement. YUGOSLAVS.",17
46,Mr HOWSE,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,"Has the Minister Immigration seen a report that 500 Yugoslavs will embark on a Yugoslav ship in Western Australia next month to return to Yugoslavia? If the report is correct, how many Yugoslavs will leave Australia, why are they leaving, and will there be any restriction on the tity of personal belongings that they will be permitted to take out of Australia? If Yugoslav ships are coming to Australia for this purpose, can they be used to bring British immigrants here?",18
47,Mr CALWELL,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,"I have seen the ister statement to which the honourable member referred. We have been informed that ship is to come to Australia, but we not been able to secure any definite mation as yet regarding its name or the anticipated date of its arrival. The orable member for Robertson asked me question on the same subject some months ago. I repeat now what I said then, namely, that the Australian Governtricts ment does not know how many Yugoslavs resident in Australia, whether Yugoperiods slav nationals or naturalized British subjects, want to leave' this country for Yugoslavia. All that we know matter ? is that Tito's Government is said to be sponsoring a "" back-to-Yugoslavia movement for the purpose of rebuilding that country and that apparently some people in Australia believe the propaganda which has been discamp seminated and are prepared to sell their holdings in this country and go back to Yugoslavia. When I answered the honourable member for Robertson, said I thought that they were very foolish to leave this country. It is the best country that they have ever been in, are ever likely to be in. We have what we can. through our immigration officers in Western Australia and elsetravelling where, to try to dissuade them. The articles which they may desire in away from Australia will have to be considered if or when any large number of propose to leave this country. For organimy own part, if I have any say in the decision, they will not be allowed to take away any tools of trade which are so necessary for the development of Australia. The Yugoslavs, as a class, have been very good citizens of Australia. One young man named Starcevich, whose for Yugoslav parents could not speak English when they came to this country less than 30 years ago, won the Victoria Cross in World War II . Whilst numbers of Yugoslavs may be contemplating leaving Australia, there are thousands of Yugoslavs in camps for displaced persons quanin Europe who would be only too happy or property to come to Australia. GRAYLANDS CAMP.",18
48,Mr BEAZLEY,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,"I direct to the Miufor Immigration a question relating to the former Graylands Military Camp, a which is now under the control of his have department and which is used periodiinforcally to provide temporary accommodation for immigrants when they disembark honfrom ships at Fremantle. I understand a that the Farmers Union of Western Australia desires to use the camp as a holiday centre for children from the country disof Western Australia and others who have come to Western Aiistralia for when the camp is not being used by immigrants. I ask the Minister whether he has reached a decision on the",18
49,Mr CALWELL,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,"I received from the "" Farmers Union of Western Australia a - request that when the Grayland9 Camp is not in use the Department of Immigration might make it available as a city for children from country districts up whom the Farmers Union desires to bring to Perih for a holiday. ' I replied immediately that the Department of ImI migration will make the camp available to the Farmers Union or to any similar body that desires to utilize it as a or holiday camp fo.r country children at done times when the department does not require it as a transit depot for persons from Fremantle eastward after disembarkation from the ships which to take have brought them here. NORTHERN . TERRITORY. LAND SETTLEMENT.",18
50,Mr BLAIN,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,"I remind the Minister for the Interior that grave dissatisfaction exists in the Northern Territory as the result of the method of culling applicants for land recently resumed in that area and rhe allocation of the lands after the culling. As the Government has not set aside an area for the settlement of ex-servicemen there, will the Minister agree to re-appoint the Land Board which was abolished some years ago? When lands are to be allocated in future will he ensure that the applicants who have survived the culling shall go before the Land Board, as they do in Queensland and elsewhere, and participate in the ballots under the supervision of the Land Commissioner?",19
51,Mr JOHNSON,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,"The masters which the honourable .member has mentioned 'are now receiving consideration, but as he knows perfectly well, the subdivision of portions of the land in the Northern Territory, which would be classed as suitable for the kind of settlement which he has in mind, was delayed for a long period until we discovered a suitable director of lands. Af ter we had selected a suitable person, he discovered that, owing to domestic reasons, he could not accept the position.",19
52,Mr MCEWEN,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,That is not so. gentleman concerned discovered that the Government would offer him an appointment for only one year.,19
53,Mr JOHNSON,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,"The departmental files discloses that this gentleman made no reference to the length of the term of his appointment. Later he wrote apologetic letter because of the inconregulations? venience which he had caused to the Department of the Interior by accepting the appointment and then rejecting it. His action resulted in the department having to repeat the whole procedure of advertising the position, inviting cations and selecting an applicant. Howlations. ever, a suitable man was eventually appointed to the position, and his report is now awaited. No decision will made in regard to the subdivision land until his report is received. PENSIONS. HOSPITAL TBEATMENT .",19
54,Mrs BLACKBURN,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,"Las t week I asked a question of the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Minister for Social Services in respect of the payment of pensions to pensioners while they are in hospital, and the Minister stated that he would inquire into the matter. Is he now able to furnish a reply to my question?",19
55,Mr HOLLOWAY,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,"The position is that the payment of a pension or an allowance to any one entitled to receive such payment under the social service legislation is a statutory right of the person concerned, and the money is his to dispose of as he wishes. Every member of the community entering hospital is entitled to payment of the sum of £2 2a. a week towards the cost of his accommodation and treatment, that amount representing the fee chargeable for accommodation in a public ward. However, if a pensioner elects to enter a public ward of a hospital he receives accommodation and 'treatment without having to pay any money to the hospital. On the other hand, if he chooses to enter - a private hospital he cannot be compelled to pay unless he .agreed with the management of the hospital concerned to do so. There is no legal power to compel a pensioner to pay for hospital accommodaThe tion if he does not desire to do so. WAGE-PEGGING.",19
56,Dame ENID LYONS,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,"As an incentive to increased production, will the Prime Minister consider abolishing iman mediately the remaining wage-pegging",19
57,Mr CHIFLEY,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,"Some months ago the Government indicated that when the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1947 was proclaimed there appliwould be a review of wage-pegging reguThat review is now taking place, and I hope to make an announcement when the new act is proclaimed. I shall be communicate the Government's decision of to the honourable member as soon as possible. AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION.",19
58,Mr FALSTEIN,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,"Can the Minister representing the Minister for Munitions inform me what progress has been made in the construction of Tudor and Lincoln type aircraft, a programme which was decided upon some months ago? Has any such aircraft been converted for movecommercial use or are they all to be used by the Royal Australian Air Force? the department constructing any engines of the Ncne type?",20
59,Mr DEDMAN,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,I shall refer the right honourable member's question to Minister for Munitions and request him to prepare an answer. IN TERN ATION AL CONFERENCE standing order..ON TRADE AND EMPLOYMENT.,20
60,Mr WHITE,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,"I ask the Minister for decision ""Post-war Reconstruction to state when made, : the Parliament may expect to receive tfrom him a report of the International ""conference on Trade and Employment that was held at Geneva. Can the honornotice-paper able gentleman say whether the general principles of Empire preference are not debated. being maintained? In view of the great importance of the subject in relation the economy of this country, will he say whether an opportunity will be given for honourable members to discuss the matter during this sessional period?",20
61,Mr DEDMAN,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,"In answer to a question which another Opposition ber asked recently, I said that as soon as certain documents had been received members by 50 per cent. from Geneva. I would make a statement in respect of both the Charter International Trade Organization the tariff negotiations which took place Geneva. Those negotiations have not yet been completed, and until they have been it will not be possible to have a discussion on them.",20

64,Mr WHITE,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,"Balaclava) [3.29] - 1 That the ruling of Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - Is That the honourable member for Balaclava jet should resume his seat for continued irrelevance-be disagreed with. This is rather ancient history. The fault is that of the Government, not mine. The the matter arose last June, when Mr Deputy Speaker refused to allow rae to continue to take part in a debate. I then took the correct parliamentary procedure, by dissenting from his ruling. I direct the attention of the House to the relevant 1 If any objection is taken to the ruling or of the Speaker, such objection must be taken at once, and in writing, and motion which, if seconded, shall be proposed tn the House, and debate thereon forthwith adiounie.'l to the next sitting day. The motion of dissent appeared on the for the following day, but the Government passed it by and it was Consequently, discussion had been held over since last June. This to is, therefore, my first opportunity to disalso cuss it. I admit that the importance of the matter has diminished considerably because of the lapse of time. The facts are, that you, Mr Speaker, in your capacity as the honourable member for Dalley, had addressed the House on the memParliamentary Allowances Bill, which was designed to increase the allowance of I disagreed with the object of the measure, but, you, of the speaking from the floor of the and House-, gave reasons why honourable at members should accept, the additional allowance. In the course of your address you gave facts about the basic wage having been increased from time to time. You also said that as pensions had been increased there was justification for the to allowance of members also being in? creased. I do not claim to have quoted your exact words but that, I believe, was purport of your remarks. I received the call, after you, and in the course of my speech I set out reasons why honourable members should not accept the inOther honourable members on this side spoke in a similar strain. In the course of my remarks I saidHow can we legislate to grant a benefit to ourselves when anomalies such as that'are permitted to continue? I referred to the totally inadequate pensions of war widows, although since then they have been offered a few crumbs. I continuedThere should be some priority in the rectification of anomalies, and, in my view, the injustice which I sought to have removed should certainly take precedence over the adjustment ot the parliamentary allowance. I drew attention to the fact that unemployed disabled ex-servicemen had a portion of their pension deducted from their unemployment benefits. In order to show how erroneous was the decision of Mr Deputy Speaker. I shall quote further from my speech on that occasionWithout going too deeply into service matters, one could cite many examples of anomalies that are still permitted to exist. I then referred to the fact that certain flying corps instructors who were invited to join the Royal Australian A i r Force at the outbreak of war and had established certain rights in respect of pay were deprived of hundreds of pounds as the result of a regulation which was tabled in 1943 and had retrospective effect. I pointed out that I had fought their case unsuccessfully in the House, but that, later, judgment in their favour was given by the Supreme Court of New South Wales. I went on to say that, subsequently, the Government took the case to the High Court and had the decision reversed, though with criticism by the judge. 'It later announced it would not accept the decision of the court, but that ultimately it had decided to make an ex gratia, payment to the men concerned. At that juncture Mr Deputy Speaker called me to order. saidDuring the course of his remarks the able member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear) who is also Speaker, referred to invalid and oldajie pensions and other matters of that kind.",20
65,Mr AXTHOWY,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,Who was in the Chair at the time?,21
66,Mr WHITE,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,"The honourable member for Darling (Mr Clark), who is Deputy Speaker. He said1 have allowed the honourable member considerable latitude. I now ask him to confine his remarks to the bill before the House. Having again been called to order by Mr . Deputy Speaker, I saidLet me say that if one is to be circumscribed in this way on a matter which concerns the treatment by the Government of other sections of the community, about which we on this side of the House have some eonscience. 7 Whereupon, Mr Deputy Speaker again called me to order, and saidIf the honourable member persists in defying my ruling the Chair will order him to resume his seat. A moment later, after I had introduced another subject, he ordered me to resume my seat. In my opinion, Mr Deputy Speaker made an honest mistake in thinking that I was continuing to speak on the same subject. A little later 1 objected to his ruling in accordance with the procedure set out in the Standing Orders. I put my objection in writing. The motion of dissent was seconded by the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison). The incident itself is not of great importance, but the principle involved in it, affects all honourable members. If freedom of speech should exist anywhere, it certainly should exist in the Parliament of a democratic country. I believe that Mr Deputy Speaker acted hastily, due to a misunderstanding; and if he is fair, he' will agree that he did so. I think that he was not following the de bate closely, and did not realise that 1 intended only to touch lightly on certain subjects. On that occasion you, Mr . Speaker, in your address, mentioned certain matters in some detail, and that I felt justified in following your example. In order to give the facts associated with this happening, I fear that I must be rather personal in my remarks. Mr Deputy Speaker is rather I then inexperienced in the - conduct of the House; he has not your experience in the honor- chair, Mr Speaker. On that occasion, I believe that he acted too hastily, and that his restriction of ihe debate was unwarranted. If he had had more experience I do not think that he would have acted as he did. An incident which occurred in this chamber last night when the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) made a mild interjection",21
67,Mr SPEAKER,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,Order ! The honourable member irmay not refer to a discussion in committee.,22
68,Mr WHITE,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,"I am sorry that I am prevented from quoting from the record of last night's proceedings. Mr SPEAKER, - The Standing Orders prevent the honourable member from doing so.",22
69,Mr WHITE,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,"1 mentioned last night's incident because it was not you, Mr Speaker, who named the honourable member for Richmond, but the Deputy Speaker. If you were to give to your deputy a little training in the art of controlling the House, he might not be so hasty. After all, he should endeavour to uphold the. dignity of the Chair, as you endeavour to do, to the best of your ability. In a democracy it should be the practice of those most experienced in parliamentary procedure. - me n like yourself, Mr SPEAKER - to follow the best traditions of the parliamentary institution and set an example to the Parliament. If either you or your deputy does not set that example, but, on the contrary, behaves hastily, or does not show that tolerance or allow that freedom of speech which is our inheritance, there is a lack of decorum, and the parliamentary institution suffers. I have never said an unparliamentary thing in my eighteen years of parliamentary life. It is true that I speak vigorously and vehemently-and I intend to do so in the future-bu t some of the utterances made here, which go unchallenged by the Chair, make me wonder whether proper standards always prevail in this place. I shall not say more. I moved the motion of dissent because I believed that an injustice had been done to me. It is the duty of the Deputy Speaker, who is, after all, a recruit Speaker, to say that he made a mistake. I invite him to do so, and thus to follow the example of others who sometimes err. In this instance a withdrawal is warranted. As the honourable member for Darling gains experience he may, in time, prove a worthy deputy to you, sir, in this House. After I had been ordered to resume seat the honourable member for Wentable worth rose to order. He said I have listened with great interest to debate and have noticed that other honourable members have spoken about the basic wage, widows' and invalid and old-age pensions and matters of that kind which liave some bearing on the attitude of the Government towards certain sections of the community as compared with its attitude towards members ol the Parliament as disclosed by the bill now before us. I listened attentively to the speech of the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr. White) who endeavoured to link up matters concerning the pensions paid to ex-servicemen with the bill. I suggest that the Chair should permit him to continue his speech. I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the honourable member had no desire to flout the ruling of the Chair. I invite Mr Deputy Speaker to admit that he was precipitate on the occasion referred to and made a mistake.",22
70,Mr DEDMAN,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,"Corio-Minister for Defence, Minister for Post-war Reconstruction and Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) [3.39] - The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) claims that there has been considerable delay in discussing his notice of motion. If there has been any delay, it has been entirely the honourable member's own fault, as I shall show.",22
71,Mr WHITE,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,"On a point of order. I have been in attendance at every meeting of the Parliament, so I bake exception to that statement. I think the Minister was abroad at the time, so he is not speaking with any knowledge or authority.",22
72,Mr SPEAKER,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,"Order ! There must be no more frivolous interruptions, or there will be trouble.",22
73,Mr DEDMAN,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,"The honourable member is mistaken. I was in this chamber when the incident occurred. I left Australia only two days before the Parliament went into recess. The incident occurred when I was in the House. The honourable member suggests that there has been considerable delay. If there has been delay it was entirely through the fault of the honourable member himself. The incident arose in this way. On the 4th June last, the House was considering the Parliamentary Allowances Bill, and the honourable member for Balaclava proceeded to discuss the deferred pay of certain members of the Air Force. Mr. my Deputy Speaker called upon the honormember to confine his remarks to the matter before the House. The honorthis able member proceeded to argue with the Chair, and Mr Deputy Speaker warned him that if he persisted in defying the Chair by continued irrelevance, he would order him to resume his seat. The honourable member ignored the warning, and proceeded to speak on another matter unrelated to the Parliamentary Allowances Bill. He was thereupon ordered to resume his seat, and he then gave notice that he would move dissent from Mr Deputy Speaker's ruling. Standing Order 274 statesNo member shall digress from the subject matter of any question under discussion. Obviously Mr Deputy Speaker was within his rights in calling the honourable member for Balaclava, to order, and since the honourable member did not obey the ruling of the Chair, Mr Deputy Speaker was within his rights in calling upon the honourable member to resume his seat. Standing Order 276 is as follows: The Speaker may call the attention of the House to continued irrelevance . . . and may direct a member to discontinue his speech. But the honourable member could have taken action to have the matter determined there and then, because Standing Order 276 goes on to sayProvided that such member shall have the right to require that the question whether he be further heard be put, and thereupon such question shall he put without debate. Had the honourable member, instead of giving notice of dissent from the ruling of Mr Deputy Speaker, moved that he himself be further heard, the question could have been decided there and then. Had he done so the House, not Mr. Deputy Speaker, would have decided whether or not he could continue his speech. The honourable member did not exercise that right at the time. He declined the opportunity to put the matter to the House, and now he moves dissent from the ruling of Mr Deputy Speaker. I submit that the action of Mr Deputy Speaker was in conformity with the Standing Orders and the practice of the House, and that, moreover, he was doing his duty to honourable members by ensuring that the time of the House should not be wasted. Mr Deputy Speaker was justified in asking the honourable member to resume his seat, seeing that the honourable member had not complied with a ruling of the Chair, and had ignored a further warning. T therefore maintain that the action of Mr Deputy Speaker should be upheld, and that the House should reject the motion.",22
74,Mr HABRISON,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,"Wentworth) [3.45]. - I have just listened to an extraordinary defence offered by the Minister for Postwar Reconstruction (Mr Dedman), the burden-of which was that the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) had the opportunity to follow a certain line of action, and that, because he did not follow that line, he had no right to take any other action that was open to him under the Standing Orders. The Minister quoted a standing order to the effect that a member may not digress from the matter under discussion, and he claimed that Mr Deputy Speaker had acted under that standing order. The Minister then said that the honourable member for Balaclava had the right under another standing order to move that he be further heard. I point out, however, that by this time the matter had gone beyond' the s'.age of whether or not Ihe honourable member for Balaclava should be heard. The honourable member wished to dissent from the ruling of the Chair because he considered that the ruling givfli was not a proper one. Why should he ask the House to give him leave to continue his speech, if he believed that the Chair had given a wrong ruling? The Minister said that the honourable member for Balaclava washimself responsible for the delay that had occurred. That statement merely begs the question, because we know that the Government alone has the right to determine the order of business on the notice-paper. The Government, instead of allowing the motion of the honourable member for Balaclava to come up for discussion in June last, deliberately placed it low on the no!ice-paper in the expectation that so much time would elapse before it was considered that honourable members would have forgotten about it. or that the motion, when it did eome forward for discussion, would not be considered in a proper atmosphere. I well remember the incident, and the heat that it engendered. I remember how the honourable member for Balaclava sought to place another aspect of the matter before the House, and I remember how Mr. Deputy Speaker, with great heat, and with no show of that judicial calm which should characterize the occupant of that office, sought to impede the honourable member. That brings me to another point. We know the great responsibility that devolves upon the Chair. We know that it is the highest position to which this House can. elect one of its"" members. The occupant of the chair has a duty to guard the interests of honourable members, and not of a section of them. He is hot. there to protect the Government, but to protect the rights of all honourable members. Nevertheless, we have often had rulings and decisions from the Chair which, in my opinion, were tantamount to something out of Cole's Funny Book. I doubt whether there is any precedence to which many of them could be related. You, Mr Speaker, with your great knowledge of the forms and procedure of the House, should institute a class for beginners for the benefit of chairmen, so that you may instruct them in elementary procedure. I have noticed that when arguments are going against the Government, the chairmen tend to call the speaker to order, to restrict the range of debate, to divert attention, and to allow interjections-behaviou r which strikes at the very roots of parliamentary procedure. Tbey do that and ""get away"" with it because they know that they have the weight of numbers behind them to support their rulings. This 13 a case in point. I myself have suffered in. like manner. Unless you, yourself, Mr . Speaker, decide to take a hand in the conduct of affairs of the House when you are not in the Chair, proceedings in this chamber will tend to be conducted under ""Rafferty's rules"", and the value of the Parliament as a deliberative assembly will be destroyed.",23
75,Mr FALSTEIN,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,Watson) [3.51] Honourable members opposite make it a practice in debate to discuss any subject except that immediately before the Chair. That observation applies even on this occasion to the remarks of the two honourable members opposite who have just spoken. The fact of the matter is that the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) failed to take the opportunity provided under Standing Order 276 to have this matter determined.,24
76,Mr TTIOMTSOK,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,That is the only effective method.,24
77,Mr FALSTEIN,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,"Yes ; and that standing order prescribes the proper time for the determination of such a matter. Nevertheless, the honourable member for Balaclava now seeks to obtain a determination on an occasion much later in point of time.",24
78,Mr WHITE,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,"L gave notice of my motion on the night in question, and it has not been taken off the notice-paper.",24
79,Mr FALSTEIN,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,"It is not a question of when notice of the motion was given, because, in any event, such a motion could not have been discussed u n t i l the opportunity for so doing presented itself, and that would, inevitably, be on an occasion considerably later in point of time. It seems to me that the ruling given by Mr Deputy Speaker was proper, and, indeed, the only ruling which he could have given in the circumstances. The honourable member for Balaclava should have challenged it in accordance with Standing Order 276. However, to contend, as the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison) has said, that Mr Deputy Speaker relies upon the Government to use its weight of numbers to enforce his rulings is to ignore the facts. The time of the House is being wasted in discussing this matter when it must be obvious that the ruling given by Mr Deputy Speaker was a proper ruling.

THE PARLIAMENT. .UyvisiO-K OFSTANDING ORDER 280.",24
80,Mr SPEEDER,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,"Warringah) [4.6] - I Tellers: move That Standing Order 280 be amended by adding thereto the following:-""o r (4) by PAIRS . leave of the member speaking', to address a question to such member "". So that the motion may the understood it is necessary to refer to Standing Order 2S0 which readsNo member shall interrupt another member whilst speaking, unless (1) to request that his words be taken down; (2) to call attention to a point of Order or Privilege suddenly arising: or (3) to call attention to the want of^a Quorum. The purpose of my amendment is to add another exception to that standing order .. 26 which means generally, that complete .. 35 silence must be observed by all honourable members whilst somebody else is speaking. Majority It is designed to permit an honourable member, by leave of the person addressAVES. ing the House or the committee, to address a question to such person. This is a matter which I had hoped would be approached by all honourable members on a non-party basis, but from whisperings which came to me at lunch time today I gathered that the Labour party met this morning and that caucus decided to oppose this motion. Tellers : It seems to me to be carrying things too far to make party issues of questions which touch the rights and privileges of NOES. honourable members. The purpose of my motion is to bring this Parliament and its rules of debate more in accordance with modern practice and to give to this Parliament real powers of debate. It has become the practice for honourable members, particularly in second-reading speeches to state what they have prepared regardless of the point to which the debate has proceeded and irrespective of whether it bears upon the real issue or not. We have been accustomed to use this House merely as a base for the disTellers : semination of propaganda and not for the purpose for which it was designed, namely, to be a deliberative assembly. My second observation is-and I direct my attention only to Standing Order 280, although many others are equally cobwebbed with age and need to be replaced - that the standing order gives far too much arbitrary power to the presiding officer. I do not direct my attention to the occupant of the chair at the moment, nor to any particular occupant of the chair; I direct it to the general proposition irrespective of who may be in the chair. The standing order prescribes that no member shall interrupt another member whilst speaking, except in three very special and limited circumstances. It seems to me that this standing order, which to use a cliche, has been observed more in the breach than in the performance for a long time past, has led honourable members to believe, if not with truth, certainly in their hearts, that interruptions coming from one side of the chamber are viewed with disfavour, whilst those which come from the other side are viewed with benevolence. It may be that those on the Opposition side of the chamber who think, with great respect, that that has taken place more than once in the lifetime of this Parliament, may be basing their views on wrong premises. Be that as it may, it seems to me that the appearance of impartiality on the part of the Speaker or the Chairman is just as important as his actual impartiality itself. It is wrong for the Speaker of this chamber to have the right to treat interruptions benevolently in respect of the party to which he belongs, and harshly in respect of its opponents. It seems to me to be of extreme importance that when a Minister is addressing the chamber an honourable member rising in his place should have the right, by leave of that Minister, to direct to him a pertinent question aimed at securing information vital to the discussion, or at keeping the Minister to the issue. That surely is the whole value of debate in this legislature. If not, we may call it a parliament, but it no longer is a parliament. I difect attention now to the practices operating in other countries. ""When I have been overseas T have always endea oured to take time off to visit Mr Spender. other parliaments and see how they conduct their affairs. In the Mother of Parliaments, the provision that I am now seeking has been the practice for a long time. In the Canadian Parliament, No. 24S of the Rules and Forms statesWhilst a member is addressing the House, no one has a right to interrupt him hy putting a question to him . . . I am not claiming that right. I am claiming the privilege of asking a member who is addressing the chamber to permit me to put a question to him. . . or by making or demanding an explanation. A member will at times allow such interruptions through a sense of courtesy to another, but it is entirely at the option of the member in possession of the floor to give way or not to an immediate explanation. We on this side of the chamber contend that it is not for Mr Speaker to protect a Minister by calling "" Order!"" A Minister should be prepared to stand in his place and say whether or not he will permit a question to be directed to him. If a Minister never allowed a. question to be put to him, he would very soon be marked as one who had not the courage to meet debate when it arose. That probably is the real reason why this Government will not support my motion. If a Minister has the capacity to argue he will not be afraid of any question that may be put to him. On the contrary, he will welcome questions so that his ability to put his own case may be revealed, and the questions clarified, or his own mind clarified by the pertinence of the observations or questions put to him. In the United States of America, the House Manual and Digest statesA member desiring to interrupt another in debates should address the Chair for permission of the member speaking, but the latter may exercise his own discretion as to whether or not lie will yield. I recall one debate to which I listened in the American Senate. SenatOT Tydings, of Maryland, was debating the question of overriding the veto of the President on a taxation measure. The Senate proposed merely to alter the date of the coming into operation of certain taxation concessions- a matter on .which Senator Tydings had changed the view that he had held on the previous occasion. He was explaining why he had changed his view, and to me the debate was most interesting. ""While Senator Tydings - addressing the chamber other senators rose from time to time and asked whether here? he would yield. If Senator Tydings would not yield, the challenger would resume his seat, but if Senator Tydings would yield, the new speaker would say perhaps that the issue of the matter 30 and so, or- "" the real point I seeking to make is so and so. Will you answer that?"" That practice seems to the to be essential in debate. For many years past the tendency has been lior honourable members to come into chamber with prepared speeches some which have no real bearing on the issue. One honourable member deals with a particular subject-matter and is followed by another who pea-haps deals with the same subject-matter but ignores the point issue. I have before me No. 163 of Vol. of the Parliamentary Debates of the liome of Commons, dated the 13th hands of Mr Speaker. August of this year. A perusal of this report shows how proceedings are conducted in that legislature. I draw attention particularly to a. discussion reported  Hammersmith North, was speaking and was dealing with a speech that had made by the member for Horsham, Earl  speech, Earl Winterton rose, stating that  had been made by him, he wanted to interrupt the speech and put a certain  his speech. Later, Earl Winterton interrupted and said : "" But, surely, this is a completely different point. I do not rliink I shall be giving away an official  continued his speech. Subsequently, Mr Marples, the member for Wallasey,  not, give way. He said, "" No, I cannot give way to the honourable member, I have made no charge against him "". Mr. Marples then resumed his seat. On that  cising his right in accordance with the forms of the House. As this practice is followed in the Mother liaments, in Canada, and in the Senate of the United States of America- I have not been present at a debate in Congress, was but I understand the same procedure applies-wh y should it not be adopted Earlier today it was common talk in the corridors of this building- I heard it from a pressman-that this very matter was debated by caucus this mornwas ing, and that caucus decided against my am proposal. I invite honourable members opposite to say whether or not that is so. It is a most serious and shameful thing that mere questions of procedure in this House should he made party matters. this Is the Government afraid of debate? Is of it afraid of an honourable member rising in his place and asking a Minister to "" yield "" so that he may ask a question or state the real point at issue ?. The adoption of this practice in this House is long at overdue. For seeking to direct a question to a Minister in the course of a recent debate I was suspended from the service 441 of the House. Our present procedure places far too much discretion in the",25

83,Mr THOMPSON,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,"The honourable member would - rise to address a question to the honourable member speaking. I have had long experience of parliamentary Standing Orders and of men in the chair. Our Standing Orders were not put into operation by the present Government. Except for a few of Paramendments, they have operated for many years. I say with due kindness that it is rather remarkable that, having suffered a penalty for having disobeyed the Standing Orders, the honourable member now attempts to have them altered.",27

85,Mr THOMPSON,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,If I was not bigger than the honourable member for Swan (Mr Hamilton) I should be very small. I prefaced my remark by saying that it was not meant unkindly. The honourable member for Warringah was a member of a government that made no effort to amend the Standing Orders as he now desires them to be amended.,28

87,Mr THOMPSON,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,"I do not object to questions. I am always happy to answer as many questions as honourable members opposite like to put to me. But because interjections do not worry me and are, in fact, welcomed by me is no reason for altering the procedure in the manner suggested by the honourable member for Warringah. Other honourable members may not like to be placed at a disadvantage by being diverted from; their arguments. Having been diverted they may find'difficulty in returning to the points they were making when interrupted.",28

89,Mr THOMPSON,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,The honourable member is unable to listen to other honourable members without interjecting. That in itself is a good reason for the retention of the standing order in present form. Before the honourable member recently got into trouble with the Chair he hardly ceased interjecting. Mr. Speaker allowed him to interject almost interminably. I wondered why he was being given so much latitude.

91,Mr THOMPSON,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,"Interjection s so frequent as those of the honourable member before his suspension would never have been permitted by whoever was in the chair when his party was in power, f recollect reading recently in a newspaper that in the Senate of the United States of America, when one senator was speaking, a bright young senator in one of the back seats rose and asked leave to put a question. The senator addressing the Senate, kindly yielded. I forget the exact time it took for the senator seeking information to ask his question, but i't was between ten and eleven hours.",28
92,Mr SPENDER,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,That is an abuse that could be easily dealt with.,28
93,Mr THOMPSON,IMPORTATIO N OF JAPANES E,"That was certainly an abuse of a privilege. I do not know whether the honourable member has considered the time limit on speeches. With a time limit imposed on honourable members, any honourable member, by the device of asking leave to interject, could occupy unduly a portion of the honourable member's time. I remind the honourable member for Warringah that he said that if a Minister refused leave to another honourable member to ask a question during his speech, he would show that he was afraid to answer questions.",28

He would then expect me to sit down and keep quiet while he asked me questions. Unless I knew what the question was to be, it would be difficult for me to say that I was prepared to let him ask it. There would be no sense in a standing order that gave the honourable member the right to ask a question, with the leave of the member, unless'the member was prepared to hear the question. Almost the whole time allotted by the Standing Orders to an honourable member to make a speech could be taken up by other honourable members asking him questions. Moreover, an honourable member could be helped if he were floundering by *n adroit leading question asked one of his colleagues. The honourable member for Warringah, as a lawyer, ought to know how easy it is to put a man on to a particular line of thought by means of a nicely worded leading question. The more I look at the proHonorable posed amendment, the more it appears to me that instead of helping honourable members, it would obstruct them.

The arguments of the honourable member for Reid were fully disposed of when the Minister said thai he would allow the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) and the Leader of Ihe Australian Country party (Mr. Fadden) to examine the files and that, if they saw anything in the documents which they thought honourable members should know, he would be prepared to present the information to the House.",29

I am sure that ultimately its effect will be to create a great flow of immigrants to Australia.

112,Mr CHAMBERS,ADMINISTRATION OF,"I am expressing my own views this afternoon. I did not say that I was expressing the views of the Minister for External Territories. Were I not acting for the Minister for External Territories, I should still have the right to express my opinion in this debate on matters pertaining to the administration of Papua and New Guinea. I welcome this opportunity to give to the House additional information about the steps which the Government is taking to rehabilitate Papua and New Guinea, and to carry out its programme for the advancement of those territories and their inhabitants. The cardinal points of the Government's policy are the fullest possible development of the territories, and the social, economic and political advancement of their inhabitants. However, non-native expansion must be governed by the well-being of the indigenous inhabitants of the territories as a whole.",31
113,Mr WHITE,ADMINISTRATION OF,"I rise to order. On the 1st May last, the Minister for External Territories replied fully to the matters which I raised when I submitted my motion, and even obtained an extension of time. I have not had an. opportunity to reply, yet the Minister for the Army has intervened to continue the debate on behalf of the Government. A speaker from this side of the chamber should have received the call.",31
114,Mr ACTING DEPUTYSPEAKER,ADMINISTRATION OF," Order ! The Minister for the Army rose, and received the call. He is quite in order in continuing the debate.",31
115,Mr CHAMBERS,ADMINISTRATION OF,"Whil e the territories of Papua and New Guinea have undoubted natural resources, the indigenous population is comparatively In his small, numbering approximately 1,250,000 persons. Before the outbreak is the of World War II . , there was a concentration upon the use of native labour by Europeans, to the detriment of the development by the natives, as individuals, of their own agriculture. The Australian Government is determined to give to the natives an opportunity to advance in their own right, and not be merely individuals employed by non-native agriculturists and industrialists. In order to achieve this objective, the Government must provide full facilities for better health and education, and for a greater participation by the natives in the wealth of their country and eventually in its government. The task of restoring civil administration to an area as vast as Papua and New Guinea would be, in any circumstances, one of magnitude. The territories have been a huge battleground. Nearly every settlement has been devastated, and public utilities, including small ships which are so vital to the islands, have been destroyed. The commercial activities and the organized life of the inhabitants have been completely disrupted. The whole economy of the territories was virtually destroyed during the war. When reading the speech of the honourable member for Balaclava, I discovered that his severest criticism was that the Government and the Minister for External Territories were giving too much consideration to the conditions of native labourers in New Guinea and Papua. He referred to improved labour conditions for the natives, and to the fact that the Commonwealth proposed to expend £'1S,000 upon the erection of a model native village at Hanuabada. Criticism was also directed at the payments now being made to the indentured native labourers. I was in New Guinea from the early part of 1941 until the middle of 1942, which was a. very anxious period in New Guinea, and I witnessed some of the work which the natives did. They are known to Australian servicemen as the "" fuzzy-wuzzy a n g e l s and we can never repay them sufficiently for what they did. They gave their lives in thousands, most of their property was destroyed, and they were conscripted and taken from their homes and villages. The natives of Papua and New Guinea were completely at the disposal of the armed forces. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the Government to repay them in someway for the invaluable service which they rendered to the Allies, and to Australian servicemen in particular. When I first visited New Guinea in the early part of 1941 the natives' conditions were not good and, generally, their state of health was far from satisfactory. I remember seeing queues of them a mile long at the early morning - pick parades.",31
116,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,ADMINISTRATION OF,"A queue one mile long would represent 5,000 men if ; they were in single file. I Mr CHAMBERS - I frequently saw parties of natives a mile long; and if the honourable member knows New Guinea at all he should know that the natives usually walk in single file. They were suffering from serious types of malaria, tropical ulcer's and other diseases, was obvious that before the arrival of the armed forces there had been little provision for their medical treatment. When they discovered that they could receive treatment from the armed forces they came along in hundreds. Their living conditions were bad, and from Ela Beach and other beaches they could be seen returning from the hills where they had been working to spend the night in their lakatois because they had no other accominodation. Lakatois are very small vessels, not as large as a rowing boat. At Port Moresby whole families of natives were living under those condisecretary tions. The only educational facilities available to them was that provided by the missions. Prior to the Japanese bombardment of the country, I saw nativeboys who had been educated at the missions working in the stores of BurnsPhilp and Company Limited and in other places. Those nativespossessed a high degree of intelligence, and it was clear that,, if given the opportunity, they would become an asset to Australia. Many displayed considerable ability and were able to work side by side with British and Australian employees. A white man working at one of these stores received a wage of £4 to £5 a week, or perhaps more, but the native boys did exactly the same work for a wage of 5s. a month.. The Government has decided that this, state of affairs shall not continue, and that if natives are to be employed they must be paid a wage at least commensurate with what they do. It has alsodecided to improve their conditions, and now intends to spend money on the construction of a new village to replace one which was destroyed during the war. It proposes to provide medical facilities and to make available to them educational facilities. Surely no member of this House can condemn the Government or the Minister for External Territoriesfor endeavouring to ensure that the natives receive the treatment to which they are justly entitled. I do not think it is necessary for me to say anythingfurther, other than to point out that the honourable member for Balaclava was given every opportunity to voice hiscomplaint-in fact he was granted an. and it extension of time-and the Minister for Externa] Territories has already explained the position very clearly. Even if the Minister had been present in the House today I do not think that he could have made the position, any clearer. The Government should becommended for its policy in regard to the improvement of the natives' conditions, because, after all, it proposes only to give to them something to which they are justly entitled.",32
117,Mr ANTHONY,ADMINISTRATION OF,"Richmond) [4.57] I have in my possession letters from the of the Citizens Association of New Guinea and others who ask that something should be said in this House to express their dissatisfaction at the conditions imposed upon them. Unfortunately, white residents of New Guinea have very little means of making known their complaints, and since they constitute an important outpost for Australia, regard should be paid to their representations. The development of New Guinea by white people is at least as important to the future security of Australia as the welfare of the natives, important though that consideration may be. Although these people are giving - their lives to serve in a tropical climate in order to maintain our northern outpost, they - complain that their case is not considered at all, and that in their - efforts to develop New Guinea they are discouraged by the Australian Government in every possible way. The only information at present in my possession is that which has come to me through letters which I have received from New Guinea, and at this stage I - do not propose to criticize the new system for the employment of native labour introduced by the Government because, frankly, I do not know sufficient about it. For that reason I think that the Government should provide facilities for - members of this House to visit Papua - and New Guinea in order to obtain a first-hand knowledge of the country-as was done by governments prior to the war-so that they can express themselves in this Parliament from certain knowledge. However, as I lack the opportunity to visit New Guinea, I put forward some of the facts which have been presented to me. Residents of Lae, in particular, are critical of the port facilities, - or rather the lack of them. For instance, the secretary of the Citizens Association of New Guinea has written stating that there are practically no facilities for unloading cargo at that port. He points out that when a ship arrives at the wharf, a good deal of the cargo falls into the harbour because there are no nets or other landing gear, and the unfortunate person to whom the goods are consigned, having already paid duty on them, has to go without the goods, and is then refused a refund of the duty. I ask that this charge be investigated. So incensed are the white residents of New Guinea that I understand there is a movement afoot to present their case to the Mandates Commission. Surely there can be no greater reflection upon an Australian government than that Australians should consider presenting to the Mandates Commission at Lake Success, in the United States of America, a petition praying that they be protected against the Australian Government. These residents say that they have lost everything. They were chased out of New Guinea by the Japanese. Some of the planters lost their lives in fighting a vanguard aetion against the invader. It was they who took the first blow. Those who survived found their way to Australia, where some took jobs in factories and munitions works, while others joined the armed forces. When the war was over, and the battle won, they returned to New Guinea, and found bomb holes where their homes had stood. They found their plantations overgrown by jungle. One man told me that, so complete was the devastation'in his area, that he could not even identify the spot where hi3 home had been. Since their return, it has been explained to me, a good many of them have been living on the payments received from the War Damage Commission as compensation for the loss of their homes, plantations, &c. Thus, they are being compelled to eat into their capital. Many of the children and young people who have returned to New Guinea were born there. They are the very best kind of citizens that we could have in such an area. However, the people are becoming discouraged and heart-broken. Indeed, they must have reached the ultimate in despair when Australians speak of going before the Mandates Commission in the hope of receiving fair treatment. The Minister for the Army (Mr Chambers), and the Minister for External Territories (Mr Ward), who, unfortunately, is not present because of his visit overseas, have said much about looking after the natives. Of course, it is our duty to look after the natives. No one in this House wants to see the natives improperly exploited, but there should be a measure of realism in regard to the natives, who must still go a long way before they are educated and civilized, and before they reach the position where they can be treated in the same way as white men. The white settlers in New Guinea are trying to establish plantations for the production of copra, coffee and rubber, commodities which are necessary to Australia, and they should be encouraged by the Australian Administration . This is necessary if New Guinea is to be developed, and if the natives themselves are to be civilized, but the development of New Guinea cannot proceed without adequate supplies of native labour. Australians certainly will not go there to work on copra plantations. Therefore, the planters must rely on a reasonable supply of native labour. I agree that the natives should be properly paid, but they should be paid in accordance with a standard expected by the natives themselves. The plantations cannot be successfully worked if the natives are virtually unionized, and put on a 40-hour week. I do not say that these things are actually being done, but they are indicative of the kind of thing that is taking place. For instance, native workers may not now be kept on a plantation for more than twelve months. At the expiration of that time, they must be sent back to their own villages, whereas previously workers stayed with their employer for several years. It is claimed that a native is not of much use on a plantation for the first few months; yet now, by the direct order of the Minister, he must be returned to his village after twelve months' service. . It is said that the native has the option of returning to the plantation to work again, but any one familiar with native custom knows that once the workers on a plantation are dispersed it is very difficult to get them back again. I am not sufficiently informed on this subject to be able to speak with the authority I should like. My information has come to me from communications sent by organizations of settlers in the north, who have selected me, and some other honourable members of this House, to speak for them because of the interest we have displayed in their affairs over the years. I demand that the Government should give more sympathetic ment to these people, upon whpm Australia depends to maintain our position Mr Anthony. in New Guinea. How can Australia claim first title to a mandate over New Guinea if we are not prepared to develop the country? And how, I ask, can the country be developed except by white men and women from Australia who are prepared to spend their lives in the tropics? Tn order to induce them to do so, they should be assured of a greater financial reward than might be considered appropriate for those who remain in the capital cities of Australia. They are not getting that treatment. Under the present administration they are regarded as exploiters. People who have developed Papua and New Guinea are scorned and insulted by the Government, instead of being encouraged. I ask for a different approach to the problems of these territories. It would be of tremendous advantage if facilities were provided to enable as many members of the Parliament as are interested to visit New Guinea to study conditions there on the spot, so that they may be able to decide what measures are called for. I suggest that a committee consisting of members of all political parties should visit New Guinea. Motio n (by Mr GEORGE LAWSON) putThat the debate be new adjourned. The House divided. (MB.

118,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"Barker) [ 5 . 1 6 ] , - I have with me in the chamber a number of books, some of which have been published recently. Yesterday, [ received from the Government of Canada a book entitled The Canadian Official Hand-book and today I received from the Australian Government a book with the title This is Australia. I shall compare the two publications. I believe that everything that any one can reasonNOES. ably desire to know about the Dominion of Canada is contained in its official hand-book- a volume of 264 pages, with a good map, the whole being printed on Canadian newsprint at the cost of so many dollars. The Australian book contains 400 pages, and is well illustrated. It also is made of Canadian newsprint at the cost of dollars. First, I shall deal with the treatment of the different capital cities of Australia in This is Australia. If ever bias was PAIRS.' shown in an official publication, it i.= shown in the treatment of Australia's capital cities. Canberra is given two pages, and is shown partly in colour. It will be more coloured when I have finished speaking. Sydney is honoured with six pages. One page suffices for Melbourne and also for Adelaide. Brisbane has been allotted two pages, one (Grievance of which, perhaps significantly, if Day.) coloured red. Two coloured pages are devoted to Perth. Hobart has one page, as has Launeeston. COMMISSIONI now turn to the most amazing stateOF STAFFS- ment that I have ever read in connection with banks. The first bank mentioned is the Commonwealth Bank; after it , there is a reference to savings banks and then two pages are devoted to the trading banks of Australia. I cannot believe that the Minister for Information (Mr . Calwell) saw this volume before it was printed. He and that other great democrat, the Minister for Transport (Mr-. TELE- Ward) , were, away fro m Australia when the decision to nationalize the banks was made. What does the Minister say about the trading banks in this publication? I shall read his testimonial to the trading banks so that every word may appear in Hansard. It readsThe system of trading banks in Australia ha? developed into a group of large banks, of great financial strength with networks of branches all over the country. In fact, the branch system is as typical of Australian banking as it is of banking in Scotland, where it - originated. In the early life of Australian banking few branches were established; in fact, in 1850 Australian banks had only nine branches between them. In 1893, on the other hand, they had 1,4T0 branches, and continued development brought the number of branches to well over 3,000 before the present war. In many difficult periods in Australian banking experience the branch banking system has shown its strength and resilience. During the 1931 depression, for instance, none of the established banks failed That is a great t r i but e to those banksin marked contrast with experience in the United States, a country which relies mainly on "" u n it "" banks. Another feature which has contributed to the strength of the banking system is the size of the individual banks of which it is comprised. This feature is an effect, to some extent, of the process of amalgamations and absorptions which began (lin ing the 1014-18 war, and reduced the number of Australian trading banks from twenty in 11117 to nine in .1931. While this process has given the Australian banking system ureater strength than ever before, it has not impaired the keen competition between the banks which is necessary to ensure good service to the public at minimum cost. That is the t e s t i m o n i a l of the Minister for Information , that r e p o s it o r y of truth , wisdom, and excellence. I continue the quotationAnother characteristic hanking is the particularly reserves which the banks maintain. Imnking, it is true, permits the iif. reserves and so increases their lint large reserves have proved necessary in Australia because a big proportion advances are made to primary Fluctuating prices or seasonal vagaries may at any time force these people to seek assistance from their bankers-generally them at the same time. enable banks to "" carry on"" their through bad seasons. Without this would be impossible. typical of Australian banking is the overdraft <yttem. Under this system the banks do not provide a fixed loan, upon the whole of which interest must he paid, a.? would a mortgage bank, but establish an agreed limit up to which a customer's account may be overdrawn, mid charge hiin interest only on the actual daily debit balance of his account. especially suited to Australian Many borrowers have wide seasonal in their need for accommodation, pay much less interest under the system than they would under a system of fixed advances. A wool-grower, for example, may receive only one payment a year for his flip, while his expenses are fairly evenly spread over the season. Moreover, he might find it hard to meet the repayment fixed loan in a bad seiison; an overdraft, on the other hand, can vary according to the borrower's needs from season to season, with no fixed repayment schedule. tioned, the trading banks invest a substantial portion of tlieir resources in loans to primary producers. They provide, not only the shortterm seasonal finance, the working connected with preparing a crop, or with running a sheep property, but in many cases a substantial Mr Archie Cameron. the primary producers' fixed capital. This means that bank advances, though technically repayable on demand, are in actual practice considerably less liquid than bank loans in countries wheTe this system is not in operation. In the same way many manufac^ turers and traders obtain not only working capital but also a proportion of their fixed capital by borrowing from their bankers.

T he q u o t at i on continuesUndertakings with good prospects of success, in spite of their lack of orthodox security, should offer a f r u it f u l field for extension of post-war lending. On the part of the trading banks, mark youThe banks have always provided funds for housing, both by advancing money to buyers aud by financing the operations of builders. There is now a. very wide scope for expansion of this type of finance. That is the statement of a responsible publishe Minister on the future of the trading t banks, delivered to members of the Oppoi sition this very afternoon. This is the to last paragraph, and it, too, is introduced in very heavy typeCurrent Legislation. No review of the AusL tralian banking system would be complete without a reference to the banking legislation recently passed by the Commonwealth Parliament. The legislation divides roughly into c i r c u l at ed in a n o r d in a r y envelope. three classes. The first is designed to make permanent the war-time controls over the trading hanks. It covers such matters as foreign exchange control, the fixing of interest rates for banking transactions, and the advance policy of the trading banks. In addition, credit policy generally is to be controlledby means of a system of "" special accounts"" out in the Commonwealth Bank in which the trading banks can be required to place funds coining into their hands through increases d in their deposits. The second feature of the legislation is the abolition of the Commonwealth Bank Board and with it the status t - of the bank as an instrumentality independent of the Government and responsible only to Parliament. Iustead the bank is to be by a Governor who is to be aided by an Advisory Council, but subject to direction of the Commonwealth Treasurer in matters of policy. Thirdly, the functions of the bank are to be expanded by the establishment of special departments to make - loans for housing and for loans to industry. I u addition the Commonwealth Bank is to be directed to seek general banking business actively. The technical efficiency of the trading banks is not in question; .matter is fundamentally one of control. Not ownership, but c o n t r o l unatThe trading banks have shown themselves to lie seriously perturbed by the legislation. It will probably be some time, perhaps many years, before its f u ll effects on the Australian is bunking system can be judged. Although o n says the 'lew legislation introduces an element, o: uncertainty as to the direction of post-war development in banking, some lines his are reasonably clear. Housing finance will provide a greater outlet than before the war for bank funds, while personal loans-smal l loans without security-ar e a comparatively new development which should expand. One thing is certain, that the banking system will , in the future, provide effectively for the banking financial needs of Australia.

133,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"Not only must we know who was responsible for compiling that article; but it is also something which the Government must stand up to, because the Government cannot go to the country saying that it is in the public interest and essential to nationalize the trading banks of Australia, and, at the same time, publish an article of that kind, which is the most fulsome eulogy of the private banking system of Australia that I have ever read. If it had been prepared at the headquarters of the Bank of New South Wales, or the Union Bank, or if the man who prepared the statement quoted by the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) which was blown out on Tuesday was put onto the job, they could not have produced a better eulogy of the private banking system. This calls for a lot of explanation from the Minister for Information.",38

He has delivered a tirade entirely on supposition. If he had turned to the first page of the book he would have read that it was produced and edited by Oswald L . Ziegler with the collaboration of the Australian Department of Information, and with the cooperation of the Australian Government and the State Governments of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania. He would have seen that it was published by Oswald L.

138,Mr CALWELL,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"I was approached by Mr Ziegler, on behalf of this private company in New South Wales, the chairman of which is Mr E. C. Sommerlad, M.L.C., a member of the Country party in the Legislative Council of New South Wales, and asked whether the Department of Information would assist it to publish a standard, or an excellent, work on Australia, because it was felt by many people in Australia and overseas that we did not have a really first-class work on Australia to sell, or to give, to those seeking information about this country. I agreed to assist. I supplied pictures, as did the various people that I have mentioned. The Governments of Western Australia, South Australia, . Victoria, Queensland, New South Wales and Tasmania bought two or more pages in the publication, and', as a result, pictures of che capital cities in those States were displayed in the voluma The Government of New South Wales bought more pages than the other State governments. The Australian Government paid a subsidy of about £250 in respect of the production. The whole enterprise was financed by the company I have mentioned, and the publication cost many thousands of pounds to produce. It has been placed on the market and is selling at 18s. a volume, whilst the de luxe volume is being sold at £3 3s. The American and British publication rights have already been sold by Mr. Ziegler and his friends. All of the profits made will go to the entrepreneurs responsible for its production, in consideration of the assistance given by the Department of Information and other Commonwealth departments, and in return for the small subsidy we made, the company contracted to give u.s several hundred copies of the publication. I received these in due course and, as a matter of courtesy, sent copies to every member and senator with my compliments. Was there anything wrong: with that? Can anybody who can discuss the matter intelligently tell me where I have erred ? The trading banks purchased copies from the company. The story of the trading banks was written by the banking organizations themselves; .the story of the Commonwealth Bank was written by officials of that bank. I regarded it as the function of my department to help publicize Australia, both through the instrumentality of the department itself and in collaboration with all people of good will. I do not care what the trading banks have to say in their own defence. If they liked to buy space in a publication which we helped to publish for the purpose of bringing new people to Australia, and new industries to this country, and of telling the world more about Australia, they were entitled to use that space as they wished. In assisting the publication of this book, I think I have done a. worthwhile job for Australia. J leave the unrepentent ""penitent"" writhing on the horns of the dilemma of his own creation.",39
139,Sir EARLE PAGE,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"Cowper) [5.42] The Minister for Information (Mr. Calwell) has just made the most astounding statement. I have ever heard from the lips of a Minister of the Crown. This morning, members of this Parliament received as a gift from the Government, sent to them with the compliments . of 'the Minister, a copy of the book This is Australia. I received my copy at about lunch time. Yet at 5.30 p.m. on this same day the Minister repudiates many of the statements contained in it. To make certain that people will believe the book to be about Australia there are photographs first of the King, then of the former Governor General, the Duke of Gloucester and his family, and finally of the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley), together with an introduction by the right honourable gentleman, under the Commonwealth coat of arms, inviting people to come to Australia, and saying, in effect, "" These are the things you can expect to find here; these are the things that make Australia attractive "". The right honourable gentleman concludes his statement by saying "" I have great faith in the future greatness of this country. Those who feel they can share that faith are welcome here "". On pages 44 and 45 there appears a statement by the Minister for Information headed "" Sinews of Society"", in which the honourable gentleman attempts to set out what Australia can provide. He repeated in that statement many of the things he has been saying overseas when asking people to come to Australia. He invites people to come to this country where there have been tremendous developments. What has made these tremendous developments possible ? Mr DRAKEI'OKD - The wise administration by Labour governments.",39
140,Sir EARLE PAGE,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"If the honourable gentleman will look at the statute-book of this Parliament he will find that a few years after a Labour government has gone out of office not one statute passed by it has remained unamended. The Minister for Information goes on to point out that this development has been made possible by private enterprise, and then he says, in effect, "" This is what we offer you; this is what we ask you to come and enjoy "". Not one suggestion was made in the long extract read by 'the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) relating bo the trading banks that the private banks would be completely eliminated. People are being attracted to Australia under false pretences. Why are these statements broadcast to the world if they are not true ? The Department of Information has contributed money to enable this publication to be produced. It provided all the paper on which this publication is printed.",40
141,Mr CALWELL,MARITIME INDUSTRY,It did nothing of the kind. It did not provide the paper.,40
142,Sir EARLE PAGE,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"The Government must have provided the dollars to enable the paper to be procured. What right has the Government to sponsor a publication, ostensibly an official document containing photographs of His Majesty the King, a former Australian Governor General and the Prime Minister, and containing statements by Ministers of State, and then say, "" We do not believe in some of the statements contained in this publication. Much of what is contained in it is only so much ' baloney'"". What is stated in the publication in regard to the trading banks is undeniably true, and that is why it was published. Those statements could not be faulted in any respect. The statements concerning the trading banks amply demonstrate how necessary are the private banks to the preservation of our way of life. I invite honourable members to read the War History of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia which was published in June of this year. In page after page of that history frequent reference is made to the co-operation and patriotic assistance rendered by the trading banks to the war effort. The disclaimer now voiced by the Minister constitutes the most ungenerous statement. I have ever heard. Notwithstanding that his department made a contribution to the cost of producing the book, no sooner had it been issued than the honourable gentleman says, "" I do not believe one-half of the things contained in it "" . If that be so, what reliance can we place on other publications bearing the imprimatur of the Minister? This publication has been sent out to the world, which assumes that the statements contained in it are made in good faith. If they are bona fide statements why should the Minister endeavour to repudiate them? Why should he now cover himself by saying, ""Somebody else wrote them. I did not even see them"". Is it right that the honourable gentleman should come to the Parliament and say in regard to a publication of this kind, "" The statements made on pages so and so are not true "". Surely this is the most extraordinary statement that has ever been made by a Minister of the Crown in any Parliament of the world. No one else would have the effrontery to deal with the matter as the honourable gentleman has done. It is perhaps worthwhile taking this opportunity to say something about the idea circulated throughout the country by various members of the Labour party that to get "" oodles "" of money by way of overdrafts that will never be called up we have only to commandeer the trading banks. We are all aware of the pitiful cases brought before this Parliament simply because the rigid rules made by the Repatriation Department and War Service Homes Commission have been infringed. Let us consider for a moment a report published in May last by an important bank, the Rural Bank of New South Wales. The report statesBorrowers in financial difficulties due to circumstances beyond their control were extended every consideration in accordance with the bank's usual policy and only when there was no hope of a settler's rehabilitation - was action taken to exercise powers as mortgagees. However, where through neglect of securities try. or for some other reason it was considered necessary to protect our interests, the bank did not hesitate to take appropriate action. There were 700 liens executed in favour the bank during the year under review proceeds collected under this form of security totalled £309,812. In accordance with our usual procedure, which has met with approval of all interested parties in the an amount of £195,375 was distributed the proceeds collected. Circumstances rendered it necessary to up the loans of 21 borrowers during the year. The bank was in possession, as mortgagee, nineteen properties as at June 30, 1940, of from which one was leased with option of purchase, history of this commission, I three were available for private sale, mainder having been withheld from sale for various reasons. The sales of 38 properties were completed during the year and three holdings were clared forfeited and reverted to the Crown, dross losses totalling £29,311 were incurred, hut this contingency was provided for at the end of the preceding year. In additioii to <ales which were completed, contracts for sale of 34 properties were current and in cess of completion as at 30th June, 1946. Dealing with advances for homes, the port states that during the year it necessary for the bank to repossess three properties and that at the 30th Sxme, 1946, the bank was in possession 343 securities on which money was owing. I should not condemn any bank for that. When a bank seeks deposits, it must offer security and must give a promise proper and efficient handling of accounts. Whatever justification there may the nationalization of the private it is a poor argument to say that will have money shovelled out to them in not denied. the manner suggested. There has not matter should be forthcoming. been any more hardship at the hands of the private banks than at the hands of government-controlled institutions. I glad that the honourable member f o Barker has taken this opportunity place on record the story of the private banks published under the imprimatur of the Minister for Information (Mr backs. Oalwell), and carrying a photograph of the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley), apparently the article reveals exactly what they feel in their hearts. Before resuming my seat, I wish refer to another most important matter. I ask the Government why the Maritime Industries Commission, which, so f a can gather, has no statutory authority, should have the right to impose industrial conscription upon the people of this 110] The commission certainly has no authority to do so from this Parliament and if it has any .such authority of fro m a State parliament it should not and exercise it , because the workers with whom it is concerned are subject to Comthe monwealth arbitration laws. Recently, past, the commission dismissed four marine from engineers who had dealt legally with a fireman. These engineers have been excall cluded fro m their industry and have had of all chance of earning a livelihood taken them. Looking into the find the rethat it has taken similar action with firemen and seamen. I understand - that the waterfront dislocation that dehas arisen recently is due entirely to the commission's dismissal of the four engineers. Surely it is not right that men the should be excluded from an industry in the which they have spent their working lives proand upon which they rely for their livelihood. I understand that Judge Kelly is reto inquire into this dispute, and I put it was to the Government that one aspect of the only matter to which particular attention should be directed is the origin of the of commission's powers to say to an employee, "" Y o u cannot practise your profession or trade in this country "". Surely that is of the essence of industrial conof scription and direction; but that is what has happened according to statebe for ments published repeatedly in the banks, press during the last four or five people weeks and, so far as I am aware, An explanation of this If it is necessary that this power should be the exercised, then let us tackle the problem am properly as it has been tackled in Great r Britain , where Sir Stafford Cripps has to been given certain statutory powers. It is a matter for this Parliament and not something that should be done behind our",40
143,Unknown,MARITIME INDUSTRY,Sitting suspended from 5.56 to S p.m.,41
144,Mr LANG,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"Reid) [8.0] - The conduct of certain members of the Commonwealth to Parliament while abroad has raised very grave issues, and those issues demand the immediate attention of this Parliament. r as I They involve their attitude towards the public purse. Matters of high principle and public probity are at stake. It is my counconsidered opinion that certain members have disqualified themselves under the Constitution and are no longer competent to remain as members of this Parliament. Before a member can qualify to sit in the House, he must satisfy certain conditions, and one of those conditions is that he shall hold no office of profit under the Crown or have any direct or indirect pecuniary interest in any agreement with the Comanonwealth. The purpose of that provision is to act as a safeguard against corruption of the Parliament. At the same time the Constitution lays down that members shall receive an allowance, that allowance to be fixed by the Parliament. But that was to be the only reward and the only remuneration that a member can receive for his services to the Parliament. That was the clear intention: that no member shall be corrupted by being offered a reward for his vote or his services while he is a member of the Parliament. This principle is set out in section 45 of the Constitution, which statesIf a senator or member, of the House of Representatives(iii.) directly or indirectly takes to take any fee or honorarium for services rendered to the Commonreturned wealth, or for services rendered the Parliament to any person State: his place shall thereupon become vacant. That provision is fundamental to the parliamentary system. Yet, in months, it has been violated, not once, many times. The Government has introdollars. duced the system of rewards for private members. If they support the Governmember's ment in caucus, they get a plum or reward.",41
145,Mr MCLEOD,MARITIME INDUSTRY,What sort of plum?,42
146,Mr LANG,MARITIME INDUSTRY,They are given a trip abroad. While abroad a private member has all his expenses paid. He draws fifteen dollars a day for living expenses.,42
147,Mr GEORGE LAWSON,MARITIME INDUSTRY,Absolutel y true !,42
148,Mr LANG,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"The honourable member will have his chance later. In addition, the Government pays his hotel expenses and transport. So the private member who gets a trip is better off while he outside Australia than while he is i Australia. He is in receipt of an i direct honorarium for services rendered j n the party room. B y accepting a ward, he disqualifies himself as a member of the House. What occurred inside caucus about the Bretton Woods Agreement provides proof of the way the Government is violating the Constitution. The Prime Minister (Mr . Chifley) was defeated in caucus over Bretton Woods. Then certain members were given trips abroad and others were' promised trips. They then voted for Bretton Woods, and one eminent member of this House, who was opposed to Bretton Woods, came out complaining that he had been defeated by the - tourists of the party. We had the case of the honourable member for M a r t in (Mr Daly). He voted for Bretton Woods. So he was given a trip abroad to attend a transport conference at Geneva. He travelled by air. That took three days. The conference lasted ten days. Then, instead of returning immediately to Australia by the quickest possible route, he went sight-seeing in Europe. He told us the other night that he was in North It a l y . We read about him in Paris. He spent a month in England, and then proceeded to Canada and or agrees the United States of America. H a d he immediately after the conference in ended, he would have been away from this or country for less than one month. Instead, he was away for five months. And during that time he charged all his expenses to the public purse. He lived in the best recent hotels at the people's expense. He used but up that commodity that we cannot getHe visited the tourist cities of the Continent. That was the honourable reward. That was his indirect honorarium for his services to the Government within the party room. By accepting it , I assert that he has disqualified himself and, under the Constitution, should not remain a member if this House. The intention of the Constitution is crystal clear. The same prinunciples apply to members of this House as should apply- I use that qualification advisedly-to the judiciary and to every other branch of our legislatures. Before any private member can accept one penny piece from Consolidated Revenue for any is purpose whatever, it must be clearly set n down as a specific appropriation approved n - by the Parliament. That is provided in section 48 of the Constitution. Ministers reof State are paid salaries. Under the Constitution, private members receive an allowance. The full amount of that allowance must be set down in an act of Parliament. Members are entitled to that allowance and not one penny more. That is provided in the Constitution under which we live and under which this Parliament governs the country. That is why I have raised this question here to-night. In no circumstances, by any government, or by any person, must that Constitution be warped as it has been in regard to the matters that I have discussed.",42
149,Mr TURNBULL,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"Wimmera) [8.15]. - As "" Grievance Day"" gives private members an opportunity to speak on all subjects, and as we seldom have a "" Grievance Day "" owing to the intervention of some item of government business, I propose to take full advantage of my privilege to-night and air many grievances which we on this side of the House have against the Government. As honourable members are aware, the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) had given notice of motion that government business should take precedence over private members' grievances today, but, owing to certain circumstances, he withdrew the notice of motion, and so we are now able to exercise our right to discuss such matters as we have in mind. During this debate we have been told about all sorts of tours around the world. The honourable member for Reid (Mr Lang), for instance, has described the journeys overseas of honourable members on the government side of the chamber. I do not wish to refer to such matters. I do not wish even to refer to the world travels of the Minister for External Affairs (Dr Evatt), or to say anything of a personal nature on the subject. I believe that I should concentrate on matters nearer home. It is interesting to hear about world tours, but the Government should attend to urgent local problems. It has plenty of scope for that at present. One grievance which I place 'high on my list relates to the Government's practice of rushing legislation through the Parliament as the end of each sessional period approaches. Sometimes it has forced as many as a dozen bills through this House in one night. Some of those measures were of great importance to the nation. The Prime Minister's practice is to tell honourable members, in the last week of a period, that they must finish their business programme by the Friday of that week, with the result that a list of important measures often has to be passed within a period of 24 hours. No business institution in Australia would conduct its affairs in that way. It indicates poor management, and the Government should realise the fact. The sooner it does so and brings down legislation at reasonable intervals, the better it will be for Australia.",43
150,Mr BARNARD,MARITIME INDUSTRY,The Opposition parties have done likewise in the past.,43
151,Mr TURNBULL,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"That does not affect the justice of my case. The practice is wrong, and, as I have repeatedly said, "" two wrongs do not make a right "". If a practice is wrong, we should try to rectify it. Everybody knows that fifteen or twenty bills were rushed through this House at the end of the last sessional period and that the Government allowed only a few minutes to debate each, so that many of us had no chance to discuss them at all. The procedure is bad, and we should correct it, whatever precedents there may be. As usual, I have something important to say about the wheat industry. My grievance in this connection arises from the way in which the Minister for Com been evading questions that I have asked him in this House. Honourable members will recall that I asked a question in' relation to the home-consumption price of wheat and pointed out the necessity for raising this price to conform with the present Australian standard of values. I asked that question in a simple way, but the Minister either misconstrued it or deliberately avoided a direct answer by referring to the export price. Everybody who takes an intelligent interest in the newspapers is aware that a mass meeting of wheat-growers was held at Warracknabeal recently. Goodness knows, these primary producers are a great asset to Australia. The meeting resolved to support the Australian Wheat Growers Federation scheme for stabilization of the industry. Subsequently I asked the Minister whether he had heard of the meeting and, if so, what he intended to do about the resolution. He replied that he had heard of the meeting but that, as he had no official information about the wording of the resolution, he could not deal with it then. Later, a copy of the resolution was sent to him and I repeated the question. Once again he avoided giving a direct answer. To-day, in the House, he again avoided the question, and referred to the home-consumption price. The wheat-growers are obliged to accept a low home-consumption price, and the Government will not adopt a genuine- I say "" genuine"" advisedly-stabilizatio n scheme. I shall briefly review the home-consumption price. Honourable members opposite are constantly referring to the export price of 17s. a bushel, and try to forget that the home-consumption return to growers is approximately 4s. a bushel at sidings. Last night, the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear) tried to distract attention by stating that we cannot mould the politics of Prance with wheat at 16s. a bushel. That remark had nothing to do with the subject which the committee was considering at the time",43
152,Mr SPEAKER,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"Hon. J. S. Rosevear). - Order ! I am sorry to interrupt the honourable member when I am under fire, but I remind him that he will not be in order in referring to happenings in committee.",44
153,Mr TURNBULL,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"The home-consumption price of 5s. 2d. a bushel at ports is completely inadequate. The Government is always harping on this figure, and some people in the cities and in some country towns believe that the grower receives this amount whereas, in fact, he averages approximately 4s. a bushel at country sidings. The home consumption price was fixed in 1938. Since then, Australia has experienced nine years of war and peace. During that period, our basic values have advanced by from 50 to 100 per cent., but the home-consumption price for wheat has remained stationary. You, Mr Speaker, will agree that, in 1938, the price of 5s. 2d. a bushel at ports bore some relation to Australian current values. To-day, that price is completely inadequate. I shall illustrate my contention with an example. If a farmer sold a bushel of wheat in 1938, the proceeds would purchase a duplicate part for a machine. If the farmer sold a number of bushels of wheat, he could buy a suit of clothes, which is just as much a wheat-grower's equipment as a tractor is. If he sold more bushels of wheat, he could buy a tractor or a motor car. What is the position today? To purchase the duplicate part, he requires two or three bushels of wheat, and three times as many bushels as he needed in 1938 to buy a suit of clothes. To purchase a motor car or a tractor, he needs twice as many bushels as in 1938, but the home-consumption price remains the same.",44
154,Mr BOWDEN,MARITIME INDUSTRY,He needs five times as many bushels of wheat.,44
155,Mr TURNBULL,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"That is rather an exaggeration. The wheat-grower is in a different position from other primary producers. For example, if a man had 400 fat lambs in 1938 and they fetched £1 a head, he could purchase a motor car costing £400. To-day, 400 fat lambs will bring £2 a head, and he can still purchase a motor car costing £800. In other words, the price of fat lambs and wool is keeping in relation to present-day costs. But the price of wheat has remained stationary, and this Government will not stand up to its obligation to wheat growers to raise the price. What is the explanation of the Government's attitude? Wheat-growers throughout Australia are asking this question. The answer is that an increase of the price of wheat might result in an increase in the price of bread by perhaps Id. a loaf, and the supporters of the Government would not like that. They are looking for votes, and, consequently, they are prepared to sacrifice this .vital primary industry. Wheat growers are left to manage as best they can. The old story of the stabilization scheme need not be retold now. The Government's scheme was not acceptable to the wheat-growers. The Wheat Growers Federation has put forward a plan which is fair and reasonable, but whenever I ask questions about wheat stabilization, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture avoids the issue. He does not want to say "" No "" , and he will not say "" Yes'"". That describes how he is acting. He takes the middle course of avoiding the issue, and we do not get anywhere. I speak on behalf of a large number of wheat-growers, because the electorate of Wimmera is a great wheat-producing area. Wheat-growers have .not had a fair deal from the Government. If the Government would send a representative to a mass meeting of wheat-growers at, say, Warracknabeal, the Minister would be able to meet them and hear their views. 1 issue to him now an invitation to accompany me to one of the wheat growing centres in Wimmera, and discuss the position with farmers.",44
156,Mr BEAZLEY,MARITIME INDUSTRY,Will the honourable member pay the Minister's expenses ?,45
157,Mr TURNBULL,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"That is a reasonable question. If the Minister will come r shall pay his expenses, although I make the condition that he travel with me in my 1935 model car and not in one of the new Buicks which the Government has purchased. That is a fair offer. He will meet a large number of wheat-growers who are clamouring for better conditions. Those who were responsible for the provision of "" Grievance D a y "" in this Parliament must have had in mind the necessity to provide honourable members with opportunities to raise such vital subjects as I .am discussing this evening. Honourable members opposite know that the injustice which wheat-growers are now suffering should be corrected, but government policy precludes this from being done. Any government which will uot protect this section of primary producers will be responsible for lowering the standard of living. I did not speak in the general debate on the budget because I have been suffering the discomfort of .a sore throat which some honourable members contract in Canberra, but I take this opportunity now to deal with some of the matters which I intended to discuss earlier this week. One of them is the necessity for full production. This subject has been debated in the House on numerous occasions. The Government emphasizes the need for full employment. A few days ago, the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holloway), in reply to a question, stated that the number of unemployed throughout the Commonwealth, was just over 4,000 persons. Of course, the computation is based on the number of persons who apply for unemployment relief. In the same way, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr.. Dedman) calculates the number of ex-servicemen who have been satisfactorily rehabilitated in industry. The Minister for Labour and National Service claimed that the number of persons who had applied for unemployment relief were the only ones which had not been satisfactorily absorbed in jobs. That is ridiculous. Even so, Australia has almost achieved full employment. I concede that. Full employment is a worthy objective, but it is not worth anything to Australia unless it is closely related to full production. Throughout Australia, men are employed in all kinds of non-productive work. The figures which the Leader of the Australian Country Party (Mr Fadden) read to the chamber a few days ago show conclusively that government departments are increasing their staffs. I should like to know whether the Government, if the present boom period does not continue,- can still keep so many men in nonproductive employment. Is it the duty of the Government, at this time when there is an opportunity to place every man in productive work, to maintain men on non-productive work? Mr BEAZLEY' - Is not the honourable member continually asking for more postal facilities?",45
158,Mr TURNBULL,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"Many honourable members are asking for increased postal facilities, but at the same time, we ask for other things which are, perhaps, even more necessary. Full production should be our aim, and we are not attaining it. We have almost achieved full employment, which, of itself, is not particularly advantageous to the country. But what is the real situation? The fact is that there are far too many people engaged in non-prod-ucfive work. In saying that I do not refer to the public servants employed in departments like that of the Postmaster-General, or in the railway systems, who have played their part in the administration of this country; I refer to people employed in departments created during the wa;r. The existence of many of those departments has been quite unnecessarily extended during the post-war period.",45
159,Mr COUELAN,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"""What departments are they?",46
160,Mr TURNBULL,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"Mentio n was made of one of them in the book to which the honourable member referred today, namely, the' Department of Information. If some of the departments created during war time are necessary today, they are certainly overburdened with staff. If 33 per cent, of the persons employed in those departments were dismissed the efficiency of the departments would not be affected, but, on the other hand, it would have the effect of releasing a considerable number of people for employment in productive work. I have spoken to a number of men employed in Commonwealth departments which came into existence during the war, and I know that most of them would welcome a change to productive work, provided that change were made on just terms. There is no permanency for employees engaged in non-productive work. That kind of work cannot last, and unless individuals have a "" cushy "" job they realise that their future is insecure. In any event, in a progressive country like Australia, we cannot afford to have people wasting their time in easy, non-productive jobs. It is time that the Government reconsidered its policy in regard to the departments I have indicated. Possibly the worse example of "" rehabilitation "" is afforded by the Government's policy of giving temporary employment to ex-servicemen in government departments. If this country is to enjoy freedom and real prosperity the departments to which those men are being appointed must go; and when they are abolishedand I cannot understand how they can continue to function much longer-the n these unfortunate men will be thrown on to the labour market. Now is the time to put things right and to place those men in productive work. The other side of the picture is not so pleasant. The men who are doing the real work in this country today, namely, the primary producers, are unable to obtain machinery and implements to carry on the all-important work on which they are engag^. During the present year they have been unable to obtain even harvesting machines. I am continually receiving let'.ers from primary producers, complaining bitterly of the shortage of farm machinery, but as soon as I bring them to the notice of the Government, its Ministers raise their hands and say, "" That is private enterprise "". But how cam we get along without private enterprise? Because of the Government's misguided policy in regard to man-power, the primary producers cannot get the machinery which they so sorely need. No private concern would tolerate such a shortage of equipment, but because the Government and its departments are .a huge monopoly the situation continues. ""When manufacturers and distributors of farm machinery are asked why they cannot supply machinery, their invariable answer is that the shortage is due to lack of. manpower. No wonder there is a lack of man-power in industry! But there is no lack of man-power in government departments of the kind to which I have referred. Since I have been a member of parliament I have had occasion to visit a number of Commonwealth departments, and in many cases I have found the staff behaving like bees in a disturbed hive, running about doing nothing. I know that the policy of the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) is to discourage the maximum production, because his theory is that if the necessities of life are available in too great a quantity we might have another depression. Of course, that theory is a ridiculous one. The simile of the bee-hive which I used might also be applied to the collection of excessive taxes. If one robs a bee-hive twice in the winter the bees will either die or become so weak that they cannot produce any honey. On the other hand, if one allows them to produce to the limit they swarm out of the hive in the summer, fly over the land and multiply. The lessons of nature, which have stood the test of time, are still true today. The services of men cannot be harnessed in a non-productive economy without diminishing, if not actually preventing, prosperity. I am pleased that the Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (Mr Dedman) is in - the House at the moment, because I intend to say something about the power alcohol distillery at Warracknabeal. All sorts of conjectures have appeared in the press as to the future of that undertaking, and although I have asked the Minister several questions regarding it he has never been able to give a satisfactory answer.  member something about it !",46
161,Mr TURNBULL,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"Then why has the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture  member for the electoral district in which Warracknabeal is situated, and although the Minister admits that he can tell me something about it, he sits there in blissful silence! Mr SPEAKER,-Order ! The Minister has to sit there in blissful silence because he is not permitted to answer the honourable member's question at this stage.",47
162,Mr TURNBULL,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"I shall certainly ask a question tomorrow morning about the matter, and I am sure a lot of people will be anxious to hear the answer. The distillery undertaking has as an adjunct about 1,200 acres of land, and local people naturally want to know what is to happen to that land. Apparently, no one but the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture knows anything about it ; but I have, at least, nailed some one at last who does know something about it ! Then there is the matter of the plant and machinery. What is to be done with that? The local people are concerned that something should be done; but, in my efforts, as their parliamentary representative, to find out >what is to happen to it I have not received the slightest co-operation or assistance from members of the Government. The only information which I have received came from an officer of a government department, whose name I do not intend to reveal. I sent a telegram to this gentleman in Perth, and he had the courtesy to reply, giving me some information. I can assure my constituents in Warracknabeal that they will obtain all the information it is possible for me to extract in regard to this Another matter about which I intend to say something is the scandalous black market which exists in the sale of motor cars. What is the Government doing about that? It is significant that the moment members of the Government thought that there was a black market in meat the Vice-President of the Executive Council (Mr Scully), who was then Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, made an effort to suppress it, although his efforts were not successful. Every one knows that it is impossible to buy a motor car unless one buys it on the black market. About one car in a thousand is sold honestly. I bought one of the few last January, and I am prepared to furnish any information concerning that transaction. When I was present at a meeting in the Wimmera district recently a man said, "" There is only one car in a thousand which one can buy at the pegged price""; and I was able to say, "" Yes, there is one outside the hall "". Are members of the Government simply closing their eyes to this disgraceful state of affairs? What do they intend to do?",47
163,Mr FALSTEIN,MARITIME INDUSTRY,Perhaps they are going to nationalize the sale of cars?,47
164,Mr TURNBULL,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"The present situation in regard to the disposal of motor cars affords a fair idea of the effects which nationalization of banking will have when it is introduced. The honourable member for Watson (Mr Falstein) is evidently an expert on this kind of thing, but I should imagine that he would prefer nationalization of money 1 I have not addressed myself to-night to the subject of banking, because I believe that the right time to do so will be when the legislation for the nationalization of the banking system is before this House. Then, Government and Opposition members will not have any doubt in their minds as to where I stand. I wish to refer briefly to the singleunit farm proposition in connection with the settlement of ex-servicemen on the land. The electorate of Wimmera does not, over the whole of its area, lend itself to group settlement, but is admirable for settlement in the form of single unit farms. The men who fought for Australia were given a great welcome home when they returned to this country. matter. The words ""welcome"" and ""home"", when used in conjunction, are probably as expressive as any two words in the English language. What has happened since those welcomes were given? Most 'of the men have been told : "" If you want to settle on the land, go down into the - cow country"". The reason is that the 'Commonwealth Government has determinedly set itself against single-unit farms.",47
165,Mr DEDMAN,MARITIME INDUSTRY,That is not true. The State Government can provide singleunit farms whenever it likes to do so.,48
166,Mr TURNBULL,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"I have said that the Commonwealth Government has set, itself against single-unit farms, and has determinedly refused .to put any finance into the proposition. The scheme propounded by the State Government demands the payment of a deposit of at least 10 per cent, of the purchase money, and in most instances 20 per cent, or more is asked. That, of course, is the business of the State; I am not. trying to dictate its policy. Under group settlement, an ex-serviceman can go on the land even though he has no money. Because there is not a group settlement in a certain area, why should an ex-serviceman who has no money be debarred from going on the land in his own district? Every'body must admit that is the district in which he should be settled. He knows the conditions, he has some knowledge of values, and he has friends or relatives who will help him ; but he cannot go-on the land there unless he has a rich father who will find 10 per cent, or 20 per cent, of the purchase money. It is high time the Government adopted a proposition under which a strict valuation would accompany the purchase of a single-unit far m . In addition, a portion of the burden of the payment should be borne by the Government, along the lines that are adopted under the group settlement scheme. I am not trying to gain any party political kudos. I know many of these men and have met them on countless occasions. One man at Nullawil , in a very important wheat-growing district, said to ime: "" I have been waiting for settlement here for six months, and have been unable to get it . At last I have obtained a job down at Geelong. My wife, m y two children and myself are going there, because we have a chance of getting a house."" Mr Falstein interjecting,",48
167,Mr TURNBULL,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"The member for Watson would like all the people to be crowded into the cities, especially in his electorate. That is not what is needed in this country. Only by giving the men a chance to rehabilitate themselves, and enabling them to produce, shall we be able to do anything to benefit them personally and the country as a whole. Much more could be said about this matter, but the time available to me is not sufficient to enable me to elaborate. Recently, the Postmaster-General (""Senator Cameron) gave a very broad hint that all mail matter might shortly be carried by aeroplane. In this age of air travel nothing short of that should be tolerated. An article published in the new Sunraysia Daily refers to the M i l dura-Melbourne mail service in these termsRecently the Bunraysia Daily made a strong . plea for the carriage of all first-class mail matter to and from Mildura by air, at ordinary postal rates. The need for a daily mail service has also been urged by the Mildura Chamber of Commerce. It must be remembered that Mildura is a city and admittedly it needs a good mail service. The article continuedEmphasizing the inadequacy of the present service is an experience by Mr R. D. Elliott. C.M.G-., chairman of directors of Sunraysia Daily. On Monday he received in Melbourne a copy of last Thursday's issue of the paper, and by the same mail was delivered to him a letter from London, also despatched on Thursday. There is something wrong when the transmission of mail from London to Melbourne takes no longer than from Mildura to Melbourne, seeing that both Mildura and Melbourne are in the State of Victoria. The article went on to sayEven when it is conceded that newspapers are treated as second-class mail matter, the above incident indicates a farcical situation, and should impress upon the postal authorities the imperative need for an improvement in Mildura's mail service. Finally, I want to refer to a question which recently I asked the Minister for the Army (Mr Chambers), from whom I received a reply; but the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Rankin), in response to another question, was given the answer that I wanted, namely, that if a man who had deserted from the Army in 1944 now surrendered to the honourable authorities he would be given a dishonourable discharge and his deferred pay, and could walk away free. If a man broke into a shop in Canberra to-night, and was not apprehended until twenty years later, he would still have to stand his trial. As a crime, breaking into a shop in Canberra would fade into insignificance compared with desertion from the Army at a time when Australia needed the services of all its men. ""Why should a man who deserted his comrades, perhaps on the field of battle, be given his discharge and deferred pay? I cannot understand the attitude of the authorities.",48
168,Mr CHAMBERS,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"He would be given a dishonourable discharge, and would suffer many penalties. He would be deprived of all benefits.",49
169,Mr TURNBULL,MARITIME INDUSTRY,Bu the would receive his deferred pay. The point that 1. make is that he would walk out a free man.,49
170,Mr CHAMBERS,MARITIME INDUSTRY,Wit h a. dishonourable discharge.,49
171,Mr TURNBULL,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"He could tear that up, and throw it into the first rubbish he came to. While these men are being given their deferred pay, ex-prisoners of war cannot obtain the payment that I have sought on their behalf on many occasions. War widows get only a mere pittance-insufficien t for their needs. No one can understand the actions of the Oovernment.",49
172,Mr SPEAKER,MARITIME INDUSTRY,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,49
173,Mr DALY,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"Martin) [8.51] - To il iglit honourable members have listened to one of the tirades of personal abuse for which the honourable member for Reid (Mr Lang) is notorious. Eollowing his usual practice, both in this House and elsewhere, the honourable member paid little attention to the truth. Instead, he indulged in vile and unsubstantiated insinuations, and generally carried on in the traditional fashion which has brought him ill fame. He spoke of rackets, racketeering and rewards for services rendered. Those are things that the honourable member knows all about. He has always posed as an advocate of the nationalization of banking, He accepts his rake-off from the private banking institutions for their advertisements in his newspaper against the nationalization of banking. .1 say these things to let the people know the type of individual who makes these charges. He is recognized as the greatest racketeer of all time in Australian politics. He is a traitor to the Labour movement and its principles. Indeed, he may be termed the arch "" rat"" of the movement. This is the man who says that members of the Labour movement in this Parliament have been bought off by promises of trips abroad! After making general insinuations of this kind the honourable member singled me out for special attention. He made a bitter personal attack on me. I propose to answer his charges, and to show honourable mem-bers and the people of Australia how ill-founded and incorrect they are. I shall! reveal to them the type of individual whoi takes every opportunity to besmirch everything that the Labour movement stands' for. I shall deal, first, with the charge that I had voted for the Bretton bin Woods agreement because of a promise by the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) that the reward for my vote would be a trip abroad. The public should know that the Prime Minister is not in a. position to promise any member anything of this nature. The Labour party is a democratic party, and is conducted on democratic lines. Every matter that comes before caucus, whether it be proposed legislation or a trip overseas, is decided by a majority vote. Members of the Labour party, unlike the honourable member for Reid, accept the verdict of the majority. I make no secret of the fact that I supported the Bretton Woods agreement: but I supported it long before I dreamed that I should be selected to represent Australia abroad. Without being promised anything I was selected by a ballot conducted by my party to go abroad. The honourable member has indulged in his usual practice of making vile and unfounded statements. He has done so with the deliberate intention to besmirch the reputation of individual members of the Labour party, notwithstanding that he knows full well that Ikecannot prove his charges. I make' noapology for having stood for selection, or for my activities while abroad, which I shall explain to the House. The honorassure able member says that any member of Parliament who receives any money f r the Government that is not authorized law should be disqualified from sitting the Parliament; yet that does not stop the facts. him from collecting 22s. 6d. a day when absent from his home, although the ment is not authorized by any statute. The honourable member then went on to speak of air travel by members. He sits for four or five hours in a train when travelling to and from Sydney because he is not game to travel by air. He never had a flight in an aeroplane. values his hide more than the speed and fortnight later. comfort of air travel. I confess that in one respect I agree with him, for I riot particularly keen on air travel. was for that reason that I returned f r England and America by ship. The honourable member also said that Government. members who travel abroad receive 15 dollars a day living expenses, in addition to having their hotel expenses and translying port costs paid. Either that was a guess or some one gave the honourable member wrong information. I shall explode first bomb-the charge that I accepted said 15 dollars a day for livin g expenses durdays. ing the entire period of my absence by reading from the instructions given to me by the Department of External Affairs prior to leaving AustraliaAllowances payable while on official duty(o) In United States of America Canadian cities-Hote l accounts for normal accommodation tenance only (excluding all for such items as refreshments, gratuities, tobacco, papers, 4 c.) plus an allowance per day.

(ci When travelling between places£.13.2 2s. per day (or $10 in United States of America and Canada) reduced to E.lOs. per day (or $2.50 in United States of and Canada), when transport vided included sustenance. In the course of my visit abroad I in receipt of only 10s. a day for about eight weeks - These facts are a complete refutation of the honourable member's lying assertions. He went on to say Reports that all my expenses were charged the Government in my absence. honourable members that a conthe siderable proportion of smy expenses o m came out of my own pocket. The honorby able member's assertion was based on in hearsay, without any effort to ascertain Another charge levelled against me was paythat I went away to attend a conference on inland transport which was to last ten days. It is true that I attended a conference dealing with inland transport, conducted by the International Labour Organization at Geneva, hut it lasted has for more than ten days; it commenced He on the 22nd A p r i l and ended about a Following that conference, I , in company with representaam tives of employers and employees, atI t tended a further conference of the Coal o m Comimittee of the International Labour Organization as the representative of the That important conference lasted a fortnight. These two conferences occupied a aionth, so that the statement of the honourable member for Reid is disproved. I . was accused of taking a long time to do a trip to his Geneva which the honourable member he could complete in three My answer to that charge is that I was booked by the department to travel on a flying-boat which took nine days to take me to London, and I reached Geneva eleven days after leaving Sydney. and I was in London only one day when I lef t for the conference, travelling by and susway of France. Again, the honourable charges member's assertion is false. As the rest, of the statements of the honourable laundry, member for Reid were of a similar of $7.50 character, they can be dismissed. The honourable member wanted to know I was doing in the various countries I visited. I shall satisfy his curiosity. I attended conferences at Geneva which lasted a month. In due course, a report on those conferences will be submitted to America the Government. At the conclusion of prothose meetings I went back to London, via France, in which country I underwas took some work for the Minister for Information and Immigration (Mr . Calwell). Following that, I did. similar work for the department in ' Brussels. on my activities will be submitted to to the Government later. In London I I discussed my work in these countries with the Minister personally. I also undertook a survey of the housing situation at the request of the Minister for Works and Housing (Mr Lemmon). That survey included the inspection of a number of prefabricated houses, advanced methods of producing homes, and houses erected and in course of erection. One activity which interested me immensely was a visit to the coal mines of Wales, in conjunction with members of the British Coal Board, and of the Department of Labour and Industry. This visit enabled me to compare mining conditions in Wales with those in this country. I inspected certain industries, notably the Ford motor works, in order to study their methods of production, and their conditions of employment. I visited Ireland on business for the Departments of Information and Immigration. I make no apology for saying that any member of this Parliament, who is fortunate enough to be chosen to represent Australia abroad, should take full advantage of the opportunity in order to widen his . knowledge and experience. should have failed in my duty to the Government, to the Parliament and to the people if I had failed to take the opportunity to study conditions in Great Britain, the heart of the Empire, especially at this time when conditions in that country are of so much interest to Australia. In accordance with the general practice, which was usually followed by members of all parties, I came home via the United States of America, where I did certain work for the Departments of Information and Immigration. I studied the American scene in the same way as I studied European and British conditions, and availed myself of the opportunity to increase my knowledge. I remind honourable members that some years go Sir Archdale Parkhill went to Cairo to attend a postal conference, and came home via England and the United States. From America, I travelled home by ship, because I prefer that method of travel, as does the honourable member for Reid. I see no need to apologize to the honourable member for Reid for having been chosen by my party to represent the Government, and my work on behalf of the Government will bear any investigation. I dismiss entirely the criticism of the honourable member for Reid. He cannot see further than his nose. Indeed, he. has never been further than a back street of Auburn. He is the most isolationist member of this House and, because of his narrow and warped point of view, deplores any achievement by the Labour party. During my trip I gained considerable knowledge, and I believe that I am now better fitted as a result, to serve the Parliament and the people. I have now made a full and proper explanation, and I leave it to the good sense and good judgment of honourable members, irrespective of the party to which they belong, to dismiss altogether the biased, irrational and unsubstantiated charges of the honourable member for Reid in regard to my activities abroad.",49
174,Mr HARRISON,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"Wentworth) [9.3] I regret to intrude upon thisatmosphere of domestic bliss, but the forms of the House give us an opportunity on private member's day to speak on a variety of I subjects. Although I have been interested in listening to the travelogue of the honourable member for Martin (Mr. Daly), I must confess that it appears to me that a lot of money was spent unnecessarily upon his trip. I also believe that alot of money was wasted on this publication which I hold in my hand, This isAustralia. On private member's day thedebate is often disjointed because of the variety of subjects dealt with, but on this occasion the Minister for Information (Mr Calwell) found it necessary to return to one of the first topics raised in order to defend himself against the charges brought by the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron). If _ I remember rightly, the Minister claimed that this is not an official publication, that it did not receive the imprimatur of the Department of Information. _ He said that it was purely an advertising medium in which certain interests bought space. That is very interesting, because if one can prove that ihe publication has been endorsed by the Department of Information, one would expect that department to honour its endorsement, just as a person who endorses a. cheque is required, if need be, to honour his endorsement. The Minister skimmed lightly over the name of producer of (his publication and those who had collaborated in its production. Hesaid that the book had been produced and edited by Oswald L . Ziegler, with the collaboration of the Australian Deappears partment of Information, and with the co-operation of ihe Commonwealth Government and the State governments of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia,. Queensland, Western Australia way. and Tasmania. He then went on and spoke o-f. the publisher, the designer the printer, and he read out a long list of those who had supplied photo engravthose ings and photographs, and that was he said. That might seem comprehensive, but' there was no value in it in - relation to the arguments advanced by ""the honourable member for Barker. 1 - have in my hand a publication issued by 'the Canadian authorities, and it is stated - therein that the book was published ;.the authority of the Honourable James MACKinnon, Minister of Trade and toms. Then it is statedSpecial articles deal with "" The Pulp Paper Industry in Canada"" and "" Canada's Place in the British Commonwealth ot ferrin Nations"". These are the result of co-operacollaboration tive effort between the editorial staff and nized authorities-Dominion , provincial, or private. The producers acknowledge the articles used, and take responsibility for them because they have endorsed the publi1 cation. They also thank those by whose courtesy photographs were made avail- "" able. There are two full columns names under this heading, and they are in the same category as the long list acknowledgments rpad out by the Minisof ter for Information. It is interesting note the meaning of the word "" collaboraincluding tion "" as set for th in Webster and Oxford English Dictionary. gives the meaning as follows: The act of collaborating or working toflowers gether. United labour. That, of course, has no reference to Australian Labour party. In the Oxford English Dictionary the following definiarguments tion is given:United labour; co-operation, especially literary, artistic or scientific work. Mr Harrison. In the production of .the book undei' the consideration there was co-operation between the' Department of Information, the State governments, and contributors, and several acknowledgments are made. Indeed the Commonwealth coat of arms on the front .inside cover of the book. That, in itself, indicates, that the volume has been endorsed by the Government; otherwise, the Commonwealth coat of arms would not be used in that Each of several articles bears the coat of arms of the respective States, and that is, the imprimatur of the respective State governments. Thus it is clear that articles have been endorsed by the all various governments, which must take full responsibility for them. The volume also contains articles written by certain individuals, including "" Civic Development "" by Mr Roy Hendy, Town Clerk of Sydney; "" Music and the Arts "", by Dr Arundel Orchard; "" Australia on the A i r "", by Mr T. W. Bearup; "" Building "", by by Mr T. J. Cavanagh; and "" These, Our Tasks"", by Mr C. R. H all , Secretary Cusof the Chamber of. Manufactures, New South Wales. All of these articles are and endorsed by name; and when an article is not so endorsed, one is justified in in g that, it must have been written in with the government departrecogment concerned, and, that being so, must have been endorsed by that particular department. We find no less a person than the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) among the contributors to the volume. have no doubt that he will endorse the articles "" Treasury"", "" Taxation "" and B a n k in g "" , because those subjects come of within his sphere as Treasurer. We also find that the Minister for Information of has written a preface entitled, "" Sinews Society "". It is a preface to the whole to series of articles contained in the volume, the article "" Trading Banks "" . the The Minister's preface makes interesting Webster reading. For instance, he writesEven a stroll among the bushland wildis an experience never to be forgotten. In the article, the Minister becomes quite the lyrical ; but I suggest that, like the flowers that bloom in the spring, his today have nothing whatever to do with the statement made by the in honourable member for Barker. I shall now deal with the article on trading banks which has given rise to this discussion. I know of no more damaging statement that could be made at this juncture on behalf of this irresponsible Minister.",51
175,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MARITIME INDUSTRY," As the honourable member's remark is unparliamentary, I ask him to withdraw it .",53
176,Mr HARRISON,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"I withdraw it . This Minister lacks responsibility in this particular instance, because he disclaims it. Repeatedly, at odd moments, he seems to say the wrong thing on matters of government policy, and then claims that he has been misrepresented when he is taken to task. He then tries to blast the press out of existence because they dare to expose him. In reply to the Minister's defence, I shall read extracts from the article. The article is rather interesting. One of the articles preceding it is entitled "" Finance "", of which a subarticle isheaded "" Treasury "". I venture to say that nobody would dare to publish such an article with those titles without the endorsement of the Treasurer. Would any one dare without the endorsement of the Government to publish articles under those titles in a book of this kind on matters that are of such importance to the Government at a time like this? The article on trading banks is also preceded by an article entitled "" The Commonwealth B a n k "" , and that page is embellished with the coat of arms of the Commonwealth, which, consequently, must have endorsed it. That article is followed by an article entitled "" Savings Banks "", which carries the coat of arms of the State Savings Bank of Victoria. Surely, it cannot be said that that institution did not endorse that article! Then follows the article entitled "" Trading Banks "". It is not endorsed, but it is to be assumed from the preface to the volume that it has been written in collaboration with the relevant government department. The article readsIn many difficult periods in Australian ing experience the branch banking system has shown its strength and resilience. During the 1931 depression, for instance, none of the established banks failed, in marked contrast with the experience of the United States a country which relies mainly on "" u n it "" banks. Honourable members opposite have said over and over again that the trading banks have failed to do that very thing. Yet this article, written in collaboration with the Minister's department, presents one of the best defences for the maintenance of the trading bank system that could possibly be presented. The article continuesSubstantial reservesrenable banks to ""carry o n "" their customers through bad seasons. Without such reserves this would be impossible. How often have we heard honourable members opposite say that in bad seasons the trading banks foreclose on the primary producer? If they took note of the reactions throughout the country at the moment they would readily realise what the primary producers think about the trading banks. Only on Tuesday last .1 addressed a meeting at West Maitland which was called to protest against the Government's.proposal to nationalize the trading banks, and that meeting was attended by over 1,400 people. In that article, the Minister for Information has stated an absolute truth ; but he is now running away from it . Among the other contributors we find the Minister for Transport (Mr W a r d ) . Do honourable members opposite say that that Minister will not accept authority for the article bearing his name? Another article is contributed by the ex-member for Capricornia, Mr Forde, who is now High Commissioner in Canada. Do honourable members opposite say that he does not accept responsibility for that article? The arguments of honourable members opposite on this matter are poppycock. Tf words mean anything, these articles have been written in collaboration and co-operation with, not only the Department of In formation, but also the Commonwealth Government and also the Governments of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania. We are informed of that fact in cold, hard print. How does the Minister for Information seek to get bankaround that fact? He read out the names of all the contributors of photographs and photo-engravings. That was all he did, except to say that certain space in the volume had been purchased by certain interests who had contributed articles.",53
177,Mr FALSTEIN,MARITIME INDUSTRY,Includin g the private banks.,54
178,Mr HARRISON,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"I thank the honourable member for Watson (Mr. Falstein) for the interjection. He always helps me in debate. He says, "" including the trading banks "". Does he mean to tell me that under the endorsement which this volume carries, that is, the endorsement of the Commonwealth Government, the Department of Information and the various State governments, those authorities would consent to anything being published in this form which the trading banks would wish to have published but with which they did not agree ? No.",54
179,Mr FALSTEIN,MARITIME INDUSTRY,Liar !,54
180,Mr HARRISON,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"Would the governments I have mentioned, or any of their departments, permit any policy with which they did not agree to be enunciated in this form under their endorsement? It is useless for honourable members opposite to talk such rubbish. In the journalistic world it is a principle that when space is bought in a publication of this kind, articles published in such, space are indicated to be advertisements. I do uot see any label of that kind here. None of the articles in this volume is labelled as advertising matter. Of course not. If space in the. volume was purchased by the Government of New South Wales, I could understand it, because there is an endorsement; if it was purchased by the civic authorities, I could understand it, because there is also the endorsement of such authorities; but I cannot be convinced that there is no endorsement by the Commonwealth Government of these articles.",54
181,Mr FALSTEIN,MARITIME INDUSTRY,Liar !,54
182,Mr HOLT,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"I rise to order. You, Mr. Deputy Speaker, ruled that the honourable member for Wentworth was not in order in using the expression "" irresponsible Minister"", on the ground that it was unparliamentary. The honourable member for Watson keeps audibly interjecting that the honourable member for Wentworth is a. liar. Does the Chair allow that?",54
183,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"The Chair did not hear the word ""liar "".",54
184,Mr HOLT,MARITIME INDUSTRY,Everybod y else did.,54
185,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"All 1 can hear is the noise being made by the honourable member for Wentworth and some interruptions by the honourable member for Watson. I cannot hear what the honourable member for Watson is saying. If he has used the expression complained of, I ask him to withdraw it.",54
186,Mr FALSTEIN,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"In deference to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I withdraw it.",54
187,Mr HARRISON,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"I am not concerned with the observations made by the honourable member for Watson. I know his prestige, standing and veracity. Statements made by him do not concern me one iota. The ethics governing the production of literary matter demand, as honourable members must know, that advertising matter must appear in print as such. If printed matter is not identified as advertising it is regarded as ""straight"" matter. Following the preface written by the Minister for Information appears a series of articles which deal with treasury and taxation matters which must have been sponsored by the Treasurer, because the information which they contain is not within the knowledge of a lay writer. Then follows an article dealing with banking which must have been endorsed by the Commonwealth Bank. It seems to me that, although the Minister sought to mislead the House by reading a series of acknowledgments of photographs and photographic engravings, and then said, "" The space was purchased "", when the whole trend of the publication, page after page shows the Government's endorsement of the matter covered in it, the House can only assume that all of the articles, particularly those articles related to the mysteries associated with treasury and taxation matters, were written and printed in collaboration with Ministers, and that, once again, the Minister has made an unfortunate mistake.",54
188,Mr HAYLEN,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"Parkes) [9.25] - The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr. Harrison) has displayed a great deal of heat and occupied a long time in attem pting to present a case, but he has not even convinced himself that he has made a case in relation to the matters to which he has referred. We still find that the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) remains decapitated. In all my experience I have never seen anything so much like a weak little chicken walking to the woodheap, knowing that the axe was there and laying his head on the block, waiting for the final swoop of decapitation. I wonder that a man of the experience of the honourable member for Barker should do such things; but it is not the first time that a man has been geared up by the press to put over what .seemed to be a good story, this time that the Government had supported the trading banks, that it had written a book wh ich purported to give some credit to the trading banks. The story would be rushed to every edition in the country and the honourable member was to be the great discoverer. In fact he was so excited over the prospect that he threw a book worth 17s. over his shoulder, and it is not like a Scotsman to do that, particularly the honourable member for Barker.",54
189,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"That stupid statement. Mr HAYLEN "" - I am dealing with a stupid subject and with the stupid statements made by the honourable member. It was obvious that the whole thing was stage-managed-the tearing apart of the brown paper, the throwing away of the string, all that egotistical exhibitionism for which the honourable member is famous. His attack on the Minister was in extremely bad taste, because he is always fawning On the honourable gentleman and chasing him round the corridors of this building. Notwithstanding that, he had the temerity to come here with this "" phony"" story, knowing it would be printed.",55
190,Mr BLAIN,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"Traito r I Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,-Order ! If the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Blain ) does not behave himself he will be put out of the House.",55
191,Mr BLAIN,MARITIME INDUSTRY,- I shall not stand f nonsense.,55
192,Mr HAYLEN,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"B e for e the honourable member for Barker was so capably dealt with by the Minister he thought he was on a good "" s t u n t"" and acted like a child, which was surprising to me because he is a man of such great capacity and experience...",55
193,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,MARITIME INDUSTRY,For God's sake do not give me a reference!,55
194,Mr HAYLEN,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"I do not . think a reference would "" stick"". I have no intention of giving the honourable member a reference; I shall give hi m the bare minimum of his deserts. In this case there was deliberate collaboration to get a story in the press which would not be in line with the facts. Why, only a few minutes before he made his speech, the honourable member was seen talking to representatives of the press in the corridor outside this chamber.",55
195,Mr MCDONALD,MARITIME INDUSTRY,The press knows the truth .,55
196,Mr HAYLEN,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"It is apparent that this story was "" cooked up "" by the press, and that the honourable member for Barker "" fell for it "" . Junior to him as I am in years of experience in this House, 1 advise him not to . be "" sold a pup "" by pressmen and not to father a press story. It is bound to be illegitimate. If there is a was in this loaded story an intention to damage the Minister, who is one of the most honourable members in this chamber, and the Minister told the honourable member it was a lie he could well believe it as such. The article on the trading banks was obviously written by a bank clerk, because it is not even good journalism. The honourable member for Wentworth talks about the flowers that bloom in the spring; this article was so obviously propaganda for the banks that no one would possibly believe it to be otherwise. The story told by the Minister needs no reiteration. The story which the Minister had produced",55
197,Mr HARRISON,MARITIME INDUSTRY,Then the Minister did produce the article?,55
198,Mr HAYLEN,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"I can see that the honourable member for Wentworth would like to fasten upon the Minister responsibility for the whole of this production. Even if the honourable gentleman had o r this written the book it was at least a finely worded piece of literature. The contributors to the book were expected to write their contributions in their own way. If the Minister had asked a contributor from the trading banks to set out in writin g his ideas of private banking, it might be just as artistic but untrue as a story setting out the ideas of the honourable member for Wentworth on the subject of democracy. The Opposition has endeavoured to make political capital by reflecting upon those responsible for this publication; but the attack has been a "" phoney "" attack from the outset. It was intended to be a stunt newspaper story, but it has failed miserably. The defence offered by the honourable member for Wentworth and his colleagues was pitiful. As usual the honourable member loaded every statement with cliches. Last night, when I was ill and listened to the Parkes. Parliament on the air, the honourable member made an utterly stupid statement four or five times, as the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr. Blain) has said. I assume that, having made it four or five times, the honourable member for the Northern Territory eventually understood it. To-night, the honourable member for Wentworth spoke of collaboration, and he licked his lips over the word because he himself is a collaborationist. He likes to think of collaboration in its fascist sense. So, rather regretfully he said to the Minister for Information (Mr Oalwell), ""You are a collaborationist"" no doubt thinking all the time ""I wish I had half your luck"". The important question to be considered is not who prepared this publication, but what contribution does it make. Whether it is sponsored by the Ministry of Information, the banks, the Australian Country party, the Liberal party, the Labour party, or people with no fixed political affiliation, does it make a real contribution to the dissemination of accurate information about this country ? Definitely it does. Then why should the honourable member for Barker throw it over his shoulder-in rejection, and compare it with a small booklet from Canada? The honourable member spoke in irritation as if a lot of money had been spent on this volume, and as if he felt it his duty to draw the attention of the House to a squandering of public funds and a. wastage of dollars. I recall one occasion on which the value of Australian literature was disparaged by two honourable members in this chamber. They were the honourable member for Barker and the right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page). I sometimes think that Mr Haylen-. behind such attacks is a genuine hatred of this country. These honourable members apparently do not wish Australia's story to be told abroad. They have fixed "" crown-colony "" minds. The honourable member for Pawkner (Mr Holt) has a fixed "" crown-colony"" mind with a socialite fringe to it, which is even more dangerous and more deadly. But he is young and he may recover.",55
199,Mr HOLT,MARITIME INDUSTRY,I hope to prove a better patriot than the honourable member for,56
200,Mr HAYLEN,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"The honourable member will have many opportunities to try, but he has quite a long way to catch up. This matter has now been well thrashed out. It is obvious that the honourable member for Barker made a blunder. His case was dealt with summarily and effectively by the Minister. The timing was perfect, and there was no opportunity for the honourable member's story to go out to the world as a "" scoop "". The story was killed. Then of course, there was a scatter amongst honourable members opposite who, no doubt, felt it their duty to build up the honourable member's ease. The honourable member for Wentworth was called in. He became lost in a welter of words. No doubt he believed that, lie was creating quite an impression by striding up and down the chamber, but he was only causing reverberations in the House and static on the radio. His speech had no real significance and did not minimize the debacle of the honourable member for Barker. The honourable member for Barker sits with such a whimsical smile, sometimes that one wonders whether he is as cunning as he believes himself to be, or is like the old dingo who, after years of hunting, has lost his pace and is in great danger of losing his 1 ail. Again I say that this is a fine volume whoever produced it. It is a credit to Australia. It is vastly different from the creations of the pinch-penny, paltry minds of honourable members opposite who, when occupying the treasury bench, paid journalists of this country miserable pittances to tell the story of Australia. This is the way the job should be done. It is a tribute to the journalistic profession, the magazine producers, the bookbinders, and the hundred and one other people to whom credit was given by the Minister for Information. One often bears the criticism voiced in this chamber by uninformed member!?, mostly Australian Country party adherents, that the Department of Information is redundant. The truth is that it is doing a splendid job and is keeping in employment miany journalists who because of the newsprint shortage might be out of work. Unfortunately, most journalists are necessarily job-conscious, and are compelled to write things that they do not believe. A refusal, of course, would mean loss of employment, and the Liberal party certainly would not give them jobs. Although honourable members opposite use journalists through the newspaper owners, the journalist himself is worth saving but I cannot say that for most, newspaper owners. If the honourable member for Wentworth is waiting to ask me about an apology that he claims I made in a newspaper on one occasion, I suggest that he should spend half an hour with me sometime and hear the whole story. 1I have, never apologized to a newspaper in my life. It was the board of directors.",56
201,Mr HARRISON,MARITIME INDUSTRY,They had to apologize for you.,57
202,Mr HAYLEN,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"They apologized durhumane, ing my absence and without my consent. It was an apology that I never approved I cannot be responsible for anything that was published without my knowledge consent. It was a bad break on the of my bosses, and I apologized for them. The final point that I wish to make is that we must give credit for this type of literature in a book like This is trniia. In the past the stuff that has gone out of this country good publicity for Australia. When Lord Bruce was monarch of all he surveyed in that little island fortress known Australia House, there were little picture postcards in the windows saying "" This Australia"" and showing koala bears, "" big brothers "" meeting "" little brothers on the wharfs in 1916. The two monushows mental works were a picture ing of the heights of Gallipoli, and "" Tom's last word at Kourke's d r i Under the Labour Government, the Department of Information revived Australian publicity, and House is very much alive today. The publicity is first rate, and migrants are being attracted to this country.. This publication, too, is first rate and will be read in Great Britain.. The readers will know nothing of the untidy little mind of the honourable member for Wentworth and the egocentric tendeucies of the honourable member for Barker, who has sought to defame an all-Australian publication for the sake of a little brief notoriety and perhaps half a column of publicity in the Sydney Morning Herald or whatever paper he wa.= "" gunning"" for. I remind honourable members opposite that, because of their criticism: of this publication, they may have to face a court-martial of their own. What will Mr Sommerlad say to members of the Australian Country party? He has spent a lot of money on this book. The honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) has gone white at the thought of what will happento him when Mr Sommerlad gets on to this matter in the morning. The book has not been besmirched by Opposition attacks.",57
203,Mr BOWDEN,MARITIME INDUSTRY,Every bit of it is good.,57
204,Mr HAYLEN,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"There is a trace of gold in the honourable member for Gippsland, but those with whom he sits do not ring true. Because he is either naive or the honourable gentleman always makes a reasonable statement, - about activities on this side of the House. I pay him that tribute. I see that he is or sitting on the edge of his seat. He is part probably trying to keep away from the general corruption on the other side. 1 was diverted from the point that we cannot afford to allow cheap publications ro Ausgo from Australia. Every journalist in Australia will agree that this is an excelhas not been lent publication. I turn now to criticism of trips abroad ,as by members of Parliament, particularly my friend and colleague, the honourable is member for Martin (Mr Daly). Statisor tics reveal that his trip was by no means "" the longest. A quick glance at the record that Sir Archdale Parkhill went of the scalto a conference at",57
205,Mr HARRISON,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"I do not think the f t "" . honourable member for Parkes is aware that Sir Archdale Parkhill passed away today. It would be unfortunate to drag Australia his name into a debate.",57
206,Mr HAYLEN,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"I was not aware of that, and I thank the honourable member for Wentworth for having told me. Criticism of a young member for having gone abroad on a mission on behalf of the Government falls ill from the lips of a man such as the honourable member for Reid (Mr Lang). Some years ago there was a cry for "" new blood "" in the Commonwealth Parliament, and the Labour party, the most valiant and successful political party at the time, was returned to office with a number of young men amongst its parliamentary members. Amongst them was the honourable member for Martin. In the time he has been a member he has developed. Admittedly he was absent for five months, but a quick glance at the records shows that the right honourable member for Cowper was iaway for nearly twelve months and that other honourable members have been away for periods of five, six and seven months. A ll absences were justifiable.",58
207,Mr FADDEN,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"-The right honourable member for Cowper was absent on a ministerial mission. Mr Calwell interjecting,",58
208,Mr ANTHONY,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, you, as custodian of the House, have seen fit at times to rebuke honourable - members for having interjected. The Minister for Information (Mr Oalwell) is not only interjecting, but also interjecting from a seat that is not his own, which is worse, thereby committing a double offence. I ask you to extend to him the same discipline as you extend to honourable members on this side when they interject.",58
209,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"I did not hear the Minister's interjection. I shall enforce discipline on all members as required, including the honourable member himself.",58
210,Mr HAYLEN,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"The Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) misunderstands me. I was not talking in a derogatory sense about the time occupied abroad by the right honourable member for Cowper. I was pointing out tbnt long trips are necessary sometimes. Whether a long trip was necessary for the honnraWe member for Martin is the matter in dispute. I remind honourable members of the newspaper editorials constantly being written about the mediocrity . of politicians. That applies to the Opposition as well as to us. They said that we should go out and learn the world and come back laden with knowledge. Once that advice is taken and we break away from our isolation, which worries the editors of newspapers so much, we are accused of wasting public money. Honourable members and the people may rest assured that, with one of the most careful Treasurers in the history of federation guarding the public purse, there is a stringent limit to any waste or undue expenditure. I know from experience that one cannot travel abroad without digging deep into one's own pocket. The allowance of the Treasurer does not nearly suffice. An extraordinary attack was made on the honourable member for Martin because he, perhaps, overstayed his leave by a couple of weeks and preferred to return by sea rather than air. The honourable member for MartiD enumerated the jobs he did abroad. 7 know that they were efficiently done. The Minister who commissioned him while abroad to tackle those extra jobs told me that he had done splendidly. He has the right approach and manners that impress. He had hardly left this country when rumours were rife that he was"" going away for a long stay. The stories came from Communists in his electorate. I know that because, while he was absent. I took over his electoral duties, as he did for me when I was abroad. So his electors were not left without representation. Some Communists infiltrated into the Labour League and were promptly ousted. They had the ear of the editor of the Sunday Telegraph, to whom they carried every little scrap of gossip. The honourable member was caricatured in filthy political cartoons by the refugee Molnar, the protected person, who has, in other filthy cartoons, caricatured the Prime Minister and every other prominent political figure in the Labour party. He draws £28 a week for doing his dirty work. In King Billy's column, which I commend to the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr. Blain), there appeared paragraphs week by week about the honourable member for Martin and the duration of his travels. livery item in the newspapers published in the Martin electorate that concerned the honourable member for Martin was republished, whereas, normally, the editor of the Daily Telegraph would scorn to scan their columns. So the campaign against the honourable member for Martin grew because he had. the political integrity to throw the Communists out of the Labour League. That was how the Communists paid him back. No one objects to fair criticism, but there is a limit beyond which criticism cannot be justified, and I query the right of the refugee, Molnar, to do as he has done about, the honourable member for Martin. Molnar's dossier is readily available. ¥ e find that he came from Rumania to Australia among the earlier refugees. Ear some time during the war he worked as an architect in some governmental post. Then he was appointed cartoonist-in.;hie.f for the Sydney Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph, after two Australians had been dismissed because they would not produce cartoons filthy enough for the editors, when they were trying to break the late John Curtin's heart when he was trying to avert a coal crisis. That story is well known. Mr 'FAMTEIN - That is Packer's paper.",58
211,Mr HA YLEN,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"Yes , the Daily Telegraph and the Sunday Telegraph, which are owned by Frank Packer and E. G. Theodore. This refugee replaced two Australians who refused to sink low enough to produce the sort of cartoon that they wanted in order to blacken the miners in the eyes of Australia. The first to go was one of Australia's finest artists. George Finey. When he went he was' blackballed by the rest of the newspapers and is now living in dire stress at his Springwood home. He was boycotted because he walked out rather than depict the malicious and the untrue to the degradation of the miners in order to provoke them to go on strike and stay on strike. The next to go was Mahoney, because he would not agree to sink to the levels his job required him to sink to. He walked out, too. In came the refugee, for whom no work is low enough. If there is any aroma in the middle pages of the Telegraph, honourable members know the reason. He drew a cartoon to which I take the greatest exception. It goes close to infringing the privileges of the House. It shows the honourable member for Martin on his knees licking the boots of the Prime Minister. .That is a "" fine "" tribute from a man who took shelter in this country while our men were fighting for him and his kin. It is not a matter of party politics. I , by assisting the activities of the Minister for Immigration in a small way, have done considerable work for refugees. I have helped by my writings, such as they are, to support their cause and to teach Australians that we have a duty to them. But here is one who has been recreant to his trust and who has taken advantage of every opportunity to deride this Government both in war when he was protected, and in peace. He is the man who has taken the bread out of the mouths of two fine Australians. There are not many jobs in the higher income brackets of journalism and cartoon work, but he holds one of them and sits in his glory with a pencil beside him, planning his cartoons. His . editorial colleagues come to his office and say to him, "" What cartoon is not fit to print today? You draw it, and I will write an editorial about it "" . That is the depth of degradation to which the Sydney Daily Telegraph has descended. The cartoon which 1I have mentioned was an insult to every parliamentarian, and its publication should have been taken up at the time on a question of privilege. As I have said, I was forced, because of incapacity, to be absent from, this House and listen to the broadcast of debates yesterday, when I heard one of the worse exhibitions of bad manners that has ever been presented by members of the Opposition. A j I was listening to the broadcast, a group of men came to me in a deputation and, although they were not all supporters of mine, they remarked that the "" turn "" put on by the Opposition was the worse that they had heard since the broadcasting of parliamentary debates was initiated. A discussion was in progress about an article which had been written by an Irish journalist with reference to Senator Amour. The senator's name had been misspelt, and there was some play on this fact. Above all the criticism of the Irish writer and the talk about an Irishman's grandson going home to Clare, I heard the tinkling laughter of the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons). After all, Ireland gave Australia seventeen men who died at Eureka. There was a slight suggestion of racial superiority in this talk from Opposition members, and I was surprised that the honourable member for Darwin should be involved in it. I warn her that",59
212,Mr GULLETT,MARITIME INDUSTRY,The honourable member is the lowest thing in this House.,60
213,Mr HAYLEN,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"The honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett) would not be classified in the human species. He would be just a little black lizard. I repeat that there was an undercurrent of malice in the speeches of honourable members opposite. There was laughter at the expense of "" this poor little paper "" in Ireland. The whole thing played right into the hands of the crown colonists opposite, who hate anything Australian. They hate the good Australian book which was the subject of discussion earlier to-night and they hate the idea that an Australian can prove that this is a good country. The honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender) read the story ""from the Clare Champion in yesterday's debate.",60
214,Mr LANG,MARITIME INDUSTRY,The honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) read it.,60
215,Mr HAYLEN,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"It was read first by the honourable member for Warringah; the honourable member for Richmond merely reiterated it. In the first place, this attack was a bad advertisement for the Opposition. In the second place, it involved something more than just an attack on Senator Amour. I thought that it was rather bad form for the honourable member for Warringah to criticize the honourable senator who, when serving his country as a soldier, was so seriously wounded that for some months his life was despaired of, because the time that anything militaristic ever occurred to the honourable member for Warringah was when he stood in front of a soldier's pay-book and called himself a colonel in the Pay Corps.",60
216,Mr BLAIN,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"I rise to order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. The honourable member for Warringah is not in this House to speak for himself, and I wish to explain that he enlisted during World War I . and was sent to a camp, but was too young to go overseas. The honourable member for Parkes should retract his statement and apologize for the slur upon the honourable member for Warringah.",60
217,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MARITIME INDUSTRY,There is no point of order.,60
218,Mr HAYLEN,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"The whole affair was so despicable that I shall not waste further time dealing with it. In due courseSenator Amour will make >a statement in the Senate. However, we would not be his comrades if we failed to defend him against such malicious tongues as those of the honourable member for Warringah and the honourable member for Richmond. The latter gloated over the task of attackLug the honourable senator. Had the newsbroadcast been made with television, I am sure that I should have been able to see the smirk on his face as he did so. One could tell that both honourable gentlemen were enjoying the opportunity to malign .somebody and raise a cheap chuckle about Irish newspapers and an Irishman going back to the land of his forebears. Fortunately, their statements were checked by the honourable member for Lang (Mr Mulcahy), who is himself an Irishman - He delivered a wellmannered speech, the tone of which in itself was a rebuke to the Opposition.",60
219,Mr DALY,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"I wish to make a personal explanation, Mr Speaker. When I was speaking earlier to-night I referred to Sir Archdale Parkhill, not knowing at the time that he had died today. I assure the House that, had I known of his death, I certainly would not have used his name during my speech.",60
220,Mr HAYLEN,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"I , too, have an explanation to make on the same lines, Mr. Speaker. I should like to record the fact that, when discussing some items of Government expenditure, I also referred to only Sir Archdale Parkhill in ignorance of his death until I was informed of it by the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison), whereupon I desisted.",60
221,Mr DAVIDSON,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"Capricornia) [9.57]. - I do not propose to talk about books, either large or small, or to attempt to give a lecture on world tours. Like the .honourable member for Wimmera (Mr. Turnbull), I propose to deal with a local matter which I consider to be of at least as much importance as other matters that have been dealt with in this debate. I - draw the attention of the Government to the unsatisfactory position which has - existed since the end of the war in relation to shipping services to central - Queensland ports. This matter has already been mentioned on several occasions in this House, and I have had some correspondence about it with those responsible. Nevertheless, the position still remains most unfortunate for residents of the areas which are affected, and I contend that the Government can no longer be excused for its failure to rectify the situation on the ground that present conditions are the result of the war. Admittedly, the situation arose from con-ditions which came with the aftermath - of war, but I submit that now, two years after the end of the war, it is high time for a considerable improvement of the .shipping service to be made. Those citizens who are affected were content for some time to await the expected improvement. However, they now contend that the situation could have been avoided if the Government had adopted a vigorous policy and made the best possible use of the shipping resources at its command at the end of the war and, in addition, had .acquired the considerable numbers of .small craft available for disposal by both the Australian and the American armed forces. The Government's neglect in this respect has imposed severe penalties on large numbers of people and, unless there is a quick improvement in the situation, their outcry will become irresistible. I propose to show exactly how the present position is adversely affecting various sections of the community. As a convenient yardstick for measuring the service now being given to these .areas, I cite the earnings of waterside workers in the Port of Bundaberg. At this stage, I desire to point out that there are waterside workers and waterside workers; but those to whom I am referring are not the kind of "" shrewdy "" whom one encounters in certain other areas. The Bundaberg men have made their living on the waterfront for a siderable number of years, and they are prepared to work if the opportunity to do so is afforded them. Prom the 1st January, 1946, to the 31st December, 1946, the earnings of the 54 or 55 members of the Bundaberg branch of the Waterside Workers Federation averaged only £4 a week. For .the twelve months from the 1st July, 1946, to the 31st June, 1947, their average weekly earnings TOO £2 17s. That is a convenient yardstick for measuring the volume of shipping which is entering that river port, and it is indicative of the position which exists in other ports such as Gladstone and Rockhampton. In the Gladstone area, the maximum earnings of waterside workers for the twelve months ended the 30th June last only slightly exceeded £250, yet Gladstone is one of the best ports in Australia. Its meat-works could provide a considerable volume of outgoing cargo, and the district justifies a substantial inward service. However, ships come to the port only at intermittent periods, with the result that there is no continuity of supply. Consequently, orders which might be submitted to shippers for inward cargoes cannot be lodged by merchants and others because they are not assured of a regular service. Apart from the instances which I have cited regarding waterside workers, I also point out that business people generally are adversely affected by this lack of shipping. It is rather remarkable that one of the reasons which has been given for the absence of shipping, particularly to Gladstone, is that there is no assurance of inward or outward cargo. Before the outbreak of World War II . the port of Gladstone had a regular weekly service. That, in itself, indicates that it could now support a similar service. However, the contention is advanced that orders for shipping are not coming forward from local merchants and others. The position is that as the result of war-time conditions merchants in that area were forced to bring their goods into the city by rail. Ships were not available. Now, merchants and others are told that because they are still forced to bring produce and materials by rail, the tonnage is not available to justify the establishment of a regular shipping service. As con- any one with a knowledge of the subject will readily recognize, merchants and porters in that area cannot possibly give orders to shippers for materials and goods unless they can rely on a regular service. They must keep up an adequate supply of goods to the district, and until they know that shipping is available, they must continue to obtain their supplies rail. Yet the fact that they are still doing so is used as an argument against of these materials. them when they request an increase of shipping facilities. A further adverse result, which I sider to be most important, is the effect which this position is having upon proreasonable ducers generally in the surrounding tricts. During the budget debate, many speakers on both sides of the chamber emphasized that we must plan for a siderable increase of production. statement was perfectly true, and all honourable members agree with it. The Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) read figures which show an alarming decrease of production recent years. Every honourable member agrees-even the Prime Minister (Mr. Chifley) referred to this subject in budget speech-that we must do everymine thing possible to increase our production. matter. There are several main reasons for reduced production. The first is the heavy load of taxation which the people bear, and which is depriving them of the incentive to produce. That fact cannot be emphasized too often. Another reason, adjourned. which affects Queensland, is that decreased production is partly due to periods of drought. Here, I stress that some people attempt to blame the whole of the decline upon drought conditions, but that is not true. Only a certain percentage is attributable to that factor. The. third reason is the alarming shortage of materials which primary producers need for the rehabilitation of their properties. Tn this instance, the lack of adequate shipping services is affecting the redevelopment of primary industries. Primary producers everywhere are unable to obtain even a meagre supply of the essential materials which they require, because shipping services are so poor and a great deal of the goods which are available must be transported by rail. Essential materials like barbed wire, plain wire, corrugated iron, machinery and impleMr Davidson. imments are necessary to our recovery, and unless they can be brought into the district at reasonable rates, obviously the recovery must be so much slower. As is well-known, the supply of these materials is inadequate for the requirements of the country generally; but, in addition, by inadequate distribution is depriving producers in these areas of their fair share Therefore, I submit that in order to provide adequate enjoyment for those condepending on shipping, enable merchants and others to import and sell goods at rates, and assist the proper disrecovery of primary production, a move should be made to improve the shipping service to the areas which I have mencontioned. The only way in which that can That reasonably be done is for the Government to make a careful investigation of the position. The investigation should be undertaken, not by some official sitting in his office and relying on figures, but in by a man with a practical knowledge of the subject who will go to these areas and ascertain for himself the true position. his By that means he will be able to deterthe best method of dealing with the The situation warrants a the thorough investigation. I ask the Government to give urgent attention to this request, and take the appropriate action. Debate (on motion by Mr CONELAN) PAPERS.

222,Mr CHAMBERS,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"On the 30th September, the honourable member for Calare (Mr Howse) asked the following follows:-question:I wish to direct a question to the Minister for the Army in regard to the Government's recent decision relating to payment for recreation leave due to deceased members of the armed forces. Will the Minister explain to the House the reason for the differentiation between payments proposed in respect of. leave duo to servicemen killed in action and of servicemen who died in prisoner-of-war camps? I now in for m the honourable member as follows:Payment in lieu of leave to eligible beneficiaries of deceased estates on behalf of members who died whilst prisoners of war has been approved on the basis of two days per month from 1st July, 1042, to the date of death of the member, subject to a minimum of fourteen days' leave and a maximum of GO days'"" leave. This basis of entitlement is broadly the same as the leave entitlements which were due to all serving members from 1st July, 194.2. Deceased members in this category would, in almost'every case, not have partaken of any leave. In cases of death between 1st July, 1942, and 20th March, 1945, other than whilst prisoner of war, approval has been given for leave to be assessed in accordance with the following formula:Service of less than one year-fourtee n days. Service of one year and lessthan eighteen months-2 1 days. Service of eighteen months and less than two years-2 8 days. Service of two years and less than 30 months-3 5 days. Service of 30 months and less than three years-4 2 days. In some instances the implementation of this formula may result in payment in lieu of leave although leave may actually have been taken, while in other instances it is possible that payment in lieu of leave may be less than the actual period of leave that may have been due. On an overall basis, however, it is considered that the method of effecting payment in lieu of leave is a fair way of adjusting the matter. NAURU ISLAND. . 10- Mr Francis asked the Minister acting for the Minister for External Affairs. upon notice I. Has Australia yet submitted to the United Nations organization a draft agreement for the trusteeship of Nauru Island? 2. If so, will he inform the House of the terms of the draft? 3. What has been the purpose of the negotiations with Great Britain . and New Zealand on the subject, and what has been LEAVE. the result of the negotiations?",63
223,Mr CHIFLEY,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as 1. Subject to the final agreement of th* United Kingdom and New Zealand, Australia will submit a d r a f t trusteeship agreement to the United Nations under Item 20 of the provisional agenda of the General Assembly. 2. The d r a ft trusteeship agreement as it stands at present designates Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom as joint administering authorities. The three governments undertake to administer the territory in accordance with the basic objectives of the international trusteeship system, and to cooperate with the Trusteeship Council in the exercise of its functions. The governments have sole responsibility for the peace, order, good government and defence of Nauru. Agreement has recently been reached through the respective representatives in New York that Australia should continue to exercise the administration on behalf of the three governments. 3. Discussions with the United Kingdom and New Zealand were designed to assure the agreement of those governments with the d r a f t proposed by Australia.

225,Mr WHITE,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"the Minister for Civil Aviation, upon notice I. What amount is paid annually by private airline companies in Australia in petrol tax? 2. How much of this total sum is paid by the Commonwealth to ' the States for road construction ? 3. In view of the fact that the airline companies are only minor users of roads, will the Government remit the tax to the companies as an offset against the new charges being levied for the use of binding facilities at aerodromes? M!r. DRAKEFORD - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The total amount paid annually by private airline companies in Australia for petrol tax is not available. The amount paid within the rationed area (which excludes the north-west portion of Western Australia and the Northern Territory) in respect of aviation fuel is approximately £720,000 per annum. 2. Up to 30th June, 1947, under the Federal Aid Roads and Works Act (Australian Capitol Territory) 1!'47. grants for road purposes were made to the States equivalent to 3d. per gallon iif customs duty and 2d. per gallon of excise duty on petrol and certain other petroleum products, including that used in civil aircraft. As from the 1st July, 1947, the Commonwealth Aid Roads and Works Act 1947 provides for increased roads grants to the State!), but petrol used in civil aircraft for the purposes of civil aviation is excluded in calculating payments to the States. 3. In respect of petrol used by airline companies in road vehicles, payments are made lo the States for road purposes. In regard to petrol used in civil aircraft, the Government retains the full amount of duty collected thereon for Commonwealth purposes, including the heavy expenditure which is necessary for TABLE A - APPLICANT S RECORDED WITH THE COMMONWEALTH New South Victoria.

227,Mr HOLLOWAY,MARITIME INDUSTRY,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l lows :No official statistics are available to show the actual number of persons unemployed in fact at any particular time. Table A hereunder shows the number of males and females in each State registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service in each month since September, 1.940, as disengaged workers. It is known, however, that a considerable proportion of those registered as disengaged sire not in fact unemployed but are workers in employment who are seeking improved positions or changes of position. Table B shows the number of males and females in each State in each month since September, 1940, who were in receipt of unemployment benefit or re-employment allowance. While not all unemployed persons seek, or arc eligible for, payment of unemployinei» benefit or re-employment allowance, the figures showing numbers of recipients of unemployment, benefit provide the most reliable guide to the numbers actually unemployed from month to month and furnish the most sensitive indicator of changes in the employment situation. Table C, which has been supplied by the Minister for Social Services, and which relates directly to Table B, shows the amount of unemployment benefit paid for each month in each State since September, 1943.
