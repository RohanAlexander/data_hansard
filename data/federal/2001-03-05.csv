Today I would like to address some starting with the area of aged care. I understand of healthy ageing for older Australians, and older people and support for their carers. of last year announcing 126 new places for the for Aged Care, which was Mrs Bronwyn after the budget. It spoke in fairly glowing terms more than 100 new aged care places, with 126 excited about this because the reality is that, as a relatively young community here in age NA Monday, 5 March 2001 terms, we do have a growing proportion of older people requiring assistance in their ageing years I was particularly pleased when I saw that article. Then, in January this year, there was a further thought that was an additional grant of places, nouncing the decision on how those 126 new of excitement at getting new places abated somewhat the previous announcement. However, from received 78 new residential aged care places packages as they are commonly known. Again, this may sound terrific for the local you would never knock back and would welcome that, despite these announcements, I am constantly have enormous concerns about how they can possibly tives when that need arises. One comment that is a reasonable one-is that the ACT community around Australia in the sense that most of us meet someone who was actually born in That leads to many questions. Many people parts of this country to set up their families few years ago than it is now, but it still occurs. when they get to the point where they need words, they migrate into the ACT at a time when of them, as my mother migrated, for want of when she needed to be near younger members The question is whether or not that itinerancy required to be worked out for the allocation when you look at per capita head of population, exactly how many places there need to be. One is the need to recognise the additional numbers including the immediate region, to receive The situation here is far from satisfactory parts of the country. The demand for those number available. The CAPS package process ternative to going into an aged care facility. stances suit and they wish to do so, they can staying in their own home for longer However, it is only good if you can get it. after having waited for allocation of a CAPS number of them have progressed to a point where, age is of no use to them-they have reached many cases, they then go through the process cility. It becomes a whole new ball game. The hostel-level type need-to use the old is pretty heavy, but it is not as bad as the there is a very high level of demand in comparison thinking of the number of families who walk thing to help them get a place for their MAIN COMMITTEE 25009 folk. It is becoming increasingly difficult for to gain that assistance when it is required, so announcement by Minister Bishop. At first I as did many others. In actual fact, it was anplaces would be allocated. So our second attack when we realised that it was referring to that announcement we learnt that the ACT had and 48 community aged care places, or CAPs community-and on the surface it is something warmly-however, I again refer to the fact confronted by folk in the community who cater for the needs of their older relahas constantly been made to me-and I think it is a little different from other communities have come from elsewhere. It is always a joy to the ACT because they are in the minority. come here having left their families in other and work in the ACT. That was more the case a So there is an influx of older folk needing help to join their younger family members. In other they need to be near their families. I am one a better term, from another part of the country of her family when she needed special care. or migration is included in the formula that is of aged care places. My understanding is that, there is no consideration in the formula for thing we have to start to address immediately of folk who come to Canberra from elsewhere, aged care accommodation or aged care assistance. and probably reflects the situation in many other CAPS packages is extremely high compared to the is probably a good one; it offers people an alIt means that if they are able to, their circumlive in the hope of getting assistance at home and than would normally be the case.

I am through my door, pleading with me to do someelderly relative quicker than they can. NA 25010 I want to thank the government for their packages. We would never turn one of them very carefully about where their process in enormous withdrawal of funds, in historical great. I have a case on my hands right now been married for 62 years. The husband is in rid of him. He has to get into aged care accommodation. his family is feeling pressured and the CAP place. In the meantime, his wife of 62 years, of her family.

I am not saying that naively- I understand ply when it is required with the stream of that all of that. But government, whoever they are, that is, that waiting lists mean nothing. You matters is that as soon as there is a need for is not needed in three or six months time. It enough to do it much better than we are currently doing it.

It is not intended, but it is very do something as a matter of urgency to try to lies. In finishing this particular part of my talk the facilities in these places is also pretty you deal with these folk they are terrific. concerned but at the end of the day they have themselves as well. Another area that these appropriation bills people-in other words, an area of the immigration an understatement, that I am a little bit disappointed sometimes categorise folk. I would like to today that are outstanding. They stand out so that they have actually occurred. Yet, because part of the world where the government processes risk of overstaying, the circumstances become not matter.

The three children all spoke MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 5 March 2001 126 places-78 of them are beds and 48 are CAPS down. But I really want the government to think aged care has now got them.
