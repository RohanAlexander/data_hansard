24,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WESTKALIAN PABMEES,"I have received the intimation from the honortry able member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) that he intends to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a definite matter of urgent publio importance, viz., "" depression of the wool market, and ters in connection therewith."" Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed.",22
25,Mr BLAKELEY,WESTKALIAN PABMEES,"Darling) [3.17] - It is only because of the outcome of the putation to the Acting Prime Minister (Sir Joseph Cook) the other day that am moving the adjournment of the in regard to this matter. The position of the graziers in New South Wales, and the centralwestern portion particularly, is such as to cause general uneasiness, only in that district, but in other parts of the Commonwealth as well; for, while that portion of New South Wales is ing the depression particularly, other important districts of Australia are in exactly the same position owing to fact that the Associated Banks have only refused further cash advances graziers, but have asked them to reduce their overdrafts. The position calls action on the part of the Commonwealth Government because the situation is outcome of war conditions, and therefore is national in character. The Acting mier of New South Wales (Mr Dooley) has been endeavouring to make some rangement whereby the graziers in districts affected may be able to stock their holdings, and thus carry on the dustry, thereby creating that wealth which is so necessary for the progress the Commonwealth. The paralysis, far as the wool market is concerned, is due to the fact that at present the people of Europe are unable to buy our raw materials, and apparently they will be in a position to do so until some systive. tem of international credit can be arranged. I have no doubt that, under the Bawra scheme, considerable relief will be experienced, but unless more credit can be established, our raw materials will be sold at considerably below their true market value. In the districts to which I refer, the central and central-west of New South Wales, I have particulars of forty-three cases of graziers-and these may be regarded as representative of the whole of those engaged in the industhroughout Australia and I find that the amounts advanced by the banks represent 33 per cent, The against the land, and only 27 per cent, matagainst land, stock, and unsold wool. The outstanding debts average about 3 per cent, of the present assets. Thus the banks have advanced about 33 per cent, against the land itself, and only 27 per cent, against land and stock, excluding plant, which is a not inconsiderable item. deThe advances are on a very conservative basis, whereas the small land-holders find I it impossible to stock up unless they are House advanced up to 50 per cent. The number of sheep grazed in New in South Wales is about 14,000,000 below the average for the last ten or twelve not years, a very disquieting fact when one takes into consideration the grasses and herbage available. On the other, hand, feelQueensland has plenty of sheep and many cattle, and they can be bought very the cheaply; but if those who are anxious to not buy are unable to get advances from the to banks, or do not receive sympathetic treatment from the Commonwealth Gofor vernment, that stock must remain in the northern State, and the paddocks of New the South Wales must continue to remain idle instead of producing wealth. It is not Preonly the graziers who are held up. In some.cases mixed farmers are compelled arto go slow because of lack of funds with the which to pay wages to those who might up otherwise be engaged in ploughing their inland. The position is clearly set out in a schedule of forty-three cases which has of been prepared, from which I shall take a so few items indiscriminately. In this schedule, sheep are valued at 15s. per head, horses at £8 per h.ead, cattle at £6 per head, and wool at £10 per not bale. The valuation is indeed conservaCase 43 is that of a settlement lease of 5,289 acres worth £1 per acre. It carries 1,173 sheep valued at 15s. per head. Other assets consist of two horses worth £8 each, and unsold wool valued at £210. The total assets amount to £6,395. The banks have advanced £1,010, and this grazier's outstanding debts are covered by another £516, but he wants a further £1,500 to enable him to stock up. has been absolutely refused any further advance. Indeed, he has been asked to reduce his overdraft. Case No. 1 refers to 3,877 acres of conditional purchase and Crown lease land valued at £1 10s. per acre, or a total value of £5,905. He has no stock and no wool. He owes the bank £2,226, and his outstanding debts amount to £200, but he requires a further £1,200 to enable him to stock up. He has been refused any further advance. Case No. 3 refers to 6,000 acres of conditional purchase and Crown lease land valued at £1 10s. per acre, or a total value of £9,000. The stock is worth £1,500, and the unsold wool £300. The total assets are £10,800. There are no outstauding debts. A bank has advanced £4,500, but in order to stock the land properly the holder requires a further £1,,500. However, the security is not regarded as good enough, and the bank will advance him nothing further. Case No. 4 is that of freehold, conditional purchase, and Crown lease land, comprising 2,710 acres worth £2 10s. per acre. The total value is £6,775. Ewes and lambs are worth £600, cattle £200, and horses £70. The total value of assets is £7,545, on which a bank has advanced £2,800. The holder, however, requires another £1,000 to enable him to stock up, but his bank has absolutely Tefused to give him any further assistance. ^ Case No. 5 refers to freehold, conditional purchase, and Crown lease land, comprising 9,612 acres. The freehold land is worth £2 10s. per acre, and is paid up to £1 5s. per acre. The conditional purchase land is worth £1 10s. per acre. The total value of the holding is £13,400. The stock is valued at £6,,075, and wool unsold is worth £930. The total assets are valued at £20,405, on which £6,700 has been advanced, but the owner has been asked to reduce his overdraft. This he cannot do. As a matter of fact, he really requires more capital in order to stock up his property to its carrying capacity. Case No. 7 is that of a Crown lease, on which all conditions have been fulfilled, and the property is now convertible to a freehold. It comprises 4,647 acres worth; at £1 per acre, £4,647. The sheep He are worth £450,, and the unsold wool is valued at £110. The total value of the assets is £5,607. . The bank advance is £1,185, and the outstanding debts amount to £110, but the holder requires a further £1,100 to enable him to stock up his property properly. He has been absolutely refused any further assistance'. Indeed, he has been asked to reduce his overdraft as soon as possible. J£ | , The Associated Banks have got cojg feet, or they are in such a position through carrying the importers that they cannot advance further capital to any individual. It is beyond doubt that the grazing industry is .perfectly solvent, because against the whole of the assets of the forty-three cases in this list, which are an average of conditions that apply throughout Australia, the banks have ' only advanced up to 27per cent, of the value of the stock and land, exclusive of plant. . The whole of this information has been laid before the Acting Prime Minister (Sir Joseph Cook), who bas promised to interview the Associated Banks. The deputation placed before the right honourable gentleman the following proposals, which he could not see his way to accept:1. That the Federal Government approach Bawra with the object of stabilizing the value of wool included in the free wool at present held, and the clip of 1921-1922, by guaranteeing a flat rate of lOd. per lb. (which was the average price for a series of years prior to appraisement scheme, on which the flat rate of 15Jd. was based), and paying for the free wool immediately, and the wool of 1921-22 on receipt of same in store after appraisement. 2. That the Federal Government stabilizes the position of graziers generally by creating a credit with the Associated Banks by the issue of notes, such notes to be redeemed within three or five years. The credit so established to be used in the following manner:(a) Advances to be made on the security of lands to an aggregate including . amounts already advanced by Banks not exceeding 65 per cent, of the value of the land. The Government to accept declarations from bank managers as to present day values of properties held as security, and the moneys so advanced to be on separate accounts, and not to be used in reduction of existing overdrafts, (b) Advances up to 100 per cent, of value of certificates issued for wool ap praised, on flat, rate of lOd. per .lb. Under this it would be necessary for all wool to bo appraised by Bawra, aud certificates issued (similarly to . Wheat Pool) for the value of the clip.. The graziers, who are in had circumr stances, do not demand that the flat rate should, be lOd. per lb., but they do say that some rate should bofixed which would provide them with some money with which to carry on. 3. Alternatively to resolution 2, if the proposal for establishing credit by issue of notes be not favoured, that the Federal Government arrange a short-dated loan in London to Stabilize the position of graziers generally, the whole of the money so raised to be made available for the Banks' use, for advances as provided for in resolution 2 (a) and (6). 4. Should the foregoing proposals be accepted, it is necessary for immediate action, and that the Government, instead of creating a fresh Department for the management of the business, appoint a committee of business men in each State to act as' a sort of Board of Directors to pass advances, and, if necessary, arbitrate in the event of any differences arising regarding valuation of properties, &c. 5. It is further proposed that a conference be called with representatives of the Associated 1 Banks, the: Chairman, of Bawra, and representatives of the graziers-to fully, go into the matters raised by the deputation. Personally,. I do not take any responsibility for the suggested note issue or the short-dated loan in London. there is sufficient credit in Australia support men. who are absolutely and require only a little temporary sistance in order that they may r«-stock their land and carry on until they have sold their wool, or until such time as the wool position is eased. Whilst the Acting Prime Minister may be opposed to any further inflation of the note issue, and will not entertain the suggestion for a shortdated loan in London, he should, at least, make somearrangement with the Associated Banks whereby they will not foreclose on small land-holders. suggested by representatives sociated Banks that it is not their intention to. close down on the small men. Others cold-bloodedly say that times are bad, and the weakest must go to the wall. That is a brutal and vicious principle to enunciate. A man who has been thirty, forty, or even forty-five years on Mr Blakeley. the land,. and finds himself, temporarily embarrassed owing to drought, followed by floods and the depression of the wool 1 market caused by international - conditions, should not be forced off his land because of temporary tightness of the money market or panic on the part of the bankers. The schedule which has been filed deals with forty-three cases, in all of which it has been found that the valuation of properties is about twelve years old. The properties have not been reyalued in the meantime, although, in many instances, the value of the land had completely altered. Many of the properties have been further improved, and the titles have been converted. A properry which might have been valued at £6,000 twelve years ago would today be worth probably double that amount. Notwithstanding that fact, the banks will do nothing to relieve the situation. Mr HILL?-Does the honourable member suggest that land in New South Wales and Queensland is as valuable today as it was two years ago?",22
26,Mr BLAKELEY,WESTKALIAN PABMEES,"I say that the value of twelve years ago has been doubled. A great number of conditional purchase blocks and Crown leases have been converted, and conditions have been fulfilled, which make the land considerably more valuable-10 0 per cent, more valuable in some cases. Where the title of a conditional purchase has been conI believe verted the security is ever so much betto ter. Sir John Higgins, the Chairman of solvent, Bawra, attended the deputation which as- waited upon the Acting Prime Minister, and' we suggested to him that Bawra should' take control of the whole of the wool. I am a f r a nk advocate of the pooling system; but Sir John' Higgins stated that unless the whole of the wool-growers were prepared to go into the Pool he could do nothing, whilst the Acting Prime Minister said that he would not compel wool-growers to place their wool in the Pool. If the wool-growers were to It has been come together and enlarge the business of the As- of Bawra, so that that body could establish credits and pay on appraisement, as was done during the war, thesituation would be considerably relieved. I believe that the pooling system' is so' good that it should be adopted always, and not only twenty, in times of war and financial stringency.",24
27,Mr STEWART,WESTKALIAN PABMEES,Would the .honourable member apply that advocacy to wheat-as well?,25
28,Mr BLAKELEY,WESTKALIAN PABMEES,"I would. When hundreds of thousands of men are producing the same article, they should come together as a co-operative society for the selling of .their products instead - of marketing them through agents like Dalgety & Co., Dreyfus -& Co., :and other big wool-broking firms. The wool-growers and the wheat-growers could market their own products, and thereby eliminate the middlemen.. If the wool-growers establish their pooling system they will be in a very much better position than they are today. There is no difference between Bawra holders and holders of free wool. There will 'be involved merely the matter of enlarging their business. It will be lov wool-growers generally .to say whether they shall so expand their business. But it will take 'time :to inaugurate a scheme to pool the - who'lfi of the wool of .Australia-^so much time, .indeed, that those who are being'.forced by .the banks today would probably find themselves removed from their small 'holdings. The Prime 'Minister of South Africa (General Smuts) adopted a totally different attitude from that .""of thp Australian Prime Minister (Mr Hughes). T quote the following cablegram from Capetown .published in the' Sydney Daily Telegraph of 28th May: Before sailing for London this, afternoon the Prime Minister made a statement on the wool position before the Assembly - He said that the - Government' had been negotiating' for - the - gale of the new clip .to the British .Government, but had found difficulties. He was .not /sure Whether it - would succeed, and, therefore, in view of the financial situation, the Government had come to the conclusion that it would - be 'necessary 'to 'assist 'the producers torevive the scheme in'operation,-before'the war, whereby the banks, with - a Government guarantee, made advances on wool. General Smuts-said that the wool and mchair farmers would be entitled to an advance of up to '50 per cent, on pre-war prices, which would enable them to tide over the financial depression. The Prime Minister praised the liberality ef the banks, which/had agreed to accept 64 per cent, interest. pressed . on' the - banks< the .grave necessity; owing to the present crisis, of not . contracting, credit for too much. Apparently, .just what took place in .South Africa in the matter of the banks forcing graziers .has occurred in Australia. The - Government .can immediately relieve the situation here if they desire. . This is an absolutely solvent industry, requiring, perhaps, not more than - a couple of millions sterling by way of necessary advances to those who are in need. It would be an easy matter to authorize the Commonwealth .Bankwhich-would act'in conjunction ""with the Associated Banks-to establish a credit which would permitthese people to-.stock up and carry-on. 'If some such assistance is not-granted the-present condition of unemployment throughout Australia 'must - become considerably more acute. In New - South Wales there are between : lOjOOO and 15,'OGM men out of work. The position in Victoria is just as bad. In South Australia there ore some 5j000 - men out, and the,re is unemployment in Western Australia, Tasmania, - and - Queensland. The shearing-season is approaching, but, unless the industry is stabilized,-quite a number Who, ordi-naTily,'would employ labour ""for shearing' will not be in a position to do - so. Some - people 'believe,--by the °way, that the - best way,-if not-the only way, to 'relieve ""the ; - present situation 'is to - establish soup kitchens and 'giveout charity'doles. The 'whole - of the-pastoral workers will be - affected by the ""situation as 'it - develops. : Thatwill. entail an immediate reaction upon .country storekeepers, whose' - position, m turn, will react on city warehouses, and, - eventually, the trouble will all-earne. back-to the banks. I-ask the - Acting - Prime Minister if he will not take - immediate'steps to see'that somerelief ie: ^granted ? It is only a matter of'consultation with 'the Associated Banks, first, ! 'to ask them to withdraw the notices ; which they have issued.",25
29,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WESTKALIAN PABMEES, Order ! The honourable member's time limit has been reached.,25
30,Sir JOSEPH GOOK,WESTKALIAN PABMEES,"Parramatta-Acting Prime Minister and - Treasurer) [3.46] - I have not much that is fresh to say upon this matter. . The honourable 'He has im- member the otheT day introduced a deputation to me, which was representative of the men in the far-back districts referred to this afternoon-?me n who, no'doubt, are in dire distress. I cannot 'agree to their proposals, however. ' I told the .deputation emphatically that I would jiot have anything to do with the schemes propounded to me - I said ! would not attempt to give them credit in the shape of further inflation of the currency to the extent of £10,000,000, as the deputationists suggested. I pointed out that that would not help them at all, but would only aggravate their difficulties. I told them. I was quite unable, even' if I were willing, to get them a loan of £5,000,000 in London at present. Just now, nearly all the States are, asking for loan money in - London, and we ourselves need iV-if we can get it-fro m that same source. Then there is the other proposal of the deputation, namely, that wool should be stabilized for two years. by establishing a reserve price of lOd. per lb. on wool instead of 8d., as has alreadybeen . agreed to - There-may be some possibility of .relief in that direction. . Sir John Higgins invited these wool people to come into Bawra and avail .themselves of - the privileges which .Bawra offers - ' - Really, I think that that was f ood advice'. Instead of this matter eing brought before. Parliament, as it has been to-:day, and instead.of the Government being asked to .acquiesce in impossible schemes, it' would be' wiser to a little nearer home and face the actual causes of the whole trouble.. The honourable member: for Darling (Mr Blakeley) stated just - now that these valuations, which showed such tremendous margins, were the valuations of twelve years ago. He left it to bo inferred that the price of land in the districts indicated was very much higher today than it was then. But the contrary is the case. I understand that land in those parts is not now worth in some cases half what it was twelve years ago.",25
31,Mr BLAKELEY,WESTKALIAN PABMEES,The Minister does not know what he is talking about.,26
32,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WESTKALIAN PABMEES,"I do! 1 would remind the honourable member that some of the causes of the trouble which is coming upon the people in whom .he is interested are due to certain things which have been done and said in respect of land-owners by both the Queensland and New South ""Wales Governments.",26
33,Mr RILEY,WESTKALIAN PABMEES,What are those things?,26
34,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WESTKALIAN PABMEES,"By a certain proposal of the New South ""Wales Government, the values of these lands have been written down. This, has been brought about specifically by the State Government saying they would compulsorily resume holdings and - give the owners bonds bearing 4$ per cent, interest.",26

43,Mr JAMES PAGE,WESTKALIAN PABMEES,"The Acting Prime Minister may speak of South Australia and New South Wales, but thai is not the position in Queensland.",26
44,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WESTKALIAN PABMEES,"I am referring look to New South Wales, and did not mention Queensland. The fact is that honourable member's opposite, and the parties with which they are associated, are responsible for writing dowjn the values of those lands, and it is time they .began to recognise' that the chickens are coming home - to roost. Wc sympathize with those who are the victims, but honourable members opposite and their political friends are causing many of the troubles with which the graziers are confronted. They are also largely responsible for the attitude of the banks, who see their securities becoming less valuable.",26
45,Mr JAMES PAGE,WESTKALIAN PABMEES,The Treasurer knows that that is not true. I Sir JOSEPH COOK - I would not say it if I did not believe it to be absolutely true.,26
46,Mr BLAKELEY,WESTKALIAN PABMEES,You r information is incorrect.,26
47,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WESTKALIAN PABMEES,"The .honourable member and his supporters know that contracts made with the leaseholders in Queensland have been interfered with, and that trouble has arisen in consequence of such action, which has adversely affected the money markets in London and in Australia. They cannot have it both. ways. Honourable members, cannot go out with predatory'intent-against these institutions, and then' ask them to more liberal than ever. It is of no blinking our eyes at the situation.' sonally, I have the greatest possible symgreat deal worse. pathy with those men - who are struggling to keep their holdings, and who cannot secure the necessary accommodation from the banks. Mr GABS::-The Acting Prime Minister is endeavouring to make political capital out of it. That is the extent of his symbe pathy.",26
48,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WESTKALIAN PABMEES,"I-shal l leave i at that. In all the districtsreferred by the honourable member for Darling have (Mr Blakeley), he and those with whom he is associated are helping these unforstressing tunate people by submitting a new log for shearers which is going to add a groat to the graziers' costs.

74,Mr GREGORY,WESTKALIAN PABMEES,"There can be no be doubt that many of our troubles today are due to economic as well as. to industrial conditions. Much of the trouble has been brought about by Government interParference.

For the purpose of discussion of the Tariff I brought"" here today .some 'Particulars, conf corning, the condition.of Argentina - That country has not to face : the difficulties confronting us, as it'did not assist in the - war, and,- therefore, has notincurred a big war debt. "":'The statement.

Ih consequence, large numbers-of ; ships have arrived, and continue to arrive, at ' the various ports, and the country's foreign trade has - bedoine enormously active' of late. . . Low exchange'rates. have favoured the cancellation of mortgages and other debts in Europe, and important quantities of ' bonds of the Argentine public debt, Ce.dulas of . the National 'Mortgage Bank, &c, - have been imported. Furthermore, subscriptions to loans recently floated by theGovernments of France and Italy"" reached very high. sums . in Argentina. In short, Argentina is passing through an'epoch of great prosperity, and one 'which, judging by all appearances, is likely to continue for some time. - - Mr JAMES PAGE - Eve r since I can remembw the bogy of the Argentine has been trotted out before us. ' We are not frightened of the Argentine. ' - Mr GREGORY - The quotation I 'have made shows that that country is making wonderful progress.' ' ' Mr OOBSEK - In extraordinary",29

'.Taxation, both direct and indirect, is piled upon him.' He' has the greatest difficulty in.' obtaining labour, and his capacity to comply with arbitration awards is altogether different from that of the city business man. I'do hot propose to further delay the House. This debate, it seems to me, can. be of little value since the matters complained of do not come within the province of this ' Parliament. The Acting Prime .Minister (Sir ' Joseph Cook) has said that he would be pleased to consider proposals coming from the Government of New South Wales, and I hope he will see how far he can help to tide over the present unfortunate position in which the graziers now' fmd'.themselves. It . may be possible, to do something to improve, the position, but the remedy lies wholly with the Government of' New South Wales,, ,'ahd cannot: ,be brought about by any direct action on the part of this Parliament.  [4.13 ] - I do not think that any one will say that the remarks made by the honorcirable member for Dampier '(Mr Gregory), or the ' utterances of' the Acting Prime cirMinister' (Sir Joseph Cook), are likely been to help in any way the people on the land who, at the present time, are labouring under serious disabilities. The honbur orable member for Dampier indulged in one long tirade against the workers, of Australia, and was reminded by the honshare orable member for Maranoa (Mr James made. Page) that the workers have the sameto live as has any other section of the the community. When he asserted that the ""Land Bill introduced into the Parliament of New South Wales by the State Government had depreciated land values outin that State, and was making the posiof tion of the . man on the land extremely difficult, I asked him to cite one clause Ji(P'ta*-xneaix£^-i*licli was - calculated have: suchan effect - He was unable to do so, and I suggested that he had never seen the - Bill."" I feel sure that he has not sean ity or that if he has he has not care: fully considered it. . The honourable mem-, ber said'that--it' provided for the compulsory ^resumption of land,!and that because of that provision it had' had the effect of depreciating land values in New South Wales. In Victoria, where there is-not aLabour Government in power, an Act providing for the compulsory.resumption of estates has .been in operation for many years. When it was being passed there, was no talk on the part of the banking-institutions of calling upon land-holders. or any one - else to reduce their overdrafts; but because such a measure, was introduced by a Labour Government, in the New South Wales Parliament, the honourable member urges that it has brought about all the difficulties under which land-holders in that State are labouring'today. We know, as a fact, that it has not done so. The Acting Prime Minister .(Sir Joseph Cook) also urged ' that the man' on the, land ih Queensland and New. South Wales had been subjected to the most unfortunate conditions because of legislation passed by State Labour Governments! It is to be regretted that the right honourable gentleman was unable to discuss thisquestion' without introducing party politics. He might, have well been expected to ""propound some scheme to assist the people on the land' who are in such difficulties today. Unfortunately, he made no. such attempt, but approached the consideration of the question from a purely partypolitical stand-point. The right honourable gentleman also made the most extraordinary statement that land values in New South Wales were higher twelve months ago than they are today.",30
77,Mr WEST,WESTKALIAN PABMEES,"That is quite incorrect. The resumption of land for soldier settlement has actually increased prices.  not say 'that the Acting Prime - Minister made the statement knowing it to be false, but it certainly is wholly opposed to fact. Land values m New South Wales today are as high as they have been within my knowledge for the last fifteen years. I<f the right honourable gentleman and the honourable member for Dampier really believe that land values in the Mother State to'' have very greatly depreciated, I - invite them' to seek to purchase land there. If they d6, .'theywill speedily discover that they are mistaken. - Mr BELL - If lafcnd-owners are having such' a bad time,' as we are asked to believe, then values must soon decrease.  an entirely different matter. The honourable member is looking at the question from the right point of view: If as a result of the most disastrous, drought ever experienced in New South Wales landowners there are in difficulties today,, and if,, because of those difficulties, they are in many pases forced off the land, values will certainly decrease. The present situation.is due to natural causes, and what I might describe as ""bad luck,"" rather than to legislation.",31
78,Mr GIBSON,WESTKALIAN PABMEES,"Thos e natural causes have been operating during the last three years, and in that way land values have been depreciated.  so.",31
79,Mr BELL,WESTKALIAN PABMEES,"But the honourable member said a few moments ago that land values in New South Wales today were as high as they had been for many years.  cause land-owners who have had to 'fight drought conditions have not yet had pressure brought' to bear upon them by the' banks. ' They are struggling under serious handicaps due tt* the natural causes to which I have referred, and if the financial institutions call upon them to reduce their overdrafts before they can get on their feet again, there - certainly will be a depreciation in land values. Bad seasons and not bad legislation are responsible for the present situation. As a matter of fact, the Land Bill to which the honourable member for Dampier referred was not passed. It was withdrawn. That Bill ' was capable of much sendee, and I trust that it .will be improved and re-introduced, in the hope of doing something in the direction of cutting up large estates of 50,000 and 60,000 acres and over, and thus giving an opening . to - people who are now looking for land in vain. < There was one other statement made by the Acting Prime Minister in regard to the assistance which he says is always given by the private 'banking institutions - of .the country. - He - told, us that toralists aiid-others':-have .much to thank the private banks &*-S (but the' right - honourable gentleman did . not giye- - credit where credit is. due - 3?he interest charges - for. *the hist few years.have be6n:COmparatively light, owing, rto a large-lextent, to the - steadying influence of 'the Commonwealth Bank. Before, that Bank -.was instituted, - the interest Chargeswere - infi;nrtely higher than they are show.. Mr GIBSON:-Why 'does the iOommonwdSlth Bank tf'dt assist these land-hoKters now?  ready ^pointed 'outj the Commonwealth Batik - has done a great deal,' 'but it cannot do everything. ' ' It could, however, :be made capable of doing a great deal more : if it were administered by some other Government than the present Government. "" Mr BBH.!.' --Politica l influence!  all.. The Commonwealth Bank should be capable of exercising ail the functions of a truly national bank, functions which 'it does mot now exercise. 'Thjere is too much .political control brought to bear, and this prevents the Bank doing what a national bank should. Too much thought ""is .given by the Government to flie protection of the .private banking companies,'and, because of that, the'Commonwealth Bank cannot perform its proper .functions. . If it were allowed to perform these functions, the .pastoralists and others on the land today would not .be experiencing their .present difficulties. The-national credit of - this country could be used to a greater extent 'than :it is; it was - so used during - the war period, and it <can .be aised in any -.time of national difficulty. The war ""was .a 'national trouble, and, had it continued, - we should have hadto rely on our national-credit for-years to come. 'It is a hackneyed, but /nevertheless a true - saying, that the primary 'producers are the ""-backbone of the country "" ; and now they are in difficulties. If these producers suffer, the whole country suffers, and the present is a time when the national credit should be used to relieve them by means of - the National Bank. Perhaps it would be too harsh to say that the Acting Prime Minister is preventing that being done by the Bank; but there is no doubt that the - the .(pas- right;honourable gen*leman - in.his position : as treasurer-.could do something to assist, it in vusing '.the '-national 'credit -.to a' greater - extent. I have several letters in ray ^possession (from ipeople-.on .the land in iNeW - South 'Wales,., 'and they are .typical of .hundreds .referred 'to - by the honourable member - for Barling (Mr. Blakeley) - and others. It will be .admitted that the .position of - Ne-,. South Wales is exceptional. During - the :lasi four - yeaTSi 'that; State has :su'ff erred - more from drought and bad 'seasons than any other State - of - the Commonwealth. Mr HILL:-What is to prevent the State Government of - New South - Wales giving those land-toldeTS' relief?  ""pa""ratively speaking, it is only - the other day that'the State-Government did come : to the assistance of the land-holders; but the ;powers of a State Government are nothing, in comparison with the. powers of the Commonwealth Government, As a matter of fact, the State Government borrowed and spent £3,000,00.0 on the relief of the land-holders, .£1,000,000 as a direct contribution, and another £1,000,000 in building silos. That has - been 'done by the present. State Government during its short .period of office. ;and - it is a record unequalled by any other' .Government in Australia. Mr DEPUTY'SPEAKER - The honourable member^s time has expired. Mr (mmSTOSBKMS. (Gwydir) [4:28]. - Honourable members who have spoken in opposition to any action being taken by the Commonwealth Government do not, in my opinion, take a broad enough view of the position. Those 'honourable members seem to think that the difficulties referred to are oonfined 'to New South Wales, but there is evidence that they affect Queensland, as well as certain.portions of - Victoria - There is no doubt, that the State - Governments can 'afford a certain amount of relief, - and.'the .New South Wales Government has promised to do so, 'but this industry is a. nationalone, extending all over Australia, and under the circumstances I submit that - it is the duty of this Government to take steps to safeguard it. The Commonwealth Government very properly has control of the - defence of the nation, because such a mattercannot properly be managed by the States individually, and on the Commonwealth Government falls the duty of safeguarding the interests of the nation. I submit, therefore, as a fair analogy, that when war is being made, as it were, on a section of our primary producers engaged in a national industry, the Connnonwealth Government ought to come to their protection and aid. We have been told that the banks - have gone as far as they can-that they are business institutions, and have to safeguard themselves. I remind honourable members, however, that the private banks enjoy certain privilege's under the - laws of this country, and, moreover, that when money is plentiful we find bank managers approaching producers and urging them to go into propositions in order to absorb bank funds that would otherwise be idle. Many men have been induced by bank managers in that way to go into certain propositions, and now that the period of depression has come upon us, some of the banks are suffering from cold feet, and are doing much to injure the credit of this country hy intimating to the landholders that their credits are not good, or that they have to reduce their overdrafts.",31
80,Mr GABB,WESTKALIAN PABMEES,It may be something else besides cold feet.,33
81,Mr CUNNINGHAM,WESTKALIAN PABMEES,"Yes ; some say that this is a deliberate attempt to discredit La'bour Governments, and it is significant that this move was first made in New South ""Wales, a State which has as good credit as has any other in the Commonwealth. Still, it is there that we find a great move made to order men to reduce their overdrafts. order to meet this order, many of the men are forced to dispose of what I call their reproductive capital. A man may have 2,000 acres of land worth £3,000, with £1,000 worth of sheep- a flock that lie has, perhaps, spent years and years in breeding up to a certain pitch of perfection. When he is. ordered to reduce his overdraft, he has to sell that flock. Therefore,, to reduce his overdraft, he leaves Ms .property bareof stock, and, consequently, bare of his reproductive capital. Land and grass, without stock to grow wool or increase in weight to be sold as fats, are of no use. The reason for the attitude of the banks - is beyond my comprehension. They stood at the back of the importers and paid their debts overseas, as we know, because the papers are full of it. When these, men ordered ten times the amount of stuff they required, and large quantities were unexpectedly delivered, the banks stepped in and met their debts overseas. The papers went so far as to say that the banks should have .shut down on the importers six or twelve months be- . fore they did. It was only when these men i a d drifted into such a position that the banks saw no chance of their paying their debts, that they shut down on them, and refused further credit.",33
82,Mr CORSEB,WESTKALIAN PABMEES,"I am afraid the honourable member is making a great mistake, there. Mr CUNNINGHAM,-My information came from reliable sources, as 'well as the daily press that supports the present Federal Government. If I am wrong, the honourable member's press supporters are wrong also. It seems to me that the action of the banks is designed to crucify the country at the expense of; the cities. I am one of those on the land, and am continually receiving letters from men who have been forced to sell their live stock. If this policy is persisted iiij the Government will find, big areas of land in New South Wales, as well as in other portions of Australia, without stock on them. The present holders will have no incomes during the next twelve months, and, consequently, large amounts of revenue will be lost both to the State and Federal Treasuries. Blood cannot be got out of a stone, and In if a man has no income, he pays no income tax. If the banks persist in their attitude, and do not call their dogs off, many of these men will be forced off their holdings, and if the - mortgagees foreclose, the properties will be sold. The bank in each case is; of course, covered, because it has advanced only about one-third of the value of the property, and, consequently, will get its money out of it ; but what becomes of the man who is pushed' out with nothing? He joins the ranks of the unemployed, and drifts into the city, and then there is a clamour for the raising of State loans in order to provide employment. The banks themselves will buy up many of these properties after the occupiers have been forced out. In the past the banks have put up "" dummies "" to buy in properties of that kind. I have known cases where men were forced out by the banks, and the "" dummies"" put up by the banks bought their properties. The banks, using their position under the laws of the country, have been able to acquire properties in that way at less than their true value, and to thrust out many a pioneer with his swag on his back after all his years of labour. ""We on this side take up the position that it is the duty of the - Government ment to see that no ""man is pushed period of depression. out of his home when his position Government, is not' his fault.

We must not look at these matin ters from the business point of view from which a bank looks at it. The property and plant. function of a Government is to protect its people, and if the present Government fails to realise its duty in that regard the alternative is that these men will pushed out, and will join the army of employed. If that is allowed to happen, this Government will have neglected its duty. I was surprised to hear the Treagreat surer adopting such a helpless attitude he took up today. One would think in Mr Cunningham. that his hands were tied, and that he was powerless; yet men who are considered' to know finance and to understand the Constitution of the Commonwealth say that it is the duty of the Commonwealth Government to stand behind the men on whose behalf I am speaking. The Government is the controller of finance in Australia. The Commonwealth Government controls the note issue, which is one . of the main factors of the finance of the nation. If the Commonwealth Bank cared to take up the accounts of these men it could increase its business three or fourfold with no risk, and acquire their business for all time. It was to protect the people that this Bank was instituted. It is the duty of the Commonwealth Governto stand behind these men in their They look to the as the controller of finance, perform its duty to the people of the community, What else are Governments if it is not to safeguard the interests It is a poor consolation to the man who is pushed out to be told the Commonwealth Treasurer symand pathizes with him. The Treasurer said plainly and emphatically today, "" I canWe say that a who adopts an attitude of impotence, who says that he can do nothing, of has failed to realise his functions as a for member of the governing body which represents the people of Australia. One I honourable member, and, in fact, the Treahimself, decried the credit of these people by saying that the lands which they occupy are not so valuable today because of certain proposed legislation. That is all a myth, because if the Land referred to had been passed it would have applied only to estates of over The men for whom we are fighting have assets far below that value. They are men with £2,000 or £3,000 up to £8,000 or £10,000 worth of A man with £30,000 worth of land would probably hold, with land and stock together, assets in the neighbourhood of £50,000 or be £60,000. It will be found that none of unthe men quoted by the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) hold asset3 going above £10,000 or £15,000, and the bulk of them possess far below that as figure, In fact, most of them come with the limit of £5,000, which is only onesixth of the estate value which it was intended to affect by the passage through the New South Wales Parliament of the Bill in question. For a man in a responsible public position to decry any State is traitorous to the Commonwealth itself. These land values have not decreased.

When prices like thatare obtained, there can be no depreciation values.

Men who are forced to sell their increasing stock under these circumstances will ing sheep. be ten times worse off than they were while the stock were on their land. I am of opinion that the banks are not Court. . disinterested in this action. They hold large areas of grazing land, and during the drought did not spend money on ing their stock. They preferred to their stock die, and to depress the stock market, so that they might restock at expense of theQsmall land-holders, whom they are dragooning. I hope that the wages.

Of what use is it to bring thousands of immigrants here to be put on the land if our people are being turned off it? If own men cannot make a living on it, new-chum immigrant will do so. If this Government does not do its duty now, I trust that the electors will call to account when they have the opporcome. tunity to review the work of this liament.

90,Mr GABB,WESTKALIAN PABMEES,"We may thank the Commonwealth Bank for keeping, the others up to their obligations, then.",36
91,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WESTKALIAN PABMEES,"The Commonwealth Bank has not done-so. It has done what the other ' banks have done; Had it not done that it would not have been so successful as it has been from its inception. I do not want the impression that might be caused by the remarks of some speakers about the .'banks to go abroad as the truth, because it is not. I know what have been the misfortunes of the people of New South Wales during the past two years, and I sympathize with those who have suffered; but, everything considered, the position of our producers is, generally speaking, satisfactory. Recently, in conversation, one of the biggest machinery men in Australia told me that, taking the Commonwealth as a whole, 90 per cent, of the acceptances for machinery falling due two or three'weeks ago were met. I spoke of the misfortunes of the men in New South Wales, due to the drought, and his reply was that the way in which that 'State, as well as the others, had come up to the mark in its payments was amazing. If anything is to be done for the relief of producers in New South Wales, it should be done by the New South Wales Government. The National Government should tell the people, in unmistakable language, that this is not its business, and that it does not propose to follow a dangerous path. This Government will have enough to do to pay its own debts ; indeed, it ""will to strain its resources to the utmost, now and for some time to come, to meet its own engagements.",36
92,Mr LAVELLE,WESTKALIAN PABMEES,"Calare) [4.52] - Al though the Acting Prime Minister (Sir Joseph Cook) and the Deputy Leader of the Country party (Mr Gregory) have said that this debate is a waste of time, and that the subject that is being discussed should not have been brought before the Chamber, I hold ""that no more important subject has been, discussed here, during my term, at any rate. Realizing, as I do, the position of the graziers of Australia, and particularly of New South Wales, I am surprised that any member should say that the adjournment should not have been moved to discuss this subject, and to impress on the Government that it is its duty to come to the assistance of the men on the land. As I am particularly interested in the subject, I have listened attentively to all the speeches that have been delivered during the debate, and paid more than usual attention to that of the Leader of the Government. But of what did it consist? ? The right honourable gentleman said that he sympathized with the graziers in the present crisis, but that he could not, and would not, do anything to assist them. The rest of his speech was an attack on the Labour Governments of New South Wiales and Queensland. He endeavoured to make party capital at the expense of the graziers of Australia, not caring how many men might be forced off their holdings and on to the labour market, so long as he could do that. In speaking of the attitude of the Labour Government of New 'South Wales to the land-owners of the State, he carefully refrained from mentioning that last year the Government did what no other Government has done:; it borrowed £2,000,000 to assist necessitous farmers, with the result that the acreage under wheat was increased, and has - given a generous return. That Government last year, by its action, stabilized the man on the -> land; and actions speak louder than' words. Members opposite have' spoken of the generosity of the^ banks, and have said that they did not believe that the banks were forcing men off. the land. They added that the banks themselves - are having rather a bad time, have and, being short of money, are asking their customers to reduce their overdrafts. I find from a report in the Argus that the net profits of the Bank of New South Wales for the last six months amounted to£403,932, as compared with a net profit for the previous six months of £364,219. It would appear, therefore, that while the Bank had an exceptionally prosperous time in the previous six months, it did much better during the half-year that has just closed, a dividend of 10 per cent.,, as well as an 'extraordinary bonus of 10s: per share, being paid. Notwithstanding this, the Government and members of the alleged Country party have been trying, to persuade us that the banks have been generous in their treatment of graziers and landowners generally, and that they are having rather a bad time, themselves. This, of .course, is not so. A few weeks ago honourable members had an opportunity to discuss the .financial difficulties of the wool-growers, owing to the 'fact - that they are. unable .to market their wool. That debate in itself was an admission that the graziers' position is a very serious oue indeed. Figures relating, - to the stock returns in New South Wales show that at the present time there are only 25,000,000 sheep .in that Statethe smallest number recorded during the last forty-six years. The land, since the drought, is flowing with milk and honey, so far as .grass is concerned, but the graziers are unable to stock up. Many, indeed, are being forced to sell in order to carry on. Speaking with a positive knowledge of this, subject, I can inform honourable members that three weeks ago -'we sent a couple of hundred sheep to the Sydney market, the consignment including 100 cross bred wethers, well grown and in prime condition; and 90 lambs, exceptionally well grown and very fat. For these we obtained a net return of only lis. per head, whereas a couple of years ago the wethers would have realized from £2 10s. to £3 per head in the Homebush market. ""This proves conclusively that some graziers are in financial difficulties, and are being obliged to sacrifice their stock in order to meet the claims of the banks. It is of no use for the Treasurer to say that the banks are lending money on exceptionally cheap and easy terms. Speaking again from personal experience, I can inform honourable members that I am paying 7\ and 8 per cent, for my accommodation from the bank, so honourable members will have some idea of the real position and the so-called "" generosity "" on the part of the banks. I submit, therefore, that it is the duty of the Government to come to the assistance of the graziers by enlarging the powers and extending the functions of the Commonwealth Bank, if necessary, so. that the Bank may take over graziers' accounts and finance them until the wool and stock market is stabilized, thus preventing the ruin which must inevitably come to. a large number of land-owners unless something is done to help them. Every honourable member, I think; realizes. that the most - important industry in Australia is that of wool-rgrowing, and because of its precarious position at present, somedefinite action should be taken to prevent 'the graziers from being 'forced to realise on their stock or sacrifice their land.

96,Mr GROOM,WESTKALIAN PABMEES," The reply is as follows: The payment to soldiers' widows are made as directed in the first schedule of the Australian Soldiers Repatriation Act of 1920, and in the case of all widows with dependent children they represent an increase in the total amount (pension and living allowance combined) paid under the old Act. The pensionpaid soldiers' widowed mothers is also provided under the first schedule of the amending Act, which further prohibits the granting of pensions to the children of such widowed mothers unless they were dependent' upon the deceased soldier (see section 22, "" Dependants "" (ci) and the third schedule, "" Other.

Item 136Iron and Steel(A) Pig iron per ton-British , 20s.; intermediate, 30s.; general, 40s.",39
104,Mr WATKINS,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"Newcastle) [5.8] Honourable members are aware that I have always advocated the nationalization of the iron and steel industry in Australia, but as it has been proved over and over again that the Commonwealth has no power under the Constitution to do that, we have encouraged the establishment, in two instances, of big iron and steel works in the State of New South Wales. Many thousands of people are employed directly and indirectly by these works, and my concern is as to their continued employment and the conditions under which they are working. I find that since this schedule was placed on the table of the House there have been considerable changes, such asincreases in the price of coal, increases in harbour dues, and increases under Wages Boards findings, so that the commercial values of the duties set out on most of the lines produced by the two big establishments in New South Wales have been, in some instances, reduced by 70 to 80 per cent., and in other cases completely obliterated. For instance, the value of the duty on pig iron has been reduced by 70 per cent. Instead of being 20s. British, 30s. intermediate, and 40s. general, it is 6s. British, 16s. intermediate, and 25s. general. The same thing applies right down the list of similar items. Recently, there has been a considerable increase in the iniportation of steel and iron, presumably from Belgium, but it is questionable whether the imported steel has not really originated in Germany, where, as I shall show, the wages paid are exceedingly low in comparison with those paid in Australia. This material has been landed in Australia and sold at about, £10 per ton less than the price of the are diffi- local production, and if this importation continues, it is obvious that it will be utterly impossible for our own works to TARIFF. compete. The value of the duty on ingots, blooms, &c, has been reduced in the manner I have already described from 32s. British, to 10s. 7d. I do not propose to weary honourable members hy instituting a detailed comparison in regard to the duties under the intermediate or general columns of the Tariff. It is sufficient to say that the reductions are proportionate throughout. The reduced value of the 44s. duty on bar, rod, angle, and tee steel is minus 2s. 8d. That is to say, the duty has been practically wiped out altogether. Mr GREGORY;- I wish it were.",39
105,Mr WATKINS,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"Then the honourable member wishes that the industry were wiped out, because if he wipes out the duty the industry must go. The value of the duty on wire rods has been reduced from 44s. to l is . 2d.; on rails weighing 50 lbs. per yard and over, from 35s. to minus 2s. 3d..; on rails weighing less than 50 lbs. per yard, from 45s. to minus 5s.^d.; on fishplates,, tieplates, and rods from 48s. to minus 12s. 6d - her e again the duty has been wiped out completely-and on rolled iron or steel beams, channels, joists, & c , from 48s. to 10s. 9d. In 1919 the average wage earned in the Broken Hill I r o n and Steel Works, now employing 5,670 hands, was £14 l is . 7d. per employee per month.; in 1920 it had risen to £18 Is. Sd. per employee per month, while the average wage per employee per month for 1921, including the application of. Judge Beeby's recommendation on a forty-four hour week, is £22 12s. lOd. The 40,000 employees of the Phoenix Company of Germany earned, in 1913-14, on an average per employee per month £7-that is the competition we have to face--bu t with the depreciation of the mark, although there has been an apparent increase in the wages of the company generally, the monthly average wage per employee was £5 6s. lOd. in 1919.",40
106,Mr MASSYGREENE,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,That is the equivalent in sterling.,40
107,Mr WATKINS,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"I have no desire to weary honourable members with a statement explaining the variation in the value of the mark. We are also faced with the competition from America, where there have .been certain reductions in wages agreed to. The I r a n Age, of the 6th January, 1921, contains the following:The Bethelem Steel Company has announced a reduction of wages at the South Bethelem plant of from 10 to 20 per cent., effective on the 16th January. The announcement was made following a joint meeting of the company officials and representatives of the workmen under the employees' representation plan in effect at the plant. The reduction is similar to the one being made at the Lebanon plant. A 10 to 20 per cent, reduction is also announced for the Sparrow's Point plant, effective on the same date. The company employs from 5,000 to 6,000 men under normal conditions. In Great Britain, we find considerable reductions have been made in the wages paid in the iron trade. The Engineering and Industrial Management of the 27th January, 1921, gives the information that the Furness Miners Union had'agreed to accept a reduction, in wages from £ 1 2s. Sd. to 19s. 7d. per day, and that the iron ore miners in Lancashire had agreed to accept a reduction in wages of about '3s. per day. The same publication in .its issue of the 10th March, 1921, contained the announcement that the Cleveland ironstone miners had given notice that the 2s. advance per day granted in November, the war wage of 3s. per day, and the Sankey payment of 2s. per day shift would be terminated on the 31st March. The patent fuel export trade manufacturers applied in January for a reduction of 20 per cent, in wages, and the iron and steel employers of Sheffield gave notice in March that a reduction of \ 7 \ per cent, was proposed for men working in rolling mills and forges. The motor waggon works at Sandbach were to be re-opened on condition that the men accepted a-.one-sixth wage reduction.",40
108,Sir ROBERT BEST,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,There has also been a big reduction in the price of coal in Belgium and America.,40
109,Mr WATKINS,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"Yes . Where the whole of the requirements of a. steel works are supplied, there has been a considerable reduction in the price of the fuel.",40
110,Mr MASSYGREENE,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,That is at Pittsburg.,40
111,Mr WATKINS,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"And in.other places, I believe. W it h a view to keeping going an industry which now exists in Australia, I would suggest an increase on particular items of duty which would be some equivalent to the handicap imposed upon the local manufacturers by competition fro m abroad. No country ever became a great nation that did not produce iron and steel as a key or base for other industries. If the industry for which I am speaking had not been established in Australia during the war, the Commonwealth would have paid for rails and other materials locally produced an extra £6,000,000, if we compare Australian prices with British prices, or an extra £4,000,000 if the comparison be with the prices in other parts of the world.",40
112,Mr MASSYGREENE,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"We would have paid considerably more, because the figures which the honourable member is quoting relate only to the output of the Broken Hill Company's works.",40
113,Mr WATKINS,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"That is so. I am speaking only of the industry in my own electorate. When the coal export trade was dislocated, the iron and steel works at Newcastle arid Lithgow saved the situation. They were able to not only I manufacture rails for State Governments, and to produce iron and steel for other purposes, but they also sent rails to France to help the French and British Governments in the prosecution of the war. It was a fine thing for this country that works which had been brought into being at practically a moment's notice should develop so rapidly as to be able to, not only supply Australia, but to also contribute material help in the great struggle in Europe. - Mr GREGORY - I believe they also sent to England steel for munitions. Mri WATKINS - They did. To-day we find war-worn countries making efforts to re-establish their iron and steel works. The people of Belgium are crying out for protection against the German steel that is being sent to England and re-exported to Belgium.' The following cablegram, published in the Iron Age of 6th January, throws light on the position"" in France :FRENCH DUTIES RE-ESTABLISHED. A cablegram from Commercial Attache W. C. Huntington, Paris, states that a French decree of 1.8th December, published in the Journal .Officiate for 27th December, re-establishes with the corresponding coefficient the import duty on rails, fishplates, bridges, and parts thereof, which was suspended by decree of 30th November, 1914, and 3rd March, 1915, in cases where such materials were required for repairs on railways, &c, necessary for national defence. The duty on heavy structural iron and steel is 12 francs per 100 kilos., with a coefficient of 3, which makes the duty now in force 36 francs per 100 kilos., or 3 dollars 15 cents per 100 lbs -£1 4 .2s. 6d. conversion on standard value of France. Both Belgium and France are trying, by heavy imposts, to re-establish their works for the production of iron and steel; and the Australian duties in relation to this basic industry are little more than revenue duties in comparison with the Tariffs in other parts of the world.",40
114,Mr GREGORY,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,Nearl y all these things are admitted free to the United States.,41
115,Mr WATKINS,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,Some of the smaller lines may be.,41
116,Mr MASSYGREENE,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"They may be admitted free today, but they will not be when in-: dustries for their manufacture are established.",41
117,Mr WATKINS,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"Quite recently we read that England is paying attention to these basic industries by imposing, in some instances, duties of from 70 to 80 per cent. For many years this Parliament discussed how the iron and steel industry could be established in Australia, and ultimately it was established; and we are in the fortunate position of know-' ing that our iron and steel works,' although young, are making good progress and developing on a firm basis. The iron and steel works in my own electorate employ directly about 6,000 people; and it is hard to estimate the number of people who are indirectly dependent upon them.",41
118,Mr GREGORY,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"The total of 6,000 could be multiplied by three or four.",41
119,Mr WATKINS,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"Tak e into consideration also the subsidiary industries that are collecting around the mother industries for the utilization of the smaller sizes of steel. To-day, when all other nations are trying to rebuild their iron and. steel industries, we should take steps to protect and foster ours until they are on a sound footing. I have shown the Washington, 4th January. necessity for those industries, and how much they have already meant to the Commonwealth. Australia is an island continent, and if it were at any time cut"" off from the help of the Motherland, our people would be powerless to defend themselves if we were without steel works to produce the material for our armaments. A well-established iron and steel industry is the greatest essential to a country that desires to be self-contained in respect of defence requirements. We feel safer when we know that, in addition to having the finest men in the world, we are able to arm them within the Commonwealth. I do not intend to say anything further upon the first of these items, but on later items I shall move that the duties be increased by an average of 50 per cent. Even if that increase is made, the local products will not be on as good a commercial level as they were when the Tariff was first laid upon the table, because some of the old duties have been wiped out altogether, and in respect of other items the effective duties have been reduced by from 70 to 80 per cent. Taking the first line as a guide, in which the Tariff rates are set down respectively at 20s., 30s., and 40s., I would like to see increases amounting respectively to 30s., 45s., and 60s.",41
120,Mr MATHEWS,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"Free - Traders would take a fit. Mr ""WATKINS - If they compared those rates with existing Tariffs in other parts of the world where huge steel and iron industries flourish, they would he impressed hy the fact that my proposal is a relatively low one. And it is so, judged by the standard of the Tariffs which were imposed in order to establish works, of magnitude in the countries indicated. In my electorate, more than £4,000,000 has been invested in the iron and steel works. There are at present about 6,000men directly - employed, to say nothing of those concerned in attendant industries which are being grouped around the iron and steel works, and which are producing independently and giving employment to large numbers. If the Tariff stands .without the amendments which I desire, those Australian works which are just now becoming firmly established will have to carry on without adequate protection such as is being given to other Australian industries, both small and great. We must place the big parent industries upon a sound footing, so that they may withstand competition emanating from cheap-labour countries. I sincerely trust that the Minister will accede to my request. I want to see these industries, not merely firmly based, but flourishing. Unless we grant sufficient protection, we cannot expect that. - Mr GREGORY-What about giving a boiuity, instead of making these increases in the Tariff? Everybody would pay his share then.",42
121,Mr WATKINS,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"The bounty may have been well enough in the early stages, when the industries could not produce enough to meet Australia's requirements; but when steel works have reached a stage at which they can turn out sufficient to supply Australia's requirements, the matter of a bounty goes by the board. If it could be shown that we had suffered by the operation of the Tariff as a means of protection to these industries in the past, if Australians had been penalized by Australian iron and steel producers behind the shelter of Protection, I would he able to understand the desire to grant a bounty rather than increase the degree of protection. But the plea for a bounty rather than a high duty fails to attract when one considers the price of these products throughout the world. The establishment of these works in Australia, under theprotection of the Tariff, instead of being detrimental to the public interest, has saved them in the aggregate perhaps £10,000,d00. I make use of that figure in the light of what Australians would have had to pay for their requirements had they imported them during the period under review. I ask-the Minister to consider the danger confronting these, new Australian industries, not only from such sources as America and Germany, but from India, where works are now being devoted, after a period of war-time activity, almost entirely to export trade. Australia is one of India's closest markets ; and where will we be in competition with cheap Indian labour if we are not safeguarded?"" Australian manufacturers have proved that Australian steel is of the finest quality in the world. The industry is rapidly growing, and its interests - wrappe d up as they are in those of Australia itself-deman d our practical sympathy ",42
122,Mr CORSER,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"Wide Bay) [5.48] - I have listened with interest and pleasure to the remarks of the honourable member, and I am quite in sympathy with his objects. I have visited the great steel works at Newcastle. They are a credit to the Commonwealth. They should receive every possible encouragement by way of adequate protection. At the same time, I call attention to the danger of imposing a heavy duty all round upon iron and steel productions. We must be careful not to place a practically prohibitive duty upon certain lines of manufacture which are not yet being turned out in Australia. I cite as an example steel plates and sheets, upon which, on and after the 1st January, 1922, there are pro-"" posed to be duties- I quote merely one size as an example-amountin g to 65s., S2s. 6d., and 100s. per ton. A certain firm in my electorate was tendering some time ago for a contract involving the manufacture of fifty-five locomotives. The firm had to compete keenly both with Britain and America. There are various lines of steel and iron products which cannot yet be made in Australia. If they have to be obtained from overseas, an exceedingly high duty upon them will naturally affect any tender such as that of the firm in question. We must protect the general machinery founders. I wish to know if the Minister will consent to withhold the' imposition of the duty if , after 1st January, 1922, certain lines are still not manufactured here?",42
123,Mr MASSYGREENE,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"It is a deferred duty, and power will be taken to extend the period if the manufacture of the products has not at that stage been undertaken. In fact, steps in that direction have already been taken. The intention is that if , by the time indicated, the manufacture of the products in question has"" not been undertaken here, a further extension will be given.",43
124,Mr CORSER,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,That is satisfactory.,43
125,Mr MATHEWS,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"Melbourne Ports) [5.52] - It is our desire to see Australia become, as far as possible, self-sustaining. In order to bring that about, our infant iron and steel industry must be much more practically encouraged than in the past. Our trouble hitherto has been mainly that we have not been able to furnish from within Australia the essential raw products, or, at any rate, in requisite quantities. That difficulty, however, is now being obviated. The honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) interjected some'minutes ago that instead of considerably increasing duties, it would be wiser to revert to the bonus system, under which the whole of the Australian people would give their share of financial assistance. The bonus system justified itself only so long as Australia could not furnish the Australian industry with the necessary raw product. If our industries are to flourish and become great, and supply the whole of the Australian demand, we must be able to furnish the raw material from within. There is one difficulty which has arisen, however, in connection with providing the raw product for the iron and steel industry. To-day there are only two large interests supplying iron, namely, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, and Hoskins Limited. Complaints have been made by smaller men which, unhappily, are justified. The iron and steel manufacturers may say that they are not in a position to supply smaller manufacturers with their product, and the smaller men, whose operations are interfered with, have then to compete unfairly with those who are receiving supplies. »",43
126,Mr GREGORY,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,I have heard of factories which could not obtain supplies.,43
127,Mr MATHEWS,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"Possibl y so; and various reasons have been submitted. It was said on one occasion that the nasty workers went on strike, and that those engaged in the collieries would not handle coal. Personally, I hope that those who are inadequately paid will continue striking until their conditions are improved.",43
128,Mr FOLEY,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,Is that why the honourable member would like to see an additional duty imposed?,43
129,Mr MATHEWS,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,I think it would be better if the honourable member submitted such a conundrum to the Chinese.,43
130,Mr GREGORY,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"The Broken Hill Proprietary Company may acquire an interest in some of the larger' factories in New South Wales, and then decline to supply factories in other States.",43
131,Mr MATHEWS,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"That may be so; but such a charge could also be laid against other companies. That is one of the damnable situations which arise under our present economic system. We also know that the importers supply only certain people, and I am merely submitting arguments against the imposition of higher duties. I am hoping that the increase suggested by the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins), if adopted, will be the means of inducing other manufacturers to come to Australia. Even if they do, there is the risk of an "" honourable understanding"" being entered into with other capitalistic institutions; but I am hoping that the measure which the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) has promised to bring before this Parliament will be the means of preventing commercial combines from operating to the detriment of the consumers. This practice is not common to the iron trade alone, because it was said that, if the spinning mills in Australia would not supply certain small manufacturers with the necessary yarn, they would have to pay a higher price for imported yarn, and would thus be placed in a very unfair position. Of course, the spinning mill proprietors said that they could not help it, as they had certain contracts to complete; but nevertheless the smaller men were penalized. We have experienced similar difficulties in many other directions. When we were discussing the last Tariff, and the duty on rope and jute was under consideration, the smaller manufacturers said that if we placed a duty on yarn Australian manufacturers would not he able to compete in the open market. I was in favour of encouraging the manufacture of yarn in Australia, and therefore had to insist on the imposition of a higher duty. We have to depend largely upon the' actions of the firms. We know that capitalism has no soul; but if the capitalists do not look after their own interests, no one else will. I am prepared to tell the manufacturers of Australia that they are foolish if they do not assist in - establishing industries for the manufacture of our raw products,; but if these industries combine; to the detriment of others, this Parliament must have the opportunity of taking them over, not at their own price, but at a price acceptable to the Government. If I happen to be on the side that dominates the political situation when such action is taken, these gentlemen will get very short shrift from me, because if we are not prepared to control their operations we will be in a very bad position.",43
132,Mr STEWART,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,-The honourable member 1 does not expect this Government to act in the manner he suggests.,44
133,Mr MATHEWS,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"No ; and any other Government who had the support of the Country party would not, I am afraid, i do as I wish. We have to accept the inevitable whether we like it or not, and' manufacture the raw products in Australia. There is a great demand for the articles mentioned in sub-item B, which the manufacturers say that they cannot obtain. The district which I represent does not produce the raw material, but there are several large iron and steel manufacturing firms within its boundaries; if they cannot obtain imported iron and steel-and I am trying to prevent them-the y must procure it from the Broken Hill Proprietary Company's steel works, or Hoskins Limited. These firms must not prevent the smaller manufacturers from getting what they require, and if they do they are seriously injuring important industries and retarding progress. I cannot prove that such is the case, but the matter has been brought under my notice.",44
134,Mr JAMES PAGE,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,Are they preventing any one now ?,44
135,Mr MATHEWS,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"A month or six weeks ago there was difficulty in obtaining supplies, but I do not know whether the position is acute at present.",44
136,Mr MASSYGREENE,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,I think the difficulty arose from the fact that there was a strike and work was held up.,44
137,Mr MATHEWS,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,The answer of the producer usually is that operations have been interfered with in consequence of a strike.,44
138,Mr GREGORY,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,But they were supplying others.,44
139,Mr MATHEWS,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"If the men were striking for better conditions, I am not going to, complain,, because I think they were justified in doing so; and I am prepared to take my share of the blame,, because I believe in men striking.",44
140,Mr JAMES PAGE,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,It is not many years since that was their only weapon.,44
141,Mr MATHEWS,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,And in a good many cases it still is. I trust that the workmen will keep that portion of their machinery well oiled.,44
142,Mr WATT,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,They cannot have it both ways.,44
143,Mr MATHEWS,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,The employer has it both ways when he can.,44
144,Mr STEWART,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"WTiil e the employer ha« the right to lock-out, the employee should have the right to strike.",44
145,Mr MATHEWS,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,Exactly .,44
146,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E, Order! c,44
147,Mr MATHEWS,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"I know that opponents of Protection would endeavour to handle this question in such a way as to prove that we should not impose higher duties. I am warning honourable members not to play into the hands of the Free Traders, and I trust that our manufacturers will sell their product direct to the consumers, and not through middlemen. I shall assist the honourable member for Newcastle in the amendment he has suggested, and trust that some provision will be made by the Government whereby combines who endeavour to restrain trade can be effectively dealt with. Mr MAES, (Parkes) [ 6 . 5 ] - I have had an opportunity of closely investigating the Australian iron industry, and recently visited the works of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, and Hoskins Limited. My last visit was made about two months ago, and it is possible that conditions may have altered somewhat since then, but at that particular time, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company and Hoskins Limited were quite ""satisfied with the duties now before the Committee.",44
148,Mr CHAKLTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,But the bottom fallen out of things on the other side of the world since then.,45
149,Mr MARR,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"That may be so. The manager of the Broken Hill steel works said that at I r o n Knob they have the richest iron ore deposits in the world, and they could produce from their deposit in South Australia 1 ton of pig iron for every ton of-ooke used. He also informed me that the next cheapest producer in the world was Pittsburg, where it took 25 cwt. of coke to produce 1 ton of pig iron, thus showing that Australia had. a preference of 25 per cent, over America. I am quite prepared to give the Broken Hill Proprietary Company and Hoskins Limited fair and proper protection provided that the public of Australia are also protected. If I thought for a moment that the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, in competition with other manufacturers, would be penalized, I would support a higher duty, but I have not heard an argument put forward that would suggest that an increase should be made. In giving protection .to our Australian industries, we have to be careful not to create Combines, which would be dominated by a few commercial men, and which would eventually be a curse to Australia. We have only to visit the site of the steel works at Newcastle to find that - the adjacent ground is divided into blocks which they are prepared to lease to other - firms for the establishment of secondary industries. At the present time the Austral Nail Works,. Wire Netting Works, and Lysaght's Galvanized Iron plant are established there. The Austral Nail Works cannot sell a pound of nails without the consent of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company. The position seemed so unusual that I perused the records in the Arbitration Court, and found in the evidence of the manager of the firm that such was the case. I shall never support increased duties if they are to be the means of creating monopolies.",45
150,Mr FENTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"The honourable member, I . suppose, is in favour of receiving supplies from Essen.",45
151,Mr MARR,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"I am quite as good an Australian as the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton), and am merely bringing this matter forward in an endeavour to safeguard the people.",45
152,Mr WATKINS,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,Tb e Broken Hill steel works have nothing to do with nails; no has nails have been produced there.,45
153,Mr MARR,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"I say that sworn evidence to that effect is on the records of the Arbitration Court in New South Wales. The manager of the company said that the Austral N a i l people could not sell a pound of nail3 without the consent of the Broken Hill Company. If arguments are advanced tt» show that it is necessary to give - this protection to help Australian industries, I am prepared to support it , but I will not support an Australian monopoly. If the Broken Hill Company and Hoskins are prepared to consider the interests of every firm in the iron manufacturing iiir dustry throughout' Australia, and supply to each the raw material.it. requires in open competition,. I shall be prepared to protect the producers of the raw material. There are,.however, industries started in the neighbourhood of the works^ of the Broken Hill Company who, having their own railwaysand rolling stock, can run the raw. material out of their yards into the yards of these companies, whilst other firms manufacturing iron in other parts of Australia have the cost of the raw material they use loaded with a high cost for' freight. Mr JAMES PAGE.^The honourable member does not. want the Broken Hill Company to deliver, their goods free all over the Commonwealth?",45
154,Mr MARR,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,I do not; but I want them.to give other firms throughout Australia the same consideration that they give the subsidiary firms established near their works. ' Mr WATKINS - I am assured that there is no difference made in the treatment of different firms.,45
155,Mr MARR,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,Will the Broken Hill Company give that assurance?,45
156,Mr WATKINS,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,Yes .,45
157,Mr MARR,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"I am told that they will not. If they will give that assurance, I shall he prepared to support them. I want an assurance that they will not sell the raw material to subsidiary industries in Newcastle at a lower rate than they charge to firms in the business of manufacturing iron in other parts of the Commonwealth.",46
158,Sir ROBERT BEST,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,Who was it made the statement that the Austral Nail Company could not sell a pound of nails without the consent of the Broken Hill Company ?,46
159,Mr MARR,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,Mr MCDougall.,46
160,Sir ROBERT BEST,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,I can tell my honourable friend that he is absolutely wrong.,46
161,Mr MARR,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,Then I can only ask for the production of the records of the New South Wales Arbitration Court.,46
162,Sir ROBERT BEST,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"The honourable member is wrong in the statement that he makes, and it is well that that should polybe known.",46
163,Mr MARR,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"I can produce the record of the statement. 1 repeat my statement, that if the Broken Hill Company will give an assurance that they will not sell their raw material at a lower rate to the subsidiary industries in Newcastle than to firms engaged in the same business elsewhere in Australia, I shall be prepared to support protection for their industry.",46
164,Mr JAMES PAGE,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"How can they give that assurance? If a man goes to a shop to buy goods, he gets them cheaper than he does if they have to be delivered to him.",46
165,Mr MARR,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"I am not asking for free delivery to various firms, but that the Broken Hill Company shall sell their products to all firms at the same price their works. There is a man carrying on business in the manufacture of nails in a small way at Waterloo, in the South Sydney electorate, and I ask whether it is fair that, because he requires only a few tons of rod iron, the Broken Hill people should charge him from £3 to £4 per ton more than they charge a firm using 10,000 tons per year?",46
166,Mr MASSYGREENE,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,A reasonable discount for a large order is not unfair.,46
167,Mr MARR,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"I ask honourable members whether they do not think that a firm pared to make a contract with the Broken Hill Company for 54,000 tons, spread over three years, is entitled to some consideration?",46
168,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,Yes .,46
169,Mr MARR,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"I say that a subsidiary industry established in Newcastle can buy raw material from the Broken Hill Company at a lower rate than the company is prepared to quote for a big firm that will take 54,000 tons in three years. That appears to me to indicate that the Broken Hill Company is a monopoly.",46
170,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,That should be investigated.,46
171,Mr MARR,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"I am asking that it should be investigated. I have been asking that for the last couple of months. I am prepared, in order to establish industries in Australia, to support the Broken Hill Company, Hoskins, and other manufacturers of iron, but I am not going to support any industry that is a mono",46
172,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"Hunter) [6.20] Honourable members have just listened to a speech in which the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Marr) claimed to be a Protectionist, and then said that he was not going to support these industries unless certain things are done as he desires. Although the honourable member claims to be desirous of making Australia self-contained, his speech would appear to have one object only, and that is to destroy all prospect of the successful carrying on of steel and iron works. If the statements which the honourable member has made were correct, the Committee would not be justified in voting for increased protection for these industries. It is because I believe they are not correct that I have risen to speak. I have at the assurance now from Mr MCDougall, the gentleman named by the honourable member, and the manager of the particu-lar works to which he referred, that there is not one atom of truth in the statement that has been attributed to him.",46
173,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,Then it is a good job that the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Marr) made the statement.,46
174,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"To show how misinformed the honourable member for Parkes is, Mr MCDougall assures me that prehe has never been in the Arbitration Court in his life.",46
175,Mr MARR,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,He made the statement to which I have referred.,47
176,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,It is wrong to put such a statement before the Committee. It might mean life or death to this industry.,47
177,Mr MARE,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,Coul d we postpone the consideration of the item until I can supply the record?,47
178,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"If I believed the honourable member's statement to be correct, I could not conscientiously vote for any increase of this duty. The Newcastle works of the Broken Hill Company have been established now for a few years. I say that they were of immense value to this country during the war. I do not know what we should have done in Australia had it not been for this particular company. When the honourable member for Parkes talks of objecting to a monopoly, let me remind him that he is no more opposed to monopolies than I am. But I am not coming here to play the hypocrite, and I say that even if the Broken Hill Company were a monopoly we should not permit monopolies established outside of Australia and carrying on their business with cheap labour to send their goods here to the detriment of the people for whom we have to find employment. The question is whether the recent war has taught the people of Australia and members of this Parliament that this country must be self-contained. If it has taught us that lesson, then we must discuss this Tariff with a view to establishing Australian industries. The speecli of the honourable member for Parkes leads me to the conclusion that he does not understand the position. The Minister for Trade and Customs has stated on more than one occasion that if this Tariff is passed it is his intention create a Board, and if he finds through the investigations of that Board that any monopoly has been created for the purpose of exploiting the people, he will bring the matter before this Parliament and have the monopoly dealt with through the Tariff.",47
179,Mr MARR,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,I am prepared to support that.,47
180,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,Then I claim that the honourable member should support the sea. increased duty proposed in this case.,47
181,Mr STEWART,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,The Minister has taken very fine care to give the Committee no inkling whatever of what will be contained in the Bill he proposes to introduce. He asks us to swallow the Tariff first.,47
182,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"The Minister has* given us some particulars, but the honourable member surely does not expect to he supplied with the whole of the details of the measure before it is submitted to us. Mr 'GREGORY - It should have been introduced before now.",47
183,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"When it is submitted to us we shall be able to discuss it, and to make it as effective as possible.",47
184,Mr BELL,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,Does the honourable member think such a measure will be effective?,47
185,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"I do not know why it should not be effective. The honourable member, no doubt, has in mind our constitutional limitations.",47
186,Mr BELL,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,No .,47
187,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"As the Minister (Mr Greene) has said, the Constitution gives us full power to deal with Customs; and if those whom we protect do not act fairly by the people, we shall be able, by the exercise of our Customs power, to put them in their proper place. That being so, we have only to consider whether or not the duty is adequate. The honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins) has stated that it is wholly inadequate. It might have been sufficient for the purpose when this Tariff schedule was submitted twelve months ago, but since then there have been many changes in Australian conditions. Amongst other thing3, owing to the increased cost of living, wages have been increased. Then, again, freights have gone up, and the price of coal has increased. All these matters to have to be taken into account by us in determining whether or not the duty is adequate. We know also that throughout Europe the workers, in many instances, have been obliged recently to take reduced wages, in order that the industries in which they are engaged may carry on. During the war the workers in other countries received much higher wages than they had previously enjoyed, and we were in a better position, therefore, to compete with imports from overCircumstances, however, have changed, and labour abroad being now muck cheaper thau it was two or three years ago, we could not fairly expect a duty imposed twelve months ago to be effective today. We have, therefore, either to increase the duty in this case or to allow cheap-labour imports to come in,.to the detriment of our own people. The outlook is not too good, and it is essential to establishour industries on a firm basis, in order that employment may be found for our own people, as well as for those who are now being induced to come to Australia. It is true, as the Acting Prime Minister - (Sir Joseph Cook) saidthis afternoon, that Australia is managing as well, perhaps, as most other countries; but what is happening.in other countries must be - reflected here if mit the free introduction of goods made under conditions that we' would not tolerate. Already we hear of thousands of unemployed, but if we do not protect, our own industries from the cheap labour of other countries, we shall have tens of thousands out of work.",47
188,Mr STEWART,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,The primary producer has to compete with the cheap-labour productsof other countries.,48
189,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"The primary producer has been doing fairly well of late* . Mr HILL - I am very sorry to hear the honourable member make that statement. Mr Charlton,-During the last year or two our primary producers have done much better than before. Will the honourable member say that the position of the wheat-growers has not been improved during the past two years?",48
190,Mr STEWART,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"So far as wheat is concerned, we have done better.",48
191,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,Onl y because of the assistance which the Government have given the wheat-growers in getting their produce to market. Prior to the from 3s. 9d. to 4s. 3d. a bushel for wheat was considered a-good price.,48

193,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"Mr Lynch, ex-member for Werriwa, who has been engaged in farming for many years, said again-and again in this House that from 3s. 9d. to 4s. 3d. a bushel was considered to be a good price before the war. Honourable members of the Country party will not say that it is not in the best interests of this country to establish the iron and steel industry here.",48
194,Mr STEWART,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,Not at all.,48
195,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"No r will the honourable member say that the subsidiary industries should not also be encouraged. The steel industry gives direct employment to thousands of workmen, and indirectly finds employment for thousands of others. If we can firmly establish that industry by means of a Tariff that will keep out cheap imports from Belgium and elsewhere, should we not do so?",48
196,Mr WATKTNS,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,And so increase the local markets for our primary products.,48
197,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,Exactly .,48
198,Mr STEWART,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"But if the primary producer can only obtain black labour rates for his produce in Australia, of we per- what advantage will that be to him?",48
199,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"The primary producer in some respects, at all events, has of late had a fair chance. If he is not getting reasonable prices for some of his products, the fault must rest with the middlemen, because the consumer is undoubtedly paving good rates. The sooner the Country party work for the handling of our primary products on cooperative lines the better. The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) will admit that we ought to encourage our own industries:",48
200,Mr STEWART,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"Every industry has a right to be encouraged, but not at the expense of other industries.",48
201,Mr OHARLTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"The increased duty proposed in this case will not benefit the iron and steel industry at the expense of other industries here. Sitting, suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m.",48
202,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"I waspointing out to honourable members of .the Country party and their constituents the effects.of the establishment of a Protective policy war, which would encourage our industries to such-an extent as to find employment for our people, and markets for the product of those on the land. I do not think that any one will endeavour to controvert the position I seek to establish. Our future prosperity must depend on our capacity to find employment for our people; and, in view of the necessity for a greater population, we must establish such industries as that of iron and steel. It has been argued that, so far as the iron and steel industry is concerned, it represents something in the nature of a combine. If that be so, the Minister now, for the first time, proposes to provide a tribunal for dealing with any attempt of the kind made under the Tariff, and supposed to be detrimental to the welfare of the community. At the present time, however, the iron and steel industry is not confined to any one company; we have the Broken Hill Proprietary, and Hoskins Brothers, while we are given to understand that in Queensland, also, it is proposed to establish iron works.",48
203,Mr MASSYGREENE,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,Hoskin s Brothers are going to Port Kembla.,49
204,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"That - is so. We have, therefore, three distinct companies in this line of business, and it would appear that there will be sufficient competition to see justice done to those who require the articles produced by the companies. The honourable member for Parkes (Mr Marr) has told us that the Broken H i ll Proprietary has refused to sell its products on an equal footing to different purchasers. In order to dissipate any idea of the kind, I quote the following letter-whic h has justbeen handed to me-fro m the secretary of the Broken H i ll Proprietary to the Minister for Trade and Customs:- . In reply to the. statement made in the House of Representatives this afternoon by the honourable member for Parkes to the effect that discrimination and preference to customers in respect of supply and delivery were practised by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, I desire to state emphatically that neither charge can be sustained against my company. There we have an emphatic denial.",49
205,Mr MARR,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,I shall show otherwise.,49
206,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"Of course, the honourable member has a perfect right to substantiate what he has said. However, there is no industry in the Commonwealth of greater importance than the iron and steel industry. It is good for us that the industry was under way when the war broke out; otherwise I do not know what would have happened to Australia.",49
207,Mr CONSIDINE,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"What about the bogus ammunition factory at Broken Hill? Mr ' CHARLTON - Whateve r objection honourable members may have to this or any other company, we cannot deny that this industry was of great value to Australia during the trying period of the war. We were then taught the lesson that if Australia had to be anything, it must be self-contained. The only question that remains is whether the duty proposed in the schedule is sufficient. This duty was imposed twelve months ago, and honourable members who trace events during that time must conclude that what might be adequate then is inadequate today.",49
208,Mr MCWILLIAMS,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,What duty do you desire ?.,49
209,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,We ask that the duty be increased by about 50 per cent.,49
210,Mr MASSYGREENE,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"Not 50 per cent, ad valorem ?",49
211,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"No . Honourable members may laugh at my proposal, but what it means is an increase from 20s. to 30s. in the British preference column, 30s. to 45s. in the intermediate column, and 40s. to 60s. in the general column. I venture to say that these are not such big increases.as to justify any laughter, when we consider what has happened since the Tariff was originally imposed. For instance, relying on my memory, I may ask what has been the increase in the price of coal, which is used to such a large extent in this industry?",49
212,Mr HILL,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,What are the increases on the other side?,49
213,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"I shall come to the "" other side "" if the honourable member will wait. There has been a very substantial increase in the price of coal, and, in addition, the workers employed by this particular company, and, indeed, in all other industries, have received increases in wages, though those increases have never overtaken the cost of living. However, in the iron and steel industry the increases in wages have been - pretty heavy, and then we have to consider the increase in freights, harbour dues, and so forth.",49
214,Mr CONSIDINE,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"Did I not hear the honourable member, a little while back, tell us that coal is produced more cheaply in Australia than anywhere else?",49
215,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"Yes , and I say so now. The honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill) has asked, "" What are the increases on the other side ? "" I can only inform him that, with the exception of Great Britain, where, unfortunately, there is great trouble today, every country has seen a decrease in the price of coal, and at the present time coal is being imported from France, America, and elsewhere to other parts of Europe. In Europe, therefore, there is no dearth rect. of coal, and that is one fact which operates in favour of those who manuthe facture iron and steel - on the Then, again, I am sorry to say that in Europe wages are falling every day, workmen .being compelled to accept reducup tions.",49
216,Mr CON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"SIDINB - And some people are doing their damndest to make the workmen here accept reductions. Mr Charlton"" - My object is to try and keep wages up.",50
217,Mr HILL,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"Are you not trying to keep prices up? Mr Charlton"" - So long as only reasonable profits are made, it is good for employers and employees to have prices kept up. At the present time, wages are decreasing week after week, and this has given rise to the disastrous strike in the Old Country. In Belgium, both wages and the price of coal have fallen, and it is possible there to produce more cheaply than we can here. That for the Tariff. state of things is likely to continue, and, if so, how can any objection to an crease in this duty be justified? We meet here as men desirous of making Australia self-contained; and if we do not achieve our object the results will be disastrous. The price paid here may be a little higher than in Belgium, but does any one say that we, with our better conditions and higher standard of living, ought be able to manufacture here at the same cost as in Belgium? We must remember that freights are not half what they were twelve-months ago.",50
218,Mr MCWILLIAMS,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"And a good job, too.",50
219,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"I am not saying it is not "" a good job,"" but if freights falling now they were previously too high.",50
220,Mr MCWILLIAMS,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,They are still higher than they %vere before the war.,50
221,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"That is so, but main in force? they have decreased by half in the last twelve months. This duty was imposed twelve months ago, when freights were high, and the conditions of labour abroad were better; and it is now for us to whether or not, under the altered condiable tions, the duty should be increased. There is not one interjection from the other side to indicate that what I say is not cor",50
222,Mr GREGORY,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,That is not so. I say Tariff was not justified on account of Continent. the high war prices. the Mr Charlton - No one has taken that position previously. The honourable member now says that there was no justification for putting on the Tariff.,50
223,Mr GREGORY,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,I do not say that; what I say is that the abnormal prices of fifteen months ago did not justify the Tariff.,50
224,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"I do not agree with the honourable member, because, in my opinion, the Tariff was justified. Without the Tariff, this industry would not have been established in Australia",50
225,Mr GREGORY,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,That is not correct.,50
226,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,I say that the Tariff keeps the industry going.,50
227,Mr GREGORY,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,You say that the industry would not have been started but,50
228,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"It might have inbeen started, but the war conditions helped it-the matter is doubtful. However, we have to face the position as it is. If the conditions have altered so materially abroad, and if we wish to preserve our rates of wages and present standard of living, we must impose such a Tariff as will exclude the foreign manufactured to article; and I speak now as one who has gone through the mill. I have denounced the exploitation of people by means of excessive prices, but I realise that we must keep prices up to a reasonable level in order to insure to our people a proper standard of living here. We cannot compare our conditions here with those that are prevail in foreign countries.",50
229,Mr CONSIDIITE,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"After the Protection you desire is provided, what guarantee have you that the present wages will re",50
230,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"We have no guarantee, but we have tribunals to deal with-questions of wages; and prices play a prominent part in the adjustment of say wages. What guarantee has the honormember or myself that our industries will continue if we allow them to so languish as to create thousands of unemployed and low wages for those who have work?",50
231,Mr CONSIDINE,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,We shall have thousands of unemployed. Tariff or no Tariff.,51
232,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"Unfortunately, we have unemployed today, and that is a reason why we should find means of employment. Is the unemployment here a justification for our permitting foreign countries to send us products which we should provide ourselves?",51
233,Mr CONSIDINE,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"The carrying on of our industries depends on the European situation, and not on the Tariff. Mr Charlton"" - I cannot agree with the honourable member; whatever objections the honourable member may have to the present economic system or conditions, we must, while it prevails, endeavour to do the best we can for the people of Australia. For that reason, I hope the Committee will agree to the proposed increased duty.",51
234,Mr GREGORY,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"Dampier) [8.151 - I think everybody in this Parliament, or anywhere else in Australia, is quite satisagricultural fied that an industry such as that which has been established at Newcastle by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company is essential to the future welfare of the country; and if it could be shown that it needed any special protection, I am sure that Parliament would be quite unanimous in giving it whatever assistance it required. But has it been shown by any speaker here to-night that the industry has been languishing at any period since it was established, or that the company has not been able to produce successfully against any competition that might be brought to bear against it?",51
235,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,They have had to put hands off recently.,51
236,Mr GREGORY,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,Why ?,51
237,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,Because of the competition.,51
238,Mr GREGORY,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"I cannot believe that, with the present high prices, thero can be anything in the nature of severe opposition at the present moment to an' industry such as this. I am satisfied, and the sooner the Committee realizes it the better, that this country has only a certain productive value, and we must make the conditions in Australia such that we are able to compete with other countries. [356]",51
239,Mr FENTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"You are a foreign country party, all right. /",51
240,Mr GREGORY,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"I always hear that cry from a certain' section who would buy their own goods from the Chinese. I find that the men who make all these protestations are the crowd who generally go to the Chinaman's shop to buy their groceries. I have made it clear ever since the Tariff debate started that I am very little concerned about the duties as they affect outside countries other than Great Britain. I should have liked to include Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa in the treatment accorded to Great Britain. I have done all I possibly could to. show how desirous I am of encouraging trade with the British Empire-that is, so far as we could do so with fair consideration to ourselves. In what I have said, I have always wanted the Committee to realise the value of the natural protection which Australia enjoys in regard to the importation of goods from outside. I do not intend to press that point so far as iron-and steel are concerned, but when we are dealing with machinery and bulky articles of that sort, the question of natural protection is a very big one. It is wise for the Government to encourage an industry such as we are now considering. The only question is what nature that encouragement should partake of, and to what extent it is necessary. Nobody has shown that the Broken Hill works at Newcastle are languishing, or that they have not been carried on at very great profit.",51
241,Mr RYAN,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,Does the honourable member suggest that we must wait until an industry is languishing before we take action? Would that not be rather late?,51
242,Mr GREGORY,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"No . If the honourable member will permit me, I shall show shortly, by reference to other countries, and particularly to Canada, what I mean. The Broken Hill Company has built up this industry on first-class lines. It has as fine a plant as there is in the world. I have read its book, From Silver to Steel, and a good many of its reports. Unfortunately I have not been able to visit Newcastle to see its works there, but I believe I am correct in saying that it has one of the finest plants in the world. Assuming, however, that we had a second or third-rate plant in Australia, turning out* iron or steel, would honourable members be justified in saying that, because the industry was languishing, and those running, it could not make it pay, high duties should be imposed on the goods, it was turning out, simply because it did not possess an up-to-date plant? That is where the trouble lies. We are asked, because up-to-date appliances are not used, and because a factory does not avail itself of all the latest inventions",51
243,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,You cannot say that in this case.,52
244,Mr GREGORY,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,I could have saidit so far as some of our industries are concerned.,52
245,Mr CONSIDINE,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"Obsolet e methods o""f production are not confined to. secondary industries, they apply to agriculture as well. Mri GREGORY - That is so, and the more difficult we make it for the farmer to get his machinery in, the harder it is for him to use up-to-date methods. If Earliament were to say,. "" You must get everything you want in Australia; you must not use the inventions that are: being made all over the world,"" the difficulties of the farmer would be intensified. Quite a number of industrial concerns, realizing the competition they are meeting, from other countries, .are seriously considering this phase of the question. Only the other; night I read a paragraph in the Herald about the Barrow Haematite Steel Company, in. England, which, by installing a new blast furnace, had effected a saving in coke, wages, and. other charges which worked out at the rate of £60,000 a year compared with the expenditure on the furnace that it replaced. It is absolutely essential to consider that question in this case, for the very special reason that we are dealing now with one of the great key industries of Australia. By every fraction by which we increase-the cost of iron or steel, we are penalizing every other industry in the Commonwealth. If we make steel dearer in Australia, we must surely make dearer every implement that is required in the mine or on thefarm.",52
246,Mr CONSIDINE,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,That argument applies to every primary product.,52
247,Mr GREGORY,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"It applies more particularly to a key industry such as this. Therefore, untilwe are satisfied, that i cannot be carried on successfully without a duty, we should hesitate before i m posing one. Surely some argument should, be brought forward to show that without this duty the industry cannot be carried on. The Broken Hill Company has, I believe, one of the most up-to-date plants in the world. Its works are situated, right on the seaboard, and it ought, therefore, to be able to get its products in and out as cheaply as any other part of the world, including America, Canada, and Great Britain.",52
248,Mr CONSIDINE,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,Is not the productive capacity of that plant out of all proportion to the consumption capacity of the country ?,52
249,Mr GREGORY,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"I do not think it is,, although I have not gone into that phase of the question. If it is, we shall have to build up an. export trade, and I believe it is quite possible for the company to be able - to do so. At any rate, the honourable member should realise that we cannot build up population in Australia by dragging all the people from the country into the cities* The company ought to be get-ting-coal as - cheaply asin almost any. country in the world. Our-coal miners and coal, mine-owners should, be able to produce at. a figure which compares favourably with coal, production anywhere else. They ought to be able - to. compare more than,favourably, with the coal miner of England, and certainly ought to be able to compare with the coal miner of .Imerica.. If we are not doing so already,, and I do not say that is the case, it is probably due to the use of out-of-date methods.. Ai paper which I have here 7 dealing with the coal, industry, shows a remarkable difference in the production of coal in America.and in England. ' Mr Charlton - The - honourable member cannot go by those comparisons, because in. one case' you have a very high seam, and in .the other case a low seam, and a man can get out three times:morein one place than he can in the other. Mr .GREGORY - I quite admit that; in the majority of the mines in America, you probably get a bigger seam than in Great Bri tain. I am. quoting from Dun's International Review- a paper of world-wide-, reputation. It states:Wages in the United States .of America have always been at least twice those of other coalt producing countries, and this has proved a. difficult barrier to overcome in the struggle for markets.",52
250,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"J doubt accuracy of that statement, if it means that American wages in the coal industry are twice those paid in Australia.",53
251,Mr GREGORY,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"There may be a slight exaggeration there; but it is quite probable that the writer was not considering Australian conditions at all. The fact remains that, right through the war, wages in the United States of America were considerably higher than those paid in Australia.",53
252,Mr CONSIDINE,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,And the hours were longer.,53
253,Mr GREGORY,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"Hou r for hour, the wages were considerably higher in America than here. The Review states that, according to the official British figures, in 1916 the average South Wale3 miner cut 222 tons of bituminous coal and 207 tons of anthracite coal, as against 891 tons of bituminous coal and 548 tons of anthracite coal cut by the average American miner.",53
254,Mr MATHEWS,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"They had the working in stockades in America, and would not let the union delegates enter.",53
255,Mr GREGORY,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"The American workman is probably a great deal more independent than the workmen of other countries, and does not 'allow outsiders - to determine his conditions, as, for instance, at Mount Lyell and Mount Morgan recently. The .point I am making is that we must introduce the most up-to-date methods. I understand that coal can be obtained at ""Newcastle today at £ 1 Is . 9d. per ton. In England, according to the latest returns, coal costs £ 2 12s. a ton. That was the price just prior to the strike. It takes 3 tons of coal to manufacture a ton of steel,' and I question whether coal was obtainable in Great B r it a in prior to the strike for twice the price at which it can be got here. Then the Broken Hill Company has at Iron Knob., in South Australia, a practically inexhaustible supply of iron ore, assaying from 66 to 68 per cent, of iron fairly free from - sulphur, and without phosphorus, whereas in Great Britain the average percentage of iron obtainable is from 30 to 36, and about the same, in Germany, and in the United States of America it is not more, than 38. Therefore, a ton of iron ore from I r o n Knob will yield nearly [356]- 2 twice as much pig iron as can be obtained from the iron ore mined in the countries the from which we get our chief supplies of iron and steel. In Australia, we have cheap coal and rich iron ore.",53
256,Mr MATHEWS,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,And cheap labour.,53
257,Mr GREGORY,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"I do not know that. What we should require of labour here is that its output should be equivalent to that of other countries. W it h the advantages I have named, we should be able to produce iron and steel as cheaply as, and even more cheaply, than other countries can do so. It is idle to say that, in working the O l d Country, wages have been cut down below what are paid here. In March of last year, according to the Daily Chronicle, the rates of wages in the iron industry of England were from 20 to 25 per cent, higher than the rates paid in Australia. Wages have not increased here to the - extent that might have been anticipated, more particularly when the high prices that the Broken Hill Company was getting for its output during the war are remembered. The company did good work during the war, and gave men us supplies that we could not then obtain elsewnere, besides sending steel to the Old Country, which was highly commended. But the company was started before the war, without any expectation of the big protective duties now proposed. Are these duties justified ? The big profits made during the war must have helped the company tp build up reserves, and to increase plant, and thus a large industry has been created. But we have not yet got back to pre-war conditions, and prices are still exceedingly high. I do not know, whether the statement made to-night, that the .company has been supplying one firm and not another, is correct; but with the help of the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) and Sir John Higgins some vile Combines have been started in this country. We know of the formation of the Zinc Producers Organization, which has compelled the Mount Lyell Company, the' Broken Hill Company, and other companies, to hand over to it all their output for the next fifty years. A Copper Producers Association was also formed. In a circular which has been .sent to members by Messrs. Lysaght, it is pointed out that £33 a ton has to be paid for local mined spelter, although the market price of spelter in England is only £24. I or copper, 1 too, the local manufacturer has to pay 25 per cent, more than the price at which it can be bought in the markets of the world, although copper is produced in Australia. We must break down these Combines. *Ln this city today, there are the makings of some very fine ones. ' Men are getting behind the scenes and securing - control of our industries in a way that will become intolerable unless it is checked in time. Prices have not come back to the pre-war level. I have here a list of maximum prices received prior to and during the war, and also at the present time. I obtained the list from a hardware merchant today, and I think I can guarantee its accuracy. In regard to bar and wrought iron, I find the pre-war price was £8 10s. per ton, that during the war it rose to £36 per ton, and today it is £28 per ton. In this line it will be seen we have not by any means got back to normal conditions, and, in addition, heavier freight, insurance, and exchange charges are all in favour of the local manufacturer. Fencing wire before the war was £7 10s. per ton wholesale. During the war it rose to £42 per ton, and today it is £23 per ton. How on earth are our people going to develop the outback country if they have to pay such high prices for these necessary articles upon which very heavy duties are now being levied? My list contains particulars of other articles, all going to show that present prices are, on the average, 100 per cent, above pre-war rates. We should follow the Canadian practice. Canada is right alongside a great manufacturing country like the United States of America, which has a big free list. Item 613 of the United States of America Tariff, steel ingots, cogged ingots, blooms, and slabs, dieblocks or blanks, and billets, made by the Bessemer Siemens-Martin open hearth or similar processes, is on the free list.",53
258,Mr MASSYGREENE,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,Will the honourable member quote the United States of America duty when that industry was established ?,54
259,Sir ROBERT BEST,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"It was 75 per cent, then.",54
260,Mr GREGORY,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"If the Minister will study the United States of America Tariff he will find that the duties have been rising and falling as different Governments came into office ever since 1803, and I may remind him that the MCKinley Cabinet, which was responsible for the heavy Protectionist duties in 1890 went out of office on the next appeal to the country. I do not know whether the present Government will meet a similar fate. I am only reminding the Minister of what happened in that case. The United States of America so built up their iron and steel industries that they can do without protection, and Canada, which is alongside the United States of America, and whose industries are in competition with those of the United States of America, is content with a duty of 10s. 5d. per ton on pig iron, whereas this Committee is asked to increase the duty of 20s. per ton by 50 per cent.",54
261,Mr CONSIDINE,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,One-thir d of the capital invested in Canada is from the United States of America.,54
262,Mr GREGORY,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"But the policy of the Canadian Government is not dictated by the investors of the United States of America, who may have put their money into Canadian plant. I want also to remind honourable members that the Canadian manufacturers, besides having to meet the United States of America manufacturers in competition, have to import a great proportion of the coal required for manufacturing purposes. For instance, in 1918, they imported 45,000,000 tons of anthracite coal, duty free, and over 14,000,000 tons of bituminous coal, on which they paid a duty of 35 cents per ton, and still they are able to carry on with lighter duties than are proposed in this schedule. I .direct attention to the report of a Select Committee that inquired into this particular industry, and reported in October, 1912. Mr Delprat gave some important evidence. He was askedI presume you arc going into these works, believing you can compete successfully, so far as iron and steel are concerned, with the markets of the outside world? He said "" Yes "" to this question, and was then askedI suppose you will not ask that any import duty be put upon iron and steel to assist you in your industry? To this he repliedNo. We have decided that if we cannot carry on without Government support or assistance, we shall not proceed with the.works at all.",54
263,Sir JOSEI,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,H COOK - The conditions have totally altered since then.,55
264,Mr GREGORY,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"The Treasurer reminds us that the conditions have altered. I have been looking up earlier Hansard reports and reading the wonderful speeches made by members of the Free Trade party headed by the present Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), and aided and abetted by the present Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook). I cannot believe that either of those gentlemen has altered his opinion to any extent. It is possible, however, that political views have made all this difference in them. I want to show that industrial conditions have not altered in Australia to the extent that they have .altered in Great Britain and America. I shall show, later on, that the wages paid in those countries in the manufacture of agricultural machinery are considerably in advance of those paid in Australia, and that the production elsewhere is ever so much greater than it is here. If the workers would only give an adequate output, the cost of wages paid to them would be no great item.""",55

266,Mr GREGORY,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"I read the evidence contained in the report submitted by the Public Accounts Committee, of which the honourable member for Hunter (Mr. Charlton) was Chairman. It was one of the fairest and best reports ever published. It showed the difficulties with which the management of the island had to contend. Unfortunately, the recommendations of the Committee were not carried out.",55
267,Mr LAVELLE,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"On a point of order, what connection has the honourable member's remarks with the item under discussion ?",55
268,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E, The honourable member for Dampier is not in order in discussing Cockatoo Island.,55
269,Mr GREGORY,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"I have already shown that the report of the Inter-State Commission contains a clear and distinct statement made by the Broken Hill Proprietary when they established their steel works that they did not require anything in the nature of a duty or assistance from the Commonwealth Government. Mr ""WATKINS - They all said that at the commencement. They were enthusiasts. The attempt to start steel works in Australia in face of such tremendous opposition reads like a romance.",55
270,Mr GREGORY,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"Probably there is a different crowd in control today. Possibly, seeing the way in which duties have been increased all round, they have come to the conclusion that they might as well be in the swim and ask for more.",55
271,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"The honourable member has made comparisons with almost every country in the world but Belgium, from which our steel works are getting competition today in the shape of goods which probably come from Germany.",55
272,Mr GREGORY,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"I have figures that show that the prices of these big lines coming from Belgium are nearly 300 per cent, higher' than pre-war prices. Of course, we. shall never go back to the pre-war level. I do not want that. I want to see good conditions established for our workers, because it will be useless for us to attempt to carry on without a contented community; but we cannot exceed the productive capacity of the country. ""We cannot pay wages beyond our productive capacity. We must consider the effect these duties are likely to have on people who are engaged in primary production. If the imposition of heavy duties makes land development too expensive, production must decrease; and if we cease to produce wealth we cannot continue to pay wages. The' following words, contained id the report of the Inter-State Commission, justify my previous remarks in reference to the iron deposits at Iron K n o b : I see nothing in the evidence to justify the assumption that some form of fiscal assistance will be permanently inevitable. On the contrary, the richness of Australian ore deposits, compared with those of other countries (the Iron Knob ore yields 68 per cent, of iron as against 36 per cent, profitably worked in Germany), and the freight charges borne by our nearest competitors, make it probable that Mr. Delprat's original view that the industry can stand on its own footing in Australia will prove right once output* is secured, and with it low production cost. The adage, ""The ore goes to the fuel"" is complied with in the Australian works. Before reading the recommendation of that Commission, I want to point out that the people of ""Western Australia are endeavouring to build up their State.' Mr. Lysaght has demonstrated the cost of conveying galvanized iron and other materials from Newcastle to Fremantle-the freight ranges from' £2 10s. to £3 2s. 6d. per ton-and the Inter-State Commission has shown that even if a bonus were given for the delivery of pig-iron to distant places, no such bonus would be sufficient to enable Australian manufacturers to capture the Western Australian market. I do not suppose that much pigiron is imported into Western Australia, but I feel sure that steel and other-similar .lines.can be imported from Great Britain under the present Tariff cheaper than they can be from Newcastle unless the price of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company's product is considerably reduced. Freight alone will enable the Western Australian people to get a cheaper article from Great Britain.",55
273,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"The honourable member, is not looking at the cost of carrying the raw material to Newcastle.",56
274,Mr GREGORY,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"That is quite a different matter. Evidently the honourable member has not studied the question. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company have vessels specially built for the purpose-of conveying iron ore from Iron Knob to Newcastle. Mr HECTOR LAMOND.;-Thos e vessels are under the same navigation laws,, awards and expenses as are other vessels.",56
275,Mr GREGORY,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"That , again, is an entirely different matter. The Broken Hill'Proprietary Company's vessels run from their own wharf at Iron Knob, to their own wharf at Newcastle, and their costs are nothing in comparison with what they would be if they had to tie up at other people's wharfs and consign from one port to another. This is the recommendation made by the Iriter-State - CommissionWe recommend that a duty of 17s. 6d. per ton general, and 12s.. 6d. per ton preferential, be imposed on pig iron, exeept pig iron of special-brands and values, which are provided for hereunder. This ;will not secure the Western. Australian market, but no means can be seen of arranging - for this without, the imposition of a duty more than .adequate for the other States. If the Government have power, the best method to - adopt .would' be i>y giving further assistance by way of-a10s. per 1 ton bounty on all Australian pig iron delivered to Western Australia. The Commonwealth has no power to differentiate between States in that way.",56
276,Mr GEEENE,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,The Constitution specially debars that.,56
277,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"If the Inter-State Commission has recommended a remedy which is unconstitutional, what weight can be attached to its other recommendations ?",56
278,Mr GREGORY,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"The Inter-State Commission was inquiring into the Tariff, and not into constitutional questions, and. the report has this qualification-""If the Government have power."" The Commission's recommendation has been entirely ignored. I understand that the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins) intends to move an amendment, and after it is disposed of I shall move that the recommendation of the Inter-State Commission for a duty of 12s. .6d. per ton be adopted. . Sir ROBERT BEST (Kooyong) [9.5] - The honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) has industriously and laboriously applied himself to the investigation of ancient history, and written under old conditions. He has looked into evidence furnished to the Inter-State Commission in 1912, and has studied most - carefully the recommendations they made. But those investigations and recommendations were made under a condition of things totally different from those existing today, and I do not'think they can help usdn anyway. The honourable member must realise that the cost*of. production has, increased 100, 150, and in some cases'200 per cent.",56
279,Mr GREGORY,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"All over the world. .. Sir ROBERT BEST - I am .referring to Australia. Whilst Mr Delprat and other witnesses may have had splendid aspirations as to starting the industry without assistance, the actual practical experience has clearly demonstrated that under existing conditions the industry cannot prosper without Protection.",56
280,Mr STEWART,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,The steel works have done very well so far. ;,56
281,Sir ROBERT BEST,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"Probably they have, mainly under war conditions, and I commend the proprietors for their enterprise; but we must realise what has actually taken place during the last twelve months. Honourable members have re-ferred, indiscriminately to the increase of duties to be proposed by the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins), and much confusion exists as to. the real issues; they ' have overlooked the very essence of the question. As the honourable; member told the House-and this is >the kernel of the matter-the duty proposed by the Government twelve months ago was 20s. per ton British preferential for pig iron. As the result of an investigation by the Minister (Mr - it. Greene) and his officers into the affairs, of this great industry, the Minister was satisfied that fair and reasonable protection, for the industry would .be a. duty of 20s. per ton. I ask honourable members, to apply their minds to what has happened in the. meantime. According to the Hibble report,- the cost of coal has increased 4s. per ton; according to the Board of Trade award, wages have increased 8s. 6d. per week per employee; and, in addition, harbour dues have been imposed, making a total increased cost of .14s.' per ton.",56
282,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"Goal , in 1912, was lis. per ton, and it is now 21s. 9d. Sir ROBERT. BEST - Yes . T i e result of the industrial increase during the ton. lasttwelve months is that the duty of 20s., imposed on the 25th March, 1920> is worth only 6s. today to the industry.",57
283,Mr MCWILLIAMS,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,Is not the coal supplied to the steel industry the cheapest in the world?,57
284,Sir ROBERT BEST,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"I have alIthat lowed for the increase in the cost.of'coal and-wages, and the result has been.to crease the scheduled duty by 70 per cent. (British preferential).",57
285,Mr MCWILLIAMS,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,How doesthe between honourable member make that out?,57
286,Sir ROBERT BEST,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"The increase of wagesby 8s. 6d. per employee per week, the. increase of 4s. per ton in the price of coal, and the harbour dues have in Australia today. increased the cost of production by 14s. and. upwards per ton.",57
287,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,What is the corpart responding change on the other side of dropped. the world ?,57
288,Sir ROBERT BEST,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"I will tell the honourable member presently. tent ion is that the investigations of the 1 Minister enabled him to satisfy himself, when he introduced the Tariff, that 20s. per ton was a reasonable duty for the encouragement of this industry. And in that view this House would have, supported him. Parliament would have been satisfied that 20s. was a fair duty to impose in order to effectively protect the industry. However, the duty which he then imposed is today worth only 6s.; and it is in those circumstances that the Broken Hill Proprietary Company come to Parliament and. lay their case before I have just been asked what has ,-been the state of .aff airs on the other side of the world. I have shown that the increased costof production here is equal ""to 70 per cent, reduction in the value of. the duty. On the other side, taking. Belgium for example, coal.has considerably decreased invalue. Mir - MCWILLIAMS:-What is the price there ?",57
289,Sir ROBERT BEST,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"I have the figures at hand, - and will endeavour to furnish them to the honourable member.. In America also coal has decreased in value.",57
290,Mr MASSYGREENE,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"At the pit run in' Pittsburg the price is at present 16s. 8d'. per Sir ROBERT BEST.'-In the United States of America there has been a decrease of Us. 3d. per ton during the year. That means that the cost of production has decreased, so far as fuel is. concerned, by that amountper ton. As for wagesj can furnish abundant material to prove there have been substantial decreases in Belgium, from which source we fear demuch opposition; and in America also. The honourable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) made reference to the contrast ourwages and those paid in Germany last year. Wages were £7 per month there as against £18 here. This year, wages in Germany are at the rate of £5 per month, as against £22 10s. paid That clearly indicates that, while the cost of production here has greatly increased, the cost on the of our competitors has considerably",57
291,Mr MCWILLIAMS,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,Tell us something My conr about Great Britain. Sir ROBERT. BEST - In the Moth?* Country wages are coming down.,57
292,Mr MCWILLIAMS,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,How much is coal there?,58
293,Sir ROBERT BEST,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"The price is £2 odd per ton. But I am speaking of the altered conditions so far as our foreign competitors are concerned. Some honourable members talk as though we were resorting to some wild and untried experiments, or some scheme which would prove, upon experience, to be detrimental to the best interests of Australia. The American people, by greater foresight than we are exercising, realized that the only way in which to build up the iron and steel industry was to impose high duties. For many years the imposition was equal to 80s. per ton. Ultimately the duty was reduced to 75s. There were two results. The first of these was that the production of America was vastly increased, and more than supplied the home market, and the second was that with the increased production, the cost to the sumer fell considerably. I am in a position to quote highly authoritative figures which conclusively demonstrate that the outcome of the exceedingly high duties imposed was not an increase in the price of commodities to the primary producer, but the very reverse. That has been the experience of the world. America could never have established her iron and steel industries but for the imposition of high duties, because from the moment of their inauguration those activities would have been overwhelmed by importations of English products, in which country similar industries had been established for a very long while. It was due to the erection of the high Protective wall that the American industries were so flourishingly established as to attain vast proportions, while, at the same time, there was a striking decrease of prices to the consumer. And there was this complementary result^that prices of competitors in the Mother Country were also brought down.",58
294,Mr MCWILLIAMS,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,Has the effect to reduce the .prices of agricultural tools and implements here?,58
295,Sir ROBERT BEST,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"Yes ; and that can be demonstrated very easily. We need not be much alarmed by this proposed crease of duty, since it can be shown it is not paid by the consumer. realise that the iron and steel industry essential for Australia, and that it is the duty of Parliament to give whatever protection that industry requires. The great point emphasized by the honourable member for Dampier was that it had not been demonstrated that a duty is required at all. I shall quote illustrations to show how essential is the imposition of a duty. I draw my facts from a statement furnished by the Industries Protection League, upon whose figures I can absolutely rely. I have before me a statement showing comparative prices of British, Continental, and Australian steel products. For example, the landed price, duty paid, of pig iron in Australia is £10 15s. 6d., and the cost of producing here at local works is £9 2s. 6d. The landed price per ton of ingots, blooms, billets, &c, from the Continent is £10. With duty added, the price is £13 5s. landed here. The Broken H i ll Procon- prietary works cannot turn out the same line of product under £14 10s. per ton. Then, with respect to bars, rods, angles, and tees, the landed cost here today from the Continent is £17, while the actual cost of production in Australia is £21 10s. The landed cost of bars, &c., from Great Britain, of course^ including duty, is £19 14s., and, as I said, the cost here is £21 10s. The landed cost here of rails, 60 lbs., 45 feet in length, is £17 4s., but they cannot be produoed here for less than £17 17s. 6d. Joists, channels, and girders from the Continent cost £18 landed in Australia, duty paid, and the cost to produoe here is £22 10s.",58
296,Mr MCWILLIAMS,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,Why does not the honourable member quote the British prices ?,58
297,Sir ROBERT BEST,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,I am quoting the price of our competitors on the Continent. Honourable members must realise that we cannot obtain the whole of our requirements from Great Britain; and if they study the question they will see that many of our importations in this direcbeen tion come from Belgium and Germany.,58
298,Mr STEWART,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,Canno t we get nearly all that we require from Great Britain?,58

302,Sir ROBERT BEST,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"The experience in America proves conclusively that high protective duties reduce the cost to the cumstances. consumer, as the industries are established and expand. We can, of course, throw open our ports, and allow goods to keen on bounties. come from abroad free of duty; but doing so we will annihilate our industries and bring disaster on the community causing unemployment and higher prices; by so doing we place ourselves mercy of the foreign exporter. We have to consider whether the proposed duties reasonable. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) said twelve months ago that 20s. per ton was a fair rate; we have to realise that, owing to altered circumstances .which have arisen in sequence of the increased costs, that duty now represents only 6s. I admit that this is a difficult matter to adjust; but I repeat what I have previously said, that we should appoint a Tariff Board, whose duty it would be to fully investigate the conditions under which protected dustries were operating, and if it discovered that too high a duty imposed, or that advantage was being taken of the Tariff, the Board could commend Parliament to adjust the duty, from their report; and thus create fair and reasonable competition.

It would he a matter for regret if the people' of this country, particularly. those charged with its government, should have a quarter of a century's experience of changing conditions without being able to adapt their : conclusions to the altered circumstances in which they find themselves. The honourable member for Dampior is one of the few people I have come in contact with on whom, the war. has made no> impression, and to whom it has taught nothing.

335,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"It is an exception that ought to be noted, and i stands to the credit of, those who control the industry. And it is not the characfire teristic .of those men alone; good men who conduct their business honestly are blamed for the sins of others who exact the uttermost farthing the Tariff allows; and it is the latter class that makes the framing of a Tariff' so difficult.",63

Alongside this attempt to set city against country there is evidence that almost t every year the amounts paid to landlords for the privilege of working their land increasing. I suggest to the reformers that they examine a little more closely the money thus exacted by people who render no service' to the industry, and that they have a little less to say about those who in the 'cities are earning all the money they are paid for services rendered to primary industry.",63
342,Mr JOWETT,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"The honourable member, of course, is referring to city landlords. . Mr HECTOR LAMOND - The landlords are just as oppressive in the cities as in the country.",63

The TEMPORARY CHAIRM (Mr Atkinson) - Order ! Will the honourable member show the connection between his remarks and the question before the Chair ?,63
345,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,I do not know that I can show anymore connection than the honourable member for Dampier - (Mr Gregory) could have shown if you had asked him the same question when he was speaking.,64
346,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,Order! The honourable member is out of order.,64
347,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,I can connect my remarks in this way: The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr. Stewart) pointed out that the whole burden of the duties we are considering is going to be paid by the agricultural industries.,64
348,Mr STEWART,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"I did not say the whole burden. . Mr HECTOR LAMOND - The hontralian orable member professed to mention people pn whom the burden will fall, but he did not get beyond the primary proto ducer in the list he gave. This is not question of city versus country,, or primary producers versus secondaiy protries ducers. It is a question of the establishprimary ment in Australia of certain industries - which are necessary to our existence.as a sea. nation, and without which no country can continue under-modern conditions exist.",64
349,Mr BRENNAN,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"You r point, is that secondary industries are the primary dustries? '",64

The only question we have to decide is whether they shall be conallow ducted in Australia, or somewhere else. The honourable member for Wimmera is not going to cultivate his land with old wooden plough of the Eastern peoples. Ho is going to cultivate it with modern machinery, which must be made either or out of Australia. He is going to employment to the people in Australia, or to their competitors outside Australia. In that matter, the honourable member has no choice. If he is going to conduct industry on modern lines, he must emfreights. AN ploy somebody in secondary industries. In every step he takes,, from the time ho rises in the morning until he goes to bed at night, in all the articles he uses when he takes his food, and in everything he employs to equip himself for' the work he doesduring the day-in every operation that he pursues, he must employ secondary industries; and the choice that is left to him is not the choice of whether people shall be employed in the cities or in the country, but of whether in the secondary industries which are essential to his work he shall employ people in his own country, or the cheap labour qf other countries. Mr STEWART.;-It depends upon the conditions under which we shall employ them. . Mr HECTOR LAMOND. - If the industries are established here, those conditions' will be decided by the Australian people. They will be - such as the Auspeople approve; but if the arguthe ment of the - honourable member for Dampier is to prevail, and we aro to look the cheap labour of the Eastern couna tries as the standard to be set uphere, of then not only will the secondaryindusof this country fade away, but the industries will be reducedto the same level as their competitors across the",64

364,Mr JAMES PAGE,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,What could I do?,65
365,Mr FENTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"The honourable member could have roared against them as he is roaring now. The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) was silent upas a tombstone when it was proposed to put duties on onions and millet; but when it comes to protecting what is one of the key industries of the country, and doing what' is needed in the interests of the is Australian people, a howl of indignation comes from him and from the corner of the chamber where he sits. The relations of the countries, of Europe are not the same today as they were two and a half years ago. Germany was then our enemy and Belgium our ally; but today, from the trade point of view, both are our enemy. As an Australian and as an Australian legislator, if I have to choose between an Australian and a foreign combination I must choose the former. Some honourable members say that, we are giving a monopoly to the Broken Hill Company and to Messrs. Hoskins; but I rely absolutely on the promise of the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene), although I differ from him politically, that as soon as the Tariff is out of the way a Bill will be introduced to constitute a Board of Trade whose special duty it will be to see that no manufacturers who enjoy Protection shall fleece the public.",65

368,Mr STEWART,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,Are you sure he will do it?,66
369,Mr FENTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"I am. If I were not, my attitude towards some of the prothat posed duties would be different. Tofor many years to come. day the exchange rates operate largely in favour of Germany and Belgium against Australia, and put those countries most as favourable a position for competwar-time, ing against us as if wo had no Tariff. The object of importers is to destroy local manufactures, and to recoup themthat selves later for the initial losses they be forced to incur. They do this at possible to get. the expense of the consumers of Australia.",66
370,Mr STEWART,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"When Denmark underare cuts the butter producers of Australia, they have to grin and bear it.",66
371,Mr FENTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"Every Australian butter producer would be glad to receive always for his butter the price the Danish butter brings on the London market. The honourable member has spoken of a com- bination between the capitalist and the worker as unholy; but the members of the Country party are in alliance with the biggest exploiters of the Commonwealth, the importers of Flinders-lane and Other importers. I would rather be in the company of the manufacturers of Australia than in that of the importers of Flinders-lane. This is an industry that has been established in Australia, and if honourable members care to look back over the records, they will find that during war-time the Broken Hill Proprietary Company could have obtained London prices for their iron and steel products for railway and shipbuilding purposes, but made them available at several pounds per ton below London quotations.",66
372,Mr MCWILLIAMS,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,You had better not say too much about the shipbuilding industry.,66
373,Mr FENTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,I know as much about that as the honourable member.,66
374,Mr MCWILLIAMS,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"No , you do not.",66
375,Mr FENTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"I think I do. I remind him that the Public Accounts Committee, of which I am a member, made full inquiries into all phases of the shipbuilding industry.",66
376,Mr MCWILLIAMS,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,I know you did; of the but your report is not worth much.,66
377,Mr FENTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"I think it will be worth a good deal more than that which the honourable member will sign shortly. I am prepared to stand by that report. I think the honourable member will find its recommendations will stand good But for the establishment of these iron and steel works in Australia our railway construction in alworks would have been held up during and I point out to honourable members of the Country party, who are the always talking about decentralization, in the steel works at Newcastle and may Lithgow we have the finest examples it is",66
378,Mr STEWART,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"We do not object to them. We are pleased to know that they established, but it is a question of the conditions under which they shall be carried on.",66
379,Mr FENTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"It appears that the honourable member for Wimmera, since he has resumed his seat, has discovered that these are fine industries for Australia, although, when he was on his feet, he was denouncing everything in general and the Broken Hill Proprietary Company in particular. I do not know why. I am not fighting for any particular Combine myself, but I repeat that if it is a question of choosing between an Australian and an English, American, German, or Belgian Combine, my choice will be for the Australian every time, because I want to do what little I oan to establish key industries here so that Australia may be a self-contained nation. If we can only develop the iron and steel, the woollen, and the cement industries, we shall be able to provide employment, not only for the men and women of Australia, but for a large number of people from other parts of the world,'in the manufacture of goods for our own requirements without the export trade at all. Is that not a desirable objective, and One worthy of attainment'?",66
380,Mr STEWART,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,But why cannot it be done under the old Tariff?,67
381,Mr FENTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"The honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) a little while ago quoted Mr Delprat, the general manager of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company as saying, in 1912, that once the iron industry was fairly established, they were prepared to meet competition from any part qf the world. Since then the whole world has been revolutionized. Mr GABB,-Mad e safe for Democracy.",67
382,Mr FENTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,"I will not say that Neither has it been made safe for autocracy, because, crowned heads have been tumbling one after another. I remind the honourable member for Wimmera that in 1920 Mr Delprat was very emphatic in stating that unless the iron and steel industry were protected by the Tariff from dumping, his company could not possibly carry on. He was then thinking of the condition of shipbuilding. in other parts of the world. I think the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) will bear me out when I y . that it was impossible to get a quotation from English shipbuilding yards for the construction of vessels at about that time. The yards would only undertake to build at a certain rate which averaged about £35 per ton, whereas in Australia the cost was about £30 per ton. The honourable member for Dampier says there is no difference now. As a matter of fact, there is. I believe that ships, which in 1920 cost to build about £35 per ton in England, may now be built for about £10 per ton. . Mr Mo WILLIAMS - But while material is getting cheaper here, the cost .of shipbuilding is higher.",67
383,Mr FENTON,QUEENSLAND PI NEA PPL E,I think it comes out at about £29 or £30. per ton. Progress reported. House adjourned at 10.30 p.m. s a,67
