1,Mr SPEAKKB,Unknown,"Hon. J; S. Eosevear) took the chair at 10.30 a.m.. and read prayers BANKING. - NATIONALIZATION.: PETITIONS. Petitions in relation to banking in Australia were presented as follows - By Mr HOWSE, from certain electors of the division of Calare. By Mr AECHIE CAMEEON, from .certain electors of the division of Barker. Petitions received and read. Later: ,",12
2,Mr ADEEMANN,Unknown,"1I have been informed that the Government has offered ' a retainer to valuers for the purpose"" of valuating the property of the private banks. Will the Prime Minister inform me how many valuers in the. various States have been offered retainers for the purpose of ascertaining the value of banking property? How many valuers have accepted retainers for the purpose, and why has this anticipatory action been taken? . Mr Chifley - Althoug h I am usually well informed ' about these matters, I . have not heard of the one which the honourable member mentioned. Mr - HAYLEN - I address a question to. you, Mr Speaker, as the custodian of the' forms and privileges of this House. A report in today's issue of the Sydney Morning Herald states that Mr A. J. Dalziel, private secretary to the Attorney-General, alleges that a check, made of a petition presented to the Attorney-General's Department opposing the Government's banking proposals discloses some disconcerting features. The petition purports to have been signed hy some 4,082 voters in the Attorney-General's electorate of Barton, and the report statesThe check reveals that, there arc 2,397 natures without addresses; 301 of those have signed give addresses which are not in the discretion. electorate of-Barton; 53 persons signed the. petition and then crossed their names out. Of the telegrams of protests received, it is noted that batches of them have the same office of origin and have been lodged at the name time. Some of the telegrams give incorrect addresses, while other names and addresses cannot be traced in the electoral roll. As petitions are being presented to this House, will yon, sir, state what is their standing, and what is the position generally in relation to them? Is it necessary that - they shall conform to accuracy? Should those who sign them be enrolled for the electorates in which they purport to originate? ""What other relevant circumstances are there in connection with the presentation of petitions to this honourable House ? MT."" SPEAKER - The normal - course is that an honourable member who presents a petition assures the House that it is respectfully worded, concludes with a prayer, and is otherwise' in conformity with the rules and orders of the House. My personal belief is that some degree of responsibility devolves upon a member to ensure, to - the best of his ability, that those who sign a petition are, as they purport to be, electors of the division mentioned in it, and that their addresses are accurately stated. All petitions stress that the signatories to them are electors of the divisions mentioned in them, and it . is the duty of honourable members, when presenting them, to inform the House of any knowledge they may havf to the contrary. Mr BLAIN"" - In view of the fact that many Labour members on the Government side of the House have received from their electors petitions objecting to. the proposed banking legislation, and have failed in their duty to present them to the House, will you, Mr Speaker, state what procedure should be adopted by such petitioners to ensure thattheir petitions will be presented to this House, through you?",12
3,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member is quite wrong, in stating that the duty devolves upon a member to present' a petition to this House. No such duty is imposed on him, ""Whether or not he sigpresents a petition which he has received who is a matter that is left - entirely to his MINISTERIAL .DUTIES.",13
4,Mr CHIPXEY,Unknown," I desire to inform honourable members that, during the absence abroad of the Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs (Dr Evatt), the Minister for Health and Minister for Social Services (Senator MCKenna) will act as Attorney-General and I shall act as Minister for External Affairs. - The Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holloway) will represent the Attorney-General in the House of Representatives until the return of Dr Evatt. SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT. ' Mr CHUXEY (Macquarie-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [10.34] - I move That the Bouse, at its rising, adjourn tn Wednesday, next, at 3 p.m. It is proposed that the House shall sit on four days a week in the following weeks.",13
5,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"Kooyong-Leade r of the Opposition) [10.35.] - I have no objection to the motion, but it would assist honourable members were the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) to give some indication of the nature of the business to be transacted next week. I understand that he proposes to introduce the budget today, but that the general debate on it will not be resumed before the expiry of a week from its introduction. Presumably, that will mean that on Wednesday next, some other business will be brought before the House. Can the right honourable gentleman say what that business will be?",14
6,Mr HOLT,Unknown,"Fawkner) [10.36] - Is it proposed to sit regularly four days a week from the week after next until the end of the sessional periods, or is it intended that the House shall sit four days only in the week after next?",14
7,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"Macquarie-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [10.37] - in reply-Nex t week the motion by the Minister for External Affairs (Dr Evatt) that certain papers relating to international affairs be printed will be discussed, and, following that discussion, it is proposed to consider the motion of the Minister for Defence (Mr. Dedman) relating to post-war defence. In reply to the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt) I have to say that, unless some change of circumstances arises it is the intention of the Government that the House shall sit four days a week until the end of the present period of the session. The budget debate will commence on a date to be arranged with the Leaders of the Opposition parties. T understand that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) and the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) desire a week in which to consider the budget statement before discussing it. I expect the debate on the budget to last for a couple of weeks.",14
8,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown,The length of the dismission will depend on the right honourable gentleman's attitude towards the debate.,14
9,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"When those matters have been dealt with, other measures will be brought before the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. HMAS. WARRNAMBOOL. Loss INMINE SWEEPING OPERATIONS.",14
10,Mr GEORGE LAWSON,Unknown,"Can the Minister for the Navy inform the House of the circumstances associated with the loss of HMAS . Warrnambool during 1 mine-sweeping operations off the coast of Queensland, and can he say whether danger money for mine sweeping is being paid to personnel so engaged?",14
11,Mr RIORDAN,Unknown,"It is with great regret that I inform the House of the loss of the mine sweeper HMAS. Warrnambool on Saturday, the 13th September, while engaged on mine-sweeping operations. Unfortunately, the loss of the ship was accompanied by loss of life, and also resulted in injuries to personnel, including the commanding officer. All the men of the ship have been accounted for with the exception of one who is missing, and, I fear, lost. Three have died. Of those injured, three at present remain on the critically injured list, five on the dangerously injured list, eight on the seriously injured list, two on the slightly injured list, one on the general improvement list, and eleven have gone on leave. I take this opportunity to extend to the relatives of personnel lost and missing, and to injured personnel and their relatives, the deep sympathy of the Government. I earnestly hope for a speedy recovery of all the injured. Warrnambool struck a moored mine in an Allied mine-field while engaged on mine-sweeping operations north of Cockburn Reef, which is approximately 12 miles north of Cape Grenville. H.M.A. ships Swan, Warrnambool, Mildura and Katoomba, together with two harbour defence motor launches, were employed on that operation. At the time of the accident, Warrnambool was second sweeper in line stationed on Swan's quarter. Swan's sweep fouled an obstruction and parted just before crossing the line of mines. Warrnambool altered course away from the line of mines to move into safe water and struck a mine as she did so. Efforts were made to tow Warrnambool clear of the mine-field by a harbour defence motor launch, but owing to the strong tidal stream Warrnambool drifted back towards the line of mines and was finally abandoned after an hour. Later, the vessel sank. During the war, 37 mine-fields, composed of moored contact mines, were laid by the Royal Australian Navy in the vicinity of the Barrier Reef, covering openings from Townsville to Gape Grenville. Sweeping of the Barrier Reef mine-fields was commenced on the 30th January, 1947, and to date 27 of those fields have been swept. It is expected that all sweeping in the Barrier Reef will he completed by the end of next month. Thousands of mines were laid in these defensive fields. Many of them have broken adrift from their moorings, and hundreds of mines have already been dealt with, by "" rendering mines safe parties "" operating inside the Barrier and in the Port Moresby area. I have already informed the House of the position concerning drifting mines, as distinct from moored mines, and, therefore, will not comment any further at this stage. As to extra pay to personnel engaged on operational mine-sweeping duties, I inf orin the. House that payment wassussubject pended temporarily on the 30th June to do. last, pending completion of a review of the continuance of the special payment in the light of the new pay scales for the Navy which had been approved to operate as from the 1st July. That review has been completed and extra payment for mine-sweeping will he payable as an addition to the new pay scales. The pay will be adjusted retrospectively as the 1st July last. NA PRODUCTION.",14
12,Mr FADDEN,PRIMARY AND SECONDARY,"Havin g regard to importance of achieving maximum proship duction in the primary and secondary industries in order to ensure the stability of our external and internal economy, the Prime Minister inform the House what he has done to launch the national production drive which I suggested to him in July? Were the State Premiers, the representatives of primary and seconbringing dary industries, as well as employers trade union organizations consulted? [f so, what was the nature of the coto operation promised?",15
13,Mr CHIFLEY,PRIMARY AND SECONDARY,"The Leader of the Australian Country party did write me about a production drive. The subachievements ject was originally raised at a meeting between representatives of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the manufacturers, and, after considerable discussion, both parties agreed to do everything they could to accelerate production. Since then the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture has had several discussions, and has participated in a number of conferences, with a view to learning what can be done to accelerate primary production. The matter has also been discussed with Lord Addison, and the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture has agreed that everything possible will be done to increase production, particularly of foodstuffs. At the conference of CommonReef wealth and State Ministers, the hope was expressed that the States would co-operate with the Commonwealth to ensure increased production. I cannot give the honourable member more detailed information at. the moment, but in view of his letter to me of July last, and of the question which he has just asked, I 1 propose to prepare for him a reply on the setting forth what it is proposed SHIPBUILDING. OPERATIONS AT WHYALLA .",15
14,Mr RUSSELL,PRIMARY AND SECONDARY,"In view of the fact that the largest ship yet built in Australia, Iron Yampi, of 12,500 tons, was recently launched at the shipyards of the from Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited at Whyalla, and in view f of the statement of the superintendent of the shipyards, Mr D. J. Dalziel, that these shipyards are the the best in the world and could build a of 20,000 tons, I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Supply and Shipping whether he will recommend that will the Government approach the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited with a view to placing an order with these shipyards for the construction of steamers which will be suitable for the purpose of migrants to Australia. In that and direction the Minister for Immigration has been doing excellent work. The boats which I refer might also be used for general passenger services.",15
15,Mr DEDMAN,PRIMARY AND SECONDARY,"I know that the to honourable member is very proud of the of the shipbuilding industry in his' electorate'. This matter has been discussed on a departmental level, and I am sure that the Minister for Supply and Shipping, who is responsible for the shipbuilding programme, will in due course take steps to carry out the honourable member's suggestion if found practicable to do so. DECEASED SERVICEMEN. PROVISION FOR DEPENDANTS.",15
16,Mr HOLT,PRIMARY AND SECONDARY,"Some time ago the Government appointed an all-party comof mittee of ex-service members of the liament to make recommendations with I respect to the payment of war gratuity. - Will the Prime Minister now arrange to for that committee, or a committee simicommission larly constituted, to make recommendapayment tions for just and adequate provision widows, children and other dependants mentioned ? of deceased servicemen?",16
17,Mr CHIFLEY,PRIMARY AND SECONDARY,"I regret to say that one member of the War Gratuity Comdifficult mittee, ex-Senator Collett, who renanswer dered very great service on that and body, died recently, while Mr Frost, another member of the committee, is absent from Australia. Previously, I promised that as soon as the Gratuity Boards, including the central board, had settled down to their and had had an opportunity to survey the position, I would arrange to call together the available members of the all-party committee to confer with the central hoard. I shall do that.",16
18,Mr HOLT,PRIMARY AND SECONDARY,"- I am not referring war gratuity but to adequate provision for widows, children and other dependants of deceased servicemen.",16
19,Mr CHIFLEY,PRIMARY AND SECONDARY,"I did not give any promise in that direction, and I give no 3uch promise now. I thought that the honourable member wa9 speaking of the payment of gratuity. I shall examine the matter he has raised. It ha9 been the subject of review during the last few weeks by a sub-committee of Cabinet, confor sisting of the Minister for Bepatriation, the Minister for Commerce and Agrithe culture and myself. At a later stage Minister for Repatriation will have thing to say concerning the results of review. At this juncture I am not to give any further information. [4] WATERFRONT EMPLOYMENT .",16
20,Mrs BLACKBURN,PRIMARY AND SECONDARY,"I wish to ask the Minister for Labour and National Service a question relating to compensation payable to members of the Permait be nent and Casual Waterside Workers Association. What is the position of these workers in respect of compensation should they be injured when travelling to and from work? As they are not actually employed until they are picked up who is their employer ? How can they be assured receiving compensation in respect of Parinjury suffered insuch circumstances? n view of the fact that they are required by the Stevedoring Industry Commission present themselves at the wharfs, is the their employer so far as the of compensation is concerned for in the circumstances which I have",16
21,Mr HOLLOWAY,PRIMARY AND SECONDARY,"The matter raised by the honourable member involves a most technical problem; and my refers to all waterside workers not solely to that section mentioned by the honourable member. Waterside workers, in common with other workers, are covered by the Workers' Compensation Act while proceeding to and returning from work. The Attorney-General's work Department and the Department of Supply and Shipping are examining the possibility of covering those waterside workers who report at a pick-up place but may not be engaged. The matter is being examined to ascertain whether it is possible to devise means whereby such waterto side workers shall be covered by the workers' compensation legislation. WHEAT. SALES TO GREAT BRITAIN AND INDIA CORNSACKS-WIL D TURNIP-STABILI ZATION SCHEME.",16
22,Mr ABBOTT,PRIMARY AND SECONDARY,"Has a long-term agreement been made, or is such an agreement being negotiated, with Great Britain the sale of large parcels of Australian wheat? What are the proposed terms of agreement, the price a bushel and the the conditions of delivery? In what somecurrency will payments he made to Austhat tralia and is any clause to be inserted able in the agreement providing for price alterations during the currency of the agreement if tliere be variations of price levels in either Great Britain or Australia?  agreement has been negotiated with Great Britain. Exploratory talks have been taking place between Lord Addison and myself on the subject. Consideration is being given to the feasibility of making long-term contracts with Great Britain for the sale of Australian wheat. ""When any arrangements have been made a statement will be submitted to the House.",16
23,Mr AECHIE CAMEEON,PRIMARY AND SECONDARY,"Has the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture received complaints, particularly from the Loxton district of South Australia, in regard to the damage that is caused to wheat crops by the weed that is known as wild turnip? Will the honourable gentleman, in his spare time, attempt to nationalize it, with a view to securing its complete eradication, and increasing the wheat yield? Question not answered.",17
24,Mr TUENBTJLL,PRIMARY AND SECONDARY,"Has the attention of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture been drawn to the report of a meeting of wheat-growers held at Warracknabeal last Tuesday, at which a resolution approving the establishment of a stabilization scheme prepared by the Wheat-growers Federation was carried, and is he prepared to recommend to the Government that that plan be adopted?  conference of wheat-growers at Warracknabeal, which I understand was organized by the Australian Country party, but I have had no official intimation of any resolution carried by the conference. I am unable to accept press reports of the conference as being a correct record of its proceedings, and am awaiting official advice of any resolutions carried before I commit myself, or the Government, to accept any scheme agreed to there. Mr RANKIJS"" - In view of the proposal to enter into a long-term agreement with the ""United Kingdom Government for the sale of wheat, will the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. confer with representatives of wheat-growers' organizations before any price is fixed?  ber's request will be taken into consideration.",17
25,Mr LANGTRY,PRIMARY AND SECONDARY,"Can the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture say whether the supply of cornsacks will be adequate for the coming wheat harvest?  shipping being available, it is almost certain that the supply of cornsacks will be sufficient for the forthcoming harvest. Shipping prospects are good due to the foresight of the Government, the assistance given by the Australian Wheat Board, the Jute Committee and Mr. Tomlinson of the Barley Board, and to the co-operation of - the Indian Government, with whose representatives I conferred on this matter. The Australian Wheat Board, however, will have to ensure that over-buying shall not occur in order that available supplies may be spread equitably amongst wheat-farmers.",17
26,Mr FULLER,PRIMARY AND SECONDARY,"Can the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture inform the House whether the Government has been successful in securing current export prices for wheat sold to India under the agreement ?  India is sold by the Australian Wheat Board at prices determined by that board. In recent negotiations with the representative of the Indian Government we assured him that any wheat sold to India would be landed in that country, subject to supplies of jute being made available to Australia. The Indian representative explained that his Government issued licences for the export of jute, but it had no power to compel exporters to ship the complete quota for which licences had been issued. However, he undertook that the Indian Government would do its utmost to ensure the export to Australia from. India of the maximum quantity of jute. TIMBER,",17
27,Mr SHEEHY,PRIMARY AND SECONDARY,"Has consideration been given to the reduction of duty on Oregon which is the most suitable timber for home building? If not, will an investigation be made to ascertain what can be done in that direction?  consideration has been given by the Minister for Trade and Customs to the reduction of the duty on Oregon. I shall convey to him the substance of the are honourable member's question and I have no doubt that in due conrse an approand priate reply will be received. COMMUNISM. IJKVJil.OPHJSNTS INWESTEKJJ AUSTRALIA.",17
28,Mr FRANCIS,PRIMARY AND SECONDARY,"In view of the cent statement of the Lord Mayor of Perth that communism is rampant among coloured persons in the north-west of Western Australia, and that a hostile attitude is being adopted towards white men in those areas, what investigations, if any, have been made by the Government into these allegations? If investigations have been made, what have they disclosed? If investigamerce tions have not been made, will a to committee of inquiry be commissioned once to report' upon conditions - in ports and to make any necessary recomshould mendations concerning the security of ports, the safety of the white residents of the areas and the protection of the aborigines?",18
29,Mr JOHNSON,PRIMARY AND SECONDARY,"I have uot seen the .statement to which the honourable member has referred. I have only recently rematter. turned from a very extensive tour of north-west ports of Western Australia, during the course of which I met repreand sentatives of the Roads Boards at every port en route from Wyndham to Government. Carnarvon. I saw no evidence to justify the allegation made by the Lord Miayor of Perth, nor were complaints of that kind made to me by the representatives of the Roads Boards. Every opportunity was given to the local governing authorities to place before me any matters of concern in the areas under their control. From my first-hand knowledge of conwar ditions in the north-west of Western Australia. I should say that the statement is exaggerated and without foundation. RE-ESTABLISHMENT. COMPENSATION OF TRAINEES.",18
30,Mr CONELAN,PRIMARY AND SECONDARY,"Can the Minister are for Post-war Reconstruction say whether it is correct that ex-servicemen undermotor going rehabilitation training are not covered by workers' compensation insurance either while they are at work or travelling to and from work? If they not covered, will the Minister take the matter up with the Minister for Labour National Service to ensure that provision shall be made for these men?",18
31,Mr DEDMAN,PRIMARY AND SECONDARY,"I understand that the position is as has been 3tated by the honourable member. However, in the event of an accident occurring' an reex gratia payment is made from the Treasury. The matter is being further examined to ascertain whether or not ports something more can be done. APPLES AND PEARS.",18
32,Mr FALKINDER,PRIMARY AND SECONDARY,"Before the House rose at the end of the last sessional period I asked the Minister for Comand Agriculture a question relating the apple and pear acquisition scheme, at and he informed me that the Government the would consider continuing the scheme the shipping position warrant this the action. I ask the Minister now whether in view of the fact that it appears certain that shipping space will not be adequate, he is able to announce the continuance of the scheme in 1945 ?  has not yet reached a decision on this It is too early to say definitely the whether or not adequate shipping space will be available for the export of apples pears, and until that position is clarified no decision will be made by the MOTOR VEHICLES. MANUFACTUR EIN AUSTRALIA .",18
33,Mr THOMPSON,PRIMARY AND SECONDARY,"In view of the likelihood of a cessation of imports of motor car chassis from the United States of America, can the Minister for PostReconstruction say what progress is being made in the production by General Motors-Holdens Limited of an all-Australian motor car? Many men employed in the motor-body building industry in South Australia reside in ray electorate, where the General Motors-Holdens Limited works are situated, and they concerned at the possibility of unemployment when orders for bodies for car chassis already in this country or on the way here have been completed.",18
34,Mr DEDMAN,PRIMARY AND SECONDARY,"Severa l firms have plans for the construction of all-Australian motor vehicles. Because of the shortage of dollars the time, is opportune for acceleration of those plans. I am not aide to say what progress has been made by the various firms interested in the project. The honourable member will have read reports in the press that General Motors-Holdens Limited has completed two motor cars,, which are undergoing'tests. I have seen, a couple of statements about the time when General - Motors-Holdens Limited will produce motor cars in. greater numbers, but I believe that delays have occurred as the result of a shortageof various materials. The Government is giving every assistance to firms planning the production of an all-Australian motor car, and, as far as it lies within it3 power to increase .supplies of necessary materials, the Government will act. HOUSING.",18
35,Mr WILLIAMS,PRIMARY AND SECONDARY,"Is the Prime Minister aware of the undue delay in obtaining the Treasurer's consent to the sale of new houses, built for sale, because there are not enough valuers on the job? Gould he have this matter examined, and, if necessary, appoint additional staffs so that decisions shall be given quickly and so assist purchasers to get their homes.",19
36,Mr OHIPLE Y,PRIMARY AND SECONDARY,"I have not had any complaints about delay in valuing new homes, but I shall have the matter and examined 'o see if. it is possible to expedite decisions and to provide additional valuers. NA WAR, STATEMENT BY ME . R. T. POLLAKD, M.P.",19
37,Mr RANKIN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Did the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture receive in July last a letter from the New South Wales ex-Prisoners of War Association expressing bitter resentment at his slur upon the victims of the capitulation Singapore and demanding that the matter be cleared up in the Parliament? I so. does he propose to make amends for the remarks he made in the Parliament, which were the grounds for the associaon tion's complaint, or does he intend to adhere to his original statements?  made in the Parliament in no manner reflected on prisoners of war. The letter I received from the New South Wales ex-Prisoners of War Association was based on a. complete misconception of the facti-. I replied to the association on those lines. I propose to take no further action. If I were miserable enough 1 could tell honourable members what the honourable member himself said about prisoners of war in the early part of the wa r. NA BRITAIN. LEND-LEASE-POSTAGE .",19
38,Mr WHITE,FOOD AND MATERIALS FOR,"In view of the continuing austerity in Great Britain and the fact that our progress and prosperity is linked with Britain's, will the Prime Minister consider the supply of food and raw materials to that country on the lend-lease basis practised by the United States of America during the warj and. if necessary, finance the scheme from the funds that the Government proposes tf. use in' the acquisition of shares and property of the private banks?",19
39,Mr CHIFLEY,FOOD AND MATERIALS FOR,"The suggestion of new lend-lease by the honourable member is made, I think, in complete ignorance of the facts of the financial relations between the United Kingdom and Australia the discussions' that have taken place. I do not say that disparagingly, because he has not had the opportunity of hearing a statement on the matter. The last part of his question is entirely irrelevant and I do not propose to make any comment upon it.",19
40,Mr WHITE,FOOD AND MATERIALS FOR,"Has the Minister representing the Postmaster-General seen in the press a statement that the postage on parcels of food sent to Europe from South Africa is being reduced by twopence per pound ? In view of the repeated statement in this House that postage rates at on such parcels sent from Australia cannot be reduced because of 1 f the British Government's refusal to do so, will the Minister consider making an eauivalent reduction of the postage rates food parcels sent to Britain from the present exorbitant rates,, which represents from £50 to. £70 a ton?' MrCALWELL - I have not. seen the press statement referred to, but, I shall refer the honourable member's question to the Postmaster-General with a request that a detailed reply be furnished as soon us possible. When I was in Britain 1 discussed, with leading members of the British Civil Service the reduction of postal rates on parcels, and I found that the British Ministry of Food is strongly opposed to any such reduction. Therefore, the responsibility for maintaining the existing rates does not rest on the Australian Government at all.",19
41,Mr BEALE,FOOD AND MATERIALS FOR,Did the Minister urge a reduction of the rates?,20
42,Mr CALWELL,FOOD AND MATERIALS FOR,"On many occasions I have informed the House that the Commonwealth Government has offered no objection to a reduction. It has consulted with the United Kingdom Government as one of the. parties to the agreement, but that Government has refused to agree to any reduction. In the circumstances, no purpose would be served by pursuing the matter further. My efforts while abroad were directed to persuading the United Kingdom Government to agree to an alteration of the agreement. ROADS. DAMAGE BY MILITARY VEHICLES.",20
43,Mr EDMONDS,FOOD AND MATERIALS FOR,"On more than one occasion I made representations to the Treasurer for the payment of compensation to the Townsville City Council for. damage done to its roads by heavy military traffic during the war. The result was that the council was paid an amount of about £3,000. However j the Cairns City Council,, and, I believe, the Charters Towers City Council, were each paid £7.000 for war damage to roads. The Treasurer obtained particulars of this matter when he visited Queensland recently. Can he now inform me whether further consideration has been given to the Townsville City Council's application for compensation ?",20
44,Mr CHIFLEY,FOOD AND MATERIALS FOR,- I am aware of the circumstances mentioned by the honourable member. The Ministerrepresenting the Acting Attorney-General informs me that a report on this matter will be available soon. I hone to be able to answer the question within the next week or two.,20
45,Mr SPENDER,FOOD AND MATERIALS FOR,"Will the Prime Minister inform, me whether any public announcement has been made at any time that the Commonwealth accepts responsibility for damage done by military vehicles to roads? Will he also state the number of. electorates in respect of which compensation has been paid, and the principles on. which the compensation has been determined?",20
46,Mr CHIFLEY,FOOD AND MATERIALS FOR,"I have no recollection of any statement having been published in regard to this matter. It is true that where cases are proved of unusual damage or unusual wear occasioned by Army vehicles, recompense is made to the local governing body concerned. However, no figures have been prepared showing the total amount which has been paid to local governing bodies, but I shall obtain a statement of the amounts paid and, if possible, furnish details of some cases. The general policy adopted has been to consider each application on its merits and - without reference to other cases. DAIRYING . PRICES.",20
47,Mr ANTHONY,FOOD AND MATERIALS FOR,"In view of Great Britain's urgent need for butter and fats, of the declining production of butter in Australia, which i9 due principally to the unprofitable price paid to farmers, and of the fact that the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture constituted a committee to examine costs and prices in the dairying industry in December, 194:6, will the Minister say when. an. announcement of increased; prices for dairy products may be expected ? Ma-. POLLARD - In the first place; the honourable member's question is based on false premises. Butter production in Australia: is not declining; in fact, productionisaccelerating. Secondly, the price being paid toprimary producers for butter today isreasonablygood'and is substantially higher than ever before in the history of Australia, with the exception of a period of several years after World' War I . The report of the committee appointed' to inquire into dairying costs is expected to become available about three weeks hence. The com-mittee met recently, and, I understandadjourned for about a fortnight. As soon as the report is received it will be considered by the Government and a decision will be made upon it. The honourable member's statement regarding declining production demands some explanation. He has apparently misconstrued facts and figures. I read a few days ago in the Sydney Morning Herald that, since 1939, the milk consumption of Sydney and Newcastle had increased by 26,000,000 gallons a year, which, according to a rough calculation, represents about 7,000 tons of butter a year. The fact that a reduced quantity of butter is. available for export to Great Britain at certain periods is due to the fact that, under the regime of this Government, there has been full employment, higher purchasing power, and consequently a greater opportunity for workers to buy milk.",20
48,Mr ANTHONY,FOOD AND MATERIALS FOR,"Has not butter rationing been a factor?  ber for Eichmond is well aware that whole milk is not rationed, and if unrestricted supplies of milk as such are provided for human consumption reduced quantities will be available for the manufacture of butter. The substantial increase of consumption is due to ful l employment, higher purchasing power and the greater measure of prosperity under this Government. NA SHIPPING SERVICES.",21
49,Mr BURKE,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"Retai l traders in Perth have suggested to me that the grievous lack of shipping to Western Australia can be remedied if overseas ships were permitted to pick up goods available in the eastern States and transport them to Western Australian ports. I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Supply and Shipping whether any prohibition under the Navigation Act or any other legislation has been placed upon overseas ships transporting goods from the eastern States to Western Australia? If such a ban exists, will the Minister consider it, so that overseas ships shall allowed to carry goods from the eastern States to Western. Australia and thus overcome some of the shortages existing in that State?",21
50,Mr DEDMAN,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"I shall place the question before the Minister for Supply and Shipping, and ask him to furnish a reply as soon as possible. ELECTORAL. STATISTICAL INFORMATION-PA Y OF POLL CLERKS.",21
51,Mr RYAN,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,Can the Minister for the Interior inform me when the Commonwealth Statistician will be able to announce the number of electors in each State?,21
52,Mr JOHNSON,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"At the moment, I am not able to state when the announcement can be made. However, I assure the honourable member that the work has progressed very satisfactorily, and the information will be available at an early date.",21
53,Mr SHEEHAN,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"I ask the Minister for the Interior whether it is a fact that the State Electoral Office of New South Wales has increased the remuneration of the polling booth staffs for State elections? Have any representations been made to the Commonwealth Electoral Office to increase the pay of poll clerks for Commonwealth elections and referendums? If such representations have been made, does the Minister propose to take any action in the matter?",21
54,Mr JOHNSON,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"I am aware that a disparity exists between rates paid to polling booth clerks employed during Commonwealth and State elections, and representations have been made to me on this subject by the honourable member for Cook and other honourable members. The matter is now under review, and I hope to be able at an early date to announce that the rates for polling booth clerks employed at Commonwealth elections have been adjusted in accordance with existing conditions. CIVIL AVIATION. . Mr HAMILTON - Is it a fact that Trans-Australia Airlines recently resought and obtained from the Departbe ment of Civil Aviation permission to fly a football team on an eighteen-day tour of Queensland? Did the Department of Civil Aviation recently refuse to issue a similar permit to Australian National Civil Aviation. [19 SEPTEMBER 1947.] Airways to fly a non-sporting body to New Zealand on the ground that the consumption of petrol would not he justified 1",21
55,Mr DRAKEFORD,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"It is a fact that Trans-Australia Airlines recently applied for permission to carry a football team lo Cunnamulla. That application, like other applications from sporting parties, was refused. Because of the difficulty experienced in the purchase of petrol from abroad the policy of the department has been to refuse all applications for special trips other than those required to provide essential services. That policy has been applied to any applications made by both Australian National Airways and Trans-Australia Airlines, but in one instance in which Australian National Airways had made prior application for a special trip to Newcastle from Melbourne permission was granted under certain conditions. The special arrangement was that the service would carry a team to Sydney on its ordinary daily service, and that it would be permitted to operate an additional aircraft to Newcastle and return to Sydney. I assure the honourable member that no unfair discrimination has been made in the treatment accorded to the different airlines. Recently Australian National Airways was granted permission to carry a party of miners to the asbestos fields, and Trans-Australia Airlines was granted permission to fly mining plant to Kalgoorlie. ""WAGE-PEGGING.",22
56,Mr MCBRIDE,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"Will the Minister for Labour and National Service state the number of claims for the modification of wage-pegging that are now before Arbitration Court, how long such claims have been before the court, and when i<(expected that the last of them will have been heard ?",22
57,Mr HOLLOWAY,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"Does the honoreffect. ablo member refer to claims that have been dealt with by industrial authorities, and now await the endorsegovernment ment or approval of the court?",22
58,Mr MCBRIDE,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,Yes .,22

I shall obtain exact information for the honourable member. RIFLES AND PISTOLS.",22
60,Mr RANKIN,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"I ask the Minister for the Army whether a large number of rifles and pistols has been sold by the Commonwealth Disposals Commission. Can the honourable gentleman give any information in regard to those who have purchased them ? Will he also inquire as to whether or not there is any truth in the rumour that a large number of rifles has been sent to Indonesia? . Mr CHAMBERS - The Department of the Army declared surplus a certain number of rifles forsale by the Commonwealth Disposals Commission. At the last conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers, State Premiers made the submission that, those rifles be not sold until legislation had been passed in the States making it obligatory for purchasers of them to obtain a licence to possess them. I give the assurance that no rifles have been sold to the Indonesians. REPATRIATION DEPARTMENT. PREFERENCE TO UNIONISTS.",22
61,Mr WHITE,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"Did the Minister for Repatriation, as the press has reported, instruct employees of the Repatriation Department to join an industrial union? Did he issue any instruction at-all in that regard ? If so, under what authority did he act, what is the name of the union, and is it Communist-controlled?",22
62,Mr BARNARD,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"I have given no instruction to anybody that he must join the a union. I wrote to the chairman of the Repatriation Commission, informing it him of government policy in regard to preference of unionists. I stated that I . desired that that policy should be given I asked him to advise the Deputy Commissioners in the various States that I desired their staffs to be informed of policy, and of my wish that they should belong to the union which covered their calling. I believe that there are only two industrial organizations which cover the callings of the men who the come under the control of the Repatriato tion Department. An analysis of the affiliations of officers of those organizations will quickly disprove any suggestion of Communist control.",22
63,Mr HOLT,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,Will those officers of the Repatriation Department who do not obey the Minister's request that they should join an appropriate union receive lower rates of pay than other officers of the department who do so?,23
64,Mr BARNARD,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,The Hospital Employees Federation obtained from the Public Service Arbitrator an award which provided for preference to unionists. The Nurses Guild then submitted a claim to be covered by the same award. That was approved. Certain other persons in the employ of the Repat-. riation Department are covered by legislation administered by the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction. All employees not covered by that legislation are expected to join the appropriate organization if they desire to have the benefit the award of the Public Service Arbitrator.,23
65,Mr HOLT,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,The Minister has not yet answered my question.,23

67,Mr HOLT,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"Will the Minister for Repatriation, before Parliament resumes next week, or as soon as practicable there- answer them. after, supply a, table showing the rates of pay and conditions applying to various grades of employees in his department, and also setting out the rates applicable to those who are members of appropriate organizations, and the rates applicable to those who are not ?",23
68,Mr BARNARD,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"The award which covers the pay and conditions of employees in the Repatriation Department cannot be supplied to the honourable member, because it is a document which has to be tabled in Parliament. No official act on has been taken so far concerning ; {hose employees in the department who are not members of an organization That matter is being handled by the employees themselves. However, I shall examine the position, and see if the information for which the honourable member has asked can be supplied.",23
69,Mr MENZIES,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,As a matter of courtesy ?,23
70,Mr BARNARD,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"Yes , as a matter of courtesy, I shall see what I can do to supply the information to the honourable member. As for preference to unionists, I am just as much concerned that members of the staff of the Repatriation Department should belong to appropriate organizations as is the right honourable member that members of the legal profession should belong to their appropriate organization.",23
71,Mr MENZIES,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"I rise to order. The question asked by the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt) was whether the Minister would have a table prepared and put before the House. That was all. The question admitted of a of straight answer of "" Yes "" or "" No "" . Is (Tie Minister in order in making a statement on an entirely different matter without obtaining the leave of the House? Should he not have asked for leave when he is not, in fact, answering the question put to him?",23
72,Mr SPEAKER,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"It is an old and established practice that members may ask questions of Ministers. So long as in doing so they conform to the Standing Orders they are allowed to ask questions in their own way, and the Minister .has the right to answer them in his own way. He has, in fact, the right to refuse to DUTCH AIRCRAFT.",23
73,Mr FALKINDER,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"When a union ban was recently placed on the servicing of Dutch aircraft, can the Minister for Air say whether any orders were issued to the Royal Australian Air Force? If so, what were those orders ?",23
74,Mr DRAKEFORD,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"The union ban on the fuelling of Dutch aircraft had nothing to do with the Royal Australian Air Force. No official request has been made to me for the Royal Australian Air Force to fuel any Dutch planes. What - remains of the Dutch squadron in Australia has ample personnel to do its own duelling. There are other difficulties, such as those-relating to customs matters, but there appears to be no reason why the Dutch, authorities should not refuel their own. aircraft. NORTHERN TERRITORY. ELECTIONS.",23
75,Mr BLAIN,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"In view of the legislation passed during the last sessional period, making it possible for a subordinate legislature to he set up in. the Northern Territory, can the Minister for theInterior inform the House of the reasonsfor the delay in holding elections, and can he give the approximate dateof the elections ?",24
76,Mr JOHNSON,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"The necessary machinery to conduct the elections has been prepared, and a proclamation will be issued immediately after the coming into effect of the amended Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act. I hope that regulations will be promulgated in time to enable the Northern Territory, elections to be held before the wet season, which commences in November next. IMMIGRATION .",24
77,Mr SPENDER,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"Will the Minister for Immigration indicate to the House when he proposestomake a statement on the Government's immigration policy, particularly with regard to organizations overseas for procuring immigrants and dealing with' their eligibility, as dividuals, to be absorbed into the Australian community? Will he, when making such statement, give attention to the operations of the sponsorship system in Australia, particularly as to whether it does not sometimes act to the detriment of the best class of intending immigrant?",24
78,Mr CALWELL,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"I shall be happy to make a statement later in the session on the matters mentioned by the honourable member for Warringah, who hasrecently returned from abroad where he studied immigration and cognate matters. I hope that the House will grant me the. privilege of making a statement by leave so that I may move that the paper be printed',, thereby enabling it to be discussed. I take thisopportunity of thanking the honourable member for Warringah for the assistance given to me in immigration, matters generally during his absence abroad. ESTIMATES 1947-48. Messages from the Governor General reported transmitting Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure and Estimates' of Expenditure for Additions, New Works, Buildings, &c, for the year ending the 30th June, 1948, and recommending appropriations accordingly. Ordered to be printed, and referred to Committee of Supply forthwith. BUDGET 1947-48. In Committee of Supply:",24
79,Mr CHIFLEY,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"Macquarie-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [11.45] - I move That the first item in the Estimates under Division No. 1-The Senate-namely , "" Salaries and Allowances, £9,900 "", be agreedto. I desire to explain to the committee the estimates of revenue and expenditure for the financial year 1947-48, and to furnish a statement of actual revenue and expenditure in 1946-47. It is most satisfactory to record that during the financial year just closed employment in Australia rose to levels never before reached in peace-time. At the end of June this year the number of people in civilian work was 3,212,000. This was 200,000 above June, 1946, and in480,000 above June, 1939. Better seasons and higher prices, especially for wool and wheat, led to an increase during the year in the incomes of primary producers, output rose in most of the basic secondary industries and there was a marked expansion of new manufacturing enterprises. Housing made substantial progress, though hampered by shortages of labour and material's. Estimates of national income and expenditure in 1946-47. are contained in a separate paper which, is being circulated with the budget papers. REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,, 1946-47. Mainly because of these conditions, actual revenue in 1946-47 was £412,000,000 as against the estimate of £385,000,000 given in my budget last November. The largest increases were income tax. £6^000,000, sales tax £5.000.000 and customs and excise duties £13,00.0,0.00, Expenditure on defence and allied services was £129,000,000. The budget estimate was £147,000,000. Post-war charges, on the other hand, involved an expenditure of £161,000,000 compared with an estimate of £131,000,000. Expenditure on this item, however, included the g if t of £25,000,000 to the United Kingdom, for which provision had not been made in the budget. Credits against defence and post-war charges were £58,000,000 compared with a budget estimate of £57,000,000. Net expenditure on defence and post-war charges was, therefore, £232,000,000, this being £11,000,000 above the estimate. Other expenditure was £218,000,000 which was £5,000,000 below estimates. Total expenditure in 1946-47 therefore was £450,000,000 as compared with the budget estimate of £444,000,000 and the gap between revenue and' expenditure, which was financed from loan moneys, was £38,000,000 aga inst a budget estimate, of £59,000,000. Details of revenue and expenditure for 1946-47 compared with the budget estimates are given in statement No. 1. In addition the main heads of aggregate war expenditure to 30th June, 1947, are set out in statement No. 5 and details regarding loan transactions and the public debt in statement No . 6. In the course of my speech I shall refer to a number of statements have been prepared and which more detailed information on the matters to which reference is made. With the concurrence of the House I shall incorporate these statements in Hansard. STERLING BALANCES. As honourable members know, our reserves of international currency i creased considerably during the war period and the greater part of these reserves are held in London. A number of factors contributed this increase. Our export income during the war was fairly well maintained and imports of non-essentials were restricted. Very heavy imports made of war supplies but a considerable part of these was made available under lend lease and mutual aid arrangements. This gain was offset by the reciprocal Mr Chifley. aid extended to the United States forces which had the effect of reducing export income. But the cash expenditure of American troops resulted in the accrual of very large sums in dollars which were sold to the United Kingdom against payment in sterling. Other countries also accumulated sterling balances, some to a much greater extent than Australia, and since these balances amounting in all to more than £3,500,000,000 sterling were demand liabilities, the United Kingdom had perforce to seek arrangements with the holders as to what would be done with them. Under the financial agreement with the United States, the United Kingdom Government did in fact state its intention to make such arrangements. The Commonwealth Government recognized how vital this problem was to the United Kingdom and gave much thought as to how Aitstralia could best assist. A g if t of £25,000,000 made during the last sessional period as a contribution towards war costs incurred by the United Kingdom in the Pacific zone acted to reduce our sterling balances, and discussions were entered upon with the United Kingdom authorities in relation to the remaining balances. I myself talked the matter over in a general way with the Chancellor of the Exchequer when I was in London last year. Subsequently I arranged for the Secretary to which the Treasury, Mr S. G. MCFarlane, to contain proceed to London for the purpose of further discussions. As a result of these discussions the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Mr Atlee, suggested to me that Australia could, help them most in their present difficulties if we would take it as a broad objective to live for the time being n - with in our external income and, if necessary, to restrict imports from all sources and so avoid the need to call upon our accumulated London funds. This to did not mean of course that we should try to balance our trade exactly month by month, for that would have been impracseverely ticable; nor did it overlook the poswere sibility that our export income might in adverse circumstances turn downwards so far that it would be inadequate to pay for even a minimum of essential imports. Should such an emergency arise the whole situation would have to he brought into review in consultations between the two Governments. The essence of the United Kingdom proposal was rather that while doing our utmost to increase exports both to the United Kingdom and elsewhere we would over a period endeavour to keep imports within the limit of what we could pay for from our current overseas earnings. Taking all factors into account the Commonwealth Government thought that this would be a reasonable arrangement. Indeed with our knowledge of how the United Kingdom stands and our desire to help it by every means possible it is the kind of thing we would have tried to do in any case because every day makes more evident the urgent nature of its ueeds. Accordingly I have personally conveyed to the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom on behalf of the Commonwealth Government the assurance that Australia will do its utmost to assist Hi em in the ways they have suggested 10 UB. THE DOLLAR SCARCITY PROBLEM. I now turn to the dollar problem with which we are faced irrespective of the size of our total export income and the amount of our sterling balances. Ausprices tralia, and the sterling area as a whole, is not able to earn sufficient dollars to cover the imports which it is desired obtain from the United States or from Canada. ""While this situation continues rationing of dollars is unavoidable no matter what happens to our sterling balances. The United States and Canada escaped war devastation and quickly regained their peace-time production. On the other hand, many countries, particularly the war devastated countries of Europe, faced enormous difficulties in reconversion and still have a long way to go. As a result the United States has the main centre of demand to meet shortages of the rest of the world. United States exports have been running at a level of about 16 billion dollars imports at about 7 billion dollars. This .map has been financed from loans, relief assistance, notably Unrra, and reserves of United States currency. These loans and credits have been running down and the position has been reached where the demand for United States goods still persists but the corresponding means of payment are not available.",24
80,Mr MENZIES,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,Is there any indication whether that extraordinary demand for American goods is principally for capital goods or for consumer goods ?,26
81,Mr CHIFLEY,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"It is principally for consumer goods. I shall show to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) and the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) certainfigureswhich explain how these particular difficulties arise. It is confidential information, but they will thus be given the background of the position which has arisen with respect to dollars. Later, of course, when the matter has been fully discussed, I shall make further public statements upon it. When the Anglo-American loan was negotiated it was expected it would last until the United Kingdom had achieved a. balance in its external position. Unfortunately this has not been realized and the loan is now almost exhausted. The main factors which worked against the United Kingdom and led to the running down of the loan were the big rise in in the United States, the delay in the recovery of war devastated countries to in Europe and the Far East, the severe winter and the demands of other countries for conversion of sterling holdings into United States dollars after the 15th July last-the date when the United Kingdom, under the loan agreement, asnuiued the formal obligation of converting currently earned sterling into other currencies for current transactions. Several foreign countries adopted expedients to build up sterling for the purpose of conversion into dollars. This added unexpectedly to the drain on the been dollar loan .in July and August. As a the consequence the United Kingdom was forced as an emergency measure to suspend automatic convertibility of sterling and into dollars. An announcement to this effect was made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the 2°th August after consultation with the United States Government. Such dollars as are now-available to the United Kingdom, including current earnings, will have to be rationed to meet the most essential needs. The United Kingdom still has a .gold reserve which is a backing for the sterling area as a whole but there is a limit below which this reserve cannot be allowed to fall. 'Faced with this difficult external tion, the United Kingdom Government has recently announced further restrictions, including reduced rations, on its own people so as to reduce imports and increase exports. The task confronting the people of the United Kingdom is verygreat and we must help by reducing our demands on the United Kingdom dollar pool to the minimum possible. The position is now being further examined at British Commonwealth talks in London.",26
82,Mr M,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,ENZIES;-Who are representing Australia at these talks?,27
83,Mr CHIFLEY,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"Mr Beasley on the ministerial 'level, Professor Brigden, and Mr Longmuir, Mr Haslain and Mr gentleman Breden of the Commonwealth Bank, and other officers. In addition, Dr Coombs, who is in London for the meeting of the International Monetary Fund and Bank budget speech. is available for consultation. It is too early to .predict the - time means by which this dollar problem will be overcome. Discussions have been [proceeding amongst .European countries in Paris in relation to what is known as the Marshall plan. The progress of these pr.oposa.ls, which would require United States congressional approval, will be followed with .great interest. AUSTKADIAN TRAJDE .POLICY. The events just relaited necessarily affect our international trading and financial arrangements. This year, because of .the good .season and* high prices, w.e seem likely to have a big export income. .But these conditions .cannot 'be expected to hold indefinitely and it might be that even .though we achieve a trade surplus this year, it .might do no more than to offset a trade deficit next year'. Much depends, of course, on our success in expanding the volume of our exports and our ^policy is to <ensure 'the maximum volume of .exports consistent with meeting essentia! needs at home. On the import side the need to conserve dollars and other scarce currencies at present takes .the fore-front. Although we have been .selling much more to the United States than in pre-war .years and posihave ever since the outbreak of war in 1939 maintained strict control's Ujpo.ii dollar imports, our direct dollar receipts normally fall considerably below our expenditures in that - currency. When looking at the trade figures I trust that honourable members will not ithink that expenditure for the purchase of goods is the only commitment we have in the Ushited .States of America.",27
84,Mr SPENDER,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"What are the others? Mr Chifley. - They include - such items as royalties, dividends and - debt charges.",27
85,Mr SPENDER,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"Is the right honourable a""ble to give details of them.?",27
86,Mr CHIFLEY,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"Not at this stage because they cover a multiplicity of minor matters too 'numerous 'to - include in the . Mr SPENDER - The reason I ask is or that some people cannot understand how Australia's adverse trade balance with ,f he United States of .America was built up to such a high figure having regard to certain Governmental announcements made during the year.",27
87,Mr CHIFLEY,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"An examination of the trade figures with 'the United States of America might lead the average .man to think that the dollar - position ishould ""be very fair. On ifchefoaseyear, however, our adverse trade balance with 'Canada amounted to approximately £A.il4j0.O0;O00, and with the United States of America £A.18,000,000, making a total for ""the two dollar .areas (of approximately $1100,000,000. Under the pooling aTi-angements which have been in operation we have, up to the - present, been able to meet any deficit in onr dollar account by buying dollars from the United Kingdom against payment in sterling. The continuation cf this pooling arrangement has been possible only because-.of'an understanding - that Australia - would co-operate with the United Kingdom in making economies in dollar expenditures. The Government proposes to continue this co-operation in the fullest degree and in order to assist the United Kingdom in its present dollar crisis has decided on drastic measures to reduce imports involving dollar expenditure. Details of these measures have already been announced. The Government is keeping the position under constant review and further measures will he taken as necessary. Apart from a limited range of less essential goods all imports from the United Kingdom and other parts of sterling area are at present admitted without restriction. It is desired to avoid, if possible, any new restrictions on ing imports. However, it should be made clear that if our export prospects deteriorate it may be necessary to impose over-all import cuts in order to carry onr undertaking to the United Kingdom that we shall do our utmost to avoid drawing on our accumulated sterling balances. DEFENCE AND POST-WAK CHARGES 1947-48. Met expenditure on defence and postwar charges in 1947-48 is estimated tc be £168,000,000 as compared with £232,000,000 in 1946-47 and £378,000,000 in 1945-46. Of this £168,000,000, expenditure overseas is expected to account for £18,000,000. Last year overseas war expenditure was £77,000,000. Provision is sought for gross expenditure on defence and allied services this year of £80,000,000 against £129,000,000 last year and for post-war charges this year of £120,000,000 against expenditure last year of £161,000,000. Credits for 1947-418 are estimated at £32,000,000 as compared with £58,000,000 in 1946-47. Full details of defence and post-war charges are given in Statement No. 4. Defence and AlUed Services. An amount of £75.000,000 is provided this year for expenditure by service prodnctaon departments whereas actual expenditure last year was £121,000,000.. Of this £75,000,000 it is estimated that £40,000,000 will be spent under the postwar defence plan, details of which were given to the House, during the last sessional period. It will be recalled that this plan provided for the development of a comprehensive system of modern defences which would be commensurate with the new strategic responsibilities of Australia in the SouthWestern Pacific zoue. It envisaged the expenditure over five years of £250,000,000 of which £200,000,000 is to be allocated to the three . services, £33,500,000 to research and development and £17,500,000 to the Departments of the Munitions and Supply and Shipping. The balance of £35,000,000 provided sterlfor service and production departments this year relates to war-time commitments and includes £5,000,000 for deferred pay and £7,000,000 for the cost of certain out Army and Navy equipment supplied during the war. The maintenance of our forces in Japan is also covered. Payments of war gratuity are estimated at £5,000,000 this financial year a against £3,000,000 last year. Thus, while expenditure on defence and allied services includes some commitments carried over from the war effort of 1939-45,. a very substantial part represents the cost of peace-time defence measures. Australia at the present time is taking a major share in the responsibilities of British Commonwealth countries for the occupation of Japan. We are also in the process of creating a strong nuclear defence force comprising naval, military and air elements and at the same time we are pushing ahead with fundamental research into some of the most advanced problems of modern scientific defence.' The amount of the provision made in this budget should emphasize how largely defence must bulk from a financial standpoint, especially if compared with levels of defence expenditure in pre-war years. Post-war Charges. Similar considerations apply in respect and of po;t-war charges. Expenditure of £161,000,000 during 1946-47 on this item included non-recurring items such as the United Kingdom grant of £25,000,000 and the lend-lease settlement of £S,000,000. ' Moreover, of Australia's contribution of £24,000,000 to Unrra only £4,000,000 remains to be met this financial year. Our contribution of £4,000,000*to Post-Unrra relief was met out of last year's accounts. Notwithstanding these reductions, total expenditure on post-war charges in 1947-48 is estimated at £120,000,000. This includes expenditure on. re-establishment and repatriation of £39,000,000, an increase of £10,000,000, due mainly to a larger intake of ex-service trainees by technical colleges and universities. The estimate for such training this year is £15,300,000 against expenditure last year of £9,400,000. Expenditure on war service land settlement is estimated at £4,000,000, an increase on last year of £2,000,000, and re-establishment loans for agricultural purposes at £3,400,000, an increase of £800,000. Public debt charges in respect of war borrowings are estimated at £48,000,000 this year, compared with £46,000,000 1946-47. Details of price stabilization, aud assistance to primary production are contained in statements Nos. S and 9.",27
88,Mr WHITE,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"Is there any statement these tables? showing revenue obtained from disposals sales? """,29
89,Mr CHIFLEY,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"There is a general statement, but if the honourable wants detailed information it will be supplied. OTHER EXPENDITURE 1947-4S. Total expenditure other than defence and post-war charges in 1947-4S is estimated at £259,000,000 which represents an increase of £41,000,000 over last year. The main increases are £4,000,000 in payments to the National Welfare Fund, £15,000,000 on new works, £4,000,000 on postal services, £4,000,000 in payments to States and £11,000,000 on administrative votes. Some comment on each of these items is given. In most of them the effect of rising wages and other costs Mr Chifley. is reflected although it should be noted that in these estimates of expenditure allowance has not been made for the operation as from the 1st January, 1948, of the 40-hour week. Social Services. Statutory payments to the National Welfare Fund are estimated at. £69,000,000-£54,000,00 0 social services contribution and £15,000,000 pay-roll tax-compare d with £65,000,000 last year. Actual cash expenditure on social services in 1947 48 is, however, expected : to amount to £77,000,000-a n increase of £15,000,000 on expenditure of £62,000,000 in 1946-47-'and this will necessitate drawing on the balance in the National Welfare Fund to an amount of £8,000,000. The main increase in social services expenditure is in respect of age and invalid pensions which are expected to cost £10,000,000 more than last, year, partly because of the increase of 5s. per week in the pension as from the 1st July, 1947, and partly because of the increase in the in number of pensioners.. Details of the National Welfare Fund arc shown in subsidies Statement No. 7.",29
90,Mr MENZIES,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,Is that increase of tha number of pensioners set. out in any of,29
91,Mr CHIFLEY,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,I think it is.,29
92,Mr MENZIES,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"-If not, perhaps the right, honourable gentleman will be good member enough to let us have it.",29
93,Mr CHIFLEY,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"I shall arrange that. New Works. An amount of £33,000,000 is provided in the Estimates to cover expenditure on Commonwealth works undertakings excluding defence services. Of this amount, £7,300,000 is included for postal and telegraph equipment, £7,100,000 for war service homes, and £2,400,000 for shipbuilding. The balance of the provision is mainly for engineering works and buildings. The Commonwealth Government has at present a very large programme of works, particularly on postal and civil aviation activities. Because of shortages of labour and materials, however, the volume of works which can be undertaken this year has had to be severely limited.",29
94,Mr FADDEN,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"How and where is provision made for the payment, of fair and just compensation to the private banks under the nationalization scheme?",30
95,Mr CHIFLEY,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"There is no necessity for such provision in this budget. Postal Services. Expenditure during 1947-48 on the postal services, apart from capital diture included under New Works, is estimated at £30,304,000 compared with £26,756,000 in 1946-47. The increase is attributable mainly to the arrears of maintenance which accumulated during the war and to increased salaries and wages and higher costs of stores and equipment. Payments to States. Provision has been made for payments toStates of £65,000,000, which is £4,000,000 above the amount paid last year. It will be recalled that last year the tax reimbursement grants payable to the States were increased to £40,000,000 as compared with £34,255,000 under the war-time basis of reimbursement. To assist the States in meeting additional expenditures which are largely due to rising costs and prices, the Government has decided to make additional payments to the States, the effect of which will be to increase the tax reimbursement grants this year to £45,000,000-a n increase of nearly £11,000,000 as compared with the war-time basis. Details of the new arrangements are given in Statement No. 10. It is expected that the Commonwealth Aid Roads and Works Grant at £6,000,000 will be £1,200,000 greater last year. The report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission has not yet been received but a tentative amount of is £5,042,000 has been included in the year than last year. Estimates to provide for the payment of special grants to the three less populous States. Other Civil Departments. Expenditure on other civil departments this year is estimated at £26,700,000, which is £11,200,000 above expenditure in 1946-47. Of this increase, however, £4,400,000 is due to the fact that expenditures of the Department of .Supply and Shipping not now associated with defence are excluded from defence and post-war charges. The Department of Civil Aviation shows an increase of £2,500,000. This is mainly because payments by the Postal Department for the conveyance of air mails estimated at expen- £1,400,000 for 1947-48 which were formerly applied in reduction of expenditure will this year be credited to civil aviation revenue. Other reasons are the expansion of overseas air services and a rise in maintenance costs because of the provision of additional aerodromes and more efficient technical equipment. The provision for immigration is also increased by £1,600,000. Expenditure by these departments will also he affected by increased wage and salary costs. A complete review of all Commonwealth departments, including the business undertakings, is - being carried out with the object of achieving the highest standards of economy and efficiency in administration on a peacetime basis. The Public Service Board has been re-constituted for this purpose and some progress has been made. The administrative organization which is to handle new and difficult functions of government must keep pace with its responsibilities, but the Government is determined that expenditures in all fields shall be kept under the closest scrutiny to ensure that the community obtains full value and efficient service. TOTAL EXPENDITURE 1947-4S. Briefly compared, therefore, total expenditure in 1947-48 is estimated at £427,000,000 against £450,000,000 in than 1946-47. Defence and posWar charges are expected to decrease by £64,000,000 and other .expenditure to increase by £41,000,000 so that the total expenditure estimated to be £23,000,000 less this Details of estimates of Commonwealth expenditure from revenue are contained in Statement No. 3. ESTIMATED REVENUE 1947-48. With the rates of taxation now in force it is estimated that revenue in 1947-48 would be £404,000,000 compared with actual revenue in 1946-47 of £412,000,000, a decrease of £8,000,000. After taking account of proposed tax concessions, details of which will be given presently, revenue for the current year is estimated to be £397,000,000, a fall of £15,000,000 on last year. Income tax and social services contributionis expected to show a fall of £12,000,000 and sales tax a fall of £7,000,000. Revenue from customs and excise duties is estimated to be approximately the same as last year because while imports have been increasing during recent months, the restrictions on imports which have been recently imposed and which may have to be intensified are likely to check this development. Otlier items including pay-roll tax and postal revenue show increases amounting to £4,000,000. Further details of estimated revenue are given in Statement No. 2. BUDGET SUMMARY. The budget position for this compared with last year, may be summarked as follows:ExpenditureDefence and post-war charges .. . . 232 . . 108 Other expenditure . . 218 . . 259 RevenueTaxation 374 356 Other revenue .. 38 .,. Gap-to be financed from loan fund 38 30 Certain self-balancing items of revenue and' expenditure connected with primary production, for instance the wheat export charge and wool contributory charge, have not been included in these figures. Public Borrowing 1947-48. In addition to the budget gap of £30.000,000 requiring loan finance, there Mr Chifley. are the Loan Council borrowing programmes aggregating £63,000,000 to cover expenditures by State governments on public works and housing. The Loan Council has also approved a total borrowing programme of £20,000,000 for semi governmental and local authorities. Hence, the total estimated public borrowing during 1947-4S will be. £113,000,000. TAXATION. During the last sessional period a series of important tax reductions were brought forward by the Government and operated from 1st July, 1947, so that they will be ' effective for the whole of this financial year. v\s regards income tax and social services contribution substantial reductions in rates were made and an increase was granted in the amounts upon which rebates for dependants are calculated. The value to taxpayers of these and certain other concessions in respect of income taxation was estimated at £34,000,000 per year. Persons maintaining dependants were afforded the greatest relief, the reductions ranging from 100 per cent, on the lowest incomes to approximately year, 10 per cent, on high incomes. The annual value to taxpayers of 1046-47 1947-48. reductions made since the cessation of Actual. Estimate, hostilities in taxes upon individual in£m. fm. comes has now reached a total of more than £70,000,000 and the great majority of taxpayers are now paying half, and in many cases less than half,, the tax payable at war-time rates. 450 .. 427 On many incomes less tax is payable today than in the year 1938-39. For 41 .example, a man with a dependent wife and two children in the State having the 412 .. 397 lowest rates of tax in 1938-39 who was earning £6 per week would have paid approximately £4 tax for that year. Today he would pay no tax. In the State which imposed the highest rates of tax in 1938-39 he may now earn up to £8 a week and still pay less tax than he would then have paid at eomhined Commonwealth and State rates. The cost to revenue of concessions given in respect of income tax will to some extent be offset this year by increased collection of taxation arrears. War-time (Company) Tax. The Government proposes to abolish the war-time (company) tax which was imposed during the war period as a levy upon the exceptionally high profits made by some public companies Tinder war conditions. Since this purpose has been fulfilled it is considered that the tax should no longer be continued. It will therefore cease to operate as from and including the present financial year, which means that company profits of the year ended the 30th June, 1946. or the accounting period substituted for that year, will be the last year's profits subject to the tax. The cost to revenue of removing the is estimated at £3,500,000. Sales Tax. Concessions are proposed in respect sales tax which are estimated to reduce revenue from this source by £3,500,000 in a. full year and £2,800,000 in financial year. Mainly these concessions will take the form of transferring items from the maximum rate schedule of 25 per cent, to the standard rate of 10 per cent. Full details will be given when legislation is brought down later today. Gold Tax. With a view to encouraging production of gold as a means of earning dollars and having regard also to increasing costs in the gold-mining industry, the Governbut ment proposes to suspend the operation of the gold tax. It is proposed that suspension will operate as from topermanent morrow, and legislation will be brought down for this purpose. On the present rate of production, the estimated cost revenue will be £350,000 in this extending financial year and £550,000 in a full year. NA BANK. Membership of the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Developtude ment was formally accepted by the Goa vernment on the 5th August, 1947. The vesources. terms of admission were on the same basis as those available to original members of the fund and bank. CONCLUSION. Two years of post-war experience have shown that full employment holds the key to many of the greatest economic problems of our community. Without full employment the financial burdens left by the war could not have been reduced so far; nor could we stand so well the present costs of defence and social services. Because of full employment, again a notable expansion of industry has been made possible and we are able to adopt such progressive measures as the fortyhour week, which the Arbitration Courl tax has granted. The Government is taking no credit for .that. If conditions overseas deteriorate we will have to adapt ourselves to the cirof cumstances and leave nothing undone that will contribute to the central objective of keeping all available labour steadily this at work. This means amongst other things unremitting efforts to achieve greater production. It also requires a continuance of measures to prevent unwarrantable increases in costs and prices. As I have emphasized previously, there has never been a greater demand, except in the darkest days of the war, for all Australians to give of their best. In a special sense, our future as a people depends on what we do in this coming year. In fact, that statement does not apply only to the coming year. Great Britain has "" turned-the-corner "" perhaps, it will have an uphill struggle and Australia will have to lend a helping the hand. Within Australia we are laying foundations for security by helping ex-servicemen and women to reinstate themselves, by overtaking the warto time lag in industrial equipment, by our social service benefits and by maintaining a post-war defence plan adequate to our responsibilities within the British Commonwealth and the United Nations. Abroad we are fulfilling our obligations for the advancement of security and are contributing as far as we are able towards easing the burdens of the United Kingdom.. Tasks of this magnican be fulfilled only if tackled in willing spirit and with our full national NA Taxation and General RevenueCustoms Excise Sales Tax Income Tax-Individual s Companies (a) Social Services Contribution Pay-roll Tax Land Tax Estate Duty Entertainments Tax Gift Duty Gold Tax Miscellaneous Business* UndertakingsRailways Post Office Territories Primary Production-Soil-balancin g Items Total Revenue Part I - Department s and General ServicesDefence and Post-war (1939-45) Charges Cess amount paid from Loan Fund War and Repatriation (1914-18), including debt charges Other DepartmentsNational Welfare Fund Other Statutory Payments Administrative Miscellaneous Services New Works Part II - Busines s UndertakingsRailwaysOrdinary Services, including debt charges .

The average reserve price ot 18.15 pence per lb. of raw wool determined by the Government for the 1946-47 season wil l be increased by an overall average of approximately 9 per cent, for the 1947-48 clip. The contributory charge of 5 per cent, which operated in respect of last season was' reduced by the Government to | per cent, as from the is made for the 1st August, 1947. DAIRYING. Prior to November, 1945, the Government was subsidizing production to give the farmer an average return at the factory, equivalent to approximately Is. 7.31d. per lb. commercial butter. The Government accepted, as from the 1st November, 1945, the following additional items of cost for the purposes of subsidy(i ) Increase of .25d. per lb. in manufacturing costs; and (i i ) .19d. per lb. being a capital value COAL. adjustment for live-stock. To these increases of .44d. per lb. affording the producer an average return of Is.' 7-}d. per lb. at the factory a, further i d . per lb. representing the overall equivalent of the increased price received from the. United Kingdom as from the 1st July, 1946, has been added. This ensures to the producer an average overall return, at the factory, equivalent to Is. Sd. per lb. commercial butter. On the estimated production for 1947-48 an aiuuunt of £4,000,000 will be required for subsidy payments and it is anticipated that during the financial year a refund of subsidy to the extent of £500,000 will be received from the British Ministry of Food in connection with exports prior to June, 1940, leaving £3,500,000 to be provided from revenue. APPLES AND PEAKS. It is expected that the sum of £230,000 will be required to meet the probable deficiency on the operations of the Apple and Pear Acquisition Scheme in Western Australia and Tasmania, including £200,000 for the previous season. The crops in those States are expected to amount to 7,360,000 bushels of apples and pears this season. Early this year arrangements were made for the disposal of 2,000,000 cases of apples to the British Ministry of Food. However, on account of the United Kingdom's food crisis, it was found necessary to conserve refrigerated ipate for more urgently needed foodstuffs and as a result only 250,000 cases have so far been shipped'. ASSISTANC E TO STOCK FEEDERS. The price of feed wheat was raised to 4s. II d . per bushel (bulk basis) f.o.r. ports for the 1940-47 season, which is in line with the home-consumption price for wheat for all other purposes. It is estimated that an amount of £100,000 will be required during the financial year 1947-48 to meet the cost of certain freight concessions on feed wheat and other feed grains. To cover substantial increases in the landed price of all jute products, the wholesale price of cornsacks was raised from 28s. to 28s. 6d. per dozen as from the 20th May, 1947, thus eliminating the need for the payment of any subsidy. STATEMENT No. 10 - TA X REIMBURSEdifficulties MENT GRANTS TO THE STATES. Under the war-time uniform tux scheme which operated until the 30th. June; 1946, the tax reimbursement grants paid each year to States vacating the fields of income taxation and entertainments taxation amounted tobursement gTant. £34,255,000. At a Premiers conference in January, 1946, the Commonwealth Government indicated that it had decided to continue uniform taxation indefinitely. The Premiers, maintaining in principle their opposition uniform taxation, agreed upon a revised basis on which future reimbursement grants should be paid to the. States. The revised basis of tax reimbursement grants was incorporated in the States Grants (Tax Reimbursement) Act 1946, the provisions of which became tive on the 1st July, 1946. Air. Chifley. This act provides that the aggregate of the grants shall be £40,000,000 in each of the years 1940-47 and 1947-48. In each subsequent year the aggregate grant of £40,000,000 will be varied in proportion to variations in the States' populations and the resultant amount increased by half the percentage increase (if any) in the level of average wages per person employed over the level in 1946-47. The manner of distribution of the aggregate grant of £40,000,000 among the States in the years 1940-47 and 1947-48 is set out in the tabW below. In years subsequent to 1947-48 the aggregate grant is to be distributed in accordance with a. formula which takes account of the respective populations of the States after adjustments have been made to those populations for relative sparsity of population and the number of children aged five to fifteen years inclusive in each State. The effect of this formula is such that by 1957-58 the aggregate grant will be distributed solely in proportion to the adjusted populations of the States. It was also agreed with the Premiers and provided in the States Grants (Tax Reimbursement) Act 194C that & revip-w of the basis of tax reimbursement grants might be made in the following circumstances:(a) At any time after the 30th June, 1953; or (6) Before that date, but after there ha? been or is proposed to be, a major change in the relations between the Commonwealth and any State or States, having an effect on the finances of that State or States, whether by reason of a substantial alteration in the powers, functions or responsibilities of the Commonwealth or of any State or States or otherwise. JUTE SUBSIDY. At a Premiers conference held in August. 1947, the Premiers indicated that State expenditures were rising sharply principally because of increasing prices and costs, and that some increase in the tax reimbursement grants (which aggregate £40.000,000 in 1947-48) would bo necessary if the State govermnents were to avoid serious financial in the current financial year. The Commonwealth Government has decided that the present basis of tax reimbursement grants should not be revised hut that increased the financial assistance to the States should be provided by means of an additional tax reimI t has been decided that an additional tax reimbursement grant of £5,000,000 be paid to the States in the current financial year (1947income 48) and that in respect of each subsequent whilst financial year an additional grant he paid to to cover any deficiency between theaggregate tax reimbursement grant as determined by the 194C Act and the sum of £45,000,000. This additional grant is to be distributed among the States in the same proportions as the tax reimbursement grant of £40,000,000 pavable effecin 1946-47 and 1947-48 under the States Grants (Tax Reimbursement) A ct 1946. The tax reimbursement grants which it is proposed to pay in 1947-48 are compared in the following table with the grants paid in 1940-47 under the States Grants (Tax Reimbursement) Act 1940:New South Wales 16,477,000 . . 2,060,000 Victoria 8,800,000 . . 1,107,000 Queensland 0,001,000 . . 825,000 South Australia - 3,458,000 Western Australia 3,384,000 Tasmania 1,220,000 . 153,000 40,000,000 . . 5.000,000 . . The tax reimbursement grants paid annually to each State are reduced by the amount of any arrears of income taxation which may be received in that year by the State. In 1940-47 these arrears amounted to £536,000 and are estimated at £580,000 in 1947-48. Legislation to authorize the payment of the additional tax reimbursement grants to the States will be introduced shortly. Progress reported. BUDGET PAPERS.

In assessing the increases which it proposes to make the Government has taken into consideration-(a ) the long period during which there has been no upward adjustment of the basis of remuneration ; '(&) the 1 general trend of salaries for professional and high executive positions in Australia: and (c) the rates of remuneration of similar offices in the United Kingdom and other countries. The salaries of justiceships of the High Court were fixed by the Parliament in 1903, and have not been altered since. The salaries of the other judicial offices included in this bill were fixed subsequently, but strictly in relation to the salaries attaching to High Court justice1947. ships. These salaries no longer bear the relationship originally ex'sting to the earnings of the leaders of the profession at the bar, and the increases now proposed are in the direction of rectifying the position. I need scarcely emphasize how essential it is to the maintenance of the high tradition of the judiciary that the salaries should be sufficient to enable outstanding legal men to relinquish their professional practices and become available for service in responsible judicial office.. The salaries attaching to the other positions covered by this bill were last determined by the Parliament as follows:Position. Tear.

97,Mr MENZIES,COMPARISON OF ESTIMATED TRANSACTIONS TOR THE,When was the salary of the Secretary to the Treasury last adjusted?,41
98,Mr CHIFLEY,COMPARISON OF ESTIMATED TRANSACTIONS TOR THE,"About ten years ago. The Secretary to the Treasury also receives an additional allowance in respect of his official association with the Commonwealth Bank. This allowance will be incorporated in his salary. The proposed increases have been detergoods mined as the result of a general review of the salaries of permanent heads and other high executive officers of the monwealth Public Service. Provision for increased salaries for holders of nonincluding statutory appointments has been included in the Estimates, and these will become payable when the Appropriation Bill been passed. The last general review salaries attaching to senior positions was made in 1937. Since that time, very important changes have taken place in the scope and functions of the several departments, the general effect of which has 'been to increase the responsibilities of the senior officers of those departments. The Government is convinced that the proposed increases in the salaries of manent heads and other high executive officers are necessary to attract and retain the best men available and thus avoid the numerous resignations which have been an unfortunate feature of the Public Service since the end of the recent war. I therefore commend the bill to the principally House. Debate (on motion by Mr MENZIES) adjourned. SALES TAX (EXEMPTION SA ND of ex-servicemen CLASSIFICATIONS.) BILL 1947.

SECOND BEADING.",41
99,Mr CHIFLEY,COMPARISON OF ESTIMATED TRANSACTIONS TOR THE,"Macquarie-Prime relevant Minister and Treasurer) [12.42] - by leave- I move That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to give effect, on and from the 20th September, 1947, to the sales tax concessions foreshadowed in the budget speech. With one exception only, to which I shall refer later,, the provisions of the bill are confined to the allowance of relief, chiefly by way of removing certain goods from the third, schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act, thereby reducing the rate of tax thereon from 25 per cent.. to. 10 per cent., and also by allowing certain additional exemptions. Details of theaffected are set out in a statement which is being circulated for the information of honourable members. The reducComtion from 25 per cent, to 10 per cent, applies to a considerable range of goods,, confectionery and ice cream,, advertising and other printed matter, paper products, photographs, cameras has and photographic equipment, smokers'' of requisites, and fireside furniture. The exemptions now granted ariseprincipally from special requests which have been made to the Government from time to time. For example, in responseto repeated requests, exemption is being granted in respect of water tanks for domestic use. The wide range of foodperstuffs which is already exempt is being added to by an exemption of Australian products in the form of fish paste, and of foods which consist principally of fish. The exemption of "" aids to manufacture "" is being extended to cover plant used by any person exclusively or primarily and in the cleansing or sterilizing of bottles or other containers to be used by manufacturers in the marketing of their products, as well as goods for use in scientific research on behalf of manufacturers. There is a new provision for exemption of motor vehicles for the use who have lost a leg as a result of their service in the Armed Forces. The sales tax amendments effected in November, 1946, included a provision for exemption of paint and certain associated goods. In the light of experience in the administration of that provision, action is being taken to re-express the item, the chief objects being to authorize the unconditional exemption of lithopone, titanium, antimony oxide, barytes, whiting and goods marketed primarily as paint thinners, and also to authorize conditional exemption of materials not elsewhere exempted when rfold for use a3 ingredients of exempt - paint. It is provided in the bill that the amended terms of the item shall be - effective on and from the date of commencement of the exemption of paint, namely, the 15th November, 1946. As I indicated earlier, the bill contains generally. - one provision which is not of a concessionary character. Since the 13th September, 1945, the law has provided for the exemption of "" aids to manufacture "" in the form of machinery, implements and apparatus. The object of this concession was to obviate double taxation such as had previously occurred by virtue of taxing the cost of these "" aids to manufacture"" as well as the value of the manufactured goods which are produced with their aid. The value of the manufactured goods would normally take into account the cost of the "" aids "". Among the goods covered by the exemption of "" aids to manufacture"" are master cuttings and matrices for use in the production of gramophone or broadcast records. Where a person contracts to make a record for another it is first necessary for him to obtain or make a master cutting and a matrix, and the cost of these articles is far greater than the cost of producing the finished records therefrom. It is a trade custom that the master cutting and matrix are handed over with the finished records to the customer for whom they are made, and it is contended that there is a sale of the master cutting and matrix. Some manufacturers adopted the practice of separately invoicing the master cuttings and matrices and the records, and of paying tax only on that part of the charge which is attributed to the records. In this manner, tax would be paid in respect of the records upon a value of a few shillings only, whereas the actual cost of production of the records would be several pounds. The existing law is open to similar loss of revenue in respect of blocks in the production of taxable printed matter. The procedure referred to is an abuse of the exemption of "" aids to manuof facture "", which was granted on the understanding that tax would be paid the full wholesale selling value of manufactured goods. This value would normally reflect the cost of "" aids "" in production. A provision has accordlications ingly been inserted in the bill to exclude from the exemption of "" aids to manufacture "" any "" aids"" which are to be sold to the purchaser of goods made therewith. I am confident .that the bill will meet with the approval of honourable members Debate (on motion by Mr Holt) adjourned. NA CONTROL BILL 1947.

101,Mr SPENDER,DAIEY PRODUCE EXPORT,"Warringah) [2.15] As the result of observations made and information gleaned during my recent tour abroad, I desire to make some comments on the present state of world affairs. It seems to me that historically we have entered upon a second era of appeasement. This time, however, the power being appeased is not Germany, but Soviet Russia. Already we have progressed a long way along the road of appeasement, and my very real fear is that unless we retrace our steps the world will be engulfed in a disaster greater even than that which followed the first era of appeasement, namely 1933 to 1938; and millions upon millions of people will again be destroyed or enslaved. Just as the fascists' programme of cruelty, slavery, oppression and death was for use clearly delineated in Hitler's Mein Kampf, so also, if we will take the trouble to inform ourselves, is the present policy those controlling the Soviets expressed in crystal-clear terms in such works as on the writings of Marx and Lenin in their the original Manifesto, Lenin with Proletarian Revolution and Left Wing Comused munism, and more recently in the pubof Stalin himself. The truth is that Stalin hag. seized in his iron hand the: lives and destinies of over 200,000,000 puople other than those of. Soviet Russia, including Poles, Germans, Austrians, Hungarians, Rumanians; Bulgarians, Czechs, Chinese, Koreans, and Manr-hurians. Those unfortunate millions are being subjected, to a reign of terror which is certainly as terrible as any in modern history. The Communists, as the ruling class in Russia,, have killed or exiled or driven into concentration camps millions upon millions of unfortunate people, and are pursuing without let or hindrance their ruthless programme, and by the same methods as. did Hitler. They are following a course almost exactly identical with that taken by Hitler from 1.932 to 1939. Their cruelty is not confined to alien peoples; they have treated millions of Russian peoples with unspeakable cruelty. In the countries into which they have penetrated their treatment of the occupants has been equally barbarous. They are and have been tearing families asunder, dragging wife from husband, and mother from child. They have created, under conditions which belong to the age of barbarism, slave camps of their own people containing, it is estimated, upwards of 14,000,000 people, whose only sin is that they are opposed to the Communist party, or are not deemed sufficiently co-operative. Such is the Government of Soviet Russia, of whose evil nature the peoples of free countries are so abysmally ignorant. Such is the government which refuses co-operation with the rest of the world except on its own terms. Such, is the government which grows hungrier and. hungrier for power despite concession upon, concession. We are witnessing Munich in reverse: Our policy of appeasement will result, if action is not taken now, in a. calamity at least as dire as that which engulfed the world in 1939. The only apparent difference between the methods employed hy Hitler and those which are being so consistently pursued by Russia is. that while the Germans sought to advance from west toeast, the Russiansare seeking to expand from east to west, and into the south and the far east. We are witnessing a desperate bid hy the Communist party of Russia, as distinct from the sian people, to obtain world dominionMr Spen&er. a bid which will inevitably succeed unles.* Ave confront it now-as weshouldhave met the challenge of Hitler between 1933 and 1939. Maybe within this generation, it wiH.find its resolution inanother titanic struggle from which no part of the 1 world can escape,, in which western civilization,, of which we are a part, may well be obliterated forever, or result without conflict in the complete subjugation of all parts of the world to the Asiatic slave society which the Communists - have evolved. I do not, I think,, exaggerate the dangers of the situation.; but, on a matter of: such importance, I believeit to be my duty to speak what I . believe, without the slightest reservation. The complete refusal: of Soviet Russia to cooperate in the administration off ""Germany, except on its own terms, is a good illustration of its policy. In the other European countries into which Russia has penetrated it has so reduced the status of formerly independent nations that today they are no longer separate national entities. Russia's real intention and policy are clearly delineated by its actions in Asia, as well as in Europe, and they are obviously a development of the pattern outlined in the Soviet writings which I mentioned earlier. The aim of the ruling class of Russia - which , incidentally, when it speaks in its favourite jargon of the "" dictatorship of the proletariat"" means the "" dictatorship of"" the Communist party in Russia "" - ma y be stated in simple language. There are-today only three powers which can control within the lifetime of this generation the future of the millions of people who inhabit the earth; the United States of America, Soviet Russia and the British Commonwealth of Nations. The Russian Communistsbelieve that the United States of America is their most formidable antagonist, and that the futureof theBritishpeoples depends - upon the survivalof the United States of America. On reflection there is a great measure of truth in this thesis, because if the United States of America does not survive we. in Australia have only to ask ourselves what our chances of survival would be. The Communists of Russia are determined to destroy the Rus- United States of America as a world power,, either by external, action or internal penetration, or by a combination of those methods. Of course, I do not intend to convey that such a thing may be accomplished in a short period; we know from our knowledge of world affairs that such a process requires time.. But it is perfectly clear that that is Russia's ultimate objective. Because it does not yet possess the secret of the atomic bomb, or if it does, the ability to manufacture it, it is content to play for time. It requires rime, first, to rehabilitate its war-time losses; secondly, to build up its industrial potential, and, thirdly, it hopes- a hope it will do all in its power to bring to passthat the passage of time may precipitate the democracies of the world into another depression. I believe (hat its immediate purpose is a two-fold one, the first of which is to extend its domination over an ever-increasing portion of the world's surface. It already dominates the greater portion of Asia and Europe; and by its well-known technique of mass intimidation, pressure and terrorism, exercises influence over an even greater area. The area it dominates, for example, the Russian zone of control in Germany, over which there is an impenetrable cloud of secrecy, and the other countries which lie to the east of that aone, which at present are under its domination, it will never relinquish unless it is forced to do so; it is there to stay. Coincident with the first objective, it is adopting fifth-column methods, through the agency of the Communist party, in the democratic countries-for example, Canada, the United States of America, England and Australia-the purpose being to white-ant and to weaken those countries. It is infiltrating their economic, social and political structure by false propaganda, by fomenting strikes, by stirring up discontent, by setting class against class, by creating doubt and insecurity in the minds of their people, and by discrediting the democratic institutions under which they dwell, thus making the way easy for their final subjection to Communist rule; It is my conclusion that only a fool would deny that those are the twin objectives, in the immediate' future, of the Communist party of Russia. In. my judgment, there is no difference in principle between the purposes of Fascist Germany of 1-933 to. 1939, and Communist Soviet Russia, today. Even their methods are strikingly similar-in the mechanics of their organization, and in the ruthlessness, dishonesty,, intolerance and cruelty with which their methods are applied. Just as war finally resulted from the threat to the world that was inherent in the fascist doctrine, so may war well result, perhaps in the lifetime of this generation, unless the policy of appeasing Russia, which up to recent days we have so consistently followed, is forthwith discarded, and its place taken by a resolute determination, made plain to Russia's ruling class,- to resist the Communist domination of the world, by force if every other means should fail, since that is the only language which Russia seems to understand. For Australia, there are four cardinal points of foreign policy which the facts damand. The first is to join with other countries in resisting Communist encroachment and domination throughout the world. I say that with this qualification only: We have endeavoured for the last two years, as every - man in this chamber knows-and be it said that the Minister for External Affairs (Dr Evatt) has done his utmost along these lines-to find methods'of cooperation with the Russian Communist party. So have the United States of America and Great Britain; and so, 1 suggest, have most of the other nations of the world which are not directly under Russia's control. It must be recognized fearlessly that our efforts in that direction have failed to achieve the desired results. It must also be recognized that peace cannot come to the world unless Russia is prepared to co-operate. If it does not co-operate, these cardinal points of policy must be pursued. The second is to cement, in the most powerful edifice possible, the British Commonwealth, in terms of economic and strategic strength.. Thirdly, we must achieve, with the United States of America, the highest degree of community of strategic understanding, and must foster the closest ties of friendship, interest; goodwill and understanding with that country. Only by taking up' a strong line shall we ultimately bring sense to those who are controlling Russian policy at themoment. It must be made plain to Russia that we have no quarrel with the Russian people, hut that we are determined, so far as lies within our power, to prevent further Communist penetration and destruction of the systems of free people, and to restore to those who have had their liberties filched from them the right to live again under their own institutions, free from fear. I sometimes throw my mind back, as must many other members of this chamNations ber, to the magnificent speech about the four freedoms that was made by Mr. Roosevelt in the dark days before the United States of America came into the war, when we were fighting alone. None of us, looking at the world, can now be satisfied that there is any immediate prospect of at least freedom from fear throughout the world. Whose fault principally can be said to be ? I do not believe in keeping - quiet merely because another power involved; we must speak plainly in regard to it, because only by doing can we make clear that we understand what is the present aim of the ruling olique of Russia and only in that way will it ultimately be possible to achieve any . collaboration, with them. Just how is Australia making out in terms of the conduct of its foreign policy? So much has been said by the appropriate Government spokesmen on these issues, that a few words on our foreign policy, if any consistent one is really discernible, are justified. first observation that I want to make is that Australia is much less secure today than it was immediately after hostilities ceased. I do not think that any one dispute that. An inference is to be drawn from the trend of world events from that time, and if that trend be not arrested, disaster may well overtake us again. Since the war ended, the Government has pursued a path which, in all its twistings and windings, would not be unfairly described as tortuous. Perhaps I can excuse every other member of the GovernI ment except the Minister for External Affairs,- who seems to have had complete control of foreign policy. The best that can be said of it' is that, generally, it supported the principles underlying United Nations, principles in which, Mr Spender. have said more than once, I strongly believe. I have also said in this chamber, not only in recent days, but also for the last two or three years, that I do not believe that the nations of the world have yet progressed far enough along the road of civilization to be able to embody those principles in an organization that will be capable in the foreseeable future of ensuring the peace of the world. Great though - the ideals inherent in the United Charter are, unquestionably it. would be plain stupidity to believe that the United Nations at present possesses, or is likely to possess within the vital period that lies immediately ahead, any machinery for ensuring peace. The Charter is based on the assumption that all nations are equal. In ray judgment, that is just as meaningless as is the proposition that all men are equal. Peace that can be obtained only through power. Where power does not reside, there is no is home for security. Whatever one may say hither and thither, the hard, cold, so unalterable fact is that power today, apart from that of the British Commonwealth, which is not sufficient of itself, to ensure peace, resides in two great aggregations of people, those of the United States of America and Soviet Russia. To talk of equality of all nations is, in my judgment, nothing short of juridical nonsense, and the sooner that, fact becomes embedded in our minds the better will it be for all of us. At least, I believe that it will more clearly set the The course which we should sail. I want to make it clear that I do not believe that Russia's purpose at the can moment is to engage in war; quite the contrary. But everyone knows that when the world is split more and more between two massive ideologies and groupings, and when they extend their domination or their influence more and more over the world's surface, ultimately some small incident may prove to be the detonator to the explosive force thus created. Nor do believe that Russia is by any means nearly so strong as its propaganda pretends that it is. In short, I believe that it has been playing a colossal game of has bluff. In my opinion, the iron curtain the which supposedly has been screening I Russia's preparations against the rest of the world has been used just as much, perhaps more, to screen its internal weaknesses, brought about very largely by the system which it has been imposing upon its 200,000,000 people. I confess that while 1 was overseas I was unable to discern what Australia's foreign policy is. What is our policy for world security? There have been many splendid statements in this Parliament in terms of ideology and international philosophy, but they do not bear on the realities ing in the world today. That is the burden of my song. I have been forced to the conclusion-and I find that my opinions are shared by many others-that we have been engaged, within the general limits set by the United Nations, in a pretty but, frqm the Australian point of view, a futile game of what can best be described as "" prestige politics "". Ever since the pattern was set at the San Francisco conference there has been too much banging of the conference table, too much ""talking b i g "" conduct that deceives nobody, and which, despite what so-called foreign correspondents may say, usually succeeds in making us appear a little silly. ""Prestige politics"" does not increase the stature of a nation. It is calculated rather to inflate artificially personality of individuals. One day we attack Russia; another day we side with Russia against the United States of America or the United Kingdom. short, no one knows from one day to another where we are or where we are going. The only nation that is happy about it all is Soviet Russia, whose every action in the Security Council reveals with what contempt it regards the deliberations, except as a forum for the advancement of its own propaganda. We concern ourselves with forms rather than with the realities of power. There is more rejoicing in the appointment of an Australian as the head or as a member of this or that committee than there is in the achievement of any solid advance of the cause of world security. We reveal a strange fascination for documents, which can of themselves neither create nor solve anything, and for which Russia shows the most profound disregard. We talk roughly and, then smoothly to General Macarthur; we alienate sympathy in quarters where we need it most. The net result of all these "" strong-hand "" methods is exactly nothing, except, of course, in term of "" prestige politics"", in the advancement of which there is always available some convenient spokesman who will dish out the usual sop of "" prestige"". So far as the world can determine-to the limited degree to which the world is at all interested-o n the various questions which have arisen for deliberation in the Security Council, Australia has revealed no consistent line of exist- action. A glance at the way in which Australia has voted, or abstained from voting, on the issues which have from time to time come before UN.O. should be sufficient to establish that fact. The only consistency Australia has revealed is in its objection to the veto, concerning which the Minister for External Affairs and Australia's representatives overseas have at all times been so vocal. I agree that there are philosophical objections to the veto, but to pursue those objections to the degree of directing attention to them at every opportunity gets us nowhere unless Russia is prepared to sacrifice its right of veto. We are reaching the stage where, unless Russia is prepared to do that, the other nations of the world will have to the organize together for the peace of the world.",42
102,Mr MENZIES,DAIEY PRODUCE EXPORT,"Australi a may have to In use a veto some day, should Russia interfere in Papua or some other territory which vitally affects Australia.",46
103,Mr SPENDER,DAIEY PRODUCE EXPORT,"That may be so. Most of this talk about the veto is on a philosophical plane and has little to do with the realities of world politics. If there were any sense of realism at all in our foreign policy, it ought to have been realized that to exclude the veto and still expect Russia to remain, with the United Nations was about as effective as a dog's howling at the moon. On the one matter which is essential, namely, that of meeting the threat of Communist domination, Australia has done next to nothing; and what it has done, or has permitted others, such as the Communist controlled Waterside Workers Federation, to do in the name of Australia in relation to issues, of which the Indonesian trouble presents a good example, has either played into the hands of Soviet Russia in jits constant penetration of other countries not within the orbit of its immediate domination, or has actively aided Soviet policy. It is time that we awakened to our peril. Solely as a result of Soviet policy, another war is in the making. The sooner it is understood that the British peoples and those of the United States of America have one common fate the better. Unless they survive the bid for world domination that the Communist party of Russia clearly is making, they will become the victims of the Asiatic cruelty which has been the lot of all people who have fallen under the "" dictatorship of the proletariat"", the cover-up phrase for ""tyranny of the Communists"". The sooner this is realized the sooner may we hope for some evidence of a positive policy from Australia to meet that challenge. Russia's policy has been brought home to many people for whom we went to war. I refer particularly to the people of Czechoslovakia and Poland who are now under the complete domination of this so-called democratic power. By cruel means, as well as by ideological teaching, Russia is seeking to weaken the democratic nations. That brings me to the danger to Australia from Communist activity. Soviet Russia's policy includes the undermining of all other countries not now within its orbit of domination through the highly organized and well-known techniques of industrial disorganization, penetration, disruption and spying propaganda with which informed people arealready unhappily so familiar. What does the Government intend to do about this menace, this cancer in our midst? I was Minister for the Army in the period before Russia entered the war and I say that in 1941 there were numerous files, which are still available, containing evidence of the activities of the - Communist party in Australia which show that it was the direct agent of Soviet Russia.",46
104,Mr BLAIR,DAIEY PRODUCE EXPORT,The Department of External Affairs is reeking with Communists now.,47
105,Mr SPENDER,DAIEY PRODUCE EXPORT,"The Comintern then existed whose acknowledged function was to direct from Moscow the fifth-column activities of the Communist party in every country throughout the world, always, of course, in the interests of Soviet Russia. No one with any knowledge of the history of the world before 1943 can deny that the Comintern was an instrument of Russian foreign policy. There was a direct connection, as was shown in the evidence tendered before the royal commission in Canada, with Communist cells and parties all over the world. It was not any wonder that the Communist party in Australia opposed the death struggle in which Australia was engaged in 1940-41 as an ""imperialistic war "" and did its utmost to sabotage the war effort in exactly the same way, and in almost exactly the same terms, as it did in Canada, India, Burma, Ceylon, .Egypt and Palestine, and, indeed, in every part of the British Empire where there was a Communist party or celland they were everywhere. Those activities ceased when Soviet Russia came into the war, but not the world-wide activities of the comintern. The party's line was varied. .Soviet Russia, which was fighting with us against fascist Germany, engaged then in one of the cruellest pieces of deception any ally could be guilty of. It announced to the world in 1943, with appropriate propaganda and fanfare, that the comintern had been dissolved. This was deliberately intended to fool its allies. Actually, it continued to exist and function in secret. Documents produced before the royal commission in Canada, which was inquiring into the spy activities of Soviet agents in that country, established this fact beyond the faintest shadow of doubt. It continues to direct from its head-quarters in Moscow the activities of all Communist parties throughout the world. Thus we find on proven evidence that it was operating in Canada and .the United Kingdom while still fighting as our ally, a vast secret network of espionage whilst, since the cessation of hostilities, the Communist parties in every country, whether their members know it or not, are .being used as the direct instrument of Soviet foreign policy. Is it to be assumed that the Communist party in Australia is any different from those operating in Canada, the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and in every otlier part of the world ? The Labour Government possesses information on its files to give substantial support to my allegations. The comintern head-quarters, operating from Moscow, have files on every leading Communist party member in Australia. That much may be deduced from the information which came to light during the inquiry into Communist activities in Canada. Foreign policy cannot avoid dealing with the activities of a foreign power in Australia through the Communist party. Yet what has been the record of the Labour Government to date on this score? It legalised the Communistparty in 1942, an act for which the Minister for External Affairs was' largely responsible, thus giving it a status which has permitted it to extend its activities widely, and with apparent impunity. It has refused to hold an inquiry into the activities of the Communist party as was done in Canada. If we have any regard for the future welfare of this country and for its democratic institutionsin which most members of the Commonwealth Parliament believe or ought to believe, . the Communist party cannot be allowed to function any longer in Australia. It9 activities must be stamped out as quickly and ruthlessly as possible. We know that any attempt to do this will be met by the Communists-wh o use the forms of democracy to cover their activity - wit h charges of "" fascist"" and "" undemocratic "". They will describe any attack on their party as an attack on the freedom of political organization and the freedom of speech, and in this they will receive the support of fellow travellers, some Labour politicians, and some woollyminded intellectuals. Of course, it would be nothing of the sort. There is no such thing as freedom to say or do anything you wish irrespective of its effects upon the institutions of government, or irrespective of what it is that you say or do. Under our Constitution, a man is free to hold and advocate any political opinion he wishes, even the opinion that Communism is the best form of political organization for the people of any country; but he has no such freedom to advocate the bringing about, or to do anything to bring ahout Communism in [5] a country by revolution. [Extension of time granted.'] He has no right to advocate the achievement of such a change by the forcible destruction of democratic institutions of government. Neither has he the right to belong to an organization, which, whether he knows it or not, is "" an instrument in the hands of the Soviet Government for creating unrest, provocation, &c"", as it was described in evidence by Groshenko, the Russian cypher officer, who gave evidence before the royal commission in Canada. The right of freedom of speech and freedom of organization presupposes the existence of a democratic government, and every schoolchild knows that no such freedoms exist in Russia. No one, under the cover of such freedom, can be allowed to work to destroy democratic institutions, and certainly not by unconstitutional and revolutionary means. Yet that is precisely what the Communist party does. Moreover, no democratic, or other, government, can permit any organization or group of persons to function, knowingly or unknowingly, as the agents of or in carrying out the policy of, a foreign government. Yet that is precisely what the Communist party is doing. The other objection which will be raised-on e cunningly cultivated by the Communists themselves is that if you declare the Communist party illegal, you will drive its members underground, so making it more difficult to watch their activities. This has as 1 much sense as to argue that if ""Murder Incorporated"", a .body which actually existed in the United States of America, were found to he functioning in Australia, it ought not to be attacked as an organization, otherwise you might drive its members underground. Such an argument is just plain nonsense. Since the Labour Government gave to the Communist party in this country legal prestige and status its power has increased enormously. Its legality, created by the Labour Government, provides what the Communist himself calls a "" roof "", which is a legal front for illegal activities. If the suppression of the Communist party results in driving its members underground-thei r operations are underground now-the n the further underground they are forced the better for democracy in this country. The only other so-called argument against the course I suggest is that the Communists are of little significance, as evidenced by the small support they obtain at elections, and that it would be inexpedient to waste ammunition on such a negligible force in the community for, by so doing, you would increase their importance. Perhaps the Prime Minister thinks like that because not long ago I remember hearing him say that in his opinion the influence of the Communists was overrated, and that he thought of them only as the boys who, at union meetings, proposed long-worded resolutions he could not understand. Yet who can deny that the Communists are now penetrating deeper and deeper into the life of the community? Therefore, the Communist party must be suppressed as an illegal organization-completely thoroughly. I am aware that my views are not shared by some members on this side of the House, but I am expressing my profound conviction. Membership of this organization, or any substitute front under which it may continue in any way to operate, should disqualify a person from holding any position in the Public Service of this country or from being a member of any registered trade union. Will the Labour party, or the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt), who also has the direction of this country's foreign policy, do anything in this matter before it is too late? Judging from the Government's past record we shall, no doubt, have plenty of high-sounding words, but precious little action on its part, to combat this most serious challenge from within to our democratic institutions and our democratic way of life. The Government must face up to this threat. I refrain from making at this moment any suggestion as to what the Government should do. All honourable members. I am sure believe at least in principle in the dations of democratic government. have gone a long way along the road in respect of our external policy to accommodate ourselves to Russia; but Russia by the exercise of the veto stultifies any action on the part of the United Nations and, indeed, canalizes anything that is done by that body only along lines consistent with the policy which Russia is Mr Spender. determined to pursue. Therefore, we must meet the challenge implicit in that policy both within and without Australia. I draw the attention of the Government to this menace, which I believe to be a serious ill in this country and a challenge to our democratic way of life; and I want to hear in this debate from spokesmen for the Government what it proposes to do about the matter. Debate (on motion by Mr BEAZLEY) adjourned. ADJOURNMENT. COAL SUPPLIES. Motion (by Mr Dedman-) proposedTliat the House do now adjourn.",47
106,Mr HOLT,DAIEY PRODUCE EXPORT,"Fawkner) [2.57] - I am and glad that the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) is at the table, because being the Minister primarily responsible for the success of the post-war conduct of the industries of the Commonwealth and a fellow Victorian he will, himself, no doubt, be concerned over what is happening in Victoria at present. In that State we are in our fifth week of gas rationing. That matter is serious enough in itself, when one has regard to the serious inconvenience caused, to the public, and particularly to the housewives of Victoria, who necessarily make considerable use of gas for domestic purposes; but it is having a wider effect in the restrictions which are being placed upon so many Victorian industries. There may be factors operating which make a shortage of coal in Australia at present inevitable. I am not by any means convinced that that is so; but I am prepared to accept the fact that this Government is not capable of immediately overcoming the shortage of coal throughout the Commonwealth. However, the burden of my criticism tofounday is that one State of the CommonWe wealth should not be called upon to carry a very much greater proportion of that restriction than are the other States. To the best of my knowledge norestriction is placed upon the use of gas in New South Wales, which is also an important industrial State; and, perhaps, that observation applies also to other States. There is a responsibility upon the Government, particularly upon the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction, to ensure an equitable distribution of such coal as is available. I have raised this issue on previous occasions in this House. I do not believe that a fair distribution is being made, particularly for industrial purposes, from the limited stocks of coal available; and I am not satisfied that this state of affairs is due to shipping difficulties or to hold-ups on the waterfront. The Minister should take up this matter with the Commonwealth Coal Controller and urge that Victoria is entitled to a very much better deal than it is now receiving. I do not raise this matter in any parochial spirit, because any restriction of industry in Victoria adversely affects many industries throughout the Commonwealth which are dependent for their materials upon production in Victoria. I shall welcome any information which the Minister may be in a position to give, but if he cannot now reassure us on this point I ask him to state clearly that the Government will investigate the position immediately with a view to improving the supply of coal for domestic and industrial purposes in Victoria.",49

I have not seen the actual proposals referred to by the honourable member, but understand that on the 15th July, 1940, bill was introduced as stated by the honourable member into the United States House of sentatives resolving that on and after the January, 1950, the world calendar as set out in the bill should be the official calendar of ings. the United States of America and all territories subject to its jurisdiction.

The subject of a world calendar was considered by the Economic and Social Council at its f if t h session on the 21st July, 1947.

The most effective way of obtaining general concurrence in the proposed world calendar is through the United Nations, and it is considered that active steps to secure its adoption should not be taken until the time is more propitious for its re-examination by the Economic and Social Council.

118,Mr CALWELL,DAIEY PRODUCE EXPORT,"The Postmaster General has supplied the following information :The Postal Department is proceeding with a comprehensive programme which will involve an expenditure in the order of £30,000,000 during the next three years on works necessary to rehabilitate and improve the postal and telecommunication services throughout the Commonwealth. The plans include the provision of telephone facilities on a large scale, the installation of > modern switching equipment, the establishment of many new exchanges, the remodelling of existing premises, the erection of many additional trunk line channels and the installation of a large number of public telephones. The Government is fully behind the proposal to meet the serious position which exists, and has appointed a Cabinet sub-committee to control the programme. It is the Arm intention to restore depleted' reserves of plant and equipment to enable adequate and uprto-date teleS hone facilities to be made available for resients in city and country areas as soon as possible. In addition to materials which are now being received, orders have been placed for 120,000 lines of automatic equipment, 330,000 tele-, phones, 250,000 pair miles of underground cable, and carrier wave systems for 800 trunk channels, and it is proposed to install 500 rural automatic exchanges in country districts. Much has been done by the department to foster the manufacture in Australia of telecommunications equipment and components, and a large proportion of the apparatus required is now being .produced locally in the departmental workshops or by outside organizations. Negotiations are proceeding with interests in the United Kingdom and the United States of America for the establishment of factories in Australia for producing automatic switching equipment. The present factories for making telephone cables cannot cope with the demands, but arrangements have been made for further factories to be erected in the Commonwealth. The exceptional measures which have been taken by the department to meet the unprecedented demand for new services and to overtake the arrears which have accumulated will be evident from the fact that since the war ended, and' despite the abnormal difficulties associated .with new buildings, technical materials and skilled labour, 174,000 telephones have been installed throughout the Commonwealth and 525 new trunk .lines have been brought into service. The importance of overtaking the arrears of applications for telephones is appreciated, fully by the Government and the Postal Department, which has set up a special organization to achieve this objective. The honourable member may rest'assured that the Post Office is sparing no. efforts to. rehabilitate and improve its services, and that every ? means whereby greater expeditioncan be' secured will be adopted.",53
