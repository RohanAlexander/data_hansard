The first relates to a single father, Arthur, School Certificate in 1996 and completed her at the University of New England in 1997, but due to a lack of finance. At the time Melissa received unemployment benefits of $170 per $20 per fortnight on 1 July 1998 due to Commonwealth's Youth Allowance Scheme. She lodging.

Michael then received stating: You have received youth allowance at a rate of current entitlement was $119.62 per fortnight The result of this was that Michael had incurred to repay this amount which is, in fact, in Centrelink advised him that he was to repay to help recover that amount. I believe this is a totally unfair way of their paltry income each fortnight. If there steal-and unfortunately steal could well come suffer further reductions in income.

Ultimately she took a job that employment and to better herself. That was part she could not; she had to take the nearest thing I think that the important thing to consider dependencies.

Australian Federal Police: Resources (Question No. 194) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister representing the Minister for Justice and Customs, upon notice, on 24 November 1998: Further to the answer to Question No. 2835 (Hansard, 2 June 1998, page 4236), in its submission. to the review ?f resourcing needs of the AustralIan Federal PolIce (AFP) chaired by Mr Tony Ayers, AC, what additional resources did the AFP indicate were needed to properly undertake its duties and responsibilities. Mr Williams-The Minister for Justice and Customs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The AFP did not indicate any specific on-going level of funding. The AFP proposed a program of measures to upgrade its operational effectiveness. These focused on: and workplace relations reforms; - meeting emerging AFP Adjustment Scheme liabilities; - increased staff training; - upgrading essential facilities and equipment; and - cash injections to meet outstanding liabilities. The initial estimate of the costs of these measures was $125.893 million, but this was subsequently revised to $118 million when the firm costs for certain measures were confirmed. The AFP also sought redemption of borrowings of $15.219 million. Mr Ayers estimated that the AFP could be expected to contribute an estimated $50 million with the implementation of the reform program. Australian Federal Police: Recommendations (Question No. 195) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister representing the Minister for Justice and Customs, upon notice, on 24 November 1998: Further to the answer to Question No. 2835 (Hansard, 2 June 1998, page 4236), has he received the report of Mr Tony Ayers, AC; if so what (a) were the major recommendations of that report and (b) is the Government's response. Mr WiIIiams-The Minister for Justice and Customs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The Government received the report of Mr Ayers. The major recommendation of Mr Ayers' report was the implementation of a program of measures to enhance operational effectiveness along the lines of the proposals made by the AFP. However, Mr Ayers did not recommend redemption of borrowings. The net additional funding recommended by Mr Ayers to implement the program of measures was $75.1 million. This recommendation was based on savings of $50 million over three years being achievable with the implementation of the program. With updated costing, the $75.1 million became $68.244 million. The Government approved additional funding of $65.02 million. Details of the program are contained in a statement the Prime Minister and I released on 23 July 1998. Should the honourable member wish to request a copy of this statement it is available from my Office. Wood and Paper Industry Forum (Question No. 396) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, upon notice, on 9 February 1999: (1) On what dates and at what locations has the Wood and Paper Industry Forum met since 1 October 1997. (2) What was the actual expenditure on industry development assistance under the Wood and Paper Industry Strategy in (a) 1996-97 and (b) 1997-98 and what is the estimated allocation for (c) 1998-99 and (d) 1999-2000.

(4) Does his recent decision to convene meetings of stakeholders to develop a Wood and Paper Industry Action Agenda confirm that both the existing Industry Forum and Industry Strategy are not operating effectively; if not, why is it necessary to have two separate bodies and two separate strategies.",199
32,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Wood and Paper Industry Forum has met twice since its establishment was announced on 1 October 1997. The first meeting was held on 30 October 1997 at Parliament House in Canberra. The second meeting was held on 26 February 1998 in Melbourne. (2) Wood and Paper Industry Strategy funding is administered by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry-Australia (AFFA, formerly the Department of Primary Industries and Energy) ' and the Department of Industry, Science and Resources (DISR, formerly the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism). Expenditure and allocations under the W APIS for the years 1996-97 to 1999-2000 are as follows: NA 6.2 .5827 5.977 .9659 NA 5.955 1.191 5.858 0.875 (iii) Sustainability Indicators. DISR is responsible for delivering the industry development initiatives of WAPIS. These initiatives include: Facilitation of Enterprise Improvement through a network of client managers; Grants for Industry Development for projects which: (i) address impediments to industry development, (ii) encourage investment in value adding and downstream processing (iii) encourage increased innovative approach through research and technology access; (iv) improved communication through networking and other measures. (3) Under the WAPIS Farm Forestry Program administered by AFFA 55 projects have been funded with a total value of $17.2 million. The projects relate to: Regional Plantation Committees set up to develop regional strategies for the uptake of tree growing by landholders; Farm Forestry Projects to provide extension services, training, demonstration sites for the purpose of assisting and supporting landholders to integrate tree-growing with other agricultural pursuits; and Research and development to support treegrowing activities, for example, species selection, seed propagation, silviculture techniques, and publications relating to various facets of farm forestry. The W APIS R&D program is managed by the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation on behalf of the Commonwealth. Under this program the Value Added Processing subprogram invests in projects involving proven technologies· that require significant capital funding to assess commercial feasibility at a pilot scale or market development. Projects have included investigating rapid drying of softwood and hardwood sawn timber, understanding collapse during drying of Australian hardwood and identifying, developing and commercialising new feature grade hardwoods. The Plantations and Regrowth Timber subprogram invests in projects that facilitate the development of growing, processing and utilisation technology for plantation and regrowth timbers and cover the full range of high priority issues including genetic improvement, productivity, sustainability, improved silvicultural practices, pest and disease control, improved processing and final end-use in high quality furniture products. There is a particular emphasis on eucalypt plantation and regrowth timbers. The Sustainability Indicators subprogram is pursuing research that will assist Australian forest managers report progress in sustainable forest management against the internationally agreed Montreal Process Group Criteria an_d Indicators. Activities under this subprogram aim at providing the industry with the tools which it can use to demonstrate credibility (to the global community) that it is managing its raw material base sustainably. Under WAPIS funding DISR has awarded 21 grants worth $1.41 million to projects that address many different issues affecting industry development. Many of the projects are scheduled to take between 18 months and two years to complete. To date, six of the 21 projects have been concluded. Accordingly, it is not possible to assess the final impact of all the projects funded. DISR has also established a network of client managers to give companies access to consultant-provided enterprise improvement initiatives designed to increase management skills and make firms more competitive. Just on 70 companies around Australia have received financial support towards the cost of employing a consultant to undertake business planning and similar activities. For example: six grants have been awarded to projects seeking to develop new products from resource previously regarded as waste, residue, low quality or only suited for chipping or pulping. The products include charcoal for specialised metallurgical purposes, the production of chemicals previously derived from petroleum sources and ply based flooring; seven projects are specifically designed to help Australian timber based manufacturers access new export markets or compete more effectively in domestic markets. These include the development of a network amongst Central Victorian timber processors to reposition messmate timbers into more lucrative markets, the application of a more environmentally friendly preservative process to capture Japanese markets, the development and enhancement of quality schemes for timber and furniture, an export focused furniture network in Queensland and the production of marketing materials for furniture exports; two projects are specifically directed at improving the skills of timber processing workers. FAFPESC (Forest and Forest Products Employment Skills Company) has received a grant to develop educational and training strategies. The Timber Industry Training Centre at Creswick has used its grant to train a sawing instructor to meet the high level of demand for courses in sawing; more than $775, 000 has already been spent helping company managers to increase their management, business planning and decision making skills through the use of consultants with specialised expertise; eight projects will lead to increased job opportunities in regional areas. One is specifically directed at creating a better climate for investforward ment in Northern New South Wales by changing community attitudes to the forest industry, increasing awareness of investment opportunities and bringing local government together to create more positive policies towards the industry; the client manager network has been particularly effective in delivering enterprise improvement initiatives to rural based companies. The client managers are located in State Government Departments and their salaries are paid from WAPIS; (4) The Wood and Paper Industry Strategy has proved to be a flexible and cost effective way of providing support to an industry undergoing change. With the finalisation of three Regional Forest Agreements and the near completion of others, there is a growing sense of confidence within the industry and increased interest in emerging investment opportunities. This presents an ideal time to look at the way government (at all tiers) and industry might work together to ensure that the forest and wood products sector can respond to these opportunities and realise its full potential.

33,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,AFFA DISR,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) The total allocation under the National Youth Suicide Prevention Strategy for the 1998-99 financial year was $13,407,909. (b) Funding was made available to States and Territories through three programs under the Strategy. There was funding allocated to support a national stocktake of suicide prevention programs, education and training for professionals, rural and regional counselling services. 1998-1999 Funding allocations to States Staterrerritory Stocktake NSW $27,000 Vic $15,000 SA $10,000 Qld $10,000 WA $10,000 NT $7,000 Tas $7,000 ACT $7,000 Total for year $93,000 (2) Funds for the National Stocktake and Education and Training projects were allocated on the basis of progress with grant agreements made in previous years with each State and Territory. Progress payments are made on receipt of reports indicating that milestones with projects have been reached. Funds for the rural youth counselling program were calculated using a formula based on the rural, remote or indigenous youth population of that State or Territory. (3) All funds were negotiated with State and Territory Health Departments. (4) All funds were provided to ACT Department of Health and Community Care. That Department has entered into an agreement with Calvary Hospital to provide education and training in youth suicide prevention. (5) Funding is tied to the receipt of progress reports regarding progress with stocktaking suicide prevention programs in the ACT and delivery of education and training to professionals in the ACT. (6) All funds will be disbursed to the ACT by completion of the National Youth Suicide PrevenThe allocations for each of these programs 199899 for each State and Territory are given in the table below. It should be noted that the amount allocated for 1998-99 depends in part upon uptake of funds in previous years and progress with project activities over the period since 1996-97. The remainder of the funds available under the National Youth Suicide Prevention Strategy for 1998-99 are being used to support a range of national projects and pilot programs. and Territories under the National Youth Suicide Prevention Strategy Education and Rural Training Counselling Total $30,000 $788,000 $845,000 $180,000 $504,000 $699,000 $40,000 $157,000 $207,000 $40,000 $725,000 $775,000 $7,500 $247,000 $264,500 $20,000 $86,000 $113,000 $60,000 $118,000 $185,000 $60,000 Nil $67,000 $437,500 $2,625,000 $3,155,500 tion Strategy on 30 June 1999. ACT Health and Community Care has tendered the education and training program to an outside provider, and this relationship may continue past June 1999. (7) Regarding the national stocktake grants, States and Territories are paid on completion of each stocktake. The stocktake will be evaluated at a national level and a report published by January 2,000. The ACT is expected to submit an evaluation report regarding the education and training project at completion of the project, expected to be June 1999. (8) The ACT has already provided information for the first National Stocktake on youth suicide prevention to the satisfaction of the Commonwealth. A second national stocktake is now occurring. Payment will be made upon completion of the stocktake, submission of the results to the Commonwealth, and acquittal of grant funds. The ACT is required to report on progress with education and training activities in order to receive progress payments. Illegal Workers (Question No. 479) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 9 March 1999: (1) Is it a fact that some employers willingly employ illegal workers to obtain cheap, cash-inhand labour avoiding normal award entitlements induding superannuation; if so, does this action constitute an avoidance of tax responsibilities to the Australian community which disadvantages complying taxpayers induding other employers trying to compete in similar industries. (2) Is the Government committed to locating, prosecuting and deporting persons overstaying their visas or working illegally in Australia. (3) How many employers is his Department prosecuting for knowingly employing illegal labour. (4) What are the maximum penalties for employers convicted of employing illegal labour. (5) How many employers did his Department prosecute for employing illegal labour and with what outcome in each year since 1988. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) It is a fact that some employers willingly employ illegal workers. Whether such employers are trying to avoid Australian taxation, and normal working entitlements is not dear. My department participates in the Inter-agency C.ash Economy working Group which was announced by this Government shortly after it first came into office. This Government is positively committed to ensuring that both employers and employees meet their fair share of the tax burden. The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DIMA), the Australian Taxation Office (A TO) and Centrelink work together to address this issue. (2) The Government has been concemed with the problem of illegal employment for many years. The main current initiatives to address this problem are: visits by Compliance officers of DIMA to premises where it is suspected that foreign nationals are working without permission; data-matching programs with the ATO and the Health Insurance Commission to help identify and locate foreign nationals who may be working or accessing services without authority; and an Employer Awareness Campaign. The Employer Awareness Campaign has been conducted since 1992 and is aimed at encouraging and assisting employers to check the work rights of prospective employees. During the Government's first year of office, locations of overstayers or people breaching their visa conditions increased by 30%, up from 7,800 in 1995-96 to 10,138 in 1996-97. - locations of illegal workers and overstayers jumped again in 1997-98 to a total of 12,679. In the current fiscal year to 28 February 1999, 8,589 overstayers have been located, an increase of 8.7% over the same period in 1997-98 In recent media releases, I have reiterated the Government's determination to continue to crack down on overstayers and people working in breach of their visa conditions. (3) There are no employers being prosecuted by my Department for knowingly employing illegal labour. In all matters of legal action, my Department is advised by the Director of Public Prosecutions. I recently announced a review of ways to ensure that employers do not hire illegal workers and that people visiting Australia do not work illegally. Appropriate measures to deal with employers who breach immigration law will be put in place when all aspects of the proposals have been fully assessed. (4) The maximum penalty that may be imposed on an employer who is convicted of having knowingly employed unlawful non-citizens or visitors working in breach of their visa conditions is $10,000. (5) Since 1988 one employer has been convicted on 2 counts of being knowingly concerned in visitors working without permission and 2 counts of misleading DIMA officers. This was in 1993. He was placed on a $1,000 bond to be of good behaviour for 2 years. Com car: Superannuation Payments (Question No. 487) . Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister representing the Special Minister of State, upon notice, on 10 March 1999: Were arrangements made when developing the existing Comcar drivers' industrial agreement for improved superannuation payments induding backdating of improved benefits; if so, have payments been made to the drivers in accordance with the arrangements. Mr Fahey-The Special Minister of State has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Arrangements were made for improved superannuation payments to be paid to Comcar drivers by virtue of the fact that superannuation would be paid by drivers based on salary plus a National Flexibility Allowance of, initially, $5,500 per annum. The improved superannuation benefits have - een paid in accordance with the Comcar CertIfied Agreement. The Departn:ent has made all p-y­ ments, in accordance WIth the SuperannuatIOn Guarantee Act. Age Pension Recipients (Question No. 488) Ms Burke asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 10 March 1999: (1) On most recent data, how many age pension recipients reside in the postcode areas of (a) 3128, (b) 3129, (c) 3125 and (d) 3147. (2) On most recent data, how many (a) youth allowance recipients and (b) veterans reside in the electoral division of Chisholm. Mr Truss-The Minister for Family and Community Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) As at 4 December 1998: (a) 1,815; (b) 1,787; (c) 2,141; (d) 1,369. (2) As at 4 December 1998: (a) 1,823; (b) This matter does not come within the responsibility of the Family and Community Services portfolio.",207
