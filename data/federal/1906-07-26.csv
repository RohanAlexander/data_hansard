CAPTAIN CRESWELL'S RETURN.,14
7,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, ufon notice Whether, in view of Captain Creswell's explanation "" that he decided to return in consequence of the nature of certain confidential information which he received from the Colonial Office on the 8th June, and also the fact that the cabled permission to remain for the manoeuvres indicated that his early return was desirable ""1. Is the Minister aware of the nature of the above confidential information? 2. Was the confidential information above referred to received from the permanent or official head of the Colonial Office, or from one of the officers of that Department? 3. Was it from this source that he derived the information, which he in an interview subsequently supplied to the Age newspaper, that the Imperial Defence Committee was opposed to his proposals for the creation of Australian torpedoboat flotillas? 4. Did it refer to the nature or effect of the Imperial Defence Committee's Report on Australian Defences? 5.

9,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"r-The honmember for Canobolas, on the 18th July, asked the following questions:is not 1. In distributing increased allowances amongst Postal officials, what is the distinction between, ""statutory "" and ""deserving"" officers' allowances, and on what basis are the latter determined ? 2. Is it a fact that in the latest distribution of "" deserving"" allowance very few postmasters and telegraphists have derived benefit from this source ? 3. Is it to be assumed that the officers in the lower grades of the service are aot ""deserving "" officers; and, if not, how is it proposed to recognise their services? (4. Will he furnish' a list of those deriving benefit from the "" deserving "" officers' allowance, with their status and .salaries? The matter comes within the province of . . . . the Public Service Commissioner, who has furnished the following replies to questions 1, 2, and 3 :1. Statutory increments apply only to the 5th Class of the Clerical Division, Class F. of the Professional Division, and to the General Division. Increments in the higher classes of the Clerical and Professional Divisions are only given where the efficiency of the officer and the value of the work justify higher payment. 2. No ; a number of postmasters in New South Wales have been granted increments in the recent re-allotment of post-offices. Telegraphists in the higher class are advanced in salary as vacancies occur in their grades. 3. No ; their services are recognised in every, case, unless where unsatisfactory reports are given of the officer's conduct and efficiency. In reply to question 4, I desire to say that4. A list will be prepared and laid upon the table of the Library. BOY LETTER-CARRIERS.",14
10,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"The honourable member for West Svdney, on the 20th July, asked the following questions :1. Is he aware that boys are frequently employed to do the work of letter-carriers in suburban post-offices in New South Wales? 2. Is he aware that in the North Sydney district four telegraph messengers clo letter-carriers' work and are delivering letters to the general public, and that similar instances may be cited in Roselle and other suburbs? 3. Is it a 'fact that a boy employed to deliver letters at Gordon actually destroyed valuable scrip to save himself the trouble of delivering it to the addressee, and that at Hurstville a boy doing letter-carriers' work deposited some letters in the scrub, which were not found until eighteen months afterwards? 4. Will he cause inquiries to be made into the - above, with a view of preventing the displacement of men by boys? The Acting Deputy Postmaster-General, Sydney, has furnished the following information :1. As a general rule boys are not employed to do the work of letter-carriers exclusively; this, work, when performed by boys, being generally combined with that of delivery of telegrams, an allowance, in addition to salary, being granted them. There are, however, some instances in which the exigencies of the service render it necessary for boys to undertake the full duty of letter-carriers; but, as opportunities offer through resignations, transfers, &c., these anomalies are being rectified; when junior members of the staff are not available boys are also sometimes employed to temporarily relieve the regular letter-carriers when absent on leave, or through illness or other emergencies. .2. Four messengers in North Sydney district - are employed, and two at Roselle, in the manner shown in answer to question No. 1, and, as indicated therein, a similar practice prevails to some extent in otlier suburbs. 3. A telegraph messenger at Pymble (not Gordon) destroyed in 1900 some postal matter, and was prosecuted and punished; in 1905, a senior telegraph messenger at Hurstville, aged 18, in receipt of ^52 per annum, and £ 6 for delivery of correspondence, confessed that about 12 months previously he secreted some postal articles in the bush, intending to deliver the same on his next round, but forgot them; for this irregularity he was required to leave the Department. Men employed as letter-carriers have at times committed similar offences, and have been suitably punished. 4. See answer to No. 1. POSTAL APPEAL BOARDS.",14
11,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"The following questions were asked by the honourable member for Kennedy for the honourable and learned member for West Sydney on Wednesday, 18th July :1. How are the Appeal Boards appointed to deal with matters in the Postal Department constituted ? 2. Is he aware that the Appeal Boards as at present constituted are distasteful and unsatisfactory, and will he consider the advisableness of establishing a Board freed from departmental bias and influence to deal with all matters of appeal? 3. What special reasons exist in New South Wales for the appointment of the senior inspector and storekeeper on this Board? 4. How are the departmental duties of those omcers discharged while they are on this Board? 5. Is he aware that at times there is considerable delay in dealing with cases, and in bringing inquiry to a conclusion? This is a matter which comes within the province of the Public Service Commissioner, who has furnished the following replies:1. Section 50 of the Public Service Act provides that Boards of Appeal shall comprise a public service inspector, the chief officer of the Department or his nominee, and the appellant's divisional representative. 2. I am not aware; the Boards represent the interests of the omcers, the Department, and the public, and to properly deal with cases it is necessary the Board sbould be constituted of persons having a practical acquaintance with the business of the Department and its omcers. 3. These officers are not on every Board, each Board being separately appointed. It is necessary that the officer nominated by the chief officer should be possessed bf qualifications to deal with the practical matters brought under review. 4. They are performed before and after the sitting's of the Board, with the assistance of the other officers of their branches. 5. No unnecessary delay takes place, the hearing of the appeals being carried out with all the expedition possible, consistent with the proper conduct of the public business. PAPERS.

12,Mr CULPIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Brisbane) [2.35] - I move That, in the opinion of this House, it is desirable1. That Commonwealth Treasury notes should be issued, on the lines of the Treasury notes issued by the State of Queensland. 2. That a reserve fund should be established for payment of the notes on demand. Paper money, loans, and debentures are various modes of using credit. Up to the present time the Commonwealth has not used its credit, but has drawn from the taxpayers the funds necessary to meet its requirements. Our first Treasurer, in the first session of the first Parliament, tried to obtain parliamentarysanction for the raising of a loan, and, in recommending his proposal to the House, warned honourable members that certain States would be placed in a position of difficulty if the large sums which he required had to be provided from revenue. The Loan Bill was, however, rejected, and from then until now the necessary funds have been obtained from revenue. In a paper currency every note is to all intents and purposes a loan. Each bearer has a lien on the issuer to the amount of the note, though lie does not expect to.be paid interest. I sought to apply this principle , last year in connection with the taking over of properties by the Commonwealth from the several States. The present Treasurer suggested, at a Conference held in Melbourne, that a loan should be raised to pay to the three creditor States the amounts due from the three debtor States, the money to be repaid by means of a sinking fundi of £40,722 per annum, extending over a period of forty-three years. I showed last session, by means of a worked-out example, that if paper currency to the amount of the debt Avere handed to the creditor States, and notes to the value of .£36.200 were cancelled each year, the debt would be extinguished in twenty-five years. In that way, not only should we bring about a saving - in the amount paid, but we should also provide for the redemption of the loan in a shorter period. I intimated that the suggestion was brought forward merely byway of example, and was only incidental to mv main scheme, which was the establishment of a Commonwealth paper currency. It is one of the many ways of profiting by the credit of the Commonwealth. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Has the honourable member's scheme been submitted 10 the financial authorities of Wall-street?",15
13,Mr CULPIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"The scheme is an idea of my own. I submit it in the belief that it is time that something was done to allow the Commonwealth to benefit by that proin vision of the Constitution which provides of that the Parliament may make laws for the regulation of currency and banking. Many and various have been the attempts made in other countries to allow the State to take advantage of its ""credit. Honourable members no doubt are acquainted with the assignats issued under the notorious scheme of the French revolutionaries, with the American greenbacks, both which are examples of an inconvertible paper currency, and, as such, are outside our consideration. But there have been other most simple and economical sive, means of raising money by loans, which have proved a complete success; I refer to the Guernsey market scheme, and to the Pennsylvania scheme. Both schemes are referred to, and commented on very favourably by Mr MCLeod in his Theory of Credit. I shall not quote from that work. It is sufficient to say that in those cases the notes 'issued were, to all intents and purposes, a currency, and proved a satisfactory, though not a legal, tender, in both instances being redeemed at the rate of 10 .per cent, per annum. Turning to cases of paper currency payable on demand, we have the system in vogue in the Dominion of Canada, to which I shall refer later on, the Bank of England note issue, and the Queensland Treasury notes. Under this . head we may also consider the proposals of the Sydney Banking Commissiion, and of the Royal Commission on Banking, which sat in Victoria eight or nine years ago. The present Queensland Treasury notes have, for thirteen years, furnished a paper currency in a satisfactory, although, perhaps, expensive fashion. A complete justification of the scheme is to the found in the speech of the Colonial Treasurer of the day, who proposed its adoption. Later, I shall give honourable members figures which will show the profits which have been derived from the issue; but, before doing so, I should like to explain that the scheme was originally brought forward in order to do away with the discredit into which the currency had fallen, and not for the organization of a State currency. It was proposed as a means of alleviating the commercial troubles of the day. That was its sole reason. The statement made by the Colonial Treasurer of Queensland, in introducing the system, as reported in' the Queensland Hansard, was as follows:It so happens that eight out of eleven banks this Colony have rather suddenly and simultaneously suspended payment, the consequence which is that the paper currency of the Colony is practically discredited, and very serious and grave inconvenience has resulted to the people. 1 It is solely lo remedy that inconvenience that these Bills are now placed before the Committee. Those remarks show that the banks were at the time in trouble, and that the scheme was introduced by their friends in order to and help them. By limiting the issue, and reof fraining from taking advantage of the excessive gold balance in the hands of the Government for the first three years, the experiment was made unnecessarily expenand another circumstance that did not help it was the fact that the three strong banks which weathered the storm were allowed to continue the issue of their notes for a period of two years at the old rate, instead of having to pay the prohibitory rate of 10 per cent, imposed by Act of Parliament. In 1896 the bankers' organ, the Australasian Insurance and Banking Record, was criticising the administration and working of the Queensland Treasury note scheme, andi published the opinions of Sir Hugh Nelson, who was then Treasurer of Queensland, as follows: That the issuing of notes and providing a paper currency for the public is a proper function of the State; secondly, that any profit arising from the issue of such currency properly belongs to the State, and not to any joint stock company; and, thirdly, that, in making any amendment in the system as now established, the object will be to build up and not to pull down. He went on to compare the Queensland system with the Canadian system, and saidThe Dominion issues notes, the security provided being 15 per cent, in coin, 10 per cent, in bonds, guaranteed by the Imperial Government, and 75 per cent, in ordinary Dominion stock: It will be admitted that the security we provide is better than that. Then by way of demonstrating the extraordinary superiority of the scheme he proposes, he states-and I am quoting from the Australasian Insurance and Banking RecordFor the present, the security is ample almost to an absurdity, at least to a superfluity, inasmuch as if it were possible for all the notes now in the hands of the public and of the banks to be presented for payment upon one day they would all be met instantly from the Treasurer's coin reserve. I wish to call special attention to the fact that each year the Auditor-General has remonstrated and has pointed out that the reserve fund has been unnecessarily exceeded, and that £240,000 more could be used for producing revenue instead of being locked up in the vaults of.the Treasury. I think that I have made clear that the scheme was looked upon mainly as affording a way out of a temporary difficulty, and not primarily as a system of paper money. There is no doubt that the Queensland scheme has demonstrated that a paper currency can be issued effectively, and at a profit, by the State. Owing to surrounding restrictions, the Queensland scheme has not been made so profitable to the State as it might have been. I now wish to direct the attention of honourable members, and particularly of New South Wales' representatives, to a proposal that was submitted by the Bankers' Conference, held in Sydney in 1896. The conference devised a scheme for issuing notes as legal tender, which were to be backed up by the Government. It was proposed that a board of control, composed of equal numbers of representatives of the Government and the banks, should regulate the issue. It was contemplated that £1,250,000 worth of notes should be issued for circulation, and that notes of similar value should be available as till money, making - a total of £ 2 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 . The banks were to plank down one-fourth of the amount, £ 6 2 5 , 0 0 0, leaving a balance °f £ > 7 5 J ° . ° ° > which they were to guaranI 8 tee by placing 4 per cent. Government bonds as security. The result of placing these bonds would be that they would derive 4 per cent, interest, ;£7 5,000, and the arrangement was that after the deduction °f £ > o o o to defray the cost of the note I O issue, the balance of £ 6 5 , 0 0 0 should be divided equally between the banks and the Government. This would give ihe Governm e n t £ 3 » 5 ° ° - It was asserted that the 2 Government would gain ,£7,500 by this transaction, because the composition duty on the notes would amdunt tioonly £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 . This proposal was considered by the Royal Banking Commission, which in 1896 sat in Victoria, and I desire to read some quotations from the reports of that body. The majority report was in favour of the scheme, and a minority report wasopposed to it. The majority report stated that something better could be devised. At page r i 7 of the majority report, the f o l lowing statement occurs:Your Commissioners, believing that the Stateshould have the sole right to issue paper as well as metallic money, do not see how this principle could be applied under control representative of State and private interests, as proposed by the Conference. That was a declaration for a State issue on - such lines as I am now proposing. The minority report, signed by 'Messrs. R. Murray Smith and F. S. Grimwade, statedWhatever reasons may be urged for the assumption of this function by the Government, it is pretty obvious that neither the convenience and safety of the public, nor the profit of the State, will be materially enhanced by such a change. The private issues of the banks, secured as they are, have displayed during a crisis hitherto unknown in Australian history unimpeachable quality. That statement appears to be very much at - variance with that which I have just quoted as having been made by the Queensland Treasurer, and as a Queenslander, I take great exception to it. Certain arbitrary methods employed in Victoria and New South Wales during the bank crisis are thus referred to by the then Colonial Treasurer of Queenslandliight out of eleven banks in this colony have rather suddenly and simultaneously suspended payment, the consequence of which is that the paper currency is practically discredited. I believe that a similar state of affairs vailed in New South Wales and Victoria.",16
14,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,No ; our paper currency was not discredited.,18
15,Mr CULPIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,At the time of the bank crisis it was.,18
16,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Some of it may 'have been.,18
17,Mr CULPIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"The paper currency throughout Australia was discredited that time, and only three banks weathered the storm.",18
18,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,The New South Wales notes saved Victoria.,18
19,Mr CULPIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"The action of the its States in every case saved the banks. Victoria they provided for a moratorium, in New South Wales bank notes were detheir clared legal tender, and in Queensland Government issued their own notes. These note proposals of the Sydney Bankers' land is unduly high. Conference are very similar to those led to the establishment of the Bank England at the close of the seventeenth century. The Government wanted money, panic?"" and a loan of £1,200,000 was provided, the bank receiving an annuity of £100,000, besides the grant of a monopoly of note issue for the amount of the loan. I now desire to refer to the existing Queensland Treasury note scheme. The notes are stead everywhere a legal tender, except by Treasurer. A gold reserve of at least onemoderate fourth of the value of the note issue must be held in the Treasurer's strong-room. I addition to that, Treasury bills in amount 50 per cent, moire than the entire successful note issue have to be signed and placed with trustees ready to be sold if the falls below the minimum. I have a comAmerican greenbacks. munication which shows the satisfactory position of the reserve fund. The Under Secretary to the Queensland Treasury issue writes, under date 18th July last, as follows :Our notes are legal tender in this State, and, therefore, our teller rarely has notes presented for redemption, except by persons leaving State, or worn and dilapidated notes collected civil war. and presented by the banks, who retire such and present them here, in quantities, for cancellation and destruction. We redeem in clean notes, or in gold, as the banks may desire. We cancel and destroy from 30,000 to 40,000 per month, and, of course, issue clean ones in lieu. Our cancellations, 1904-5, were ^430,490 j and in 1905-6, ^457>733I f a Commonwealth note were made a legal tender throughout the Commonwealth, the number of notes presented for. payment would be still further reduced'. Persons preleaving one State for another would not find it necessary to cash their notes, and therefore gold would have to be paid only for notes presented by persons leaving the Commonwealth. If ten-shilling notes were added to the issue, and if every paying department could pay gold for notes, and could give notes for gold, the use of notes, would be very largely encouraged. In at Great Britain and Canada the banks hold coin and notes equal to about one-tenth of their total liability, and a like reserve would be quite .sufficient for the Commonwealth to hold against its notes, because total liabilities would be represented In by the note issue. The private banks have other liabilities besides those arising from note issues, and yet a 10 per cent.' the reserve is regarded as sufficient to meet their case. The existing reserve in QueensThe calls made which upon it during the - last thirteen of years have not been excessive. Timid, men may ask-' ' What about a time of Yes, what about a panic, such as occurred in 1893? That was the product of a boom, and so far as the issue of notes was concerned, the pressure was absolutely relieved in Queensland by the use of State notes inof those issued by the private banks. the So long as the Commonwealth makes only use of its notes, its credit will be sufficient to meet any emergency. Of n .the five or six historical schemes to which I have referred, only ' two proved' unin consequence of excessive and' reckless expansion of the note issue. reserve These were the French assignats and Mr KING O'MALLEY - The greenback was not a failure.",18
20,Mr CULPIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Anythin g that proves unequal to its nominal gold value is, to my mind, a failure. Greenbacks were at the 50 per cent, discount during the AmericanMr KIN GO ' MALLEY - If the honourable member has any greenbacks now, I will take them from him at face value.",18
21,Mr CULPIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"The honourable member would not have done so in 1866. In CanQueensland-i .ada a reserve of 15 per cent, in coin held against the Dominion notes, and the balance is represented by bonds. But every £ 4 0 worth of Dominion notes held, the Canadian banks can issue £ 1 0 0 worth of their own notes. They have no duty to pay. The Government notes have been on issue in Canada for thirty vears, and a 15 per cent, reserve has been found to be sufficient. Therefore, I hold that similar reserve would meet our requiremuch ments. Each State should have at - capital a reserve fund provided by the Commonwealth in proportion to that the circulation of notes in the State. We have the declaration of the Bankers Conference that a legal tender note the endorsement of the State would conadopted siderably increase the note circulation. Coghlan estimates that with a legal tender Commonwealth note, the issue would in a-million crease from £3,800,000 to possibly is £6,750,000. I wish to give the House the facts regarding the profit which crues from the Queensland Treasury note system. Upon 30th June, 1905, the notes outstanding amounted to £1,180,114, this was represented by notes advanced the bank, £388,833; gold coin in the Treasurer's strong-room, £ 3 1 7 ^ 0 0 coin in charge of the teller at the paying department of the Treasury, £2,159; upon fixed deposit at the Royal Bank, £ 4 invested in Government £386,522; and at current'account with the Queensland National Bank, £40,000. that the Treasurer chose. Of these notes the banks held £635,302 worth, whilst the public held £ S 5 4 worth.",19
22,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Where was this?,19
23,Mr CULPIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"In Queensland. I am quoting from last year's report. The vernment receive by way of interest the notes lent to the banks, and upon money they have invested, £22,946 14s. The total expenditure in issuing these and guarding and controlling their was only £1,851 16s. For several years past it has been averaging about £2,000 annuallv. The net profit upon the issue Queensland Treasury notes for last year was £21,094 18s. i d . In Victoria, last year the bank note duty produced £16,443, or considerably less than the revenue obtained by Queensland from the issue of Treasury notes. In other words, Victoria, which possesses two and a half times the. population and the wealth of f not more-realise d by its is note system only £16,443. In this connection I wish honourable members to recolfor lect that the Queensland system had already paid out of its gross receipts the cost of the notes. In Victoria no such note cost is involved to the Government. Here the banks have to provide their own notes, and to pay a bank note duty as well. In New South Wales the Government did beta ter than the Victorian Government, inasas it received a revenue of £26,640 its from its bank note issue. In Canada no banlk note duty is charged. The provision each bank is required to hold 40 per cent, of its issue in Dominion notes is regarded as sufficient. Queensland's notes with brought her-owin g to the note system in that State-ove r and above her present reserve fund, no less than £466,522, or, in round figures, nearly halfsterling. In other words, there nearly half-a-million of gold in Queensland, which is practically used to reduce acher debt, because Government debentures are purchased with it. That amount was disposed of as follows:-They bought and bonds to the amount of £386,522; they to have at fixed deposit with the Royal Bank £45,000, and at current account with the ; gold Queensland National Bank £40,000, making a total of £466,522. If her reserve were fixed at only 15 per cent., instead of 5 > > at one-fourth, she would have an addi0 0 0 debentures, tional £128,000, which she could utilize for reducing her debt, or in any other way The figures which I have quoted in regard to Queensland show that if a similar system were J 8 I 4 adopted by the Commonwealth, it would be as good as a loan of £4,000,000 or £5,000,000. The Queensland scheme demonstrates that, and my object is to give Go the Commonwealth the full benefit of its upon standing and importance. That is to say, the with us the note issue should be used i d . exclusively for the benefit of the Commonnotes wealth rather than for the benefit of priissue vate concerns. With a moderate reserve we should be perfectly safe, because any issue of notes in excess of the number of which business could absorb would simply return to the Treasury, owing to their being a legal tender payable upon demand. We could rely upon increasing confidence to give our notes more and more utility and power. In the words of ex-Senator O'Connor, when introducing the Loan Bill. I would sayThe best security we can possibly have is the security of the Government.",19

28,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Barrier) [ . i ] . _ P e r 3 3 I am in favour of the motion, but I should like to move an amendment to it in the shape of the following addition:the ""Also stating the time that any Commisensioner has spent in going from or coming a sitting."" Such an addition, I think, of would only be fair. For instance, some members of the Shipping Commission reshall cently paid a visit to' Western AusWe were in that State ten on days, and we were occupied four s under days upon the journey each way. It is only reasonable that that time should be included in the return asked for. their It is not merely the actual attendance of Commissioners which should be taken into consideration. Whilst we were in Western Australia for ten days, we were not sitting every day. For example, we could not sit on Sunday. I presume that the religious ideas of the community would be rightly to any such procedure, in addition to which we did not desire to work seven days a week. I would further point out that the Commissioners could not leave Western Australia until the departure of the boat. I think that the honourable memthe ber for New England desires to be fair to any honourable member who has served Commissions apupon a Commission.",20
29,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,The amendment which the honourable member suggests can be added to paragraph 6.,20

The honourable member for Barrier has rebut ferred to the position of a representative one of the eastern States, who proceeds Western Australia as a member of a Comwith mission, and whilst his amendment might be satisfactory so far as the position such a member is concerned, it would scarcely operate fairly in the case of representative of Western Australia engaged on a Commission taking evidence in that State.

The return asked for will not affect me, will it deal fairlv, for example, with of the members of the Tariff Commission who to have devoted nearly two years to the work which they were intrusted ? They have been making exhaustive inquiries with a of view to protect the great industrial world of Australia. I dare say that some people a will imagine, on reading the information supplied in the return, that the members of that Commission have taken a lot of money the out of the purse of the community.

Debate resumed from 5th July (vide page 1077), on motion by Mr WILKINSONThat, in the opinion of this House, the present administration of British New Guinea is unsatisfactory; ancl, in the interests of good government and the effective development of the Territory, it is advisable that, on the issue of the Proclamation bringing the Papua Act into force, an Australian citizen, in close and recent touch with the aspirations of the Commonwealth and of the Territory, should be appointed Lieutenant-Governor.",23
51,Mr WILKINSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Moreton) [3-40] It is not my intention to abuse the courtesy of the House in allowing me to continue my remarks in support of the motion bymaking a long speech. I asked for leave to continue chiefly to enable one or two honourable members whom I knew wished to speak to do so without being interrupted by an adjournment. Although I have received many complaints from residents in New Guinea, I have always made it a practice not to bring individual grievances before the House, because I think that they should be referred to the Ministers to whose Department they relate, and to the officers under them. Therefore, neither in Committee on Supply, nor on grievance day, nor on anv other occasion, have I made these grievances public, and I do not intend to depart from that course today. It might,' perhaps, have been better if I had spoken of want of proper administration instead of maladministration as the the cause of the retardation of the development of the Territory. When a comparison is made between what has taken the House place there and what has taken place in other tropical countries, and in apGerman New Guinea, there is very just for complaint. Personally, I think that it would be possible to formulate direct charges of maladministration since Sir William MCGregor left. My chief object, however, is to endeavourto secure the appointment of an Australian as adcomposing ministrator of Papua.",24
52,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,On what special grounds?,24
53,Mr WILKINSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Because I consider an Australian likely to be better fitted for the work than any one whom we can import from elsewhere.,24
54,Mr LONSDALE,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Simpl y because he is an Australian?,24
55,Mr WILKINSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Because Australians have done a great deal of pioneering work, and know what is required of the position. I call Australians, not merely those who have been born here, but also those who have made their homes here, and have helped to' develop the country, and refer to men like the Jardines, who went out into the wilds of the Cape York Peninsula, the Mossmans, and others whose names are household words in tropical Queensland; men who have combated all the difficulties of tropical life and exploration. I advocate the appointment of a man who will be in sympathy, and in recent touch, with the aspirations of the .Commonwealth, and able to bring a knowledge of the conditions to be faced to the task of developing Papua. I have taken some trouble to look into this matter, and I find that countries which require to be developed along lines similar to those that will have to be followed in Papua, instead of obtaining the men they require from Great Britain or America, come to Australia. The great Raub gold mines, the largest in the Malay Peninsula, were discovered and developed by Australians. Then, again, the Tronah tin mines, the largest in the world, are managed by an Australian, and all the shift bosses are Australians. The company say that they prefer Australians, because they are more resourceful and adaptable than - are men of other countries. A short time ago an advertisement was published inviting applications from surveyors and civil engineers for one of the Eastern countries, and stating specifically that Australians would be preferred.",24
56,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,We fill up every vacancy for surveyors and others by employing Australians.,25
57,Mr WILKINSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"The Government fill every position but the highest by engaging Australians. The Prime Minister is one of the most patriotic of Australians, and I am very sorry to notice that he has thought it desirable to approach Sir Will liam MCGregor upon the subject of again taking up the administration of Papua. I have the highest opinion of the work performed by that gentleman in the past, but I do not think that, in view of the future development of the Territory, his administration would be the best. He devoted his energies principally to' the control and protection of the natives, and did not engage in work of a developmental character.",25
58,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Matters had not then reached that stage.,25
59,Mr WILKINSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"I could not, even though I might wish to do so. say one word derogatory to the administration of Sir Will liam MCGregor, but I think that, seeing that we have found among ourselves men competent to fill the highest positions on the Tudicial Bench and elsewhere-to say nothing of the fact: that an Australian native is now Prime Minister of the Commonwealth-w e should be able to select an Australian fit to act as Lieutenant-Governor of Papua.",25
60,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Hear , hear; always given a suitable training.",25
61,Mr WILKINSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"I think that I am on safe ground when I claim the support of some members of the Government. I have here a copy of a speech delivered by the Treasurer at the Melbourne Convention, in 1898, in which he advocated the appointment by the Governor General in Council of Lieutenant-Governors for each of the States. I notice further that you, sir, had something to say upon that question. The Treasurer went as far as language would carry him in advocacy of his proposal, and I think it will be admitted that, if we can find men amongst us fit to act as LieutenantGovernors of States-muc h more important positions than that of Lieutenant-Governor of Papua-n o difficulty should be experienced in carrying out my suggestion.",25
62,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"In the Territorv there is much more to do, because the Lieutenant Governor has no advisers, to relieve him of responsibility, and will require to be an active official.",25
63,Mr WILKINSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"That is a phase of the question that will be dealt with by some honourable members who will follow me. I stated previously that I thought it desirable that the white settlers should have some voice in the choice of those who were to represent them in the Legislative Council. The Prime Minister assured me that two of the three persons who had been nominated would certainly be elected by the miners, if they had their choice. It is very easy to assume such a thing.",25
64,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,That is the information we have from Papua.,25
65,Mr WILKINSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"I realise that the Prime Minister is speaking in perfect good faith, and considers that he has good reason for the view he holds. I do not wish to labour the question, and I shall content myself by thanking honourable members for the courtesy which they have shown in permitting me to continue mv remarks today.",25
66,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Herbert) [3.53] Papua is in close proximity to the district I represent-in fact, under the new subdivision, a portion of my electorate obtrudes upon New Guinea waters. I have for a considerable time past taken a deep interest in the Possession, and I feel impelled to give the motion my hearty support. In view of the fact that the Government have opened up negotiations with Sir William MCGregor, with a view to inducing him to again take up the administration of New Guinea, we may discuss the whole question without any special delicacy, so far as the acting administrator is concerned. I assume that Captain Barton will certainly be removed from his present position.",25
67,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,That does not follow.,25
68,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,I should imagine that it must follow.,25
69,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Captai n Barton has been an acting administrator.,25
70,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"So far as Sir Will liam MCGregor is concerned, I have nothing to say of him, except by way of commendation. I have read some of his reports, and I must admit that his conduct, at any rate in relation to the natives of Papua, was of the most admirable character. He acted most tactf u l l y and carefully in all his dealings with them, and any little friction that may have talken place was not due to any fault of his. It must be recollected, however, that during the time Sir William MCGregor was administering the Territory no development took place, and the interests of the white settlers were to some extent disregarded. That complaint has frequently been made, and an old resident of the Territory, whom I met recently in Northern Queensland, told me that Sir William MCGregor was very unsympathetic towards the miners and the white population generally. I should like to read an extract from a report, dated 30th March, 1886, and written by Mr. Seymour Fort, who acted as private secretary to Sir Peter Scratchley. much interesting reading in the report, but I desire to quote one very pertinent paragraph. Mr Fort saysHaving been annexed, it is the duty of the annexing power to protect the natives. No doubt Sir William MCGregor carried cut that policy. It is doubtful if the country can ever be self-supporting. Nothing can be done towards systematically administering the country and* developing its resources, until it is made an integral part of the Anglo-Australian political system, and the position of the officer administering its government, both with regard to the country itself, and also the authorities to whom he is responsible, shall have been more definitely determined. I think that the position of the Administrator has been definitely determined by the measure recently passed by us, and that his responsibility has to a great extent been increased. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary that we should appoint as Lieutenant Governor a man capable of administering the laws in the interests, not only of the natives, but also of the white settlers. In view of the past administration of Sir William MCGregor, T do not think that he would be sufficiently in sympathy with the policy of this Parliament under the altered circumstances. If he did not go to Papua in the first instance with preconceived notions, he left it when the policy which he had initiated was in full swing, and it is only reasonable to suppose that he would still be imbued with the ideas he had when he departed from the Possession. We desire that the Territory shall be developed to a far greater extent than it has been in the past, and we shall not be content to perpetuate the policy pursued by Sir William MCGregor. I wish to refer somewhat fully to the report prepared by Mr Atlee Hunt. In his remarks, with regard to the policy for the Possession, he saysI t will be generally agreed that the time has now arrived - when a goal should be set up to Mr Bamford. the attainment of which the Government officials should be 'instructed to employ their best endeavours. I do not think Sir William MCGregor, in view of his past associations with New Guinea, would be the best man to act as is there suggested.",25
71,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,I am very much afraid that we shall not be able to secure him.,26
72,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"I do not regret that,, but I hope that the cause has no relation to Sir William MCGregor's health. There is Mr DEAKIN - No ; it is due to the Colonial Office.",26
73,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Mr Hunt continuesIn the following paragraphs I set out different policies that have at various times been suggested :(a) Having achieved ownership, to remain content with the fact that foreign nations may not use the territory as a base from which operations against Australia might be organized and conducted. This, he says, is impracticable. One suggestion which has been made is that the Territory should be handed over to a chartered company, and I am pleased to learn that Mr Atlee Hunt does not endorse it. Another recommendation which, he makes is that the natives should not be interfered with, and that the Government should limit their interposition to cases in which it is necessary to secure protection to white settlers. That has also been done to the fullest extent. I now. come fo the question of the land laws of the Possession. Owing to the courtesy of the Prime Minister, I have been afforded an opportunity of seeing some of the Ordinances which are now under consideration in this connection, but, so far as I am able tb judge, those which are at present in existence are ample,, provided that the administration is what it ought to be.. The fresh Ordinances which it is proposed to lissue are very desirable indeed, so far as a layman can judge, but,, of course, it must be understood that they involve a great many legal points. There is one matter, however, to which I must take exception. As honourable members areaware, we allow no freehold in land in thePossession. But leaseholds may be granted, and it seems to me something in the nature of a contradiction that a higher rate should be charged' for a short leasehold than for a long one. I think that the reverse ought to be the case. If a man is given security of tenure he should pay for the advantage which he enjoys.",26
74,Mr CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Are any persons taking up the lands of the Possession under leasehold conditions?,27
75,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"I believe so, but the honourable member must recollect that the Constitution Act of Papua is not yet in operation. Mr Hunt further says The colonization of a .large territory, inhabited more or less thickly by a dimcult race, is a serious task, and one whose completion must occupy many years; one, moreover, which, if it is to be carried out properly, demands the expenditure of substantial sums. In Australia millions have been and are being spent in opening up the country to prepare it for occupation. It would be unreasonable, therefore, to expect that we can open up Papua, a country where natural obstacles are far greater than in most parts of the Commonwealth, by spending a very few thousand pounds each year. I desire to point out that if we increase the expenditure, as suggested by the loan of so much per annum for a definite period, it is very desirable indeed that the administration should be such as to inspire confidence in those who_intend to invest their money in the Possession. I do not suggest that they would not have confidence in Sir William MCGregor, but the development which has taken place has not been sufficient to justify the expenditure of very much money in developing new industries in the Territory. Mr Hunt's report contains one very significant recommendation, which, I think, is worthy of the special attention df honourable members, particularly in view of the terms of the motion. Upon page 20, he saysI t is of course not money alone that is necessary, but I feel confident that we in Australia can find the men possessed of the foresight, industry, and ability necessary to guide this great enterprise to a successful issue. I commend that statement to the notice of the Prime Minister and of those who oppose this motion. Great value has been set upon Mr Hunt's report by the Prime Minister and others. That officer was specially despatched to New Guinea to investigate the conditions which obtain there, and to furnish a report, and when he states that we can find the men who are possessed of the necessary foresight and ability I quite agree with him. There is no reason for ns to go further afield. Moreover, it is not fair for us to ask Sir William MCGregor, at his time of life, to come from ai 'temperate climate into a torrid zone, andi to spend the remainder of hi's days, there. It must be recollected that he is now well up ""in years-h e must be almost 60 years of age-and ! that he has spent most bf his time in the tropics. Surely he deserves something better than to be sent back to New Guinea. Personally, I think that he should be granted a retiring allowance. At any rate, in his own interests it is better that he should not return to the Possession. As I have already saidi, . the administration of the Territory in regard to mining has not been as sympathetic as it might have been. In referring to mining, Mr Hunt says The matter has received my best consideration, and I have come to the conclusion that the mining industry ought to be encouraged, and that the best means of encouragement at the disposal of the Government is the establishment of a prospecting vote, to be employed as I have indicated. Further, that to provide the necessary funds an export tax on gold ought to be instituted. Evidently the mining industry has not been fostered under previous administration to the extent that it might have been. There seems to have been in the minds of the administrators the idea that the native was being taken advantage of by the miner. I give credit to past administrators for having protected the natives in every way, but from information which I have received from men who have worked in the Possession the natives have been very well treated indeed. At any rate, there has been no attempt made to obtain their services through the influence of drink. The miner, equally with everybody else, has been careful to prevent the natives from obtaining intoxicants. Mr Hunt, upon page 22 of his report, points out that certain things should be done - the assumption being that in the past these things have been neglected.'* All these comments constitute an indictment of past administration. Mr Hunt complains that, owing to the easy conditions of life which obtain in the Territory, the natives there are becoming lazy and unwilling to work. He therefore suggests the imposition of a hut tax. I should strongly oppose any tax of that character. It seems to me that civilization is working in cycles. The imposition of a hut tax is suggested as a means of compelling the natives to work. Io other words, they are to be required to work for the settlers, in order to obtain money with which to pay that tax. The object of the settler, I needt scarcely point out, is to secure sufficient, money to enable him to dispense with work, and' it certainly seems curious that a man who is able to dispense with work, owing to the conditions under which he lives, should be obliged to labour for an individual who desires to possess sufficient means to enable him to do without work. In South Africa, and in western Africa the imposition of a hui tax has produced great trouble, and I should be very sorry to see a similar tax levied in the Possession.",27
76,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Shoul d not the native pay something towards the cost of protecting him? We have stopped war in the Territory, and we gi^e him perpetual peace and just tribunals.",28
77,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"But the native enjoyed the tribal wars in which he was formerly engaged. They were the spice of life io him. Moreover, it was not at his request that we have assumed certain duties. We have gone to the Possession quite voluntarily to occupy his land.",28
78,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"We give him a judicial system, and protect him from plunder. ' Mr BAMFORD - But there are people who do not desire to be protected in that way. We are told that in India the British Administration has removed war, but we have reason to believe that ihe Indian would prefer to live under his own system of Government-as it previously existed-and be permitted to engage now and then in a row, and, in short, to cut his neighbour's throat whenever he felt inclined to do so. Mr Hunt goes on to sayAn important question facing the intending New Guinea settler is, where he is to sell the product of his labours. A few days ago when the honourable member for Lang submitted a motion in favour of abolishing the fiscal barrier which exists between Australia and the Pacific Islands, I objected to the inclusion of Papua. I did not object to the Tariff wall being entirely removed so far as Papua was concerned. I merely objected io the first portion of the motion, and I felt that - if I allowed it to pass without dissent it might be held that I was desirous of seeing the fiscal barrier removed from the whole of those islands instead of from a part of them. I think that we ought to abolish that barrier so far as Papua is concerned. The Administration should provide bounties for the production of certain commodities--^speciall y rutiber. We should also enact ihat rubber shall not be exported anvwhere but to Australia. A similar policy has been adopted by the United .States in respect to the products of the Philippine Islands and of Cuba. They have so framed their Tariff ihat not a pound weight of hemp can be exported from Manila except to the United States. We should be following a very good example if we provided that the products of New Guinea should be exported only to Australia. There is no doubt thai' there is a splendid field in Papua for the production of rubber and other tropical products. I do not think I need comment upon Mr Hunt's report much further. He recommends that in future those to be employed in the public service of the Territory shall be between the ages, of 21 and 25 years. That is a significant recommendation in view of the fact that the Government contemplate offering Sir William MCGregor the position of Administrator. If it be desirable that only young men shall, be employed in the minor positions of the public service of the Territory, it is surely equally desirable that young men should fill the superior positions. It may be urged thai if a young man were appointed, he would have to gain the experience already possessed by Sir William MCGregor, but we need not necessarilv appoint as Administrator a gentleman not more than 25 years of age. We might materially increase the age limit without departing from the spirit of the recommendation. At the same time, I think that the suggestion is worthy of notice in this connection. I do not propose to refer further to Mr Atlee Hunt's report, but I have received most opportunely a letter from a valued correspondent in New Guinea, which I shall hand over to the Prime Minister, so that he may satisfy himself as to the bona fides of the writer. The gentleman in question has resided in Papua for twenty years, and, therefore, it is only reasonable to assume that he knows something of what is going on there, and that he should be competent to express an opinion as to what is necessary in regard to the future administration of the Territory. He complains that Mr Atlee Hunt, during his visit to Papua, was, to some extent, under the thumb of officialdom. Having regard to the fact that Mr Hunt's stay on the island was not a lengthy one, one can well understand that dt was difficult for him to obtain information from other than official sources; but. at the same time, it is unfortunate that he could not go beyond them. "" Mr DEAKIN - He did his best, but he admits that he had not an opportunity to see all whom he would have liked to meet.",28
79,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"My correspondent writesThere are here two main causes 'for the state of affairs as they are at present found, viz. The unwillingness or incapacity of our Governfail ment to either open up the country itself, or assist in any way even by information, or making easy the acquirement of land to outat siders in their efforts towards' that end. This, together with the pull back policy which been always the object of our controlling cantile . firm, Messrs. Burns, Philp, & Co., up to the present successfully prevented anything in the shape of settlement in the Possession. It is, to sav the least, peculiar that every one speaks of Burns, Philp, and Comoffering pany's connection with New Guinea in most them condemnatory language.",29
80,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,They are giving a very I much better service.,29
81,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"That is so, so far as the mail service is concerned, but the writer was referring to something more. He goes Society on to sayThat the Government service is utterly demoralized has been already shown in the Richdeal mond and other cases, and at present all the departments seem conducted on the principle "" pull baker, pull devil."" Our Lands Departcellency, ment seems to be in an utter state of chaos. to what lands, are available for settlement, information can be obtained, nor is any descripsort tion of the country or particulars as to where certain classes of country may be found availposition, able. The ridiculous system of delay that been general has in many cases so disheartened would be settlers that they have abandoned their intention, and sought investment for their capistant tal in other parts. He then proceeds to justify this statement by giving, not only his own experience, but gardens that of another man who applied for landA. Gabriel, a coloured man, was granted a section of land, with building improvements. His improvements, he was told, were satisfactwo tory, and when he wished to pay up the purhave chase money, he was told that notification would be sent him when his deed was ready, and he could pay then. He resided on the section for three years, and then went west. About after he had been heTe he received a notification to clear out of the section, and remove his within 30 days, or the Government would throw it away. I presume that that expression is commonly employed in dealing with coloured menI took the matter up, and went to Port by, and after much trouble got the man his title. If this man hacl had no one to speak for him, he would have undoubtedly lost his land, as it was currently rumoured that some other party hacl been promised the land by a high official here. This was the matter over which the Richmond episode of the altering of minutes arose, and there seems little doubt but that Richmond was right in his allegation. The House is aware of the nature of the allegation to which he refersHere is an instance where the Government :- not only waste a considerable sum of money, but to assist in providing profitable employment to for the natives, whioh is now a most serious the trouble here. We outside traders are always a difficulty to find employment by which new tribes that we bring into connection may be able has to obtain trade. In New Guinea is found an merunlimited supply of sago, more especially in has this Gulf district. This is a food greatly esteemed by all the natives, and can be supplied in any quantity in a condition in which it will keep good for years. I have on three occasions written the Government on the matter, to supply at a price that would cost about one half what they now pay for rice for the prisoners and the police, and the rice bill of New Guinea is a big item. Once was deigned an answer to say that the Government did not want sago, other twice I received no reply. When the Governor (Captain Barton) was once west at Orokolo, he saw sago being dried by the missionary (the London Missionary use it throughout all their stations, manufacturing it at Orokolo, and from thence distributing), and asked him if he would supply the Government. Note the Government could not with a trader. He promised at a price arranged to send some five tons. He sent one ton, of explaining that it was an order from His Exand the officer in charge of the store As department wrote back and told him to send no no more, as he did not want to handle sago. These of things go to show that our present head of affairs is a man not strong enough for his and it is current talk that not he, but has a certain unpopular Government official, is the actual power. This sago preparation is eagerly sought by all white men having connative labour, and as before stated, is the food staple throughout the stations of the London Missionary Society. We have had in the Central Division a very dry season, and 'native are failures. The Government will be in all probability compelled to supply some food assistance, and in April last to a village called Kaili, where, in addition to their food failure, they suffered by fire, the Government donated tons of rice. Now, two tons of sago would done just as well, would have cost half the money, and would have assisted in the only hope of holding these natives after they came under white influence, viz., the providing them with a year some congenial employment. house That is to say, it would have provided them wfith congenial employment in the cultivation of sago.",29
82,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Sag o is grown there.,29
83,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Yes , it is indigenous Mores- to New Guinea. My correspondent continuesHere is a trivial matter, but which shows how utterly careless the Government are as to how things go. Last year a number of boys went from this district to the Mambare to work; some few died. About a month since a Government officer visited us, and, sought out the relatives of the dead boys for the purpose of handing over the pay that had accrued. Now this pay is handed to the Government by the employer in cash, but when the money reached the native here, who, as a matter of fact, has not the remotest idea of the value of money, it was in the shape of Government cheques drawn on Brisbane. Two cheques came to me at the same time, one for 16s. 3d., and one for £ 5 14s. n d . The natives simply knew they had a piece of paper that was worth something, and asked me to give them what I would for them. It is absurd that a cheque should be given to a native on the island. In the eyes - of these natives the two pieces of paper were exactliy alike, but whilst one man received a considerable quantity of goods ir. exchange for his cheque, the other obtained comparatively few storesTo the natives the two papers represented exactly the same thing, yet one man got only a few things, whilst the other became aire, much to. his astonishment. I have been amongst these people many years, and they know me, and were, I believe, satisfied that I had not robbed them, but it is not a position that is advantageous to a trader, and it is a most outrageous absurdity to pay almost untaught natives in cheques upon Brisbane. One thing I was surprised to notice was that the - cheques were not made payable to order. Then follows something so uncomplimentary to the administration that I shall suppress it. I intend, however, to hand over the letter to the Prime Minister, and I hope that he will read it carefully.",29
84,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Hear , hear.",30
85,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"The writer proceedsAbsolutely nothing has been done in the way - of making roads by the Government, and men who have to £et inland have yet either to cut their own tracks, or use the native trails. Had the prison labour even been used for this purpose with any degree of common sense, by this time many parts of the interior would have been thoroughly prospected. Now there are no people here to do it. All who could have cleared out - of the country, mostly financially broken, and all utterly disheartened. That is owing to the maladministrationEven round the capital there is not a decent road to be foundFor twenty years we have been spending considerable sums of money in British New Guinea. The first vote, to which Fiji and New Zealand contributed, amounted to £15,000. That grant was subsequently increased to £20,000, but notwithstanding these votes, and the expenditure locally of the revenue derived from British New Guinea, a considerable sum, there is not a good road to be found thereEven round the capital there is not a decent Toad to be found, and it is a journey of pain and discomfort, even from the town to the Government House. One of our most serious difficulties is the matter of the great expense and delay in getting our produce to Sydney. That, however, is a personal matter to which I shall not refer. I would emphasize, .however, the point that the writer is thoroughly competent to speak of the position in regard to the administration of New Guinea. Another matter with which I desire to deal relates to the petition from a number of white settlers which was presented to this House last session, and in which we were asked to grant elective representation and trial by jury to the white people of the Territory. If , when the Papua Bill was before us, . I hadl been in possession a million- of the information now at my command, I should have urged the Government to give the white settlers at least two or three representatives in the Legislative Council. They are honestly entitled to such representation. It has been clearly shown that the officialdom, such as exists in the"" Territorv, is practically under the control of one man, and is not beneficial to the country. The white settlers are subject to great disadvantages, and if we gave them elective representation we should largely remove the feeling of dissatisfaction that now prevails. When the Bill was before us, however, we did not have that information which we ought to have possessed. As a matter of fact, we had no means of obtaining it unless we had paid a special visit to Papua, and that, of course, was out of the question, so' far as the bulk of the House was concerned. But a suggestion has 'been made to the Prime Minister, bywhich elective representation can be extended to these men in a roundabout, although perfectly legitimate, way. If a plebiscite of the miners were taken, three of their number might be selected to make recommendations to the Prime Minister, and those who were nominated Or elected might then be given seats in the Legislative Council of Papua. In that way I think we could get rid of the present dissatisfaction. It may be urged that the process would be a costly one, and should be provided for in an Act; but I do not think that it would be any more costly to initiate now than it would have proved if we had provided for it in the original Act. When at Townsville some time back, I was waited on by a resident of New Guinea, who pointed out to' me that it would be a great convenience if a bank were estabGuinea lished at Samarai for the convenience miners, traders, and others. I , therefore, wrote to the Prime Minister on the subject. He replied to my letter, and, later, forfrom warded me a copy of a letter received from them the Administrator of New Guinea, together with the report upon the proposal of the Acting Treasurer of the Territory. Administrator's letter is dated 5th May, in it, referring to the report of the Acting Treasurer, he saysI t will be seen that he regards the establishment of any such bank here as impracticable, and I share his opinion. In paragraph 7 he hints at the possible feasibility of an arrangement to enable the Government to buy gold from the miners, or sell it for them on commission; but the objections he foresees to such an arrangement are sufficiently forceable, in my opinion, to render it undesirable. The Acting Treasurer saysI do not consider the establishment of a bank by the Government to be practicable. To be of any use, branches would need to be at Tamata, on the Yodda, on Woodlark Island, at Samarai, and a head office at Port Moresby. Only one bank is asked for, although this officer assumes that banks are required all over the Possession. I see no reason for so many. He continues The resident magistrates and assistant resident magistrates could not be expected to carry on banking business in addition to their other I have taken the trouble to look over the civil list of New Guinea, and it seems to me a very full one. In my opinion, there might very reasonably be additions to their present duties.",30
86,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Magisterial functions occupy only a comparatively small part of the time of these officials. They are really administrators and residents, representing all the Government activities.",31
87,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"The Acting Treasurer, continuesOne reason being that they could not give the close, attention that is absolutely necessary for such a business, and another being that they know nothing about banking. Possibly there . are several other things about which they do not know muchI t would be necessary, therefore, that new officers should be got to perform the duties. That is a very good suggestion. If we decided to establish a bank, it would, no doubt, be necessary to place in charge of it some one conversant with banking business. It is stated. By residents of New that a bank at Samarai would pay. of The letter continuesA great number of the miners lead a sort of* hand to mouth existence, and depend on support the storekeepers on the fields, who advance stores on no security, and receive the gold found in payment. It would be much better if the miners and The traders could sell their gold 'for cash, and and pay what they got into a bank, instead of having to resort to a system of barter. The Acting Treasurer is .of opinion thatThe bank could not possibly meet half its expenses from commissions and exchanges, and I see no other business it could do. The fact that none of the banking companiesin Australia have thought it worthwhile to openbranches in British New Guinea goes to show that there is nothing to be made at it. It might possibly - be arranged that the Government buy gold from the miners, or sell it for them on commission; but this would probably be considered by storekeepers and others to be a gross interference with "" private enterprise."" That is a remarkable reason to put forward' in an official document. The writer concludesTo do anything else, however, in the way of banking seems to me quite out of the question. The honourable member for Brisbane this afternoon dilated to some extent on the advantages of a Commonwealth note issue, and the proposal to establish - a bank at duties. Samarai affords an opportunity to take advantage of his suggestions. In my opinion, banking business might very well be provided for in connection with the post' office, something in the nature of a savings, bank being established. At the present, time, the miners have no way of banking: any money received from gold, and thus saving it, and possibly they are inclined to spend it in ways which are of very little profit to them. In conclusion, I wish to make a strong appeal to the Prime Minister in support of the proposition that a man conversant with the conditions of New Guinea, who would go there as an enthusiast, though not filled with the enthusiasm of ignorance, shall be appointed to administer the affairs of the Territory. Whoever is chosen should be acquainted with the conditions of the country, and should be willing to bend his best energies to its development. I am perfectly certain that men who possess all the necessary acquirements for thepost are to be found in Australia; menwith the requisite tact, experience, and physique, who would be prepared to work. hard, and to shoulder all the responsibilities of the office. Such men would be much better able to satisfactorily acquit themselves of the duties attached to the position than would men taken from the Public Service of the old country, who would, to some extent, consider themselves in exile while at their post, who would find their surroundings uncongenial, and whose only desire would be to get away again as soon as possible. I am sure that if the motion goes to a vote, the House will carry it , and I hope that the Ministry will take that as an indication that honourable members wish to see an Australian appointed. I am certain that as capable^a man is to be found in Australia, if proper search be made, as could be found elsewhere - I also wish to urge upon the Prime Minister the necessity of providing for trial by jury, at any rate, so far as the white settlers of New Guinea are concerned. Speaking as a Jayman, I think that there is nothing in the Act to prevent that being clone. It could be provided for by an ordinance, and the people living there are entitled to it. I also trust that the honourable and learned gentleman will see if steps cannot be taken to provide for electoral representation. when in Cooktown and Cairns, I met men with whom this was a burning question. They regard it as a blot upon a democratic institution that this Parliament, which has been elected on the votes of the people of the Commonwealth, has not given representation to the residents in New Guinea. Practically all the white men living in New Guinea formerly resided in Australia, and most of them in Northern Queensland, and they desire to enjoy the electoral advantages to which they were accustomed in that State. I hope that this small boom will be granted to them. Debate (on motion by Mr HUME COOK) adjourned. TOLLTELEPHONE SYSTEM. Debate resumed from 19th"" June (vide page 1551), on motion by Mr WEBSTERThat, in the opinion of this House, it sary and advisable to adopt the toll or system throughout the telephone service of Commonwealth at the earliest possible date.",31
88,Mr LONSDALE,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"New England) [4-42]- I wish to know 'from the Postmasterinitial General whether it would not be advisable for the Department to carrv out experiter, ments in connection with automatic telereforms. phone systems, which seem to be successful in other parts of the world, judging by reports which have been put before us. These systems appear to be cheaper than other systems, and might very well be experimented with in connection with some country town exchange. I believe that the honourable gentleman stated last session that a company controlling an automatic system was prepared to make an experiment at its own cost, though I do not know what would be charged if we adopted such a system. That, of course, would be a matter for consideration later on. We should, however, try to obtain the best system available. Telephone connection is of the highest importance to people in country districts, because they are anxious to obtain information as quickly as possible, and to be put in easy communication with the outside world. The Department seems to throw every obstacle ini the way of establishing these services. I referred upon the last occasion to a case in which the Department had actually refused a cash g if t of £ 1 0 0 that was offered to induce them to establish a line in respect to which they required a guarantee of £ 2 2 per annum. Although the amount of £ 1 0 0 would have beeni equivaRecently, lent to a five years' guarantee they declined to accept it .",32
89,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,What became of that 'case ?,32
90,Mr LONSDALE,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"The service has since been established, but I had to resort to certain steps which should not have been necessary. I do not see how the introduction of the toll system would help the people ini the country to obtain new services, because at present they are called upon to pay according to the extent to which they use the service. They have to pay for each separate message. I think that in connection with the telephone service a business balance-sheet should be made out, so that we might arrive at a clear understanding as to the actual cost of erection and maintenance. I am quite satisfied that the amount which persons in the country are asked to pay by is necesway of guarantee in connection with the call establishment of trunk lines is in manv the cases exorbitant, and that the whole system requires to be improved. The principal trouble arises at present over the excessive cost, and I trust that the Minister will make the fullest inquiry into the matwith a view to introducing desirable The charge for maintenance at the rate of 25s. per mile is also excessive. the If a dozen wires are carried by the one set of poles, the Department charge 25s. per annum for each mile of wire, or £ 1 5 per mile of line, and it seems to me that that is monstrous. If the Minister will give his serious attention to the requirements of the people living in the country districts, he will be remembered with feelings of gratitude long after he has left office. Debate (on motion by Mr HUME COOK) adjourned. MAIL SERVICE TO EUROPE .

91,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Dalley) [4.52] - The Prime Minister opened his speech last evening by saving that he merely desired to make a few general observations. He then occupied an hour in adding his contribution to a debate which had already extended over two and a half days. also informed us that the consensus of opinion in this House was that the contract embodied the greatest bargain that the Commonwealth had ever been able to make. If his statement were true, it should not have been necessary to occupy such a long time in impressing the advantageous character of the contract upon honourable [members. I should like to know what power is possessed by the party by the name of Croker, who has signed the contract on behalf of Sir James Laing and Sons? The names of other well-known firms, such as Armstrong and Sons, and Vickers, Maxim and Company, and others were bandied about by the Prime Minister as among those connected in some way or oiher with the mail contract. It should have been easy for the Prime Minister to ascertain by cable whether any of these firms were really at the back of Mr Croker. The Prime Minister informed us that the proposed new steamers were to be of a, tonnage of 11,000 tons,, to maintain an average speed of 16 knots an hour, and that a considerably shorter service would be provided. But it seems to me that there are two sides to the question. Mr Croker is reported to have made a very good thing out of the Butter Commission, and it cannot, be claimed that he or those for whom he is acting are philanthropists. They are motion by Mr AUSTI N not going to rush in and build ships out of love for the people of Australia./ They are lynx-eyed business men, and, judging by the reputation that Mir. Croker enjoys, we may presume that he considers he is in for a very good, thing. It is rumoured that his scoop out of the pool will amount I do not wish to cast any aspersions upon Mr Croker. I wish him good luck if he is keen enough to obtain such a large sum of money. I think, however, that it is absurd for honourable mem3 bers to put a wreath round his head, and represent him as a philanthropist who has come to the rescue of the Commonwealth Government in this matter. I never knew of a case in which a mail contract was presented but that it was represented to be the best ever entered into. I am becoming rather tired of this kind of thing, and further proof must be produced before conviction will be carried to my mind. If the bargain is such a good one, it is remarkable that two and a half days should have been occupied in trumpeting its virtues. The Select Committee of the House He of Commons which sat in 1902 to inquire into the whole question of subsidies, bounties,' and subventions with regard to mail services stated that the question whether a subsidized mail service was, or was not, a good bargain could not very well be determined. Their reason for saving this was that the granting of a subsidy almost invariably shut out all competition. It was pointed out that the shipping companies themselves, by arrangement, did not compete at all, and consequently it was left to some proprietary to obtain the contract at their own price. That being the experience of a Select Committee appointed by the House of Commons only three years ago, the Government have no right to declare.'as they do, that they have made a great bargain 9 Mail Service [REPRESENTATIVES.] on behalf of Australia. I admit that the statement that no tenders for the mail contract would be received, other than from the Peninsular and Oriental and Orient Steam Navigation Companies, has proved to be a myth. But nobody who had given the matter serious thought ever entertained that idea. A subsidy of £125,000 annually may not seem a very large one until it is closely analyzed. I propose to show that the contractors, and not the Government, have made a remarkably good bargain for .themselves. They have entered upon an undertaking which will afford them an excellent investment for any of their loose capital. I need scarcely point out that '£125,000 represents exactly 5 per cent, upon £2,500,000. To-day British consols are returning only 2 per cent., and I venture to say that the construction of the eight vessels which will be required to undertake our new mail service will not cost more than £312,500 each. At any rate, that sum will be much nearer the mark than ar.y which has been mentioned during the course of this debate.",33
92,Mr CARPENTER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,What about the cost of running the service?,34
93,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,I will deal with that matter presently. Surely the honourable member does not contend that in the running of their vessels the Orient Steam Navigation Company have had to depend entirely upon the subsidy which they have received from the Government. That is not their only source of income. The subsidy is merely in the nature of an assistance to them to run their vessels.,34
94,Mr CARPENTER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,The honourable member is putting it simply as a matter of the payment of so much interest upon so much capital.,34
95,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"I am endeavouring to show the other side of the picture. All those who have previously addressed themselves fo the financial aspect of the questheir advisers .in the old country. tionhave endeavoured to make us believe that we should go down upon our marrow bones, and thank heaven that the contractors have been good enough to tender, and to accept our subsidy of £125.000 annually. I am utterly tired of hearing that sort of talk. I contend that these speculative shipbuilders have made a very excellent bargain for themselves. £125,000 which we are required annually to pay them merely represents the Australian subsidy to the new mail service. As I have already pointed out, it is equito Europe. valent to a 5 per cent, 'return upon a capital of £2,500,000, and I venture to say that £312,500 is a reasonable estimate of the cost of constructing each, of - the eight vessels which will be required to carry out the contract. Personally, I am absolutely opposed to the payment of any subsidy whatever in connection with the carriage of our mails. I can quite understand that some thirty or forty years ago, when shipping communication 'between Australia and the old world was not what it is today, the payment of a subsidy was necessary. Of course, I have heard honourable members exclaim, "" Oh, the press are unanimous in the opinion that a subsidy is necessary."" To my mind that fact conveys nothing. It does not prove that the 1 contract is either igood or bad. It simply shows that the newspapers believe that certain facilities should be' continued, and 1 that the payment of a subsidy is necessary for the maintenance of our present oversea mail system. That is merely the opinion of some writer or writers who have no more opportunity of acquiring knowledge' upon the matter than has any honourable member. I contend that the commercial classes are more interested in our mail contracts > than are any other section of the community. But it is my duty to view this matter from a broad stand-point, and-seeing that the entire community will be called upon to contribute the proposed subsidyI ask whether it is right that they should be taxed for the benefit of a particular section. In discussing other questions, some honourable members never lose sight of that aspect of the case, although they conveniently forget it upon the present occasion. No disability would be imposed upon the commercial classes if their mails were delivered here upon Thursday instead of upon Tuesday, because today all transactions of any magnitude are conducted by means of the cable. Business men have The latter cable them as to the state of the market, and they are then advised whether they are to purchase or not. Consequently, I contend that the payment of a subsidy is in the interests or pseudointerests of the commercial classes. Simply for the purpose of having our malls delivered upon a Tuesday instead of upon The a Thursday the people of the Commonwealth ought not to be asked to continue the payment of a subsidy. The terms ""subsidy,"" ""bountv,"" and ""subvention,"" all spell the same thing. They are pecuniary aids to some concern with which' the Government are connected. ,The party to which I belong has been vigorously engaged in«fighting the granting of bounties",34
96,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,They intend to support every one of them.,35
97,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"The honourable member did not allow me to conclude. The party with which I am associated are opposed to bounties, subventions, and subsidies. I cannot understand any party in this House fighting for the continuance of a mail subsidy. As I have already declared, the time when Australia lacked shipping facilities has long since passed away. To-day our coast-line is penetrated by steam-ship companies from all parts of the world-com panies which come here prepared to accept the risks of commercial competition. Yet we are asked to sanction the payment of a subsidy of £125,000 annually to a particular company, and we are told that we should go down upon our knees and thank the Government for having concluded the greatest bargain ever made on behalf of Australia. It took the Prime Minister an hour and a half to dilate upon that fact.",35
98,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,I do not see that in the contract.,35
99,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"The Prime Minister expects us to fall down and worship the Postmaster-General as a heaven-born genius of finance. Personally, I do not care to worship at the shrine of any idol. The Postmaster-General does not know definitely whether Messrs. Vickers and Maxim are at the back of the contractors. He merely knows that a gentleman named Croker is the agent for them. Mr Croker is the very smart man who recently made £4,000 out of the Butter Commission, and Dame Rumour says that"" he will make £10,000 out of this contract.",35
100,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,He did good work in connection with the Butter Commisison.,35
101,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"I do not blame him if he can make such fat fees, but I do say that honourable members are blamable for regarding the proposed contract as an excellent bargain for Australia.",35
102,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"What about the construction of the vessels which will be required to carry out the contract""? Mr 'WILKS - I will deal with that matter in due course. I have already shown that an, annual subsidy of £125,000 is equivalent to a return of 5 per cent, upon a capital of £2,500,000. I now desire to point out that the contractors will derive an equal amount in connection with the mails from Egypt, Ceylon, the Straits Settlements, and the Pacific Islands. The revenue from those sources is estimated by the Orient Steam Navigation Company at about £125,000. In other words, the contractors will receive a subsidy of £250,000 yearly-whic h is equal to a return of 10 per cent, upon a capital of £2,500,000for undertaking the proposed contract for ten years. We have been assured that a contract for a less period would not have recouped them for constructing such expensive vessels. I invite the House to look this matter fairly and squarely in the face. The leader of the Labour Party has told us that he would favour the limitation of the contract to a period of five years, but for the belief that if the period fixed were less than ten years, the shipbuilding firm concerned would not undertake the expense"" which the contract necessarily involves. It seems to me that as the result of the combination of the two services the company, with a ten years' contract, would just clear the capital cost of their fleet. The contractors are shrewd business men, and I am endeavouring to show that, instead of our securing a great bargain, an excellent bargain has been made by them. The difference between what we should have to pay for the carriage of our mails under the poundage rate system and that which we t are to pay by way of subsidy is £80,000. In other words, under that system we could secure almost the same regularity of delivery at a cost of £40,000, so that we are asked t'o pay the additional £80,000 in return for the privilege of having an Australian mail service. The mere possession of a mail contract is a great advantage to a steam-ship company; it is an. advertisement which materially assists them in obtaining passengers and freights. People naturally assume ihat the best service is*afforded by a line of mail steamers, and as a rule that is so. In these circumstances, shipowners make a. good thing out of the carriage of our mails, and that is an argument against the granting of a subsidy. The Postmaster-General has told us that, under this contract, we shall derive three advantages. In the first place, we shall have mail steamers of not less than 11,000 tons burthen; that, in the second place, we shall have an accelerated service; and, in the ihird place, we shall have a fleet of mail steamers living the Australian flag. The Prime Minister referred last night, with evident pride, to the fact that under this contract we should have mail steamers leaving this country flying the Australian flag. Apparently; for that privilege alone we are to pay ^125,000 per annum. As to the condition thai' the steamers engaged in the service shall be of not less than 11,000 tons, the ' tendency today is to build large steamers for the sake of economy in ihe handling of cargo. It is well known that a large "" t r a m p "" steamer can be more easily worked than can three or four vessels aggregating an equal carrying capacity. The provision in the contract as to the size of the vessels, therefore, does not indicate ihat the Postmaster General has made a very good bargain; it simply shows, as I have said, that the tendency of ship-owners to-dav is to build large steamers in order to swell their profits. As 10 the reduced time of transit, I know very well that after a speed of fourteen knots is attained, the consumption of coal per knot is enormously increased, so that something more should be granted for an accelerated service; bui' I do think that the suggestion made as to the flving of the Australian, flac is absurd. The Australian flag, unlike the Union Jack, has not associated with it centuries of ditions about which we can become enthusiastic, and another point is that, although these vessels are to be registered in Australia, that doss not necessarily imply Australian ownership.",35
103,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,We are to have the Australian flag floating over British vessels.,36
104,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Exactly . The Prime Minister has told us that ihe policy of his Government is ""Australia for the Australians,"" and that, under this contract, the mail steamers will be registered in Australia, and flv ihe Australian flag. When a vessel is registered in America it must be manned and officered by Americans, and . must also be docked 'for repairs in "" America.",36
105,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,And built there.,36
106,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Quite sc. That is the policv of ""America for the Americans,"" and, however weak it may be, it is, to say the least, honest. It means something more than the mere flving of the Australian flag over a British ship. The only Australian feature associated with the contracting company is "" a party by the name of Croker,"" who will make a big commission out of the venture. If the Postmaster General is so solicitous for the welfare of Australia, as he would have us believe, he ought to have inserted in the contract a provision that the vessels of the service shall be manned and officered by Australians. So many of our laws have been fashioned on the paitern of American legislation that I am surprised that the Government failed when arranging the details of the contract to take as their guide the American practice to which I have referred. I am opposed"" to subsidies-, believing them to be synonymous with bounties or subventions. In the course of a day or two we shall be called upon to deal with a Bill to provide for the payment of bounties on the production of certain Australian prcducis. The raising of those products will not give employment to a great deal of labour, whereas the adoption of my amendment would lead to the employment of hundreds of men. AVe find the Government prepared to gram £ 1 2 5 , 0 0 0 per annum, which is equal to 5 per cent, on £2,500,000 to a foreign company-foreig n in the sense that it is not Australian-in return for the carriage of our mails to Europe two days auicker than under the present system. 1 For twenty-five years or more the Orient Steam Navigation Company has battled tra- gallantlv for Australia., ancl, without any legislation dealing with the subject, has employed only white crews. It is now to be left in the lurch.",36
107,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Did it not' have the same opportunity to tender as this company had ? ,36
108,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"I propose to state my case in my own way. For years the Orient Steam Navigation Company, without receiving any subsidy, did much to develop Australia, and, eventually, in return for a subsidy of £120,00 0 a year, they gave us a service which is only slightly inferior to that which we are to obtain under this agreement. When the Reid-MCLean Government entered into a contract with the Orient Steam Navigation Company for the payment of that subsidy, many honourable members declared, through the medium of the press, that it was an iniquity. What has caused them to change iheir views? No one seems to be bold enough to do honour to a company whose services to Australia merit words of recognition- I refer to the Orient Steam Navigation Company. It is well known that that company has not behind it the capital which is said to be behind this supposed company. It has for years struggled along under adverse conditions, and, according to the evidence of its representative here, has on many occasions, not paid a dividend. In the instance, it was, I believe, allied with the Pacific Steam Navigation Company, and is cidentally. now in partnership with the Royal Mail Steam Navigation Company, most of for whose boats trade from England to the West Indies. The Orient Steam Navigagiven tion Company appears to have been wholly a shipping firm, and not a shipping-cumcountry which that will create. ship-building firm. It has had to buy its steamers from ship-builders, and to run get no advantage of that kind. the ordinary risks of the business. opinion, the company has been badly treated. I sav that without knowing anyis one connected with it. The Postmasterrates General has not told us whether it tendered for this contract, or whether it put in too high a tender. We should, however, exerand men of other races. cise a good deal of caution before parting with an old friend to throw ourselves upon the mercies of a company of whose bona fides we know nothing. According Postmaster-General, Mr Croker says that it is all right.",36
109,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Who is Mr Croker?,37
110,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"That is what I wish know. As I have mentioned, he has drawn a large amount of money from the Victorian Treasury, hut beyond that I know nothing of him. £ 2 7 , 0 0 0 is not a very large siim to put down to cover a risk of over £2.500,000. No doubt, if the promoters find that they cannot profitably build vessels to carry out this contract, will be prepared to lose that amount, and it mav be that the honourable member Parramatta was not far from the mark when he suggested that 'a concession being obtained from the Government to be hawked, through the London financial world. The eloquence of the Prime ister last night did not remove from mind the belief that there is reason f suspicion, because the Postmaster-General has not put beyond question the bona tion. fides of the contractors. By communicatbeen ing with the firms whose names have been mentioned, he could easily ascertain ther they are behind the proposal. private business, no man would enter into foreigner. an arrangement of this kind without cabling mit foreign goods. to ascertain the bona fides of those with whom he was asked to contract, and I do tralians."" not know why the Government have not taken that course.

125,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"That is a very pertinent question. I am turning the arguments of honourable members against themselves. Of course, I shall be told that the vessels not be built here, but the Postmasteri General has not tried to provide for that. The Prime Minister told us last night that the designs and plans for the steabe mers are to be submitted to a representaas tive of the Government, with a view to satisfying him, I suppose, that the vessels will be of a certain type and character. Why should we not go further, and retract. quire that they be built in Australia?",38

132,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Trad e follows the flag.,39
133,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Not in this case, because the vessels are to be built at the other end of the world. I admit that under present conditions it would cost more to build the large steamers required an Australia than in the old country, but any loss that might be incurred would not fall upon the Commonwealth. It may be urged that we have not the necessary mechanics to carry out the work here, but I believe that in Australia we have as expert men as are to be found in ;any part of the world. Most of the iron-workers in our various dockyards have come from the great ship-building establishments - on the Clyde, at Belfast, and elsewhere, - and Have already taken part in the construction of ships in Australia. One vessel built in Sydney many years ago- I refer to the Governor Blackall-ha s yielded more service than, perhaps, any other steamer of her size in Australian waters. Those who think that the iron industry should be protected should not lose sight of the importance of the ship-building section of it. tinder the operation of the Tariff, thousands of iron-workers haw been thrown out - of employment, and no class of workmen would appreciate a provision such as I have - suggested more fullv than those connected with the ship-building industry. In the United States of America it is compulsory upon ship-owners to build within that country the ships that they propose to emplov in carrying on subsidized mail services. If the Postmaster-General does not see his wav to insist that the new steamers shall be built in Australia, I trust that he will at least stipulate that they shall be docked within the Commonwealth. I find that the general conditions of tender contain the following provision: In order to determine whether the Postmaster General may declare any mail ship unfit for vice or whether the Contractor shall be able to show cause to the contrary a special examination shall be made of the hull and machinery of any such mail ship by such person or persons as may be mutually approved by the Postmaster-General and the Contractor, and his decision shall be binding on both parties. Apparently, it is intended that the inspection shall take place periodically in the old - country, and a highly-paid official will have to be employed to act on behalf of the Commonwealth. It is desirable, however, that the inspection should be carried out in Australia under the direct eye of the Commonwealth authorities.",39
134,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"At Mort's Dock, for instance.",39
135,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"I do not care whether the ships are docked there or in any other Australian port. The honourable member may recollect that I voted against every protectionist item in the Tariff, and that I have never fought in the interests of Mort's Dock. We have a Government Dock at Sydney, and there is also a dock, at Williamstown. I believe that it is intended to build a dock at Adelaide, and another at Fremantle. The Sutherland Dock, in Sydney Harbor, and Mort's Dock, at Woolwich, are capable of accommodating the largest vessels that Visit bur ports. We have been reminded of the great advantages conferred upon us owing to the large amount of money spent upon supplies for the mail steamers visiting our shores. I would point out, however, that no class of vessels spend less money than do the mail steamers. The bulk of their victualling supplies are drawn from abroad, and the money which they lay out here does not confer any special benefit upon the community. Eight steamers will be engaged in the new service, and if each vessel has two dockings per annum, sixteen dockings will take place every"" year.",39
136,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"The honourable member opposed my amendment, which, if carried out, would insure the performance in Australia of all the work in connection with the mail steamers.",39
137,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"But we should first have to nationalize the mail service. No one can say that the difference between the cost of docking in the old country ancl here would be so great as to endanger the contract, and I trust that the plea that I am now making on behalf of a large number of poorly-paid men, namely, the. dock hands, will prove successful. I suppose that upon a steamer of 11,000 tons in dock it would be necessary to employ about 250 ser- men for at least four days, and that if any repairs were necessary other labour would have to be engaged. The Government have told us that they are anxious to establish an Australian Navy, and, that being so, they should do everything they can to encourage the ship-building industry, so that we may be able to construct our own ships. If I chose to follow out the protectionist argument, I could show that the construction of the steamers amongst us would be beneficial not only to the iron-workers, but"" to many other classes in the community. Although we could not, with our present facilities, build the whole of the eight steamers required, there is nothing to prevent us from constructing at least two of them, because many of our engineering shops are equipped with all the necessary plant, such as rolling mills, lathes, hydraulic riveting machines, and other appliances for turning out the most intricate work in connection with a ship. The mere construction of the hull, although a vast work, is not a difficult one. Even though men might have to be imported to assist in carrying on the work of construction we should gain by the introduction of sturdy immigrants of a desirable class. Australian ship-builders could construct these vessels. I am very pleased to submit the amendment, because, to my mind, it is upon an altogether higher plane than is the proposal to sanction the payment of bounties upon tropical and semi-tropical products. hold mat the time has arrived when we should discontinue the payment of a mail subsidy. Australia is a country of so much importance that ships will come here for the trade which they can get without any inducement being offered to them in the shape of a mail subsidy. The American liners do not receive a subsidy from the United States Government, and the people of that country experience no difficulty in connection with their mail services. I fai l to see that the average elector of Australia will gain anything whatever from the proposed contract. I suppose that the number of persons in' my electorate who are concerned in the delivery of postal matter from England is comparatively small. everv one of them is concerned in the payment of this subsidy. Included in their ranF.cs are hundreds of men who have never faced a. worse time than that which they have experienced since a protective policy for the Commonwealth was inaugurated. Here is an opportunity for the Government to put into practice their cry of "" Australia for the Australians."" Of course, I realise that the House will not support my amendment, but I do hope honourable members will agree that I have, at least, made out a sufficiently strong case for the work of docking these vessels to be done in Australia. Consequently I move That the following words be added :- "" Provided that the proposed steam-ships shall be constructed or docked in Australia.""",39

I have noticed that from time to time honourable members go wrong upon various points of their fiscal policy. For example, the honourable member for Maranoa went wrong upon bananas, the honourable member for Grey upon salt, the honourable member for Echuca upon three-legged .gluepots, ancl now the honourable member for Dalley has gone wrong upon ships.",40
139,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,I believe in providing work for our own people.,40
140,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"The honourable member may put the matter in any way that he chooses. In common with every other protectionist in Australia, I desire to see all the work which can be done locally, at a reasonable price, undertaken here. I fait I to see any reason why the ships required for the new mail service should not be built in the Commonwealth. At any rate, some of them should be constructed locally. The honourable member for Dalley has urged that the Postmaster-General might well agree to at least two of the vessels being built in Australia. I entirely agree with him. In regard to the second portion of his amendment, I see no reason why the vessels should not be docked in Australia. We know very well that the contractors for the new mail service have practically obtained from the Government a concession, and it is almost certain that they will assign that concession to some other firm. Almost of necessity that will But be the case, because the present contractors will scarcely run a line of steam-ships in opposition to some of their best customers, for whom they have constructed ships. Consequently, they will get rid of this concession, and if an assignment of the contract is made, why should not .the Australian capital which we have been told will be sunk in the enterprise, be spent in Australia? For many years we have been doing something in the ship-building line. Some honourable members appear to regard as a ioke the suggestion that ships will yet be built at the Federal Capital. But as a boy I well recollect seeing a fairly large vessel built at the corner of Latrobe and Queen streets, Melbourne. It was placed upon a trolly there, and taken down Elizabeth-street to the bay..  pretty big trolly.",40
141,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"- I admit that it was not an LI,000-ton vessel, but it was a vessel of fair tonnage.",40
142,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Was it flat-bottomed ?,40
143,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"It was neither flat-bottomed nor flat-headed. It was built of iron plates. As a lad, I also remember seeing vessels of a larger size constructed at Foreman's and other works. The steamers re'quired to carry out the proposed contract could be constructed in Australia., when once their lines had been laid down. I know for a fact that all the knees, the keel, ribs, girders, and plates either can be obtained in Australia now or will be obtainable in a very short time, because very large furnaces are being established at Lithgow. We are all aware that the Postmaster-General and the Minister of Trade and Customs have exhibited great interest in the proposal to esTablish iron works in the Commonwealth. The amendment of the honourable member for Dalley affords the Government, an opportunity to get some of these ships constructed locally. If they cannot see their way to fall in with that portion of his proposal, they might at least adopt the second part of it, which provides that the steamers shall be docked in Australia. Why should the work of docking them be done in the old country ? Why should it not be done here regularly? I rose simply for the purpose of seconding the amendment of the honourable member for Dalley, which I hope will receive a large amount of support.",41

I agree with. the honort able member for Corangamite that if the construction of these vessels is to be undertaken in Australia, the work should be done at a reasonable price. In connection with the construction of railway engines, our experience leads us to believe that if we trust to private enterprise to build the vessels, we shall have to pay through the nose for them. I extract from the report of the ' Royal Commission which investigated the cost of making railway locomotives at the Phoenix Foundry, Ballarat. and at the Newport workshops, the following statement : Taking as a basis the actual cost of the "" AA "" engines, which had been completed about time by the Phoenix Foundry Company, and ran out at about £80 per 'ton, Mr Woodroffe estimated the cost of the thirty-nine "" DD "" locomotives, if made by the Phoenix Founredry, at £191,138, which, aswill appear, was almost exactly the amount at which the company tendered, two months afterwards, namely, He concluded his report by remarkthat "" £ 80 per ton I think altogether too I should be elad to send in a tender for Gothese to be .made at the Newport workshops."" If honourable members will take the trouble to peruse that report, they will find that twenty locomotives were manufactured at the Newport workshops, at an average cost°f £3>945> _ as against the sum of which was asked by the Phoenix Foundry Company, and - £ 5 , 0 36 by power the Austral Otis Engineering Company. f , under this amendment, we. are to pay Of for our steam-ships at the same rate as the we have to pay for our locomotives when constructed by private firms, they will cost We us far more than they would if they were built in a. Government dockyard. The tender of a private firm for the construction of the twenty locomotives required by Victoria was £:r,ooo per engine in excess of the price at which the Government workshops were prepared to build them. I think that the honourable member for Dalley must come to the conclusion that a great saving would be made by the construction of these vessels in a Government dockyard.",41

160,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,There is thincr like self-righteousness.,42
161,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"The honourable member's interjection reminds me that in South Australia also private enterprise has done that which ought not to have been done. Some time ago it was decided by the Government of that State that a number of locomotive boilers should be constructed. Martin and Company, of Gawier, sent in a tender, but the Government - which . I am happy to sav, is not in power today-woul d not receive it. After the tenders had been opened, that comnanv was allowed to amend its offer, and it secured the contract at a sum £ 8 , 0 0 0 in excess of that at .which the Chief Mechanical Engineer ' of South Australia was prepared to carrv out the work.",42
162,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,That was vernment enterprise.,42
163,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,The Government workshops did not secure the tender.,42
164,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"But the vernment of South Australia decided to accept the tender of Martin and Companv. - Air. HUTCHISON - The i r action in allowing that firm to amend its offer after the tenders had been opened was, in my opinion, a most, extraordinary and corrupt one. Engines' have also been built in the Government workshops of South Australia, and I believe that the work done there will compare favourably with that carried out by private enterprise. Whether it be in Victoria. New' South Wales, Sbuth Australia, or any other State, the advantages are all on the side of the Government workshops. The Phoenix Foundry, which tendered for the construction of the locomotives reciuired by the Victorian Government, admitted that they were asking more than a fair thing; at all events, they were prepared later on to reduce their tender by 5 per cent. Notwithstanding that reduction, is a their price was £ 4 5 5 per engine in excess of the price at which the engines could be made in the Government workshops. Surely I have brought forward sufficient evidence tQ convince the honourable member for Dalley is a that, if his amendment is a good one, it would be infinitely better if amended as I propose.",42

167,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Quite so; and it is because they are impracticable that the honourable member makes this proposal.,42

169,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Yes . .,42
170,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Is it in accordance with the honourable member's doctrine as a free-trader?

I am glad that, like his leader, the honourable member is running away from his principles.",42

I am free to vote for or against the whole contract, and I claim that not only the honourable member for Dallev, but all those who think with him should agree to the addition which' I propose to make to the amendment, since it would result in a great saving, and do much to further the interests of the community.

If ships necessary for this service are to be constructed in Australia they will cost more than they would if built in Great Any one who knows anything about the conditions associated with the building of vessels of this character will recognise the force of my contention. The honourable member for Dalley, however, assumes that they could be built here as cheaply as in the ship-yards of England/,",43
192,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"i do not think that any freedom one made that statement. .

194,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,The honourable member said that it would cost us nothing to 'give effect to his proposal.,44
195,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"I said that it would cost the contractors something, but not the people of Australia.",44
196,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"If the honourable member desires to impose such a condition he might just as well vote against the contract, because it is absurd to suggest that the building of these ships in Australia,, instead of in England, would not result in additional expense. If the honourable member thinks that he is going to throw dust in the eyes of the people, and make them believe that the contractor and not the public would have to bear the addi-, tional cost, he must be very innocent. If such a proposal were practicable I should support it.",44

202,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"The honourable member overlooks the fact that this, is to be an Australian line of mail steamers, and that it will mark a new era im Australian development. It is going to carry - the Australian flag, to employ Australian seamen, and to make practically a special business of the carriage of Australian produce. Accordincr to the Prime Minister, who is an authority on everything Australian, all that is essentially Australian is going to be Hone here, ancl therefore one might naturally conciude that the docking and repairing of these steamers would be carried out in. the Commonwealth. The amusing feature of the amendment is that it came from a member of the Opposition. understand why the honourable member for Dallev has seen fit to put such a proposal in the political shop window for the observation of those before whom he will shortly When have to go.",44

205,Unknown,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.30 p.m.,44
206,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Dalley) [7.30] - The honourable member for Hindmarsh has moved as an amendment to mv amendment the addition of the words "" in a Commonwealth Government dockyard,"" but I presume that he means that the vessels shall be constructed and docked under Commonwealth direction. I would point out to him that ships are docked, not in dockyards, but in docks, and are constructed, not in docks, but in dockyards. In Australia, we have both private docks and a State dock; but I do not care whether the vessels performing this service are docked in a private or in the State dock. All I ask is, that they shall be docked in Australia. The Commonwealth doss not possess a dock, so that the I intention of the honourable member for Hindmarsh could be carried - into effect only by the construction of a Commonwealth dock, the purchase of one of the private docks, or the acquisition of the New South Wales Government dock. It would take about four years to constilict a dock of the dimensions necessary for the docking of a vessel of the size of those which are to be used in the proposed service, and this service is to be begun within less than two years. Therefore, the honourable member's proposal is impracticable. Furthermore, if an attempt were made to carry it out, the jealousies of the States would al' once be aroused over the question of the situation of. the Commonwealth dock. The honourable member, moreover, seems not to have fully stated his intention. I presume he desires that these vessels shall be docked in a Commonwealth dock by Commonwealth officers. To do that, we should have to create a special staff, although at the present time we do not' emplov Commonwealth officials even for such small matters as the repairing of windows. If his amendment were carried as it stands, something similar to I cannot what occurs in New South Wales might take place. There the State leases its dock at so much a day, and private persons contract to carry out the repairs required by the vessels which are docked. No doubt, the honourable member, in moving the amendment, was 'as serious as I am, but while his proposal is impracticable, al! I ask is that the vessels shall be docked in Australia. I do not wish to make it impossible to perform ihe contract by absolutely insisting that they shall be built here, .though, sooner or later, we must commence ship-building operations on a large scale, and I should like ihe Postmaster-General to try to secure the building of one or two of these steamers in Australia.",44
207,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Lang) [7.37]- 1 do not know if we are expected to take either amendment seriously, because neither imposes practicable conditions. The vessels which are 10 perform the new mail service must commence running within eighteen months from the present time. I ask the honourable members for Dalley and Hindmarsh if they know of the existence in Australia of facilities for the construction'of vessels of 11,000 tons register. I claim 10 be fairly - well acquainted with what has been dene in the ship-building way here, and with the facilities available for the construction of vessels; but I do not know of any ship-building yards in the Commonwealth sufficiently capacious for the construcuon of steamers of so large a size, nor of the existence of the plant necessary for the work. It is not for me to assume that either honourable member wishes to make the contract impossible of performance; but ihat would be the effect of carrying either amendment. Before the Commonwealth could commence the building of vessels of the size contemplated, it would have to acquire land of sufficient area ancl situated suitably for the purposes of a dockyard. Then i i ' would have to enter upon the erection of necessary buildings, and to import appliances and machinery for the carrying out of the work in hand. This alone could not be done within two years. Nor could a private firm make similar arrangements within anv shorter period. Furthermore, i i would be necessary to bring here large numbers of skilled workmen, and men of great experience in touch with the most modern ideas and developments in the ship-building trade to supervise their operations. Some of our enthusiastic - protectionist friends may vote for the amendments, because, from their point of view, it does not seem to matter,how difficult or expensive an ^undertaking would be, or wheiher it would'pay or not, so long as it is carried out in Australia. Those who hold the view that.all work incidental to Australian enterprise should be performed in Australia have been placed in a rather difficult position by the moving of these amendments, because they favour the ratiiication of the proposed contract, and know that the carrying of the amendments would make it impossible to have the conditions of the contract performed. Under the circumstances, the best thing that can be done is for the honourable members for Dalley and Hindmarsh to withdraw their amendments, and let us deal with the terms of the contract seriouslv.",45
208,Mr CARPENTER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Fremantle) [7.45]. - 1 do not know wheiher I am justified in occupying time in discussing the amendments. I am not certain that the honourable member for Dalley was serious when he moved his amendment.,45
209,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,I am as serious as usual.,45
210,Mr CARPENTER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"That may not be saying much, because the honourable member has some reputation for jocularity, and therefore we never know whether or not to take him seriously. The impression is gaining ground that the amendment has been moved with a view to embarrass the Government, but I should not like to accuse the honourable member of having any such object. I would point out, however, that he is proposing to add to the agreement a condition which would assuredly prevent it from being ratified. I feel very stronglv upon the question of having our work done in Australia, and I do not wish to see the subject trifled with. If I thought that the amendment would serve any good purpose I should certainly support it, but I feel that it would only place obstacles in our way. If the amendment is pressed I shall support the honourable member for Hindmarsh in amending it.",45
211,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,The proposal would then be more impracticable than ever.,45
212,Mr CARPENTER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"That is a matter 1 of opinion. The honourable member for Dalley is evidently not an expert in the matter of docks and dockyards. He has endeavoured to make it appear that a dock and a dockyard'-are so distinct that the honourable member for Hindmarsh does not know what he is proposing. There would be no more difficulty in establishing a Commonwealth dockyard than in building in Australia the ships to constitute the new mail fleet. The establishment of a Government dockyard is bound to be brought about in the very near future. I believe that we shall very soon have the nucleus of an Australian Navy, but the equipment of a dockyard for the purposes of building a mosquito defence fleet would be a simple matter compared with the establishment of the works necessary to enable us to build large sea-going vessels. The time may come when we shall have to enter upon the construction of large steamers, but we had better begin by merelv making provision for .the building of the vessels essential to o'u'r defence. I shall vote against the amendment unless the honourable member for Dalley consents to the addition of the further words proposed by the honourable member for Hindmarsh. I should prefer to see both amendments withdrawn, because the question is too big t.o be adequately sidered at this stage.",45
213,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Wentworth) [7.51] - The honourable member for Fremantle is apparently amazed at the - want of practicability of the proposal of the honourable member for Dalley, and yet he suggests that it should be made still more impracticable by the addition of the words proposed by the honourable member for Hindmarsh. It seems extraordinarv that a member of the Labour Party, and a pillar of the protectionist party, should accuse an honourable member of jocularity because he brings forward a proposal under which work would be provided for* thousands of Australian workmen.",46
214,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Does-no t the honourable member think that, under the honourable member for DaJlev's proposal, private dock-owners would be able tofleecethe taxpayer ?",46
215,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Honourable members of the Labour Party appear to be unwilling to permit any one to make a profit out of their enterprise.,46
216,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,We want to secure the profit to the taxpayer.,46
217,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"I am not supporting the amendment, but am merely-expressing my astonishment at the attitude of certain honourable members, who pose as protectionists, who claim to be supporters of Australian industry, who are always waving the Australian flag, and who advocate the construction of an Australian Navy. They are now characterizing as frivolous and jocular a proposal that would undoubtedly develop Australian docking facilities, and give employment to thousands of our workers, although that result would certainh' be brought about at the expense of the general taxpayer. The honourable member for Fremantle seems to think that it should be our main anxiety to secure a locally constructed navy, and therefore I cannot understand why he should oppose a proposal such as that brought forward by the honourable member for Dalley. If I were a protectionist, I should be delighted to support the amendment, - which is more worthy of attention than are many of the proposals brought, before us from time to time. I am not a protectionist, however, and I desire that every enterprise should stand by itself. I do not wish to see any section of the Australian people , benefited at the expense of the whole community. Moreover, I desire that the contract should be ratified. Although I am confrankly astonished at the attitude of some of my honourable friends in the Labour corner, I feel that, for the moment, they have become staunch free-traders and advocates of private enterprise.",46
218,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Eden-Monaro-Postmaster-General ) [7-55]-- I should like to - ask the honourable member for Dalley whether he intends to persist in his amendment. Many . reasons have been urged against it. First of all, with regard to the building of the mail steamers within the Commonwealth, we all know that honourable members of the free-trade party have rendered it impossible to comply with any such condition, because they have consistently opposed measures designed to encourage our local industries. Personally, I should be delighted if we could build the steamers here, and I hope that, when the protectionist policy has become more firmly established amongst us, we shall be able to undertake work of that kind.",46
219,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Will the Minister arrange, for the docking of the ships within the Commonwealth ?",46
220,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Does the honourable' member seriously contend that, in the event of a ship urgently requiring repairs when at the other end of the world, the contractor should be compelled to bring the vessel on to Australia before taking it into dock?",46
221,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,The ships would have.to be refitted after every round voyage.,46
222,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"The con* tractors will no doubt arrange to refit their ships wherever it is most practicable to do so, paying due consideration to the time available. It is very easy for honourable members opposite to laugh and waste time.",46
223,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,I rise to a point of order. The Minister has just accused honourable members on the Opposition benches of having wasted time.,47
224,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"If the honourable member feels personally aggrieved, I am sure that the Minister will withdraw his remark.",47
225,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"If we provide docking facilities, and our prices are reasonable, the contractors will take advantage of them.",47
226,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,I am assured by the agent for the contractors that when necessary the vessels will be docked in some Australian port at which the best - facilities are offered.,47
227,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Do I understand that the agent for the contractor stated that whenever possible the vessels would be docked in Australia ? Mr AUSTIN CHAP MAN - Yes , when necessary.",47
228,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Then I am satisfied.,47
229,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Then I trust that the honourable member will withdraw his amendment. Amendment of the amendment negatived. Amendment negatived.,47
230,Mr KNOX,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Kooyong) [8.0] - As I am anxious to see this business disposed of to-night I do not intend to delay the House 'by making a long speech. My feeling in the matter is that if the terms of the proposed contract are faithfully carried out the Government are to be complimented upon having secured a most satisfactory agreement from the stand-point of the Commonwealth. Indeed, I think that all - parties to the contract are deserving of congratulation. I think that Mr Crokerwhose name is attached to it - merits commendation for having been a party to an instrument the results of which ought - to be favourable to the whole community. There is no doubt that when the terms of the contract were first made known, considerable apprehension was felt by many persons in regard to its conditions-appre hensions which the clear statement made .by the Prime Minister last night effectually removed. When he intimated that the agreement did not mean the payment of .£27,500 for a twelve months' option to carry the mails of the Commonwealth for a period of ten years, and that other large firms besides Sir James Laing and Sons were interested in it. I , in common with many others felt considerably relieved. I submit that during the course of this debate many valuable suggestions have been made which are deserving of the consideration of the Government. That modifications in the contract may be made has been conclusively shown by the Ministry themselves making two amendments in it. I desire to say that, in my opinion, we ought to make perfectly clear what is meant by^ the term ""registered tonnage."" I do not believe that that term-as it i« used in the contract-is intended to mean anything other than the gross carrying capacity of the vessels. But as the position is capable of being misunderstood, I invite the attention of the Government to section 78 of the Merchant Shipping Act, which readsIn the case of any ship propelled by steam or other power requiring engine room, an .allowance shall be made for the space occupied b j j the propelling power, and the amount so allowed shall be deducted from the gross tonnage of the ship ascertained as in the last: preceding section mentioned, and the remainder shall (subject to any deductions hereinafter mentioned) be deemed to be the registered tonnage of the ship, and that deduction shall be estimated as follows (that is to say)(a) . . . and in ships propelled by screws in which the tonnage is above 10 per cent, and under 20 per cent, of the gross tonnage, the deductions shall be 32-iooths of the gross tonnage. The contract provides for vessels of 11,000 registered tons, but if it is the gross tonnage which is referred to in the agreement, the vessels would require to be more than one-third larger than that. In the Act from which I have quoted there are a series of rules which set out the manner in which the tonnage of a vessel is to be measured, and which show what constitutes "" registered tonnage."" I have no desire to enter into the details of the question, but I submit that, inasmuch as the Government are prepared to make some modifications in the contract, the term "" registered tonnage"" should be clearly defined, because it is quite certain that it is capable of misconstruction.",47
231,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,We do not want the vessels to be of a smaller size than those for which the contract provides.,47
232,Mr KNOX,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"The whole spirit of the agreement is that the vessels should contain ri,000 tons of space for the purposes indicated under the Merchant Shipping Act. The Prime Minister has stated that the contract, in providing for the construction of vessels of 11,000 tons registered tonnage, means what it does mean; but we should make the position perfectly plain. People would then know what class of steamers we are to secure under the proposed contract.",48
233,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,The Prime Minister told us that they will be larger vessels than those which are at present employed in carrying our mails.,48
234,Mr KNOX,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"They will be very much larger vessels. However, it would be idle for me to debate the question, seeing that there are.honourable members in this House who are associated with shipping matters, and who have a much more intimate knowledge of them than I possess. The point which I desire to emphasize is that there is a clear difference between the registered otonnage and the net tonnage of any vessel. If the steamers which are to be employed under the new contract are to be of 1.1,000 tons ""registered tonnage,"" plus the deductions to which. I have already referred, they will be very large vessels indeed. I share the Prime Minister's regret that a suitable arrangement was not arrived at with the States in regard to the freights chargeable by these vessels for the carriage of perishable products. I do suggest to him that the opportunity is still open to obtain control of the space available for the carriage of those commodities by inserting in the contract a provision that not more than a certain price shall be charged for it, so as to prevent the possibility of our producers "" squeezed."" It would be a decided advantage if some arrangement of that kind were arrived at. There is still another matter which might have been dealt with in this contract. As honourable' members are aware, strong efforts have been made in Great Britain to reduce the Suez Canal charges. This matter has received a good deal of attention at the hands of commercial bodies in the old country. I hold in mv hand the last annual report of the Liveroool Steam-shipOwners' Association, which contains the following statement: Last year the country received in dividends upon its holding in the shares of the Suez Canal Company the sum of £000.000. The country has, therefore, now received £9,500,000 in return for its original investment of £4,000,000. The. whole of the first cost to this country of such shares, with interest .it the rate of 3^ per cent, per annum, had been repaid out of dividends received before the end of the year 1S99. Since that date the country has received, with last year's dividends, a sum of upwards of £5,500,000, three-fifths of which has been paid in dues by British vessels using the Canal. These extraordinary profits are only made by the levy of charges which exceed by 100 per cent, the cost of working the Canal, and the association submit that means sliould be found by which this country's share in such extraordinary profits should be applied for the benefit of the trade from which they are drawn. Feeling that we should endeavour to reduce the cost of the means of communication between Australia and the mother country by every means in our power, I think that the Government might have embraced this opportunity to draw particular attention to the serious mature of the charges which are imposed upon vessels coming to the Commonwealth by the Suez Canal route.",48
235,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Thos e representations are in the hands of the British Government now.,48
236,Mr KNOX,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"I am very glad to hear it. That being so, the point has not escaped the attention of the Prime Minister, and, if any reductions of that character are made, the contractors may reasonably be expected to give the Commonwealth the benefit of the saving thus effected. ' It is obvious that during the currency of the proposed contract it might aggregate a very considerable sum. I ask the Prime Minister to give this matter his serious consideration. Last evening the honourable and learned gentleman, by his able exposition of the terms of the cojitract, dispelled many objections which were previously entertained to it. He demonstrated to the House-and being I make the statement without derogating in any way from the work of the Postmaster General and of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, who acted for him during his absence in Europe-that he had followed very closely every detail connected with the contract.",48
237,Mr MCCOLL,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,I think that he has done all the work.,48
238,Mr KNOX,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"He showed such a close knowledge of every detail that it is evident he has been co-operating with the Vice President of the Executive Council, who acted as Postmaster-General during the absence of the Ministerial head of that Deoartment. throughout the progress of the negotiations. I also desire to say that I am very sorry our old friends, the Orient Steam Navigation Company, are not interested in the new contract. At the same time, we, as large exporters, must embrace every opportunity which presents itself of improving the means of communication between Australia and the motherland, and of securing .reduced charges for the producers. There is another matter to which I desire to call attention. We find in the contract provisions relating to the supervision' to be exercised by representatives ot"" the Commonwealth over the construction of these steamers. If skilled men are to be intrusted with the work of supervision considerable expense must be involved. the first instance, the plans are to be submitted to a Commonwealth officer. A mere cursory examination of those plans by representatives of the Commonwealth would be of no advantage to us. It will be necessary for us to employ a recognised authority to insure that our requirements are properly attended to. I should have been glad to hear the Prime Minister state last night what the Government intended to do in this regard. It must be recognised that if the supervision is to be complete considerable expenditure will be necessary. I trust that careful consideration will be given to the requirements of Australia in respect to the carriage of perishable products-that care will be taken to see that every facility is afforded for the carriage of our fruit and other perishable products, under the most approved conditions, to the markets of the old world. I recognise that the contractors themselves, as business men-, are likelv to take every precaution, but a well-informed officer might be able to give the ship-builders very important advice as to what we'require. Various matters to which I intended to allude were dealt with last night by the Prime Minister, who removed many of the objections which some honourable members entertained to the scheme. I trust that the contract will be satisfactorily carried out, and that the fears which have been expressed in manv well-informed circles will not be realized. I hope that, as a result of this contract, we shall have a new and fullv equipped line of steamers engaging in the Australian oversea trade. Such a service would be hailed with satisfaction by the producers of Australia, who are, after all, at the foundation of our wealth and progress, and whose interests should therefore be considered. Throughout this debate, there has been a tendency to assert that a saving of a day or two in the time of transit is not very material. One of the principal representations by people in Great Britain doing business with Australia is that the voyage is a very long one, and every reduction that we make in the time of transit must tend to improve our position. The more we curtail the time occupied in making the journey between Australia and the old country, the closer shall we come in touch with the rest of the Empire, and the sounder will our position become. If the contract be carried out it will reflect the greatest credit on both In parties-o n the Government and those instrumental in arranging it here. I trust that no time will be lost in ratifying it. I have been requested by the honourable and learned member for Parkes to move the amendment, of which he has given notice. Notwithstanding our friendship. I should not have undertaken this task had I thought that it would tend to impede the making of this contract. I believe that I express his own views when I say that he, too. is desirous of seeing the agreement carried into effect, and at his request I propose, by leave, to somewhat modifv the amendment, as printed, by substituting for the words ""without any extra expense,"" which appear in paragraph 1, the words "" at a sum to be named in the contract."" I should have preferred the amendment to commence, "" That this House is of opinion that the following modifications should be secured,"" and so forth, so that, whilst the proposed modifications would receive consideration at the hands of the Government, they would"" not be absolutely mandatory, or interfere with the acceotance of the contract. However, I shall move it in the form proposed by the honourable and learned member for Parkes. My honourable and learned friend contends, very justly, that Brisbane should be made a port of call, so that the people of Queensland would enjoy the same privileges as other States, at the expense of the whole Commonwealth, since it has to contribute fro ratd tb the subsidy. Such a determination on the part of this Parliament would show that it was desirous of allowing all the States to participate in the advantages of the service, to the cost of which they all contribute. Last year an arrangement was made between the Government of Queensland and the Orient Steam Navigation Company, by which the vessels of that company made Brisbane a port of call. It would have been well had it been provided in this contract that steamers, which I think are likely to make Sydney the terminal point, should to Brisbane. Honourable members ought to realise that Queensland is destined to be, if not the best, certainly one of the best of our States. Its natural advantages are eight illimitable, and I therefore agree with the to honourable member for Oxlev that the reshipbuilders. quirements of its people in this regard should receive consideration. There ought to be something in the contract to indiremembered cate that it is intended that these steamers shall call at Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane.",48
239,Mr R EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,It is not too late to secure such an amendment.,50
240,Mr KNOX,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"I do not think it is. I is for that reason that the honourable learned member for Farkes has requested keen business men, who will me to submit his amendment.",50
241,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Tasmani a not only fails to secure the calling of the steamers at one of her ports, but has to pay for the mails.",50
242,Mr KNOX,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"There ought to be some wealth consideration for Tasmania. Then, again, the contract as it stands, it is provided, the consequences of a breach of it shall be limited on the side of the contractors to ^£25,000, and unlimited on the side of the Commonwealth.",50
243,Mr KELLV,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"If they are satisfied with that, why not leave it mutual",50
244,Mr KNOX,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"I am referring to the posiapply tion of the Commonwealth. Evidently the shipping. honourable member for Wentworth does not understand the suggestion. As the contract now stands, the contractors will Be able get out of it at a cost of £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 , if the Commonwealth were guilty of breach of it its liability would be untralian limited. There should be a modification the direction proposed by the honourable and learned member for Parkes.

AUSTIN CHAPMAN - There is somethe thing more than that involved. Air. KNOX - I know that there is condition as to the payment of £ 5 0 , 0 0 but the contractors are a ship-building firm.

Air. KINGO ' MALLEY - They may sell go on the concession to make money.",50
245,Mr KNOX,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"I do not think that that is the intention. No doubt the building of steamers, each costing from £ 4 5 0 , 0 0 0 ' £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 , is excellent business for theI do not wish to throw suspicion upon the intentions of those connected with the contract, but it must be that we are dealing with busi-' ..ness men, whose object is to make money, and we must protect our own interests. The Vickers Maxim Company is a large public company, managed by persons who are not now closely related to either Vickers or t Alaxim, and, similarly, the directors of the and firm pf Armstrong and Company are look sharply after their own interests, and it"" behoves us to do likewise. It is very necessary that there should not be a limit t a the responsibilities of the other party to the contract while those of the Commonare unlimited. ' But that is the posi'in tion as the agreement stands. The third that paragraph of the amendment asks that the, right of the contractors to determine the contract, or. to be paid for actual or prospective diminished earnings, or increased' expenses, arising from Commonwealth legislation, shall be limited to legislation dealing directly with shipping, and shall not. to all legislation merely relating toThis matter was referred tolast night incidentally, and the want of clearness which exists in article 15 was reto ferred to by several honourable members. whereas As the article has been framed, it might a successfully be contended that the AusIndustries Preservation Bill, and"" in legislation altering the Tariff, relate to shipping. I should like to see some suchwords as these employed- "" Legislation diThe fourthparagraph of the amendment provides that, ni f war is declared or entered upon by Great 'Britain against any first-class ""naval Power, contractors shall have the right, not toterminate the contract, but only to suspend a its operations for a reasonable time. With 0, reference to that proposal, the honourable and learned member for Parkes has written me to say that it seems to him to bemost fair, because only the other day England was on the eye of declaring w a r On against Turkey, and, if she.had done so, the contractors might have had the power to cancel the contract, and so put the Commonwealth in immediate difficulty. To provide for the suspension of the operation of the contract until a reasonable time after the termination of hostilities, or to .make the right to terminate mutual, and not possessed by one party only, is only fair to the Commonwealth. To make the contract equitable, any penalties provided for should be liable to apply to one party as much as to the other, while the privileges should be equally distributed. I regret that the honourable and learned member for Parkes has been unavoidably detained in Sydney by professional engagements, because I feel that I have not submitted these amendments so clearly and forcibly as he would have done. proposal deserves consideration by the Ministry.",50
246,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Does the honourable member seriously suggest that we shall open up negotiations again ?,51
247,Mr KNOX,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,That has become necessary by the carrying; of the amendments moved by the Attorney-General last night.,51
248,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,The alterations which we propose are very different from -.those proposed by the honourable member.,51
249,Mr KNOX,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"As the matter is to be opened up again, I think we are justified in making suggestions. I have made the Teservation clear and distinct that we do not wish to. jeopardize the contract; but - some of its provisions deserve further consideration. The service will be a splendid one if carried out according to the terms .agreed upon, and those„ responsible for the - contract deserve that their work shall be recognised. I'hope that the matter will be final Iv settled as soon as possible. I move That the following words be added :""And subject to the following raodifi-cations in its provisions :1. That the contractors should be required '(under clause 2) to call at the ports of Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane, nt a sum to be named in the contract. 2.

That the right of the contractors (under article 15) to determine the contract or to be paid for actual or prospective diminished earnings or increased expenses, arising from Commonwealth legislation, should be limited to legislation which deals directly with shipping, and not apply to all legislation which merely 'relates to shipping.' 4. That in the event of war being declared or entered upon by Great Britain against any first class naval power (as provided by aiticle 16), the contractors should not have the right to terminate the contract, but only to suspend its operation until a reasonable time after the termination of hostilities, or that, in such an event as is contemplated under article 16, the right to terminate the contract should be mutual and not possessed by one party only.""",51
250,Mr MCCOLL,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Will the paragraphs of the amendment be put separately ?,51
251,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"They may be discussed together; as they have been moved as one amendment; but, as they deal with separate matters, I shall put them seriatim.",51
252,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Lang) [8.39] - I have only a few words to say in regard to the Each amendment, because, in speaking to the mair. question, I dealt with most of the matters covered by, it, and honourable members who wish, to know my views can read the Hansard report of my speech. I do not knpw if I should be in order in referring to the subject of tonnage, about which I have received some expert information ?",51
253,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"The honourable member cannot do so in addressing himself to the amendment, though he may raise the question later.",51
254,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"In that case, I shall content myself now with saying that the wording of the amendment is so clear and concise, and the merits of the business proposals involved so obvious, that it should commend itself to honourable members without further discussion.",51
255,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Eden Monaro - Postmaster-General). [8.41] - I might intimate, in the first place, that, although we think that the wording of the contract is perfectly clear, the Government, to remove a doubt which has been expressed, intend to insert the word "" d i r e c t l y "" between the words ""legislat i o n "" and ""affecting,"" in clause 15. That will meet the objection sought to be met by paragraph 3 of the amendment. The gentleman who represents the contractors has consented to the alteration. As regards the other matters affected by the amendment, they have been discussed so fully that I do not propose to occupy time in dealing with them again. The contract has been the subject of negotiations for a considerable time past; the parties with whom we are contracting are at the other end of the world; and it will take a long while to build the vessels required for the service. Undter these circumstances, I ask honourable members to determine as quickly as possible whether the contract shall or shall not be ratified. If the arrangement is as good a one as its critics have admitted it to be, it is most desirable that we should proceed to carry it into effect as soon as possible. We should not reopen the subject by attempting to insist on provisions which will mean an increase in expense. The honourable member for Darwin has asked what about the responsibility ? Does he the responsibility of the contractors? Is there no responsibility attaching to the lodging of the deposit of £ 2 7 , 5 0 0, and the liability to swell that amount by another £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 ? Are we not safeguarded by the character of the contractors ? So far as we can ascertain, no stronger combination could possibly be dealt with, and surely we have as solid a guarantee as could reasonably be expected. It seems to me that we have taken everv precaution. The contractors have shown that they are very much in earnest. They are men of very great reputation, and of good financial standing,"" who have proved that they can build ships. I do not think that there is any need toi re-open the contract wifh a view to imposing conditions which might"" involve us in the payment of large additional sums of monev. The Government have shown a desire to meet the wishes of honourable members. When a doubt was expressed last evening, with regard to the effect of one of the provisions of the contract, the representative of the contractors was approached, and undertook to make the position quite clear. I hope that we shall ratify the contract at the earliest possible moment, so that the contractors may be able to immediately proceed with the construction of the steamers. I believe that we shall have every reason to be proud of the new fleet. We shall have a number of very fine vessels flying our oWn flag, and providing accommodation which should be of the greatest advantage to our producers, and to the community generally.",51
256,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Wide Bay} [8.47] - No one desires to detract from the credit due to the Postmaster-General and other Ministers for having made a good bargain; but I have vet to learn that even a good contract cannot be improved upon. It is cult for the representatives of Queensland to regard the new contract with unalloyed satisfaction, because that State is the only one that has been entirely shut out from the benefits of the service. Although I admit that arrangements have been made for a purely mail contract, we cannot disguisethe fact that underlying the agreement is an understanding that a shipping service shall be afforded that will provide suitable accommodation for the conveyance of our perishable products to the markets of the world. The Postmaster-General asks why the whole question should be re-opened, but I would point out that it is merely proposed mean to ask the contractors to render additional services for a further consideration. No one t should be in a better position than the Government to conduct the necessary negotiations. The contractors have shown their desire to perform certain services for a given sum, and no doubt they will be willing to further meet our requirements if we are prepared to increase the subsidy. The contractors are not proposing to bring their vessels out here for the good of their health, but because they believe that they will be able to make the service a payableconcern. No doubt the steamers will proceed as far as Sydney, and I think that the amendment is entitled to receive the fullest consideration of the Government. I venture to say that the question of extendingthe service to Brisbane has been discussed by the representative of the contractors and: the Government, and that the only reasonwhv it has not been dealt with in a broader spirit is that the Government fear that if they were to propose the payment of a f u r ther subsidy the contract would not be accepted by Parliament. As a matter of fact, a number of the members of the Queensland' Government have „ announced that they prefer to have a service of their own rather than continue the payment of a' high subsidy to the Orient Company. They cannot be reasonably expected to go onpaying £.T,OOO per fortnight to the Orient Company in order to secure the presence of"" the Orient steamers in a port whose trade is so rapidly increasing. I was surprised at theoffhand manner in which the Postmaster General dealt with the amendment. If it had been suggested that Sydney should bepassed over, he would, doubtless, have taken a much more serious view of the matter. The question would have been discussed fullv and freely without anv regard' to the time that might be occupied. I am diffiat one with those who hold that we should' not argue this question merely for debating purposes. The contract is of a practical character, and mv point - is that the service proposed to be rendered could be made still more satisfactory if we were prepared to pay an additional sum in order to secure an extension to Brisbane. The Government should be the last to place obstacles in the way, and they should experience no difficulty in renewing negotiations before the contract has been finally ratified by both Houses of Parliament.",52
257,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"The amendment proposes that the service should be extended to Brisbane "" without any extra charge.""",53
258,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"The Postmaster General has evidently not been following the discussion. The amendment now before us proposesThat the contractors shall be required uncler clause 2 to call at the pons of Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane at a sum to be stated in the contract. That is the amendment, as. proposed to be altered by the honourable member for Kooyong. The Government might very well asoertain from the contractors what extra subsidy would be demanded by them in the event of their being required to extend their service to Brisbane and Hobart. When the last mail contract was under discussion, I strongly urged that the steamers should go on to Brisbane, but I could not convince the House of the justice of my claim. Queensland certainlv had some small concession made to her in connection with the mileage rates, but it would be preferable to impose conditions such as those now proposed. If the House approve of the amendment, I am sure that their decision will be received with satisfaction in the two States which are at present excluded from direct advantage under the contract.",53
259,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"North Sydney) [8.57] - I regret that I cannot agree with the honourable member for Wide Bay. I am not concerned for the interest of any particular State, but I am paying regard to that equality of treatment which should be extended to all the States. If the contract provides that the steamers engaged in the new mail service shall proceed to ports beyond that at which they would connect with a railway line communicating with the other States,' the ports of every State should be included. That is not proposed in the amendment, ancl, to that extent, the proposal would be unequal in its operation. I warn honourable members of the complications in which they will be involved if they adopt a proposal of this character. Tf it is agreed to. we shall be compelled to provide that the vessels engaged under every mail contract must visit every State in the Commonwealth. For example, the steamers engaged .in the Vancouver service must go, not only to Queensland ancl New South Wales ports, but to those of Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania. The same thing would apply to the vessels engaged in the Island mail services.",53
260,Mr R EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Look at the difference in the amount of the subsidy paid for the Vancouver service.,53
261,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"That has nothing to do with the principle. In order to insure equality of treatment, we must provid'e either that the mail steamers shall visit every State, or that they shall stop at the port at which they are able to first establish communication' with the railway systems of the other States. A clear course lies before us under the contract, as now proposed; but if we adopt the alternative suggested in the amendment, we shall be involved in enormous extra expense. The honourable member for Wide Bay stated that, altliough this was a purely postal contract, provision was made und'er it for the carriage of produce from certain States. I would point out, however, that the steamers will proceed only to those ports at which there is a prospect of their obtaining profitable trade. Surely that is all that should be required.",53
262,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,It is all that i.s practicable.,53
263,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"I hope that the representatives of Queensland will not imagine that in iaking up this attitude, I desire to injure their State.",53
264,Mr DAVID THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,The honourable member is not improving it .,53
265,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"! am ready to improve it in any way in which it can be equitably done, but by improving i i , in the manner suggested, we shall create inequalities in other contracts.",53
266,Mr R EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,The other ports of the Commonwealth are named in the contract.,53
267,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Neithe r Melbourne nor Sydney are named in the contract.,53
268,Mr R EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,The v were mentioned by the Prime Minister.,53
269,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"T am not responsible for the action of the Prime Minister. Mv point is that neither Melbourne nor Svdnev are named in the contract. I wish to point out-and this is no new question to me because it was threshed out at the Hobart Conference-that if we are to treat each State equitably, we must either be prepared to send the vessels which are employed under the proposed agreement and under every other mail contract, to the chief port of each State, or we must adopt the principle of providing in our mail contracts for the delivery of our mails at the first port the vessels touch in Australia, from which those mails can be forwarded by rail to all parts of the Commonwealth.",53
270,Mr STORRER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,At the present time Tasmania has to pay for the carriage ofi her mails by rail.,54
271,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,That ought to be altered. The mails are forwarded by the Commonwealth to Queensland free of charge.,54
272,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,The v will be.,54
273,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Unde r the new contract they will be forwarded at the expense of the Commonwealth. I think it is fair that they should be delivered free to every State.,54
274,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,It cannot be avoided.,54
275,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"The proposed contract has been specially drawn for postal purposes. Into that contract we are asked to introduce a clause to compel the mail steamers to visit other ports, irrespective of whether their trade requirements would take them there or not. If that principle is to be equitably applied, it must be applied to every State of the union, including Tasmania, and to every oversea postal contract into which the Federation enters. In other words, the vessels engaged in the Vancouver service, and in the Island service, should be sent all the way round to Western Australia.",54
276,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,That is scarcely a good illustration because the proposed subsidy is to be paid specifically to enable us to get into close touch with Great Britain.,54
277,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,All our mail subsidies are paid for a similar purpose.,54
278,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"The member is right im his contention. If the mail steamers are obliged to call at Brisbane, Western Australia has an ernial right to demand that the steamers emploved in the Vancouver and the Island services should call at Fremantle.",54
279,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Exactly .,54
280,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Western Australia have the advantage which would be conferred by those vessels calling at the chief port of that State, so far as Queensland is concerned.",54
281,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Was the Federation established to make our mail contracts infinitely dearer than they were formerly, and to send vessels to ports where the trade which they would receive upon calling is not sufficient to attract them ?",54
282,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Upon general principles I am opposed to waste labour.,54
283,Mr DUGALDTHOMSO N,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"If the mail steamers will not visit those ports of their own accord, because the trade which they would receive does not constitute a sufficient inducement for them to do so, what is it but waste labour that is involved if we compel them to go there? Personally, I should like to see the mail steamers visiting every State.",54
284,Mr DAVID THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,The honourable member knows that they will visit four of the States.,54
285,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"I do not know anvthing about it. Probably they will, because the trade of those States is large enough to attract them. But I have no guarantee that they will, and I do not want one. If it suits them to miss Sydney, let them do so. I repeat that we must decide in favour of one principle or the other. To my mind, we shall be acting wisely by adopting the principle to which effect has been given in this contract. We should allow our mail services to terminate immediately the steamers have landed their mails at the first port of. call from which they can be conveyed by rail to the various States of the Commonwealth. I think that that is a fair and wise provision! to make. It will remove from us the reproach of having greatly increased the cost of our mail services, and of having unjustly treated any State.",54
286,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Barrier). [9.12] - I am opposed to the first portion of the amendment, because I have always held that our mail contracts should be contracts for purely postal services. I am glad that the honourable proposed agreement is for & service of that description.",54
287,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Then why all the talk which has been indulged in regarding the provision which should be made for the carriage of cargo?,54
288,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"The .agreement procan vides that the mails shall be delivered at Adelaide, and that the service shall terminate there.",54
289,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Not if the ship* go further.,54
290,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"They are not bound to go further. If they go further, they will carry the heavy postal parcels, and thus obviate the necessity for them being forwarded by rail. If the amendment be agreed to, it must necessarily reopen the whole question of the carriage of our mails, because a great many other - conditions would have to be considered. Take, for example, the proposal that the mail steamers should visit Brisbane - Before any such arrangement could be entered into, it would be necessary for the Government to know what amount of trade the vessels would be likely to obtain there. The contract between the Queensland Government and the Orient Steam Navigation Company was made upon the understanding that the whole of the exporters of butter from that State would ship their commodity by the mail steamers. The reason why the vessels of tlieOrient Steam Navigation Company were willing to proceed to Brisbane for a subsidy of £ 2 6 , 0 0 0 per annum was that they were assured of a certain amount by way of freight upon the butter exported from Queensland. The Commonwealth Government, however, could give no such guarantee. Last night the Prime Minister read the communications! which he had received from the various States Governments in reference to the carriage of perishable produce, and the reply of the Queensland Government offered him no guarantee that a single pound of butter would be exported by the new mail vessels if they called at Brisbane.",55
291,Mr R EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,The Queensland Government cannot give him any such assurance while the present contract is in existence.,55
292,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"If any proposals were made by the Government in the direction suggested, the first question they would be asked by the contractors is, "" What quantity of cargo can we obtain from Brisbane?"" If they could secure a paying cargo, they would visit that port without a single penny being added to the subsidy. It will thus be seen that a large number of questions would be raised immediately if the contract provided for other than a purely postal service. When the Shipping Commission was taking evidence in Adelaide, three witnesses appeared before it, one being an agent, and the other two being fruit exporters. These witnesses assured us that if they desired to ship frui t to the old country, either by the vessels of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company or the Orient Steam Navigation Company, they had to enter into an undertaking to allow that fruit to be sold by the agents of those companies in London.",55
293,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,That condition does not obtain in regard to the export of Tasmanian fruit.,55
294,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"The Shipping Service Commission was told by a witness that it applied to Adelaide,. and that it cost him is. 6d. per case more to have his frui t sold in London through the agents of these companies than it did under another arrangement open to him - He was consequentlyforced to ship his frui t to England by other steamers. Any one who has a knowledge of the export trade in perishable products is aware that our exporters find it advantageous to ship by the mail steamers, lie1 cause of their speed and regularity. That being so, it is only fair that the advantage of being able to ship by such steamers should be extended to exporters in every State capital. If it be true that the. Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company and the Orient Steam Navigation Company are able to impose on shippers in Adelaide conditions which fhey cannot enforce in Melbourne, Sydney, or Hobart, owing to the larger consignments of frui t offering there, it will be necessary for us, if this question is to be dealt with in the contract now before us, to provide that every person shall be at liberty to avail himself of the cool chambers on board these steamers, and to ship his perishable produce by them without any condition as. to its sale in England. If we were to enter upon ""these questions we should also have to determine whether or not the company should be required to reserve a certain area of cool 'storage for shippers in each State capital. The company might otherwise allow all the cool storage space on a steamer to be occupied by a shipment from Brisbane or Sydney, leaving no space whatever for shippers at Adelaide. If this is not to be a purely postal contract, we shall have to give consideration to all these questions. They are so important that, even if their discussion extended over a week, no ' complaint could be made, but - I do not think that the Post and Telegraph Department should have to pay for more than the carriage of the mails. Under the existing contract with, the Orient Steam Navigation Company, Queensland has had a sentimental, but cer tainly not a. legitimate, grievance. That contract provides that the mail steamers shall call at Sydney and Melbourne, but the provision does not cost the Commonwealth a penny more than it would otherwise have to pay. M!r. FISHER - l t is a good thing that Broken Hill is not on a river. Mr^ THOMAS - If I made an unjustifiable claim on behalf of Broken Hill , it would not be said that I was right in doing so.",55
295,Mr DAVID THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Of thing must go beyond Sydney.,56
296,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"That is not a fair statement. Even if we inserted in this contract a provision that the mail steamers should call at Melbourne and Sydney, we should not be called upon to pay .an additional subsidy, but Brisbane takes the stand that such a provision would be unfair to itself. This contract, therefore, does away with the sentimental grievance under which the capital of the northern State has labored. It says, in effect, to the contractors, "" Your steamers need not go beyond Adelaide, unless you desire that they shall do so."" There is no doubt, however, that they will proceed to Melbourne and Sydney. As Brisbane's sentimental grievance has been lemoved, I hope we shall agree that this contract shall be purely a postal one, providing for nothing more than the delivery of the mails at Adelaide.",56
297,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"B y way of personal explanation, Mr Speaker, I wish to state that ^vhen I rose fo second the amendment I was under the impression that it. hacl been proposed in the form in which it stands on the notice paper. I was not aware that the first clause had been so altered as to give it an entirely new comjjlexion. I wish to take this opportunity of ""stating that I do not agree with the alteration in question.",56
298,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Parramatta) [9.21.] - There can be no question as to the strictly accurate statement of the equities of this case by the last two speakers. If we are to regard this as a purely postal contract, I admit that what has' been said by the honourable member for North Svdney and the honourable member for Barrier is .not open to exception. But, after all, is this only a postal contract? The Prime Minister did not say so last night. In his oration, extending over an hour",56
299,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,I am very sorry.,56
300,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"I am not; I was delighted to hear it. We listened for fully an hour to a very - eloquent oration by the Prime Minister, who occupied about ten minutes in dealing with the postal sdde of the contract, and 'the remaining fifty minutes or more with an enumeration of the advantages which will accrue from this service to exporters of Australian products. The stipulation in the contract that the steamers shall be of 11,000 tons register cannot be designed purely for postal purcourse no- poses.",56
301,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,It was not a condition of the contract; it was the company's own proposal.,56
302,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,That mav be; but it is an inducement to the ready acceptance of the contract.,56
303,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Hear , hear.",56
304,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"As the honourable and learned gentleman said last night, these steamers will provide three times the cool storage now offered to us by the Orient Steam Navigation. Company. That was one of his chief arguments for the acceptance of the contract. Indeed, the contract was not submitted to us as being for purely postal purposes. Throughout the Prime Minister's speech we heard little as to its postal side, but we had an enumeration of the advantages that might possibly accrue to Australia if cool storage space could be found on the mail steamers for all our perishable produce. So eloquent did the honourable and learned gentleman become in the enumeration of the advantages which these steamers would give us. that I had to ask him to come ddwn once more to solid earth. He sailed away, as he usually does, into the vague empyrean, and talked "" in liquid lines mellifluously b l and "" about our exports of perishable produce. As is customary with him when discussing politics generally, - he apDlied the doctrine of political universalism. We were told last night that our produce would be trebled as the result of drv farming, which was to make us rich and happy and prosperous. The honourable and learned gentleman drew for us a picture of emigrants streaming hitherwards from other countries), and ships, laden with our produce, chasing each other over every sea. It was really grand to hear him speaking of the prosperity of Australia, and of the huge population'that eloquent she was to secure. The honourable and learned gentleman could not refrain from referring to''his favourite topic, "" land for the people, and people for the land."" He defended thenorthern parts of Australia, ancl he did all this in referring to the contract, which has been entered into, as my honourable friends would have us believe, for purely postal purposes.",56
305,Mr DAVID THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,He gave show awav.,57
306,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Surely that was an argument for the calling of these vessels at every port in Australia. He told us that they would provide an abundance of cool storage space, and that he regretted that arrangements could not be made with all the States. I understand that in making that observation, he referred to Queensland, in common with the other States.",57
307,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Yes .,57
308,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"The Government really took the initiative in regard to' the carriage of produce from Queensland. Had that State entered into the co-operative arrangement which the Prime Minister suggested, and as to which he read several documents last night, would not provision have been made for the carriage of produce? M.r. DEAKIN - The arrangement would have meant the calling of the steamers at Brisbane under an additional contract.",57
309,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Then it seems that the Government themselves, in the genesis of this contract, contemplated Brisbane being made a port of call for the mail steamers. Therefore, in proposing by this amendment that the steamers of the service shall go up to Brisbane, we are simply carrying out the original intention of the Ministry.",57
310,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Provisio n would have had to be made under a separate contract for their going to Brisbane. The postal con-tract would have stood, and there would have been another contract in relation to cool storage.",57
311,Mr TOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Oueerslan d will not obiect if another contract be made.,57
312,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Hear . hear.,57
313,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"So long as they can secure the conditions which they desire, and which have 'already been promised definitely to the other States, the people of Queensland will not obiect. Alreadv we are told that Mr Croker has given the Government an undertaking that these steamers will ,go on to Melbourne and Sydney. Clearlv. therefore, those two ports are in a satisfactory position. If a definite undertaking has been given that these vessels shall proceed to Melbourne and Sydney, there can be no harm in providing in the contract that they shall do so. The Government have contemplated their going on to Brisbane, if not under the postal contract, at all events under a separate one, and if this amendment be the carried it will simply mean that the Government will have to enter into further negotiations to carry out their original intention with regard to serving Queensland. I come now - to the equities of the case. If we are going to discuss the matter of equity as applied to our legislation, I am afraid we shall have to view this contract as providing for something more than a mail service. .From the stand-point of equity, we must view this service as relating to all the States. If the broad equities of the situation are regarded as affecting the whole of the States no substantial injustice will be done, even if we make this departure from strict equity, as it applies merely to the mail contract. For instance, the rest of the States granted to Western Australia the concession that the mail steamers should call at Fremantle. Then, again, what is the position with regard to the Vancouver mail service? I do not think that it is of very much value to us as a postal service. I do not know whether any great injury would Ije done to the States if the steamers engaged in that service made the round trip to Western Australia, but every one knows that Western Australia finds it cheaper to ship its produce direct to London, instead of vid Vancouver.",57
314,Mr FOWLER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,We could develop a direct trade with Vancouver.,57
315,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"But I do not think that Western Australia or Sonth Australia is very anxious to ""do so. Concerning the broad equities of the situation as a whole, I should like to point out that we have Western Australia and South Australia today actually competing with the rest of the States, which competition has the effect of helping to destroy the Vancouver cable service, for which these States pay, while they are making a huge profit out of their relations with the Eastern Extension Company.",57
316,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,The honourable member is departing from the question.,57
317,Mr TOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"I do so only incidentallv. I am trving to show that there is a broader view of the equities of the case than the manner in which any one State is affected By a single service. From my point of view, no substantial injustice would be done to the eastern States if these steamers were sent to Brisbane. I think that it could be done-and I admit that some degree of sentiment enters into the suggestion - we should arrange to send the steamers to all the main ports of Australia, and thus to encircle the settled portion of the continent with this great service. The vessels are to have the steaming capacity necessary to do that, and as they will have space for three times as much cargo as can be carried by the vessels of the Orient Steam Navigation Company, they will, by calling, at Brisbane, probably soon develop a trade which will make it worth their while to go there, apart from any considerations of subsidy. We mav have to pay a little more to get these steamers to call at Brisbane now; but Queensland is destined to increase her production so rapidly that Brisbane is likely soon to be a centre of attraction to all who are interested in. the trade of Australia. I do not say that we should provide that the vessels shall go to Queensland, whatever may be the cost; but, if it can be done at a reasonable cost, this concession might well be given to Queensland.",57
318,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Franklin) [9.33]-I shall support the amendment. the last contract was under discussion, I thought that Queensland had a grievance, because Brisbane was not made a port of call. The honourable member for Parramatta has dealt with a matter about which I had made a note. It is absurd to say that this is a contract for a postal service only. Three-fourths of it, so far as it is set down in black and white, may relate only to a mail service; but more than three-fourths of the arguments which have been delivered in favour of its ratification have been directed to the advantages which Australia will gain by the large provision made for the export of perishable produce.",58
319,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"We pay only for the postal service, and get all other advantages without cost.",58
320,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"If that is so, why is it stipulated that certain space shall be allowed for cold storage?",58
321,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,It is not have offered that.,58
322,Mr ROBINSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,It was not in the advera tisement ?,58
323,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"No . - Mr MCWILLIAMS - The tenderers knew that, by offering certain space for storage, they would improve their chance of benefits. obtaining the contract. If another company had offered to carry the mails for if £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 less, and had made no provision for cool storage, would the Prime Minister have been prepared to recommend the acceptance of its tender?",58
324,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,I should.,58
325,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Then the honourable and learned gentleman only wasted somuch time last night by his eloquent statement of"" the enormous advantages to be /rained by the provision of cold storage space^ - since he does not consider that advantage to be worth £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 a year.",58
326,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"I have always said that the providing of cold storage would be the subject of a separate contract, and I proposed to the States that a separate contract should! be made.",58
327,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"I think that the States did well in refusing the offer of the Commonwealth; because I believe that they can make better conditions for their trade than can be made for them by this Government. We are being asked to subsidize a line of vessels which is to provide a certain amount of space for cold storage for the export of perishable produce; When but only four of the States will be able to lake advantage of that provision of the 1 contract, the State of Tasmania, and the important State of Queensland, where agricultural settlement is progressing faster than anywhere else in the Union, being left oui of the arrangement. I do not think it fair to ask Queensland to pay her share of the subsidy when, she will noi derive from the service the advantages which the other States on the mainland will enjoy. If this is to be a true Federation, geographical position must not be regarded as a bar to any Staie.",58
328,Mr FOWLER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Hear , 'hear ! What about the Western Australian railway ?",58
329,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,I am prepared to extend to Western Australia the same consideration that is given to the oiher States.,58

332,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"To what clause does the honourable member refer , when, he says that cold storage is provided for?",59
333,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Is there no such - prevision in the contract? The Prime Minister told us distinctly last night there is such a provision. One of the chief reasons why he urged the acceptance of the contract was that the States wili derive an enormous advantage because the cold storage accommodation which will be given.,59
334,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,He did not say that that is provided for in the contract. Mn. DEAKIN - No ; it is not in the contract.,59
335,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"In reply to an interjection, he said that we have the tinct assurance of the contracting party that it will be provided, and made that a strong argument for the acceptance of the contract. The service is not to be a fast one. No one, in these days, can say that vessels capable of steaming only 15 knots an hour will provide a fast service. But, uncler the terms of the contract, as read them, we are to get a good mail and cargo service. I have always felt that the contract is really only a concession, which is to be hawked about by the conI tracting party to see what can be made of i i . If its provisions are complied we shall have got a very good bargain, only because of the arrangements made for the carriage of mails, .but also because there will be established' in the Australian trade a line of vessels which will give tensive cold storage which will assist us dump-as ihe Minister of Trade and Custhe toms would sav-ou r surplus products in the markets of the old world.",59
336,Mr KNOX,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,That is the whole object the inspection.,59
337,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"I think so, and it has been the advantage insisted upon every speech delivered in favour of the contract. If this were a contract' merely for the carriage of mails, it would have obtained a very different reception. recognise, however, that it provides and certain transit, and spacious accommoline, dation for our perishable produce. But why should not Queensland benefit by the arrangement ?",59
338,Mr ROBINSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"If the amendment is carried, will the honourable member move a similar amendment dealing with Tasthe mania ?",59

I do not think that the people of Queensland desire that the steamers of. every line carrying mails shall make Brisbane a port of call, and I of do not ask that all the mail steamers calling at ports in the mainland shall also visit Tasmania. In reply to the interjection of the honourable member for Wannon, however, I say that, in my opinion, these mail steamers should call at Tasmania during the three months of the year which form our chief season of export for perishable products. I shall support the disamendment on iis merits, and I shall not attempt to jeopardize it by proposing any extension until it has been dealt with.",59
340,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,That would seriously . interfere with the local shipping companies.,59
341,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"If the honourable member had had my experience, he would I know that the local shipping companies are . well able to take care of themselves. Practically the whole of our export trade is conducted by means of oversea steamers. n justice to the existing matil companies, out I am bound to say that no attempts have with, been made to force upon Tasmanian not shippers of apples conditions similar to those which the honourable member for Barrier has described as having been imposed upon shippers of frui t from Adelaide. The exTasmanian shippers have not been required to to sell their produce through the agency of company. So long as they pay their freight they are absolutely free to sell or consign their goods to whom they please. of There is not the same danger to be apprehended from a combine as some honourable members seem to think. No difficulty is in experienced in obtaining shipping accommodation for produce so long as reasonable notice is given to the companies. Last vear four or five different lines of steamers took We part in the Tasmanian trade. We had the speedy Blue Funnel, the White Star, the Gulf and Federal-Houlder line steamers in addition to the mail-boats, and they were all only too anxious to ship produce. Now that special conditions are being made with a view to affording facilities for our export trade, Queensland should not be left out in cold. She should not stand alone in being called upon to contribute towards the subsidy without having an opportunity of I shall vote for the extension of the service to Brisbane. Mr KING O'MALLEY [9.49] - I regret that the PostmasterThe General should feel aggrieved at the sughe gestion offered by honourable members. seems to me that this is the time and 'at which to make suggestions-otherwisethe contract should not have been submitted to Parliament. The Minister mentioned the names of a number of gentlemen who were behind the contractors. He told us they were men of great financial strength, and that their connection with the enterprise was a sufficient guarantee that everything would be right. When I first came to Ausamounted tralia I attended a banquet, and was the poorest man among those present. There was not a guest but could draw his cheque for £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 . But they have all now. They were all great and honourable men, and stood high in banking .circles. Theirs were names to conjure with. They were the Jay Goulds, Vanderbilts, and Astors of this country. Where are they business footing. . today ? If these men had been behind the contractors the Postmaster-General have told us that their names were a sufficient guaranteeI remember very well when Villard, a great railway magnate, left New York in order to accompany a number of German barons and English lords out west. He left New York worth £10,000,000, but by the time he reached Oregon he was a bankrupt. As a matter of fact, although so many financial magasylum, nates are supposed to be behind the tractors, they have rendered themselves liable to the payment of only £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 by way of penalty in the event of a breach of take to do so. the contract. On the other hand, they could sue the Commonwealth for unlimited damages in the event of their incomes ing reduced by an"" legislation passed us. The arrangement as to the penalty for - a breach of agreement be of a mutual character, and the to liability of the Commonwealth should be limited in the same wav as 'is that of the contractors. It is proposed to into a contract for ten vears, for term we shall have our hands completely tied. It is easy to say that the men behind the contractors are honnew orable and influential. I admit they are. So was Ta.v Gould, so was Astor. and so was Russell Sage, who retent cently died worth £20.000.000. But these magnates made all their monev out of the people. The honourable and teamed memciple ber for Parkes, who is a shrewd lawyer, pointed out that the interests of the Com(Darwin) monwealth should be carefully safeguarded. Postmaster-General must remember that is dealing with a pretty fly lawyer, who It has all his senses about him.. How do we place know that this concession is not to be e handed over to the Orient Steam Navigation Company ? We should have everything put down in black and white, and should not fun the risk of having our agreement made the subject of legal proceedings. Perhaps the Postmaster-General noticed that the legal expenses incurred in connection with the celebrated corset case in Melbourne to £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 . I am not particular as to which ports are visited by the mail steamers, but I quite agree with the honourable member for Franklin that they gone should go on to Brisbane. I shall speak as to the claims of Tasmania at a later stage. I trust that the Postmaster-General will devote further attention to paragraph 2 of the contract - and place matters upon a",59

I think that the fact fhat this is by a purel"" postal contract to a great extent meets the arguments that have been adshould vanced in favour of extending the service Brisbane. It would not be fair to debit the Postal Department with anv excess charged 'in respect of the extended service, enter and. so far as I know, there is no other which Denartment in the Commonwealth which c.nuld be expected to provide the monev. The auestion as to whether the proposed steamers will proceed to - Queensland' that should depend entirely upon the trading inducements offered to them. To the exto which that element ceased to onerate* we should be subsidizing the trade of that State. If we were OPCP to affirm the prinof subsidizing trade it would be veryhard to fix a limit to its application. We might be called upon to insist upon the mail steamers making a circuit of Australia. We should have to push the principle to its logical conclusion. It would be very dangerous for us to establish a principle, the application of which we cannot definitely limit. It would be perfectly open to Queensland to offer the contractors an inducement, such as was held out to the Orient Steam Navigation Company, in the form of an additional subsidy. If that course were adopted, and anything went wrong with the postal contract, no moral responsibility- I do not say anything as to the legal aspect of the matter-woul d rest upon the Commonwealth. If we were to include in the contract provisions dealing with something entirely foreign to the carriage of mails, the contractors might ask us to overlook any shortcomings on their part in connection with. delayed delivery. We should not place ourselves in that position by imposing conditions somewhat incongruous in a mail contract. I am not quite sure whether any estimate' has been made as to the additional exoense tnat would be involved under the proposal contained in the amendment.",60
346,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"It was estimated that if the mail steamers were not to beyond Adelaide we should require to add another - Croo.ooo or £ 1 2 0 , 0 0 0 to sidy. The extension of the service from Svdnev to Brisbane would cost an addibe tional £ 2 6 , 0 0 0.",61
347,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Then the amendment the Queensland Government. would involve a considerable addition to the cost of the service, which, although curred in order to meet the requirements nf one State, would have to be borne by the whole of the Commonwealth. The State itself should determine whether is desirable that the mail steamers should go beyond the terminal port at which mails are to be delivered. If it decides that question in the affirmative it should alone pav the piper.",61
348,Mr FOWL ER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Perth) [10.0] - I admit that, in the proposed agreement, we are contracting specifically for a mail service, but I think there can be no doubt that we are paying for a great deal more than a mail service. Otherwise, I take that a considerable number of honourable members would feel inclined to revert the poundage system, under which our mails would be carried just about as ciently, and for a considerably less expenamendment, diture. As I understand it, the idea underlying the contract is that the steamers which we engage to carry our mails constitute the means of communication between Australia and the outside world, and particularly that portion of the outside world in which we are most interested- I refer to the mother country. If that be so, I take it that all the States are equally entitled to facilities in that connection. If we adopt the broad Federal view of providing equal facilities to all the States, I cannot see why the payment of a comparatively small sum should stand in the way of its realization. I heartily endorse the opinion which has been expressed by the deputy leader of the Opposition, that if we are able to arrange that the mail steamers shall call at Brisbane for a few years, the potentialities of the northern State are so great that, probably, at the end of that period the contractors will find that its trade is sufficient to justify them in continuing to visit that port without receiving any extra payment. At any rate, this service ought to be made to apply equally to all the States, and for that reason I shall support the amendment.",61
349,Mr CULPIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Brisbane) [10.3] - I intend to support the amendment, because its go adoption would give Queensland a chance to which she is fairly entitled. The hon the suborable and learned member for Angas has stated that any arrangement which might entered into to insure the mail steamers calling at 'Brisbane was purely a matter for I cannot help thinking that the proposed contract is inpurely a matter of "" grab."" New South Wales and Victoria are almost certain to get the advantage which will be conferred by those vessels calling at Melbourne and it Sydney. The two States in question are grabbing all the advantages accruing from the the contract. Why should not the other States be placed upon an equality with them? That desirable result can only be secured by the adoption of the amendment, and consequently I shall vote for it. Mr R. EDWARD S (Oxley) [10.5] - I rise with a view to bringing this debate to a close. It has been very humiliating to me - and to other Queensland representatives it - to be compelled to appeal year after year to the Government to do justice to that to State in connection with our European mail contract. I wish to thank those honourable effimembers who have promised to support the but I recognise that it is utterly futile to make any further appeal for consideration at the hands of the Ministry. Consequently, I shall be pleased if honourable members will refrain from discussing the question at any greater length. I realise that the very name of Queensland stinks in the nostrils of the Commonwealth Government.",61

I was shocked to hear the language which he employed. I have consistently fought to insure that the mail steamers shall make Brisbane a port of call, and - am annoyed that the honourable member should haye made the accusations which - hasj levelled against the Commonwealth. The adoption of such tactics is not calcuCommonwealth lated to induce honourable members to assist us to achieve our object. I have already spoken upon this question, and have practically said' all that I desire to say. Last evening the Prime Minister detailed the steps which had been taken to induce the other States to enter into an arrangement with the contractors regarding the export of perishable products. He pointed out the possibilities of Australia in. that convulnexion. To my mind, the very fact that the vessels which are to be employed under the proposed contract are to possess a ""registered tonnage"" of 11,000 tons, suggests that the contractors have more in view been than the mere carriage of mails. No shipbuilding firm would construct vessels of that capacity merely for the purpose of carrying mails. I have already wired to the Premier of Queensland, asking him not to negotiate any further with the Prime Minister, or with Mr Croker, who is acting as agent for Sir James Laing and Sons, in regard to the proposal that the mail steamers shall call at Brisbane. I trust that he will not renew the subsidy which Queensland is at present paying to the Orient Steam Navigation Company. Of course, we , cannot find fault with the the vessels calling at Fremantle and AdeBut the Government know perHe fectly well that it is impossible for at the Melbourne and Sydney.

363,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Gwydir) [10.18] - I did not intend to speak at this stage of the debate, but, after listening to the wholesale condemnation of the unpatriotic attitude of this House, in which the honourable member for Oxley indulged",63
364,Mr R EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,I did not refer to this House.,63
365,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"The honourable member referred practically to the treatment which Queensland had received at the hands of this House, and he made statements which were not only unjustifiable, but unpatriotic, and unworthy of a representative of that great Staie. The honourable member declared that it had received no benefit from the Commonwealth. As a matter of fact, in proportion to her contribution to the Commonwealth Treasury, Queensland has received greater benefits from the Federation than has any other Siate 'in the Union. That being so, the statements of the honourable member were unworthy of a member of this Chamber. He is, perhaps, to be excused, for I do not think that he realizes at times the seriousness and the importance of the statements that he makes. This view is borne out by the unjustifiable assertions that haye been made with regard to the attitude of the Commonwealth towards the people of other lands. The action of the honourable member in seeking to placate the northern State by charging this Parliament with acting unfairly to it is most unjustifiable. I protest against it . As one who has endeavoured as far as possible to hold the scales of justice evenly between the Commonwealth and the States-as one who not only professes, but practices the Federal spirit in the terms of the Union, and who is prepared to do everything possible for the advancement of the Commonwealth- I resent the remarks made by him. . I hurl back his insinuation that Queensland does not receive justice at the hands of the Commonwealth, that she cannot expect to receive it, and that she should no longer appeal to us.  under the impression that when the contract with the Orient Steam Navigation Company was under consideration, we discussed what should be the principal features of the next mail contract. If I were of opinion thai the agreement under consideration related to the provision of cool storage on the mail steamers I should be at one with those who desire that Brisbane shall be made a port of call. I fail to see, however, what the question of cool storage has to do with the carriage of our mails, and why the Post and Telegraph Department of the Commonwealth should be burdened with the cost of anything beyond the carriage of mail matter. If any State ought to pay it is Queensland",63
366,Mr WILKINSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Queenslan d is quite able to pay. She does not beg anything from the Federal Parliament.  did? My contention is that the contract before us is not for the provision of cool storage, and that the Post and Telegraph' Department should not be loaded with the cost of providing cool storage for the export of perishable produce.",63
367,Mr WILKINSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Of course, the steamers should not go beyond Adelaide.  sentative of Queensland I should still hold"" the view that I am now expressing. I might as well ask that these steamers should* call at a port in the Northern Territory, or at other than the chief ports of the Commonwealth; but I recognise that this is not a contract for the carriage of perishable produce, and' that we should be very guarded in making a proposal to load the Post and Telegraph Department with the cost of such a service as some of my honourable friends desire. Members of the States Parliaments constantly complain that the Department has suffered a loss of revenue since its transfer to the Commonwealth, and yet the Treasurers of the States insist upon its being loaded with the cost of something that is wholly foreign to it. I regret that the Government have found it necessary to agree to the payment of a subsidv of £125,000 a year for this service. There isi no warrant for such a payment ; it is simply monstrous.",63
368,Mr FOWLER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"It goes to show that we are paving for something more than a postal service.  thing like £ 8 0 0 per ton for our mail matter, whereas the mail steamers will carry butter for about three-eighths of a penny per lb. It seems to me strange that, in consideration of additional speed, we should be asked to increase the subsidy from £ 7 0 , 0 0 0 , which was considered a fair amount some time ago, to £ 1 2 5 , 0 0 0 , the present contract being £120,000. There is no doubt that if the quantitv of products to be shipped from Queensland warrants the vessels calling at a port in that State, the vessels will call there. Why do the mail-boats call at Melbourne and Sydney? because there is cargo to be obtained. is not proper to load the postal service simplv in order to provide that vessels shall call at any port where there is cargo; and I should express that opinion just as candidly if I represented any other Siate but South Australia. The only port to he considered should be the terminal port of the mail service.",64
369,Mr WILKINSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"What about the tonnage of the vessels?  wise enough to know that if they cater for the Australian trade they must provide the necessary storage and equipment to enable them to compete with existing lines. That, of course, is so much the better for Australia, but it has nothing to do with the mail contract.",64

372,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Gwydir) [10.36] I move That the following words be added :"" And this House is of the opinion that the steamers should be acquired by the Government in the event of the company joining or becoming a part of any shipping ring or combine, or otherwise constituting itself a monopoly, detrimental to the trade and commerce of the Commonwealth."" I expect that I shall be met with the argument, on behalf of the Government, that the provisions already embodied in the tract cover the right to acquire the steamers under certain conditions. While I agree that, to some extent, there are powers of that kind, and while I take this opportunity to compliment the Government upon the able contract which has been drawn up, and upon the manner in which they have safeguarded the interests of the Commonposal wealth, still, I cannot agree that the ment is altogether satisfactory in this spect. It is true that there is embodied it a clause giving the right to acquire the steamers in the event of certain conditions not being complied with. That provision constitutes an advance upon anv contract that has hitherto been made for the carriage df mails in Australia. There have been provisions providing for the hiring of vessels in case of war. But in the past there has been no provision for acquiring steamers in the event of the Government desiring to run them in the interests of country. The contract sets out that If the contract or any part thereof is underlet, or otherwise disposed of without consent of the Postmaster-General, and, or breach on the part of the contractor, his agents, or servants of the contract, or of any condition, shall be committed, it shall be f u l for the Postmaster-General, if he shall fit, and notwithstanding there may or have been any former breach of the contract of any condition by an instrument, in writing, to determine the contract without any notice to the contactor, and the contractor not be entitled to any compensation in respect respect, of such determination, and such determination shall not deprive the Postmaster-General of any right or remedy to which he would otherwise be entitled by reason of such breach or of prior breach of the contract. That clause imposes conditions under which the Postmaster-General may acquire the steamers to be run by the contracting comtract pany. The contract also contains the folif lowing clause:The Postmaster-General may at anj' time ing the continuance of the contract purchase any or all of the mail ships at a valuation-o charter the same at a rate of hire to be agreed upon with the contractor, or failing any such agreement as to a valuation or rate to cided by arbitration, and the contractor shall not sell any mail ship to any person other the Postmaster-General without first giving Postmaster-Gener.il a reasonable opportunity of purchasing the same, either at a valuation be agreed upon or to be decided by arbitration or at the price he is willing to sell it at otlier person. Provided always that if the master-General exercises the right to purchase charter all the mail ships employed under contract, the contract shall thereupon be determined, and such determination shall not give the contractor any claim to compensation. conIt may be held that that clause covers the ground of the amendment which I am now submitting. I cannot agree that it does. It simply gives the Government the right to acquire the ships at a valuation in the event of the company desiring to sell or let them. In other words, it means that the Postmaster-General practically controls the disof the vessels. It may be that the docuPostmaster-General has power to acquire rethe line in the event of there being a disin position on the part of the contractors to sell their steamers, or in the event of the company being disposed to become absorbed in a ring or combine. I can readily understand that if the Postmaster-General of the day held that a shipping combine or ring was detrimental to the interests of the Commail monwealth he might, under the terms of this contract, be able to prevent the company being absorbed. But the point is that if we happen to have in office, during the the tenure of this contract, a Postmaster General having no sympathy with the obassigned, jects of mv amendment:, he, having the the power in his hands, or the Government of if any which he was a member being antagonistic officers, to the ideas which my amendment emlawbodies, might acquiesce in the absorption think of the company by a shipping ring or commay not bine. To obviate such an event, and or to prevent any Minister who may be previous in power during the ten years from shall exercising his own predilections in this we should have in the contract a definite and binding condition that, no matter what may be the opinion any of the Cabinet, we expect it to perform the task of acquiring these steamers in the event of the occurrence of the emergency provided for. The provisions of the conwould, it seems to me, meet the case we could be certain of always having a sympathetic Government in power. But they are not sufficient to meet the possidurbility of the advent to office of an unsymr may pathetic Government. The company which is to carry our mails may not sell its vessels to another company, or join a shipping be dering or combine; but its trade may grow than to such an extent, and it may become so the wealthy, that it may ultimately buy out its competitors, and, becoming a monopoly, to raise its freights and fares, to the detrito such ment of our producers, and of the people Postof Australia generally. Now, the honoror able member for North Sydney last night the admitted that, in the event of a monopoly arising, and working prejudicially to the welfare of Australia, it might be justifiable 1922 Mail Service [REPRESENTATIVES.] for the Commonwealth to take over the service. .",64
373,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,I said that such a thing might be proposed if there were a monopoly whose operations were seriously injuring Australia. But it will be time enough to deal with the matter when that happens.,66
374,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"The time to make our stipulations is when the contract is before us. I am surprised that the honourable member, who is a practical business man, should say that it will be time enough to safeguard our interests when trouble arises.",66
375,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"A combination may be formed which may be advantageous. It is only harmful combinations which should be dealt with,",66
376,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"I think that that objection is met by the words "" otherwise constituting itself a monopoly, detrimental to the trade and commerce of the Commonwealth."" Those words mean that a beneficial monopoly would not be interfered with, while a monopoly injuring the trade and commerce of the Commonwealth could be dealt with.",66
377,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Who will decide that the effects of a monopoly are detrimental ?,66
378,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"The question would be decided on the merits of the case, by the law officers of the Crown. Im passing legislation for the prevention of monopolies generally, we provide for the decision of much more difficult questions.",66

388,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"That is to say, if the House were so constituted as to desire to give such a direction, and if the Government were at the time in sympathy with a proposal of the kind. But if during the tenure of the contract an effort to give effect to a provision of this kind did not meet with the sympathy of the Government or with the support of the House, those who favour it would be left in a hopeless state in their efforts to secure compliance with the condition. In my opinion, it should be included in the contract now, as a definite instruction that in the circumstances indicated the Government' should adopt a certain course.",66
389,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,The honourable member has the full sympathy of the Government in his contention that in the case of a monopoly the interests of the people should be protected.,66
390,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"I quite understand that, but unfortunately I do not expect the present Government to continue in office for ever, and if the platform professions of those who might succeed them give a true indication of their aspirations in connection with legislation of this character, it is necessary that there should be some conditions embodied in this contract which will insure justice to the people.",66

The other night, when I described this provision as a socialistic sop, the Prime Minister promptly replied that a similar provision was included in the contracts made by the British Government. His interjection was, "" The British Government also include it . "" I find, however, that there is no provision resembling it in the Imperial contracts. The only reference to it is contained in the Imperial contract with the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, and that provision is very different from the clause in the agreement under consideration. In the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company's contract there is a provision which has nothing whatever to do with the Postmaster-'General, but which has to do with the Admiralty and with the defence of the Empire.

In the meantime, I propose to make our contract harmonize with the provision which is embodied in the British contracts at the present time. If we do that we shall do all that is necessary in the direction of nationalizing this, service. Conseauently I mereThat the following words be added- "" and with the following further modifications :In the second line of clause 16, substitute 'Minister of State for Defence' foT the 'Postmaster-General.' In No. 36 of the General Conditions of Tender, substitute the 'Minister of State for Defence' for the 'Postmaster-General,' and after the word 'contract,' in the second line, insert the words ' if he shall consider it necessary for defence purposes so to do.'"" The amendment - will confine the power of purchase or charter to the defence of Ausmailtralia, and will limit the initiative in"" this ex- matter to the Minister of Defence, instead of to the Postmaster-General.",70
430,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,There is nothing in it to protect the producers of Australia.,70
431,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"There is everything in it to protect, not only the - producers, but every other man in Australia in time of dire national, necessity.",70
432,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,There are other times besides that.,70
433,Mr DEAKI N,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [11.34] - I take it that the very section of the Imperial contract with the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company to which the honourable member has referred, proves my contention. It says The Admiralty shall at any time during the continuance of this agreement, if they shall consider it necessary in the public interest so to clo, have power and be at liberty to purchase any or all of the mail ships, &c. That gives the Admiralty absolute power to purchase those vessels if they consider it necessary to do so, the only limitation imposed being as to whether they regard such, a step as essential in the public interest ?",70
434,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,In what matters other than defence are the Admiralty the judges of the public interest?,70
435,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"That rests entirely with the Government, of which the Admiralty represents one Department.",70
436,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Subiec t to the provisions pf the subvention between the Admiralty and the company.,70
437,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"The Imperial contract, which I had in my mind when the deputy leader of the Opposition was speaking, resembled that with the Cunard Company, dated 30th Tuly, 1903, which contains the following :His Majesty's Government shall have the right on giving notice in writing to the company of their intention so to do to take possession of any vessel which they require to purchase or hire uncler the provisions of this Agreement immediately on the arrival of such vessel at her port of discharge from the voyage. . . . the There is no limitation as to public interests - n o limitation whatever. In sub-section 3. of clause 4 of the Cunard agreement'of 1903 we find that provision.",70
438,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,The Cunard agreement of 1903 was renewed in 1904.,71
439,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"I dare say it was. If any recollection is right, and I think it is, the language used in another contract with the British Government, which we had in mind and have seen, is exactly that which has been employed in this contract of ours.",71
440,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,There is no provision of the kind in the contracts with the Orient Steam Navigation Companv.,71
441,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Wide Bay) [11.37] I take it that we are to deal with this contract with due regard to our own position, and not in accordance with what is done anywhere else.",71
442,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Hear, hear; but I was challenged.",71
443,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Whils t the Admiralty see fit to take, certain action in the old country, I think that the Postmaster General is the most competent person to take charge of a purely postal contract. The honourable member's amendment provides that these vessels shall not be interfered with except for defence purposes.",71
444,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,In the way of purchase or charter.,71
445,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"That is a clear challenge to the Government. Any one who believes that there is a possibility qf the Government, by taking possession of the steamers, securing a better service than they could obtain by leaving them in the hands of the contractors",71
446,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"This is Socialism, or otherwise.",71
447,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"I quite agree that the Opposition, after assisting the Government, are challenging them with respect to a vital part of their policy. They are entitled to do so, but I would remind them of the statement made by the honourable member for North Sydney-on e of the shrewdest and ablest members of their party-that circumstances might arise that would compel the Government to take oyer these .vessels.",71
448,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,He has explained to-night that he was referring to a time of national peril.,71
449,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"The words used by the honourable member were perfectly clear. He said that the company might conduct the service in such a way as to compel Government to call upon them to hand over 'the steamers at a reasonable price. I that the Government will stand by the contract, because the proviso, whilst it may not lead to much, is sound in principle, and will ultimately be availed of under this or some other contract.",71
450,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Corinella) [11.40] - I have had an opportunity to hurriedly glance at the Cunard contract which the Prime Minister produced as a full justification for the Government proposal. So far as I have been able to peruse it, I have been led to the conclusion that the honourable and learned gentleman will find in it a weapon that turns in his own hands. In sub-clause 1 of clause 4, to which he referred, it is provided thatThe company shall at all limes during the term of this Agreement hold all and every the vessels for the time being the property of the company (including the steam-shi]3s particularized in the first schedule hereto, and the two steamships referred to in clause 3 hereof and all other vessels built for or purchased or. otherwise acquired by the company as and when the same shall have been built, purchased, or otherwise acquired and so long as such steam-ships or vessel's or any of them shall remain the property of the company) at the disposal of His Majesty's Government to be hired or purchased upon the terms and conditions set forth in the third schedule hereto. 2. His Majesty's Government shall have the right, on giving notice in writing to the company of their intention so to do to take possession of any vessel which they require to purchase or hire under the provisions of this Agreement, immediately on the arrival of such vessel at her port of discharge. That refers only to the right of purchase under the third schedule. On turning to that schedule, we find that it is as follows :Terms and conditions upon which the vessels of the company are to be held at the disposal of His Majesty's Government during the term of this Agreement. It will be remembered that the Prime Minister emphasized the words "" His Majesty's Government,"" as showing that the facilities of the. company were not to be held at the disposal of the Admiralty. The wording of the schedule is as follows: The price shall be a sum equal to the value of the vessel purchased as on the date upon which the Admiralty shall give notice in writing to the company of their intention to purchase. . . In other words, it is the Admiralty which has to determine the intention to purchase.",71
451,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Because that is the Dethe partment which deals with the matter. Mr .MCCAY - It deals with Imperial hope defence, not with the carriage of mails.",71
452,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Why is it that the words, "" F o r the purpose of defence,"" are not used ?",72
453,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"I shall tell the honourable and learned gentleman a little more as to this provision. First of all the right of His Majesty's Government to purchase is dependent upon notice by the Admiralty, and cannot be exercised until that notice is given.",72
454,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,The Admiralty is part of the Government.,72
455,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"It is that branch of the Government which deals with the Imperial problems of defence. Paragraph 2 of the third schedule describes the way in which the value is to be determined, whilst paragraph 3 provides thatThe sale shall include the f u l the vessel but save as hereinafter provided shall not include the plated ware cutlery crystal earthenware blankets counterpanes bed and table linen and consumable stores of the vessel all of which the company shall be entitled to remove from the vessel with the exception of such quantity of such articles (other than consumable stores) as may be reasonably necessary for the number of omcers and warrant officers that would form part of the vessel's cqmplement if used as an armed cruiser.",72
456,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,""" If "" used.",72
457,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"The honourable and learned gentleman is taking refuge in a very poor little "" if . "" This shows quite clearly what is the object of His Majesty's Government in claiming the Tight to purchase these vesselsand such quantity of such articles shall be considered part of the equipment so purchased by the Admiralty. Then clause 4 proceeds to prescribe that the Admiralty shall pay in cash or within thirty days.",72
458,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Is it the Admiralty that pays ?,72
459,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Yes , the Admiralty gives notice, it pays, and it retains sufficient of the ship's stores to enable it to be used an armed cruiser. The Postmaster-General disappears. When the Imperial Governwas, ment takes over these vessels it is more cerned with the preservation of the country than the delivery of the mails. The same schedule goes on to give the terms on hiring may take place. It provides thatThe company shall not be called on to provide officers and crews in war time, but will, quired, do all they can to assist the Admiralty in manning the vessels hired for war service.",72
460,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,No one is disputing that.,72
461,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Clause 3, und'er this ing, describes what is to be done in time of war, while clause 4 sets forth that, in the event of the Admiralty hiring - the ^vessels, or any of them, in times of peace - again, armed cruiserscertain things are to take place. Clause 5 refers to the taking on.hire of the vessels as armed cruisers, and paragraphs 6 to 11 refer 'to the arrangements between the A d miralty and the company. Both the provisions relating to purchase, and those relating to hire are contained in the one schedule, and are referred to in one clause of the agreement-claus e 4-as the alternative power of Ihe Admiralty to purchase or hire. The whole thing is with the Admiralty, and I say, from first to last, this schedule makes it clear beyond any reasonable doubt that the whole object conteml equipment of plated by this agreement",72
462,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,No .,72
463,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,I am expressing my own opinion.,72
464,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"The chief object is naval, not the whole object-that is the point..",72
465,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,The only contemplated object.,72
466,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,No .,72
467,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"The contemplated object throughout the whole of this agreement is the purchase or hire of those vessels for use as armed cruisers. We know that the captains of many of the vessels belong to the Royal Naval Reserve for that very same purpose. The Prime Minister quoted this agreement hastily, without any reasonable perusal, when he read sub-clause 2 of clause 4 as proof of the general power of purchase by the Government, as contrasted with the Admiralty, and for any purposes as contrasted with war purposes.",72
468,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Not as contrasted, but as including the Admiralty.",72
469,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"I have quoted the article and the schedule, and I leave it to the as House to judge, rightly or wrongly, what the purpose of the Imperial Government and how far their precedent warrants conarticle 16"" of the proposed postal contract.",72
470,Mr SALMON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Does the honourable and learned member contend that that would which preclude the Imperial Government from carrying mails during time of war?,72
471,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"I never contended any if resuch thing. I contend that the Imperial Government have claimed the right to purchase or hire those vessels because it contemplates desiring to use them in time of headwar for war purposes; and that they do not, under this agreement, contemplate- I do not say that they have not, technical I v. the power-anythin g but taking t'hem over in times of emergency, when they require them as part of the Imperial fleet, whether .as armed cruisers, despatch boats, or other description of vessel. Mr DEAKIN, - I have here their own document, showing that under the head of "" Admiralty Requirements "" the following is reported:. . . other Admiralty requirements connected with mail contracts relate to special facilities for Government parcels and stores, as to which we have no change to suggest, and to the conveyance of Government passengers.",72
472,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"What I say does not depend solely on the use of the word ""Admiralty."" I say that the whole of the third schedule, from which I have quoted, shows perfectly clearly what the Government of the United Kingdom had in mind when they entered into this agreement. If the Prime Minister thinks that the amendment of the honourable member for Parramatta. by specifically using the words "" for defence purposes,"" is too narrow, I suggest that he take the exact words that appear in the contract of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company.",73
473,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Slavishl y following some other people.,73
474,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"We have been told over and over again that clause 16 of the agreement now under consideration has Imperial precedent, and because we now challenge the accuracy of that statement we are told that we are slavishly following the precedent which, during the last day or two, has been quoted as the one we ought to follow.",73
475,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"The honourable member admits that, technically, the Imperial Government have the power.",73
476,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"I am prepared to confer the power ""technically"" on this occasion by adopting the exact words of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company's contract, I am prepared to do what is fair, and I am not concerned with the honourable member for Gwydir, or his ingenious modification of his previous theory on the socialistic question.",73
477,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Is that the honourable member's interpretation of the agreement?,73
478,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"I am prepared to substitute ""for the public interest"" for "" for defence purposes,"" and then we should have the same technical right under our contract that the Admiralty has under the Imperial contract-w e wouid have the same indica[67] tion of the contemplated objects and power that there ""is in the Imperial contract. I move- That the amendment be amended by leaving out the words ""defence purposes,""- with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words."" the-public interest.""",73
479,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Indi-Attorney-General ) [ - S3]--If the argument of the honourable 1I and learned member for Corinella is worth anything, the substitution of the words he proposes would make no difference whatever. The honourable and learned member has been arguing for the last few minutes that, although the words used in the English contract are ""for the public interest,"" the provision is limited to defence purposes.",73
480,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"I do not say that it depends solely on the word ""Admiralty."" It depends on the whole form of the third schedule.",73
481,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"If the words ""for'the public interest,"" when used in conjunction with the Admiralty, are limited to defence purposes, the honourable and learned member would argue that where we have the Minister of Defence connected with the public interest the same result must follow. Does the honourable and learned member make a proposal merely to have a verbal alteration with no distinction ?",73
482,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Then why oppose the amendment ?,73
483,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"I should like to point out what result would follow if the honourable and learned member's argument were good. It is provided that the Postmaster General may, during the continuance of the contract, purchase any or all of the mail steamers at a valuation. Does the honourable and learned member mean to say that we only give the power to the Government to purchase the mail ships for postal purposes? If the honourable and learned member's argument is worth anything, it means that we could not purchase the vessels for the purposes of defence. It would lead to the conclusion that if we adopted the present proposed contract we could purchase only through the Postmaster General for mail purposes.",73
484,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,I never said that.,73
485,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"If the honourable and learned member now admits, as he is forced to admit, that the Postmaster-General, having pouer to purchase the mail ships, may purchase them for defence purposes",73
486,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,For any purpose ,73
487,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"If the argument be sound, whycannot, the Admiralty in England purchase the vessels for mail purposes? I think I can leave the matter there.",74
488,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Kalgoorlie) [11.55] - I think that the Attorney-General has successfully demolished the argument of the honourable member for Corinella. To say that because a particular Department has been selected by the. Government to take power for the purchase of ships, that that must be the only Department to use those ships, and that they cannot be used for any other purpose than that associated with the Department, is as illogical as any argument that might be expected at any time from honourable members opposite.",74
489,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,I said that it indicated the contemplated purpose.,74
490,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,The honourable member said the whole purpose.,74
491,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"The honourable member for Corinella endeavoured to satisfy the House that the whole power that could be - exercised by the British Government in purchasing ships through the Admiralty, was in the direction of defending Great Britain in a time of national danger. .agree with the honourable member, and think that. the opinion expressed by the Attorney-General is the reasonable one to adopt now. I wish to get away from the point whether or not we should adopt in this contract the exact language that has ""been employed by * British Government in its contracts, and to point out as shortly as possible the position occupied by the alleged friends of the producers, who sit in Opposition. During the last few days, we have heard nothing else from honourable members opposite except such demands as, "" Where is the provision in this contract to protect the bone and sinew of this country, and to give our producers an oppor. tunitv to send their goods at reasonable freights to the markets of the world?"" Now, however, we find the same gentlemen objecting to the resumption of this contract. Although I do not approve of paying £ 1 2 5 , 0 0 0 under this agreement, still, the proposal under discussion were omitted, it would place the producers in the position of being probably the victims of a shipping monopoly in the near future.",74
492,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Then this is a socialistic proposal ?,74
493,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"I do not deny it. A provision to give the Government the right, when necessary, to take control of a line of steam-ships, in order to secure the peace, order, and good government of this country is, in my opinion, socialistic; and I think it is a very desirable provision to have in legislation of this kind. The extraordinary position occupied by my honourable friends opposite lis demonstrated in their endeavour to strike out this provision, and it is a reasonable interpretation to place upon their conduct that they are prepared to allow our produce to be placed in the hands of any monopoly which may charge any rates it deems desirable, even to the extent of crippling the industries of this country.",74
494,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Parramatta) [12.1] - In all my existence I have never heard a more consummate legal quibble than that which has been indulged in by the At torney-General.,74
495,Mr HUME COOK,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"It has discomfited the - honourable member's friend, the honourable member for Corinella.",74
496,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Not at all. All that the Attorney-General did was to wrest my honourable friend's statements from their setting and to set up a bogy of his I do not own. My honourable friend, the member for Corinella, never said that the A d miralty could not use the boats which it acquired for any other than war purposes. His argument all through was.that the A d miralty never contemplated using them for other than war purposes. That is the n e meaning of the contract alluded to, and the Attorney-General can read nothing, more into it. Of course, it does not take much to make honourable members of the Caucus Party laugh and cheer. Naturally, they cheer anything to get a socialistic proposal through. Why should they not?",74
497,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,The honourable member would prejudice the interests of the producers of this country because he believes the proposal to be socialistic.,74
498,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"I have no quarrel with the honourable member for Kal goorlie. I am quarrelling with those if quibblers in the Government who will not admit that this is a socialistic proposal. If they admitted at once that it was socialistic, there would be no more to be said, and we could go to a vote. No one 'can quarrel with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie and his colleagues. He says straight out, "" This is a piece of Sociali s m ; "" and it pleases them so much that they will not urge their own proposal as they would otherwise have done.",74
499,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"It was urged, all",75
500,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,The.tex t matter is this-that the Postmaster-General of Great Britain has no power whatever now ? under this contract with the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation 'Company either to buy or borrow a ship of any kind.,75
501,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,The British Government could buy a ship if it wanted one.,75
502,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"It cannot acquire these mail boats under the terms the contract with the Peninsular tal Steam Navigation Company. It cannot determine the contract for the purpose getting hold of the ships. Postmaster-General is absolutely powerless. Only the Admiralty can move in that direcwith tion. And the reason why the Admiralty alone has authority to move in this is clear. Honourable members opposite can twist and torture the words as they but, in their hearts, they know that the only reason for the insertion of the words in British contract is that the utilized by the Admiralty for war purposes. But if the words have the wider application suggested by the Attorney-General, why are they not inserted in the contract with the about that. Orient Steam Navigation Company ? Why are they only in the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company's contract? There never has been this power in the Orient Steam Navigation Company's contract. And why ? Because, ably, the boats of that company are not up to Admiralty standard. included in the secret subvention existing between the Admiralty and the Peninsular 1897. and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, whose boats are hired by the Admiralty purely for war purposes. The British tract says that when the public interest mands it, the terms of the subvention shall be executed. I say to the Government that if the contract has the wider application which they contend that it has, and if they can read all these other things into it . them give us the same proposal, and we tract? will be satisfied. If the British ment has these wide powers, why not put them into our contract?",75

If all these meanings can be read into the British contracts, why are let they not a Mowed to be read into this conEvidently this contract goes beGovernyond the British contracts. We know that the British contracts have no such wide application, but that the provision in this contract to which I have referred has been inserted as a socialistic sop to the Labour corner. The mail-boats running under the terms of the British contracts are reouired obtain the approval of the Admiralty in order that only such vessels may be employed as could be advantageously called upon in times of war. The British. master-General has no power to buy or charter any vessel. That right to the Admiralty alone. That being so, we say to the Government, "" Give the Minister of Defence a similar power for a similar purpose."" All else in this provision is the leather and . prunella of Socialism.",75
520,Mr SPENCE,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Darling) [12.10] If I understand the members of the Opposition aright, they wish to amend the contract so that the vessels carrying on may be purchased by the Government only for use in time of war. Apparently they would leave the Australian people at the mercy of the shipping company carrying sels, on the service, if it declared war on us. The obiect of the provision in the contract to which exception has been taken is to protect the interests of the people of this country in the event of certain contingencies arising. One of those contingencies the possibility of the shipping company which is a party to the contract joining with the existing shipping ring .which conhave trols freights and fares from the other side of the world, and may ultimately declare war on the people of Australia increasing the rates charged to shippers at this end. I hope that the Government will a weapon to protect our stand by that provision. The members of the Opposition have posed as the friends of our producers and exporters. they had read the evidence taken in recent inquiries they would know that our people have had to fight hard to secure reasonbe able lates, and that a satisfactory mail-boat service for the transport of perishable duce is of great importance to them. The of that. contract has been discussed as if it . were merely a contract for the conveyance of mails, whereas, in reality, the underlying Australia. intention is to secure the services of a fleet of up-to-date boats for the quick transport mercy of the company. of our products to the markets of the old world.",76

522,Mr SPENCE,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"It is a great pity that some honourable members are afraid of the shipping ring. word "" Socialism,"" and run away without examining the ideal for which it stands. ment of this provision. Would it not be unwise to make a contract for ten years without safeguarding the terests of those who have to do business with the old country? The need for proinsure tecting their interests is the real reason this provision is inserted, Without it, fortunes of our producers will be in the Posthands of the company.",76
523,Mr MCCOLL,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,There is too much comis reserved petition for that.,76
524,Mr SPENCE,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"There is really no competition. , The honourable member is not' alive to the facts of the case. It is not denied that freights are arranged at the other end, and the importers do not object to them, because they can be passed on to the consumers.",76

526,Mr SPENCE,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"The amount of cargo' to be carried is also regulated, and when only enough is offering for three or four vesit is often spread over six. It has been argued that, by increasing the freights on exports to Australia, the companies are put in a position to give reasonably low freights to those who send produce from Australia, particularly because our exports exceed in is quantity our imports. Then, too, high freights on imports assist local manufacturers. But in Western Australia attempts been made to regulate freights at this end, and it would be outrageous if Parliament for ten years abandoned its right to by interfere with arrangements threatening Australian interests, leaving itself without exporters. It is not contended that the rates already fixed are unreasonable, but there is no But if doubt that they control the oversea shipping sufficiently to enable them to raise freights at this end. Freights would not, of course, raised to the point which would prevent exports, but it is admitted that the compropanies could raise them to any rate short There is no doubt whatever that if this company does not join the shipping ring they will be unable to obtain freight to In the circumstances it would be madness for us to leave ourselves at the In spite of the alarming suggestion that what is proposed is socialistic, I am satisfied that before'the of the ten years period, this Parliament will see that it is wise that we should have our own shipping as a check upon the I believe that circumstances will arise which will demand the enforceI f the shipping ring which this company will join dictates interms to them, it might happen that the Government will have to buy them out to the carriage of perishable products' why in the interests of the Australian producer. the There can be no doubt that in the, near future there will be a tremendous, expansion of our export trade in fruit and other produce, and the ships proposed to be built - under this contract will not be able to carry all the freight offering from Australia. It is this outlook, probably, which justifies these people in entering upon a contract of this kind.",76
527,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Then this provision does not mean what is meant by the provision in the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company's contract, but something more.",77
528,Mr SPENCE,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"I cannot understand honourable members of the Opposition being such sticklers for copying what England has done. We should do what the Government have proposed, and that is consider Australian conditions. Mr JoHNSON -^They say the conditions .are the same.",77
529,Mr SPENCE,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Neve r mind what anybodv says. We are here to make this as good a contract as we can. Mr (MCCAY - The honourable member contemplates the clause being operative to take over the ships for commercial purposes. "" Mr SPENCE - I say that if the clause is not so wordted as to give the Government power to take over the ships for commercial purposes, the Government should certainly see that it is framed in such a way that that can. be done. I look upon this vision as supplying a weapon in the hands of the Government for controlling the shipping company and to prevent them acting unreasonably towards Australian producers.",77

531,Mr SPENCE,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Not necessarily. I do not think that it would be wise for the Government to buy out the company. in\ opinion, it would be far better that we should build our own ships.",77
532,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Shoul d we build them in Australia?,77
533,Mr SPENCE,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"If the honourable member pleases; but I do not think that they could be built at Mort's Dock yet. view is that the provision will enable us to prevent Australian producers from being fleeced, and that without it we should be at the mercy qf a shipping combine over which we can exercise no control whatever. I cannot understand the attitude of the Opposition in desiring to so limit the scope of the provision that the boats could only be taken over in the event of some one declaring war upon us. What I desire is that we should be prepared for a declaration of war by the shipping companies themselves.",77

535,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"North Sydney) [12.21] - I learn that various constructions have been put upon certain words which I used in the speech I made in connection with this contract yesterday, which are not warranted by what I said. Quoting from the Hansard report, I find that what I said wasIn these circumstances I cannot vote' for the amendment. I am not going to say that under certain conditions there might not be justification for a State-owned service. If we found persons taking advantage of a monopoly which they had established, and making it'absolutely injurious to the interests of Australia, some action might have to be taken, but I do say that nothing of that kind has arisen, nor is it likely to arise with the free competition of the ocean. That is what I said, and that is what I stand by, and I protest against any interpretations which are altogether wide of the pro- mark being placed upon my words. I have only a word to say about this amendment. I am absolutely against the proposal in the contract, and would substitute for it the provision contained in the British contracts, which the Ministry have sought to make it appear-probably without knowledge-is similar to the provision in this contract. As the honourable member for Parramatta has said, if it is similar, why should not In the Government accept it, and if the provision in this contract differs from it, what is the reason for the difference? Is it not that, instead of having the power merely to taike possession of these steamers in an emergency such as war, they may vest the power in the hands of the PostmasterMy General to acquire, for any or for no reason but a socialistic reason, possession of these boats? The Prime Minister said that the Postmaster-General read from a British contract a provision similar to that in the present proposal. I have no doubt at' all that what the honourable gentleman read was paragraph 32 of the Peninsular. 9 Mail Service and Oriental Steam Navigation Company's contract, which is as follows :Subject to the piovisions of the Subvention Agreement between the Admiralty and the company, dated 3rd' April, 1894, or of any subsequent Subvention Agreement, the Admiralty shall at any lime during the continuance of this Agreement, if they shall consider it necessary so to do, have power and be at liberty to purchase all or any of the mail-ships at a valuation, or to charter the same exclusively for Her Majesty's service, at a rate of hire to be mutually fixed and agreed on by them and the company, or, in case of difference, to be determined by arbitration, ancl every or any difference as to the amount of valuation or hire or rate of hire so to be paid shall be determined by arbitration. That reads as though it were similar to the proposal in this contract, but when we attach to it the schedule which gives the grounds for the acquisition of these boats, it is not so.",77
536,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,What schedule?,78
537,Mr DUGALDTHOMSO N,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,The schedule quoted by the honourable and learned member for Corinella.,78
538,Mr I SAACS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,I do not think there is one in that contract.,78
539,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,It is subject to the provisions of the subvention agreement between the Admiralty and the company.,78
540,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"I think that the honourable member is, perhaps, .inadvertently overlooking the fact that the schedules referred to were in connection with the Cunard contract.",78
541,Mr DUGALDTHOMSO N,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"The schedules were quoted from that contract, I understand.",78
542,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,That is a different one.,78
543,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"At any rate, we have had quoted the only conditions which apply, and it is shown that they apply to the purchase of the steamers for war purposes. Reading the paragraph alone, it might be taken as corresponding practically with the contract. But, reading it with the subvention agreement, and also with the schedules attached to the Cunard agreement, it is shown that it refers to the purchase of the vessels for war purposes. After that clear statement of the position by honourable members, the Ministry cannot get out of this position, either they thought they were doing the same thing as the British Government, or they are acting on the principle advocated by honourable members in the corner, who have openly avowed that they support the proposal of the Government because it is [REPRESENTATIVES.] to Europe. socialistic. The Ministry can get out of their difficulty if they wish to imitate the English contract, as they stated at first. They have a reason for not dbing so, and that is because they are bowing to the socialistic desire of members of the Labour Party, who hope to find a complaisant Postmaster-General in the future to accomplish the acquisition of the vessels.",78
544,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Where would we get the monev from ?,78
545,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"The Ministry would hope to get the money from the British lender, I suppose. The right honourable member-must know that the members of the Commission of which the honourable member for Earrier was chairman proposed to borrow money in Australia for the purpose.",78
546,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,But Parliament would have to approve of the purcliase of the vessels first.,78
547,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Parliament might be asked to approve after the agreement to acquire the vessels had been made.,78
548,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,No . before.,78
549,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"The Government could commit itself to the purchase of the vessels without reference to Parliament, and the latter could only refuse to ratify the Act by displacing them.",78
550,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,That would be a risky job to undertake.,78
551,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Risk y undertakings have been entered into before now by those who depended upon the vote of a certain number of honourable members.,78
552,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Not involving the raising of several millions of money, I hope.",78
553,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"I do not know about that. At any rate, that is the position. The Government profess to wish to copy the British contract. They see clearly now that they have not done so, and they refuse to alter their own terms, and by that means do what they at first professed they were ready to do. Mr HUTCHISON^Hindmarsh) [12.30]. - I cannot understand the attitude of the members of the Opposition. The honourable member for Parramatta has stated that the honourable member for Corinella had never said that the Imperial Government have not the power to purchase the vessels to be used for purposes other than defence, and the honourable member for North Sydney has told us that the intention as that the Government shall be able to purchase the vessels for only the purpose of defence. If the honourable member for Corinella really meant that the Government have power to purchase the vessels for any - other purpose, that is an admission that they would have the right to use them for anv other purpose, and that it was quite right that they should have that power.",78
554,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"It was not the implied object, he meant to say.",79
555,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,That is not the point at all. The honourable member for - Corinella admits that the Imperial Governportunity ment have the right to purchase these vesover sels either for any purpose or defence purposes. Which is it? we had a denial that it was as the honourable member for CoriinelLa said for the one purpose.,79
556,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,Le t them put in these provisions and then it will be clear.,79
557,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,There are reasons for not putting in the provisions. We have no right to consider what provisions the Imperial Government has put in any contract. The question is what we ought to do.,79
558,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,""" Australia for the Australians.""",79
559,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"I would rather individuality have Australia for the Australians than for the foreigners. The only trouble, apparently, with members of the Opposition is that the wording of the contract makes it that power is given to the, Government be used for a socialistic purpose, and placate the Labour Party. If that power had existed in the contract with the Peninclause. sular and Oriental Steam Navigation Comperial pany, or the Orient Steam Navigation Company, at the time when our producers Were being robbed by the mail companies, I am quite satisfied that the producers o Australia would not have had a word to say about Socialism. On the contrary, they would have said, "" F o r goodness' try to see that justice is done to us."" a similar thing were to occur, we should are today. have every producer not talking a wordabout Socialism, but saying,, "" Give us ter terms than we are getting-d o not allow us to be robbed by the shipping companies."" Apparently the members of the Opposition have forgotten all about the report of Butter Commission, although few months since it was presented. Seemingly, they have forgotten all about the secret rebates which were paid, one firm alone getting £ 1 2 , 0 0 0 odd in twelve months from a mail company, in order to allow them to charge a most exorbitant rate for carrying produce. Is that the kind of thing which the members of the Opposition wish to see continued? I do not.",79
560,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,There is a law against all that sort of thing now.,79
561,Mr MCCOLL,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,We have altered all that without buying the ships.,79
562,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,I wish to prevent the mail companies from having the opto repeat that sort of thing. All the world private enterprise is confor only tinually fleecing somebody. First,79
563,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"If the Government were to get the running of these ships there would be fleecing, too.",79

565,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,That is the old argument of destroying freedom and responsibility for the purpose of preventing persons from doing a certain thing.,79
566,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Are not the great shipping combines destroying freedom and ? The only question is which is the best form of collectivism. Is it shipping combines, or that system which allows people to control these matters for the clear benefit of the whole community? I am to satisfied that no argument has been adto vanced here to-night to induce a single member to change his vote in regard to this We have nothing to do with I m contracts. I hope that we are going to abandon the practice of copying oldworld agreements, which are possibly fifty years behind the times. I am glad to say f that in some things we are in advance of the times, as I hope we shall soon be in regard to many other things. If , however, we fol sake low the example of the Opposition, 100 If years hence we shall be exactly where we The honourable member for North Sydney has clearly shown that the betwhole purpose which he has in view is to give the Government of the Commonwealth the right to purchase the ships for war purposes only.

568,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Undoubtedl y I do care as I have proved by my votes. However, at this hour in the morning I do not intend to discuss any question with the honourable member. I am very pleased to see that the Government are likely to stand firmly by their agreement.",80
569,Mr LONSDALE,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"New England) [12.35]-The dispute between the Government and the Opposition, if there is one, arises from the fact that the Government have represented that the clause in the proposed new contract is similar to that contained in the Imperial mail contracts. Now, the Labour Party are defending the clause adopted by the Government, because it differs from the Imperial provision in that it would enable the Government to acquire the steamers for commercial purposes. The Opposition have so far stood by the Government in their resistance of the socialistic propositions put forward during the discussion of this contract. If the Government had acted in a straight-forward manner I could have admired them, but in framing the clause in the contract in such a way as to meet the desires of the Labour Party they have not put the position so clearly as to entitle them to claim that their conduct has been altogether aboveboard. If the Government had intended to insert a provision similar to that contained in the Imperial mail contracts, there would have been no necessity to resort to ambiguous language. Every one knows that the clause in the proposed contract goes very much further than the Imperial provision. Personally, I am entirely opposed to anv of these socialistic proposals. The honourable member for Darwin argued that the clause as it stood would act as a deterrent upon the ship-owners, who might be disposed to exact high freights from producers. But there is nothing in the contract to prevent any such abuse of power.",80
570,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Does the honourable member think that it would be less socialistic if the Minister of Defence, instead of the Postmaster-General, were empowered to purchase the ships?",80
571,Mr LONSDALE,COMMONWEALTH TREASURY,"Surely the honourable member recognises the distinction between empowering the Government to take over the vessels at a time of great national stress and permitting them to acquire them for purely commercial purposes.

At this late hour I have no intention to delay the House. I believe it is the feeling of honourable members that the shorter I make my speech the more votes my proposal will command. I do not ask that the mail steamers shall visit Hobart regularly throughout the year. But as honourable members are aware, there are three months during which there is a large export of fruit to London, and at the present time it is necessary to charter steamers to convey it there. Consequently I ask that fortnightly during the months of February, March, and April the mail steamers should make Hobart a port of call.",80

T'he honourable member for Barrier may rest assured lhat if the vessels visit Hobart during the months I have indicated, they will be able to take away as much fruit as they can carry. One point which 1 desire to emphasize is that our fruit-growers are further removed from the English market than are their competitors on the mainland, and I claim that they should be provided with equal shipping facilities.
