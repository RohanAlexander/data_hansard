0,NA,Unknown,"HHouse of ftepresentatibes. Friday, Si October, 1913. Mr SPEAKER took the chair a.m., and read prayers. ELECTORAL BILL .",12
1,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"In view of the fact that yesterday the House resolved that a Royal Commission should be appointed to inquire into electoral matters, does not the Prime Minister think that it would be better to postpone the consideration of the Electoral Bill until the Committee's report has been received ? . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I am quite aware that the great desire of honourable members opposite is to postpone the transaction of all business, and, in particular, consideration of the measure which the honourable member has mentioned. PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS.",12
2,Mr FLEMING,Unknown,"I understand that yesterday evening the honourable member for Darwin charged me with having stated that I was an Australian, and a self-made man. I certainly claim to be an Australian, and can substantiate the claim, but neither here nor elsewhere have I ever claimed to be a self-made man. . On the contrary, I am proud of my ancestors, and . if I do as well in my life-time as some of them did in theirs I shall be quite satisfied. I object to the honourable member, or any one else, putting into my mouth words that I have not uttered. Mr KING O'MALLEY - It is true thab I referred to the honourable member for Robertson yesterday, but I did so because, when he first entered the House, and before he had passed through the proper parliamentary refrigeration, he called me a blatant American, though he had never met me. I knew that the words were used in a state of excitement, and I thought that I would wait until he cooled down a bit before replying. Owing to the fact that I was not born here, I cannot claim to be an Australian, but if the important and interesting ceremony of my birth were to occur again I should try arrange to have it here, so that theremight be no trouble about that matter. I understood the honourable member to say that he was made here in Australia, and that he made himself. I added yesterday that I was pleased to hear that he claimed to be a self-made man, because that statement relieved Almighty God of a great responsibility. The honourable member will understand that there is no ill at 10.30 feeling in what I said. DEFENCE REGULATIONS.",12
3,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"Las t week I asked the Minister representing the Minister of Defence if he would have bound copies of the Defence Regulations supplied to honourable members, and he graciously agreed to have such a copy placed in the Library; but, in view of what transpired yesterday in this House and in another place, I ask if he will try to arrange for each member to be supplied with a copy.",12
4,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I think that what is asked for is quite feasible, and I shall the consult my honourable colleague with a view to seeing if effect can be given to the- honourable member's wishes. SMALL-POX OUTBREAK.",12
5,Mr WEST,Unknown,"Has the Prime Minister seen the report which wag published in the Melbourne Argus of a meeting held at Sydney, and presided over by the Lord Mayor of that city, at which a resolution was carried asking the Commonwealth Government to remove the quarantine embargo that has been placed upon it . In this connection I draw the honourable gentleman's attention to the fact that Sir William MCMillan supported a motion affirming that there was no need for the embargo, and, further, that the Premier of New South Wales stated that there was no need for it. This is a momentous matter, affecting half-a-million of people, I ask the Prime Minister if he will give consideration to the decisions arrived at.",13
6,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I have read.the .report referred to, and I may tell the honourable member that I think that, under the circumstances, the Premier of New South Wales had a hide to be at the meeting ",13
7,Mr CARS,Unknown,"What does "" hide "" mean? That is an undignified expression.",13
8,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Of course, the Premier of New South Wales is to be permitted to criticise me to his heart's content, and I must not make a reply of any kind. In my judgment, he is responsible fo; all the trouble. . Mr TUDOR - That is hardly an answer to the question.",13
9,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I was asked if I:knew that the Premier of New South Wales was at the meeting. I say I do know that he was there, and that I think he would have done better to attend to his own duties in this matter.",13
10,Mr WEST,Unknown,"On a point of order, I ask if I shall have an opportunity to make a statement in reply to that of the Prime Minister f",13
11,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"-No . At this stage the honourable member may only ask a question, seeking for information, and in asking a question he may not say more than is necessary to make his meaning clear. On the contrary, a Minister of whom a question is asked is allowed some latitude. He has to give information, and must, therefore, make a statement, but that statement must not go beyond what iB a fair answer to the question. . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I read the report of the meeting, .and know that among those present were the Premier of New South Wales, and my friend Sir William MCMillan, so that there wonld appear to be another Fusion over there. It waa stated that only about 1,000 persons attended.",13
12,Mr WEST,Unknown,The meeting was held in the vestibule of the Town Hall ,13
13,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Then it was noti an extraordinarily large meeting. .I am glad that the meeting was not large, because this is not a matter to be made the subject of popular clamour and appeal. There is no objection to citizens voicing their opinion, but I am glad that there was no attempt at a huge demonstration of the nature of some demonstrations which have been held. The position of Sydney is under very serious consideraand tion, and I hope that my honourable friend will believe that as soon as we think the quarantine embargo can safely be lifted it will be lifted,. POSTAGE OF CIRCULARS.",13
14,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Some time ago I asked the Postmaster-General whether he would) give consideration to the fact that tradesmen of populous suburban areas are entitled to the same postal privileges as are enjoyed by those doing business in the city itself, and he informed me that he would' do so,",13
15,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"I think I told the honourable member that there is great difficulty in doing what he suggests, and that the departmental officers advise the continuance of the present system, which requires the posting of large parcels of circulars at the central office. PAPER. Mr KELLY laid upon the table the following paper: Railway Track-Former-Particular s re the "" Castles machine used on the Kalgoorlie toPort Augusta line. AUSTRALIAN NAVY. QUESTIONS OF DISCIPLINE.",13
16,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, upon noticex. Whether general dissatisfaction has been ex-, pressed by the crews of HMAS. Australia,. Sydney and Melbourne in connection with their victualling? 2. Will the Minister inquire into the accuracy of the statement that 8o or go men of the above mentioned vessels, whose time expires in April next, intend to leave the Naval Service owing, to their dissatisfaction? - 3. Is it a fact that, on board HMAS Sydney, is. 4d. per day per man is allowed for (victualling the crew? 4. Have the crew been supplied with .margarine instead of butter? 5. Does the paymaster hold a balance of j f soo out of the victualling allowance? 6. Is it correct, as alleged, that the crew of the Sydney have been fed continuously upon tinned foods, and that sardines in bulging tins, suggestive of ptomaine conditions, have been supplied to them, while officers have received fresh meat at Capetown, Albany, and Sydney? 7. Have the men entered a protest upon the quarter-deck without any reform in the victualling being made? 8. Will the Minister inquire into the question of the marriage allowance and alleged dissatisfaction of the men in connection therewith? 9. Will the Minister cause inquiry to be into the circumstances of the death of a seaman on the Australia on the voyage?",13
17,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am going to answer this series of questions, but I desire to express the hope that at the beginning of our new naval training system honourable members will not bring to this House questions of ordinary discipline.",14
18,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"I sincerely hope that we shall do so, and I tell the Prime Minister that he will get them. . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Then I can only say that if matters of ordinary discipline are brought up here they will be ignored.",14
19,Mr FENTON,Unknown,The civil authority is going to prevail.,14
20,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Certainl y it is; but no navy can be carried on if every .little grievance is to be brought here from the Admiral, Such a thing is not done - in any other part of the world.  stick to that decision. - Mr HOWE - Does the Prime Minister - regard it as a petty matter when the men have to go on the quarter-deck and enter' their protest? - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I have not used the word "" petty.""",14
21,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! cannot be debated.,14
22,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Having made this statement, I am going to answer this series of questions. The answer to the - first question isNo complaints have been received from Aust r a l i a or Melbourne. Crew of Sydney have asked for alteration in system, and a committee ' tb consider matter was appointed on the 17th - October. As to the second questionW ill the Minister inquire into the accuracy of - the statement that 80 or 90 men of the above'- mentioned vessels, whose time expires in April next, intend to leave the Naval Service owing to their dissatisfaction, the answer is- Nothing is known of this, but total number of men in fleet whose time' expires on or before 30th April next is"" only 40. This is one of the questions which, 1 think, ought not to be put in the House in this way. Nothing is known of the statement, and it is a matter entirely for the commanders of these vessels. The answer to the third question is "" Yes "" ; whilst the answer to question 4, "" Have the crew been supplied with margarine instead 'of butter?"" isYes, on occasions during passages through made 1 tropics part issue pf margarine was made. Experience has shown that in the tropics margarine keeps better than butter. The reply to the fifth question, ""Does the paymaster hold a balance of £200 out of the victualling allowance?"" isYes,, owing to length of sea passage. The allowance of is. 4d. was based on Australian conditions, and it is probable that food-stuffs were obtained in England at lower prices before ship left. That is a perfectly feasible explanation, and it shows the undesirableness' of bringing all these matters before the House. The answer to the sixth question is "" No,"" while the answer to the seventh isComplaint was made and dealt with. The next question isW ill the Minister inquire into'the question of the marriage allowance and alleged dissatisfaction of the men in connection therewith? The reply isSeveral matters in connection with the marriage allowance are now under consideration. That, I think, is a perfectly proper question, but I hope that honourable members will make a distinction between ordinary matters of general administration of the Naval Department and matters concerning the discipline of the men on board these vessels. The answer to the last question Questions isThe inquiry required by the King's regulations was held immediately after the accident, and report has been received. .No further inquiry is deemed necessary. NORFOLK ISLAND BILL . SECOND READING. Debate resumed from 16th September (vide page 12'47), on motion by Mr. GLYNNThat this Bill be now read a second time.",14
23,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Barrier) [10.52] - It is not my intention to . delay the passing of this Bill since I favour the proposal that the Commonwealth shall take over Norfolk Island. I realise that Australia at present is faced with a large number of obligations and. some very heavy burdens. Amongst these is the Northern Territory, and I was pleased to hear the Prime Minister admit yesterday that in connection with it we have a very big problem to solve. For three years, whilst the honourable gentleman was in Opposition, he did not seem to think that the administration of the Territory was a very serious problem, but since his assumption of office he has apparently changed his view. Papua is another problem, but the destiny of Australasia, undoubtedly, is that she shall have the predominating influence in the Soutli Pacific. Norfolk Island is not a very large island, and I do not think that its transfer will impose upon Australia a very serious burden. In-view of the fact that it is about 200 miles nearer New Zealand than it is to Australia, I should have liked to see it placed under the control of that Dominion, because New Zealand will have to take, and certainly will take, her share of insuring the maintenance of Australasia's predominating influence in the South Pacific. Apparently, however, the people of Norfolk Island desire to be associated with the Commonwealth, and, that being so, no objection should be offered to this proposal. This Bill seems to embody all to which the late Government were prepared to agree; but, in clause 15, there is a proposal to which we had some objection. It was for that reason, indeed, that the Bill was not submitted by us to Parliament. The passing of that clause will mean embodying, for all time, in the Constitution of the Island, a provision that Free Trade shall prevail in respect of goods imported into Australia, provided they are produced in NorfolkIsland. I do not know that there is much ih such a provision to occasion any concern, but I do not think ft wise to place it in the Constitution itself. Norfolk Island is about 600 miles away from Australia, and it might be found advisable at some time or other to do away with Free ""Trade between the two places. Whilst we were not prepared to embody this provision in the Bill providing for the government of the Island we were ready to submit, simultaneously, a separate Bill declaring that for the time being there should be Free Trade be Mr Thomas. tween Norfolk Island and Australia, so that if any future Government desired to make an alteration, with the consent of the people, it would be able to do so. The point, however, is not a very serious one, and if , after discussion, honourable members think it well to accept the clause as it stands, I shall offer no objection. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee: Clause 1 (Short title).",14
24,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Maribyrnong) [10.58]. - I understand that Norfolk Island was previously under the Government of New South Wales, and I desire to know whether I am correct in assuming that that Government has practically said in effect to the Commonwealth, "" We do not desire to control this island any longer, and we shall be glad if you will take it over.""",15
25,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The New South Wales Government is acquiescing in our taking it over, so that there will be no difficulty in that regard.",15
26,Mr FENTON,Unknown,And the people of Norfolk Island desire that it shall be taken over by the Commonwealth?,15
27,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Yes . Clause' agreed to. - Clauses 2 and 3 agreed to. Clause 4 (Continuance of laws).  clause provides that laws in force in Norfolk Island may be altered or repealed by Ordinance made in pursuance of this Act. It seems to me to give rise to a very important consideration - In connection with the Northern Territory, for instance, important questions which should come under the immediate purview of this Parliament are determined by Ordinances instead of by Acts of the Parliament itself. I recognise that Ordinances cannot have the effect of law if the Parliament objects to them, but I should like the Minister to say whether he does not think it would be better to deal with these matters by actual legislation rather than by way of Ordinance.",15
28,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Darling Downs-Minister of Trade and Customs) [11.0] - As the island is some distance away, I do not think that it would lead to any more efficiency in its administration to do everything by Act of Parliament in this House, instead of by Ordinance. I would point out that the power to make Ordinances is vested in the Governor General in Council, that all Ordinances must be submitted to the Federal Parliament within thirty days after the making thereof, and that the House has complete power of disallowance. I think the honourable member will find that this provision will work satisfactorily. Clause agreed to. Clause 5 agreed to. Clause 6 (Continuance of Executive Council).",15
29,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Maribyrnong) [11.2]. - Can the Minister in charge of the Bill tell us the method by which this Executive Council is elected ? Are the members of the Council subject to election by the inhabitants of Norfolk Island ?,16
30,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Darling Downs-Minister of Trade and Customs) [11.3] - This clause provides that the Executive Council of Norfolk Island now existing, shall continue, subject to alteration, or abolition, by Ordinance made under this measure. Two members of the existing Executive Councils are elected by the male residents of Norfolk Island, and four members are nominated by the Governor of New South Wales.",16
31,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"That will be the Governor General, in future?",16
32,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Yes .,16
33,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Can the inhabitants of the island bring about any alteration in their Constitution ?,16
34,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"That will be subject to Ordinance, except, so far as provided by this Bill .",16
35,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Barrier) [11.4] - I notice that the election of the locallynominated members of the Executive Council is confined to the male adults. Will the Minister be prepared to issue an Ordinance so that the women of the island shall have the same voting power as the men ?,16
36,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Darling Downs-Minister of Trade and Customs) [11.6] - The honorablo member realises that this is merely a Bill providing for the continuance of the laws now in existence relating to Norfolk Island. It also"" makes arrangements for creating a body that will frame new laws. The honourable member asks something in regard to a line of policy that may be adopted in the future. T shall brine; his suggestion before the Minister of External Affairs, so that, when the question of making an Ordinance relating to representation is before him, the matter of extending the franchise to the women on the island may be taken into consideration.",16
37,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Barrier) [11.6] - We are not likely to hear much about Norfolk Island for a considerable time after it is taken over by the Commonwealth, and I would like an assurance from the Minister now that the Government will bring i u an Ordinance extending to the women of the island the right of voting.",16
38,Mr GROOM,Unknown,My own feeling towards the question is one of sympathy. I shall make representations to the Minister.,16
39,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Perhaps the Minister of External Affairs wil l deal with this matter on the thir d reading.,16
40,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Yes ; you can bring the matter up then.,16
41,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [11.7] I welcome the fact that Norfolk Island is coming unaer the control of the Commonwealth; but an injustice, unfortunately done to the islanders by the New South Wales Government, 'may continue. The islanders were promised that they could elect their own officials to govern them, and that they could hold their houses for all time; but, fifty years after that promise was made by the late Queen Victoria, the islanders were evicted by the New South Wales Government in office in 1906-7, and very unjustly treated. Therefore, I hope that provivision will be made for a very wide franchise, and that'the islanders will be able to elect their own magistrates, subject, of course, to the appointments being approved by the Commonwealth Government. The plan for the government of the island was originally set out by Mr . Labouchere, a very wise officer of the I m perial Colonial Office, who said that it was essentially an experiment in land tenure. That experiment was very successful until the Nev South Wales Government interfered too much with it . Clause agreed to. Clause 7 agreed to. Clause 8 (Laws for Norfolk Island).  may be called upon to incur considerable expenditure upon Norfolk Island. Last year we spent £68,000 on Papua, and the amount is to be increased this year to £138,000. If we are going to take on this additional expense, though we have practically no control over Norfolk Island, I would like to hear from the Minister what the extent of our liability wiU be.",16
42,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Darling Downs-Minister of Trade and Customs) [11.10] - B y the Commonwealth taking over No r f o lk - Island, the Government of New South Wales will be relieved of an annual expenditure of £1,500. Of course, further expenditure will be necessitated by the island coming within the sphere of the Federal jurisdiction, but I do not think the honourable meinber need have any apprehension that any excessive expenditure will be incurred. Clause agreed to. Clause 9 (Appointment of Officers).",17
43,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"Herbert) [11.11] Am I tounderstand that when this clause places the power of appointing officers solely in the hands of the Governor General, it is to be taken to mean "" the Governor General in Council""?",17
44,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Yes .,17
45,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"Can we learn from the Minister what is likely to be the cost of the appointment of the officers referred to in this clause, so that we may know exactly what our expenditure is going to be ? If the revenue is not sufficient to meet the expenditure, what do we contemplate doing to make up the deficit?",17
46,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"It will be met by a Commonwealth grant, as is done in the case of Papua. Clause agreed to. Clause 10 (Grants of Land).",17
47,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Maribyrnong) [11.12]. - Accordin g to this clause, the Governor General may make grants or other dispositions of Crown lands in Norfolk Island. I understand the land is now held under the perpetual lease system, but I would like to know if any of the area has become alienated, also what revenue is received from the land. Further, I would like to hear whether the island justifies the beautiful picture the Minister of External Affairs presented to us in moving the second reading-whethe r it is absolutely a community of leaseholders'",17
48,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [11.13] On my two visits it was explained to me by some of the descendants of the Pitcairn Islanders that they were not being treated too well, as the amount of arable land is limited. The.time was when an islander could bring a wife from the mainland and set up a home on a small farm of 20 acres, or, if a sailor landed from one of the ships aud married a daughter of - the island, they could start a household ini that way. I understand that this condition is now changed. The Anglican^ Melanesian Mission have full .possession of. 1,100 acres of land in the island. I do not question that, but I regret the mission are teaching the dead Motu language instead of the English the ministers are proud to speak. Is there anything in the Bill that will forbid the aggregation of land in larger quantities than, say, 40 acres of the good rich land, because the Islanders assured me that they could live comfortably on 20 acres of that class of l and t The Minister knows clearly that the settlement was established for the sake of relieving the Pitcairn Islanders, and also for the purpose of experimenting in a certain form of land tenure. I do not think a law relating to land is to be found in any other part of the British Dominions similar to that in force in Norfolk Island. I may remind honourable members that the captain of the war vessel who annexed Norfolk Island promised the people, in the name of Queen Victoria, that the buildings lef t by the military and officials of the convict system would be given to them. They were promised that they would be established in better homes than they then occupied. I have no doubt that the church lands w i ll be made a proper use of, but I hope that somethingwill be done to prevent private individuals securing an unreasonable area of laud, in view of the fact that the total area which can be cultivated in Norfolk Island is very small.",17
49,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Darling Downs-Min ister of Trade and Customs) [11.16] I may inform honourable members that the total area of the island is only 8,528 acres, and 5,400 acres have already been alienated in freeholds. The grants to the church are freeholds. I have a map of the island here, which the honourable member for Melbourne might like to see, on which the grants to the church, and alienated lands, are shown. As regards the form of land tenure to be adopted, the Bill contemplates nothing more thanthe taking over of the island under existing conditions, but provides for legislative power, by Ordinance, to frame a policy with respect to land and other questions as matters develop. I do not well see how we could lay down in this Bill details of a policy on land and other questions. The Bill provides for the disposi*tion of the land in accordance with law, and that is the usual form of power provided for i u every Constitution.",17
50,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Capricornia) [11.19] I am afraid that it is hasty legislation to pass ten clauses of a Bill in one morning, and that it is necessary I should make an observation or two. The question of a land policy for Norfolk Island, now under review, is a most important matter. When honourable members opposite were on this side, they had a great deal to say against the leasehold system, and in favour of the private ownership of land.",18
51,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,Freehold s have been granted for nearly all the land on Norfolk Island.,18
52,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"The Minister has ex- plained that 5,000 acres out of about 8,000 acres have been alienated in that way; but it wil l be for the Government of the Commonwealth to frame a policy for the disposal of the remaining 3,000 acres. This legislation seems to me rather pathetic. It is dimcult to deal with such a large question as a land policy in such a small measure. I - have very great sympathy with the people of Norfolk Island. I am sorry that we cannot put a sum of money on the Estimates to bring them all over to Australia and settle them on some of the fertile lands of the Commonwealth.  another race.",18
53,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,I did not say that.  suggestion would involve that.,18
54,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,I am extremely doubtf u l whether the people of any other race would go to Norfolk Island. The ancestors of the people who are there now went there under very peculiar circumstances.,18
55,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"They are a splendid race, and are very fond of their home.",18
56,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I am aware of that ; but there are many who would like to come to Australia. The policy of the present Government for the disposal of the 3,000 acres remaining unalienated in Norfolk Island will be to sell the land, or give it away. I admit that there are great difficulties in the way of educating the public as to the advantages which must follow where the lands are retained for the benefit of the people as a whole, instead of being cut up and sold to in dividuals who, in the course of time, will levy very heavy taxes on those who are without land. I read the other day that it would be possible to buy the whole of the lands of the United Kingdom for about £52,000,000, and it would be a great bargain for the British people to purchase it .",18
57,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,The lands of London would be worth more than that.,18
58,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I know that in London the land is of extremely high value, but there is agricultural land in Scotland and in other parts of the United Kingdom which could be bought more cheaply than land can be bought in Australia. I met a Scottish immigrant who took up land in New Zealand; worked it for a few years, and then sold out. He told me that he was going back to Scotland to buy agricultural land, because he could get it cheaper there than in New Zealand. I have said that it is very difficult to educate the public as to the advantages of the Crown ownership of land. I paid 'a visit to South Australia some little time ago, and was shown the "" B l o c k e r s "" homes there. Some twenty years ago there was an unemployed difficulty in South Australia, and the State Parliament was induced by the Labour party to purchase some lands in the suburbs of Adelaide. They were cut up into 5 and 10-acre blocks, and leased to the unemployed at a rental of, I think, 5 per cent, on the purchase money. The "" B l o c k e r s "" had to pay, I think, l s . per week for their blocks, whilst £ 5 0 was advanced to them to enable them to cultivate them and build their homes. The "" Blockers"" were doing very well until the land speculator came along, and pointed out to them what a splendid thing it would be for them to get the freehold of their blocks, and then sell out at a high figure. The ""Blockers,"" who were formerly unemployed, formed themselves into a society to secure the freehold of their blocks. At the elections they fought the Labour party, who were responsible for securing for them this great concession, and won. I believe that in many cases the "" Blockers "" got the freehold of their blocks, and sold out. I am informed that some of these men subsequently went into business, and are now no better off than they were twenty years ago. I am afraid that this was due to the unfortunate spirit of gambling with which we have to contend in Australia, and which is very hard to eradicate. Sometimes I think that we might do something to eradicate it if we could induce the people to stop gambling, generally in such matters as Tattersall's consultations, for instance. The Labour party were quite willing to make at r i al of the public ownership of lands in the Northern Territory, the Federal Territory, and New Guinea, where no very large vested interests have to be dealt with.  surely knows that the aggregation of large estates in Australia has taken place to a greater extent in connection wibh leaseholds than in connection with freeholds.",18
59,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"What the honourable member says is very true, but that is 'only part of the process of aggregation that is going on all over the world, not only in connection with landed property, but in connection with industries, and does not prove that the private ownership of land is desirable. If honourable members will look at the lists of runs held in Queensland they will find that the pioneer squatters, like the Leslies and others of whom we read, have practically all disappeared, and the leaseholders now are mortgage companies, banking concerns, and other financial institutions. The number of leaseholders in Queensland has been greatly reduced, whilst the aggregation of estates has proceeded. I have confessed that it is very difficult to induce the public to approve of the Crown ownership of lands. think that we should, so far as possible, make a .commencement in connection with town lands. I do not suppose there will be many town lots to be dealt with on Norfolk Island, but almost every week town lota are proclaimed in different parts of the Commonwealth, and no provision is made for keeping these lands for the municipalities or the State Governments. _ A very considerable revenue might be gained from the municipal ownership of town lands, which might be leased at very reasonable rental. At present townships are cut-up into small blocks, which are sold to individuals for, perhaps, £ 5 each. In ten or twenty years' time their value may run up to £500, and in the course of fifty years they may probably be worth tens of thousands of pounds.  member anticipate such enhancement of - values in Norfolk Island?",19
60,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"No , but it is a convenient peg on which to hang a political hat. We desire information. We are thirsting for it. No University student was ever more anxious for it than we are. Honourable members opposite should give us credit for that. . We do not pretend to know everything. We want to learn. My honourable friend the Minister of Trade and Customs will have had bime during the last few minutes to collect his scattered thoughts. I am sure that he must have been confused by the rapidity with which the Committee agreed to nine clauses of this Bill, and we must recollect that the honourable gentleman has also succeeded in putting through another Bill today. I wish to know whether the Government have abandoned their ideas on freehold tenure, as they have abandoned so many of their professed principles during the last three months. They were anti-Socialists on the stump, but since their advent to office they have become pronounced Socialists. They are going to establish an Agricultural Bureau to benefit the farmers, and it is quite possible that the Minister of Trade and Customs, the strong individualist and antiSocialist of a few weeks ago, has abandoned his freehold principles in the case of Norfolk Island. In regard to the 3,000 acres which belong to the Crown there, I say that they should be let at a reasonable rental.  I Norfolk Island has already been sold.",19
61,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Roughl y speaking, two-thirds of it have been alienated. Five thousand acres have been disposed of, and 3,000 acres remain-. It may be that in course of time some man may come along and wish to run a sort of Cafe Monaco there. I am sure that the honourable member for Barrier must contemplate such a prospect with alarm, and there are more wowsers than he upon this side of the Chamber. I desire to know whether the Government have abandoned their so called principles in order to hang on to office, or whether they intend to give effect to them in this Bill?",19
62,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Barrier) [11.35] - I move That the following words be added to the clause :"" No Crown lands in Norfolk Island shall be sold or disposed of for any estate of freehold except in pursuance of some contract entered into before the commencement of this Act."" These words are taken from the Northern Territory Acceptance Act . I quite agree with the Minister of Trade and Customs that a Bill for taking over an island is not a proper one in which to embody the details of land tenure. But I think that we have a right to lay. down the principle upon which future Ordinances are to be based. If my amendment be embodied in this measure, any subsequent Ordinances must be framed in accordance with its terms. That such a provision can be i troduced into a Constitution Bill is evidenced by the fact that a similar provision is incorporated in the Northern Territory Acceptance Act and the Papua Act of 1905.",19
63,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,The present Minister of Trade and Customs supported the proposal when the Papua Bill was under consideration.,20
64,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,I do not think there was a very long discussion upon the proposal to insert a similar provision in the Northern Territory Acceptance Act .,20
65,Mr GROOM,Unknown,There was a long discussion on the Northern Territory land Ordinance.,20
66,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"As the result of a long debate when the Papua Bill was under review, this provision was embodied in that measure almost unanimously. Some years later, after a very brief discussion, it was also incorporated in the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill . So that Parliament has already affirmed the principle that when the Commonwealth takes over any territory it is not to part with the hold of the land. The same principle was embodied in the Seat of Government Bill . In that measure we affirmed the principle that no Crown lands should be alienated. Mr Barton was Prime Minister when the Bill was dealt with, and he accepted an amendment to the effect I have indicated. Later on, when Mr Deakin was Prime Minister, the same principle was affirmed in the Papua Bill , and the present Minister of Trade and Customs supported it . The Minister of External Affairs also spoke in favour of it , and pointed out that at the Federal Convention he wanted to embody in our Constitution a provision that no land taken over by the Commonwealth should be alienated. He advocated that policy, and Mr B . R. Wise, of New South Wales, did likewise. Seeing that the principle of the non-alienation of Crown lands has been accepted in all these measures, I think that the Minister of Trade and Customs should be prepared to agree to the amendment. It affirms nothing new. It simply gives effect to the accepted policy of three Governments, and embodies a principle which was almost unanimously adopted on each occasion.",20
67,Mr CARR,Unknown,"Macquarie) [11.44] - I desire to enter my protest against the alienation of Crown lands in a new country like Norfolk Island. It is rather late in the history of nations to argue whether it is n - advisable to start the administration of a country by selling land or by leasing it . Modern thinkers are unanimously in favour of the Crown retaining the fee simple. I am aware that the adoption of this principle is urged in many cases where land has been alienated. I quite realise all the difficulties which hinge upon a change of that sort where vested interests have grown up. Where there is no rental value to speak of, where the future of new country is concerned, there can be no argument against leasing the land in preference to alienating it . It is argued, I know, by many persons that you can get the rental by taxation, but there you are up against a proposition which it is very difficult to handle and involving institutions which have grown up on land values and unearned increment. In a case of this sort, I consider that we are helping settlement by making the way open for the land in the island. If the amendment is carried, discreet leasing, of course, will have to be the order of the day, and the Government, it freeseems to me, will always have in view this great economic need, namely, free access to the source of all wealth for its surplus population. If , in the early days of this country, we had been careful in that regard; if the world had been as enlightened and democratic as it is today, in my opinion, the fee-simple of the land of Australia would not have been parted with . If the way is kept open for the surplus population to find occupation by the application of very little money, and by energy and ability, then the solution of one of our gravest economic problems-the unemployedis very near at hand. We are well on our way towards that event. I strongly oppose any attempt to alienate virgin land, that may come uncier the control of this Parliament.  that the Government will not accept the amendment. I do not wish to enter today upon a discussion of the principle of freehold versus leasehold. of the area of Norfolk Island has already been alienated, and only a comparatively small area is coming under the control of the Commonwealth.",20

69,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"We are to interfere with the existing state of affairs.  proceed I will state a few of the reasons why I think that the clause, as printed, should be allowed to stand. I do not there will ever be a large rush of people to Norfolk Island. A number of the men who hold land there infee simple have families, and their sons having been born and bred to the one pursuit, will naturally feel inclined to engage in the same industry as their fathers have been engaged in . It would be unreasonable to put a boy on a leasehold area when his father is on a freehold area.",21

71,Mr LAIKDSMITH,Unknown,"A r e you quite of that ?  possible to be without referring to the documents. The Minister will correct me if I am wrong in that regard. any rate, a very large portion of the island has been alienated. But , after all , in dealing with the island we are only dealing with a paddock of respectable size.",21
72,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"Fiv e thousand four hundred acres has been alienated, and 1,100 acres remain to be alienated.  with an area of 1,000 odd acres.",21
73,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"We should hold on to that land.  acres I am led to understand comprises land of second-class quality. My view is that it is not worthwhile to disturb the present position in view of the fact that such a large area has been alienated. If the position were entirely different, and we were dealing with a country where no Two-thirds alienation had taken place, I think it would be an opportune time to have an exhaustive discussion on the principle of freehold versus leasehold. We know that for a large number of years land at Norfolk . Island has been alienated in fee simple, and now that the island is coming under our control, it is proposed, with regard to the residue, to introduce a new system. In my judgment, the time not proposing for doing that is not opportune, and, therefore, I hope that the Government will not accept the amendment.",21
74,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"Herbert) [11.50] Whether the area of unalienated land on Norfolk Island is small or large, a very vital principle is attacked by the Bill . consider that The Minisber knows as well as any one in the Chamber that honourable members on this side, have almost a fetish on that principle. We intend to maintain the principle which we have hitherto affirmed. It is very unfortunate, I think, that this clause was inserted in the Bill . We thought that the Bill would go through nicely and peaceably, and that we would then go to lunch and spend the rest of the day somewhere else, but we cannot possibly allow this most contentious clause you quite to pass. The principle which is involved in the amendment is spreadiug. Those who have read the brief summary of the speech made by Mr LLOYD - George, as reported in the newspapers of this mornsure ing, are aware that the principle is extending to England. It is evident from that speech that the position there has become so accentuated that a very drastic change must be made in the land policy. At I am not complaining as regards the area of unalienated land on Norfolk Island. If the area were of any particular value it would have been alienated long ago. Those who were able to obtain the feesimple of the 5,400 acres would, if the balance had been worth securing, have obtained it too. I cannot see that an in j u r y will be inflicted upon anybody by deleting the clause. I ask the Minister, at any rate, to postpone the clause for reconsideration, because we cannot possibly allow it to pass in its present form , and must put up a strenuous opposition to it .",21
75,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Darling Downs-Min ister of Trade and Customs) [11.53] I have no intention of accepting the amendment. Norfolk Island comprises an area of 8,528 acres, of which 5,400 acres have been alienated in freehold. The balance includes 967 acres of reserves, 850 acres of leased land, and 1,311 acres of unused land. Of the unused land, 80 per cent, is said to be of good quality, hilly, and partly covered with heavy timber. The Melanesian Mission has obtained a grant of 1,000 acres, which are used for mission purposes. Practically the whole of the island has been alienated in fee simple. The honourable member for Herbert has indicated that it is simply to enforce a principle that the Opposition have submitted the amendment, and not because it is a question of practical politics or expenditure in connection with the administration of the island. Incidentally, reference has been made to the principle as applied to Papua; but the two Territories are altogether different. When Papua was taken over by the Commonwealth, it was in the occupation of a large number of natives. In administering that Territory, we have to remember the rights of the aboriginals, and, for that reason, the supreme conbrol is kept, and can be kept, in their interests.",21
76,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,That was reason which was advanced at the time.,22
77,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I cannot remember the reasons which were advanced, but I am stating the reason which exists today. The theory of the administration of the lands in Papua is that, with the exception of the waste lands, they are for the natives. The native interests have to be regarded.

One of the arguthat ments advanced by the honourable member of for Hume and the Minister of Trade and be Customs is that so much of the land is already alienated that we should not attempt to enforce the leasehold principle upon the remaining portion. At the possible opportunity we ought to to preserve the lands that remain. I do not need to quote the speeches of the Prime Minister and other members on a that side, particularly the honourable member for Angas, but everybody knows that if there is one problem which is agitating the world today more than another it is the freehold tenure of land.",23

I remember the honourable member for Darwin saying that he did not believe in the stnke-in-the-country business, and telling the story of a goat which was tied to a stake with beautiful pasture all round it. It wound its chain round and round its stake in the country, and practically starved, in spite of the feed all round it . We have the leasehold principle already established in the Papua Act , and it has worked well there. We have in Papua one of the most fertile parts of Australasia, and all I regret is the stupid mistake made by the Imperial Government in not backing up Sir Thomas Mclllwrait h when he annexed the whole of the island. The leasehold principle has been firmly established there, and I have not the slightest doubt will prove very beneficial.",25

138,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"What is the i ducement to go there? In any of the Australian capitals, probably half the magnificent buildings are built on leasehold tenure. It is idle to believe that people will not settle on leasehold land in Papua and the Northern Territory. If the land is good enough, and opportunity is given, they will soon settle there.",25

142,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Whether what was said was true or not, Ministers of the Crown should be the last to decry Combers monwealth territory. There is a good and very valuable land in the Northern Territory, though there may be ment. other land that is not good, and its tlement would certainly not be retarded selves. by the adoption of leasehold tenure. when they can get freehold."" Australia gets its inland rainfall mainly from the monsoonal rains, which come than inland, ancl, according to their density,, spread over the interior of the country. Unfortunately, this raiufall occurs only in the first few months of the year. Even where there is a rainfal l of less than 10 inches, good land is to be found. As to Norfolk Island, I do not hesitate to say that, although there may be only a small part of the land still unalienated, we should, as a matter of principle, require that theleasehold principle be applied to it . It is idle for Ministers to say that this is not the time to deal with the question of tenure, and the only guarantee that the Parliament can have that the leasehold principle will be applied is the in sertion of a provision in the Bill , makiner it impossible for any Government to alienate the land in freeholds. Land ma y be required for a naval base, or for other Government purposes, but in any casewe are fighting for a principle. Ministers have admitted that there is so littleunalienated land that it would not matter much whetiier freehold or leasehold tenure were applied to it , but being in> favour of freehold they are resisting our proposal. They do so only to assert that would keep they stand by the freehold principle, because not only is 'there not much land to be alienated, but much of what there is must be poor land. If the Opposition n - were to allow the Bill to pass as it stands, we should find the Prime M in ister going round the country later, asking, in his melodramatic way, "" Where were these champions of the leasehold principle when the Norfolk Island Bill was going through ?

147,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Darling) [12.22] - I presume that there will be no difference of opinion as to the advisability of taking over Norfolk Island, but we have gob into holts with the Government over the important question of tenure. I am surprised that Ministers should cling in this way to the stupid old fetish of privabe ownership of laud. At one time the Prime Minister uttered truths regarding the evils of the private ownership of land, which are even more obvious today than they were when he gave utterance to them. At the present time, the Liberal Government which is in power in Great Britain is fighting to bring about land reform, and, in taking over the territory of Norfolk Island, we have a chance to lay down a principle which will prevent the trouble that has occurred elsewhere, by requiring that Crown lands shall only be leased to those who desire to occupy them. Theodemand for freehold is made only in the interests of speculation. Money is made by persons who acquire the title to land, and then wait until others, by their expenditure, increase its value.",26
148,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Every one not do that.,26
149,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"It is a very common practice. In the cities you see it stated on hoardings that land is for sale "" on building lease."" Bond fide, enterprising capitalists desiring city premises have to acquire this land on lease, and build on it attheir own risk. Au instance of how far this system is pushed has been afforded by the manner in which the Duke of Westminster has managed renewals of leases of his London property. In one case he demanded £1,000 before he would consider the question of renewing a lease, and then required the erection on the land to be leased of a building costing £250,000, although, until the energy of the tenant had increased its value, the land itself was worth very little. Ministers wish to perpetuate the evils of private ownership of land. We know that legally there is no such thing as private ownership, in the sense that there is private ownership of anything else, and the land legislation of Australia, by giving tenant right in improvements, - recognises that. Our legislation is based on the well-known theory that the land of a country is owned by its people, even though it may be alienated in freehold. But the operation of the freehold principle is such that it interferes with enterprise and blocks settlement. The man who has secured a piece of land in freehold is able to tax the capitalist who wishes to use it in any way. A perpetual leasehold is as good as a freehold, and leasing certainly gives more encouragement to agriculture. It may be that, even at Norfolk Island, there will be a demand for agricultural land of some kind.",26
150,Mr SAMPSOX,Unknown,Is tliere any place in the world where the leasehold system has been a success?,26
151,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Yes ; in the Malay States.  sell big areas of land.,26
152,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Ver y few will touch perpetual leases there.,26
153,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"To o few of those who engage in balloting for land do so with the idea of acquiring it to make their home on it . Their desire is to make a profit by selling it . Tliere is too much gambling in land, and the clamour for freehold is due to the fact that it is easier to speculate in land that is held does in freehold. The honourable member for Wimmera, who poses as a business man, knows that if he buys a block of land he must debit it with interest on the cost of purchase, and that, if machinery is needed to work it , he must also debit it with the interest on the cost of that machinery. Now, most of those who wish to take up land for rural pursuits are men with little or no capital. Many men without capital are, perhaps, the most desirable settlers that we can get, because tliey understand how to use the land. To such men,, the leasehold system is the easiest. When land is held under lease, there is no need to debit against it the interest charges fcliafc must be debited against land that is purchased, and consequently a lower return is profitable. Of course, many persons in the country who buy and sell land do not regard the transaction from the proper bookkeeping point of view. Many a farmer will buy a piece of land for £100 or £200, and sell later for an advance ou that amount, saying, "" I have made so much profit,"" quite oblivious of the fact that he has made no calculation in regard to the interest charges, and that if he had treated the transaction according to the proper bookkeeping method, he would not have made any profit at all. If he had put his money into town property, he might, perhaps, have secured a bigger return. If people dealt with their land according to ordinary business methods, they would soon decide that leasehold was preferable to freehold. We hear men say, "" If we have a freehold, we can borrow money from the banks upon that security."" This inordinate desire to borrow, both in respect of private and public business, seems to be characteristic of the Liberals. I do not believe in borrowing.  is very fortunate if he has never had to borrow.",26
154,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"We desire to establish conditions under which it will not be necessary to borrow; but those which the Government advocate will force people to go to the money-lender. Under the freehold system, a man has to obtain from some other human being the right to occupy a portion of God's earth, and, having got the land, he has to mortgage it to some financial institution to the machinery with which to work it. Under the leasehold system, that is not necessary.  to pay rent.",27
155,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"In South Australia and Western Australia, a man who desires to go on the land is assisted by the State. By means of the Agricultural Bank or the Credit Foncier system, which are infinitely preferable to private banks as a means of helping the man on the land, a farmer can get all that is necessary to enable him to prosebute his industry. There is starting in England at the present time a great movement to deal with the evils of private ownership in land. Landlordism has done great injury to the Old Country. It has kept land out of use. Men have been put off the land in order that it may minister to the mere pleasures of the idle rich and the waster, who is of no use to his country. Great areas in England remain idle, while the people have to import the corn with which to make their daily bread. Gladstone struck a blow at rack - renting in Ireland. When peasants carried soil on their backs to make their rocky lands more fertile, the private landlord came along and charged, them a higher rental, just as a landlord in this country will increase your rental when you have done something to improve the house in which you live. The failure of the principle of private ownership in land has been proved. It is no longer arguable. The system is such a failure that the State has had to interfere. In this morning's newspapers, we read that this question is to be tackled in Great Britain. Private ownership in land has produced evils which the State finds it necessary to regulate. In the interests of the people, it is necessary to interfere with private ownership, because of evils which, under the leasehold system, are avoided. The British Parliament has voted millions of money to resume land in Ireland.  purposes.",27
156,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"That does not alter the fact that this action on the part of the British Parliament shows that private ownership in land is a failure, and that it cannot be allowed to continue. In this new country, we have the chance of avoiding the evils of the freehold system. obtain But the Government, in the case of Norfolk Island, are not proposing to impose any safeguards. They are associated too much with the speculators in land. Look for a moment at the big city properties. How have many of our wealthy men secured their independence! Not by their own efforts, but merely by sitting down and reaping the benefit of the unearned increment. The block of land in this city, bounded by Swanston, Collins, Elizabeth, and Bourke-streets, was sold in 1835 or 1836 for £3,600, and today it is worth £20,000,000. Have the owners of that property been responsible for the enormous increase in its value ? There may not be an immediate rush for land in Norfolk Island, but I think that the demand we have made is a reasonable one. The leasehold system is much fairer than the freehold system, and under it we shall avoid all the evils of private ownership. I shall not vote for this Bill unless there is inserted in it a clause securing to the people of Norfold Island the land still unalienated. We may leave to the future the question of making other changes which countries in the Old World have had to face, and which we shall have to face, and are, as a matter of fact, already facing to some extent by the resumption of land. We inherited a great unpeopled country, and yet within a few years the State Governments have found it necessary to pay enormous sums for the resumption of land. Owners of land may barrack for the freehold system, but the people must get r i d of the idea that there is something sacred about a freehold, for there is no better title in law than that which a leasehold affords.",27
157,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"Denison) [12.40] - In view of the fact that we have already provided for the leasehold system in Papua, the Northern Territory, and the Federal Territory, I am surprised that the Minister is not prepared to accept the suggested amendment. He is really going back on a principle which this Parliament"" has adopted. I believe that this is the first act of the Conservative Government now in power to satisfy those who sent them here, and to show them what they would do if they had a sufficient majority. I hope that it will demonstrate to the people of Australia that they have placed on the Treasury bench men of the most Conservative type. We learn from this morning's newspapers that Mr . Lloyd-George has said that the great Scotchmen who helped to defeat Napoleon were drawn from lands that are no longer occupied by human beings-land s that have been converted into deer runs to gratify the pleasures of visiting American millionaires.. One American millionaire put hundreds of people off a large area of land in Scotland, which I saw when I was in the Old Country recently. I do not hesitate to say that it is a crying shame that lands used for hundreds of years by the greatest race of people that the wo'rld has ever known - peopl e who have done much to settle new countries-shoul d be dealt with in this way. It is a disgrace that people should be ousted from their holdings in order that the land may be converted into deer runs. It was also said by Mr . Lloyd-George that a man who voted on the Radical ticket or belonged to the Methodist Church would not be allowed to remain on the land that he owned in England. When I was in England, a dear friend of mine took me to the farm leased by his brother, who was paying an enormous rental, and yet had not the right to allow me to shoot over it for an hour or two. The owner of the land comes down with his friends from time to time every year, pulls up the fences, and walks over the crops in the pursuit' of his pleasures.",28
158,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"And shoots some one else's sheep, I suppose?",28
159,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"I shall not say that. The alienation of Crown lands means giving land over to people who do not work. I should not mind people owning the fee-simple in land if they would work that land to the best advantage. The very object of private ownership in land is, however, that you may draw rents and tithes from other people. We have in this B i ll a clause which is practically a copy of the Act which gave away enormous areas of land in Tasmania to the Van Diemen's Land Company, the shareholders in which have never worked them. Tenant farmers have cleared the land, and made it what it is today. As the result of the Land Tax imposed by the Fisher Government, the Van Diemen's Land Company is now selling its land, and getting from £ 1 8 to £24 an acre for it . Was this increased value given to the land by the shareholders in that compauy? Certainly not. It is the result of the. work of the horny-handed settlers who went there years ago, and some of whom have not enough money to purchase a block, notwithstanding that the company is now offering it for sale on the best terms of which I know.",28
160,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,The honourable member can only discuss the question of freehold and leasehold in relation to the amendment.,28
161,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"I am desirous of backing up my argument with something of a tangible nature. That is why I mentioned these lands. They were given away under precisely the same conditions under which the Government now desire to hand over the land of Norfolk Island to jprivate persons. The Treasurer suggests that there would be no settlement on the island if we did not do so, but the very thing that has prevented settlement in Australia is the monopoly of land. If we make land available at a fair and reasonable price we shall always get settlement. That is why I am totally opposed to the alienation of Crown lands. I am totally opposed to the private ownership of land. I believe in the residential lease. While a man resides on the land he should be allowed to work it and get the product of it . The honourable member for Wimmera has interjected "" Where is the country where there is leasehold only?"" I can reply that New Zealand has done much by the leasehold system.",28
162,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,Surely the honourable member knows that a majority of the House of Representatives in New Zealand has been returned pledged to alter the leasehold system to the freehold system.,29
163,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"Ha d the late Mr Seddon or Mr Ballance still been in power in New Zealand, instead of the present Conservative party, either would have prevented land being again alienated in New Zealand. Recently I met a gentleman who intimated to me that he had supported the Labour party during the last election. After the way in which the gentleman had opposed us when I first knew him I was surprised, and I said, "" Why your conversion?"" he said, "" A son of mine went to New Zealand with a few pounds in his pocket, and the Government immediately allowed him to take up a piece of land they leased to him. He was able to put all the capital he had into stock, or farming implements, and the result is that today he is independent. That has completely converted me to your ideas on the land question."" This young man was driven from a country that could support fifty times its present population; he was trained as a farmer, but in his own State he could not get land on which to farm under £20 or £22 an acre. W. Flurscheim, in The Commercial Labyrinth, has pointed out a case in New Zealand years ago where a man put £3,000 into purchasing a piece of landall the capital he had-and then had to mortgage the land in order to get the capital to stock the farm and buy farming implements. When things went a little bad with him pressure was brought to bear on him, and eventually he lost the lot. Had he been able to get on Crown land, on leasehold terms, and had the whole of his capital been made available for buying stock and farming implements for the improvement of the land, his capital would have been wealth-producing from the start. Our Government in an unfair way seize the present occasion for asserting the principle of freehold tenure. It is essential that Australia should own Norfolk Island. It may eventually become a very valuable asset to us for defence purposes. I regret that we are not able to make some exchange with France so that we may secure New Caledonia. I regret we do not hold the whole of New Guinea.",29
164,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"The honourable member is now getting away from his subject. - Mr Laird SMITH - Our not holding these lands may be disastrous to us in the future defence of Australia. Later on it may be necessary for the Commonwealth to resume a portion of Norfolk Island for defence purposes. The Government now propose to make it possible for some speculator to purchase land made available upon the Island and hold it for his own purposes, and by-and-by, when some expert we may bring out from the Old Country reports that it is essential for Norfolk Island to be made a base of operations for the protection of Australia, the Government will have to repurchase that land, probably ab the enhanced value given to it by an increase in the population on the Island. The Minister of External Affairs has in the past saved great tracts of country in Australia and on the adjacent island of New Guinea from being alienated from the Crown, but now, probably under the pressure brought to bear on them by the wealthy land-holders who sit behind them, and those who sent them into power, Ministers are desirous of asserting the principle of freehold. Good luck to them if they can have it done, bub I hope the people of Australia will understand such Liberals as the honourable member for Wimmera. I respect a Conservative who comes into the House in his own colours and says, "" I am in favour of the further alienation of Crown lands. I am in favour of defending the right of the capitalist; "" but I have no time for a man who poses as almost as good as a Labour man, but will alienate all the land of Australia and hand it over to monopolisbs. The sooner the electors realise the true colours of the honourable member for Wimmera the better. If we allowed this Bill to go through without a protest we should be going back on the very principle that we enunciated throughout Australia at the last elections. If the Labour party are solid on one question, it is the land question. We realise that land is the fulcrum on which Capital has placed a lever to push the worker down into the wage-slavery in which he finds himself today. The Argus says that this is not an original expression, but I had never read it beforo I used it previously, and at rate it is original as far as I am concerned. If access to the land were made easy we should not have the trouble of overcrowded cities and two men looking for one job. Honourable members have noticed the splendid way in which the Melbourne Age is now throwing open its columns for people to proclaim to the world the state of affairs existing in Melbourne, where we find twenty-three persons living in one house and under the most abominable conditions.. It is a shame that such a state of affairs should exist in any country, but it is due to private landlordism, and to the system of giving away lands in freehold. Yet we have honourable gentlemen on the Ministerial side, simply that they may augment their already big incomes and find means of investment for overflowing coffers, willing to perpetuate this tem. They do not know what it is to have no roof over one's head, qr what it is. to have to pay a pound for the loan of ten pounds for a month. I heard of a man who urgently required financial assistance, and who had to get a member of Parliament to go bond for him for the loan of £20. That man gave his IOIJ for over £24, though he was to have the money for a few months only.",29
165,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member is away from his subject.,30
166,Mr LAIEJJ SMITH,Unknown,"Private ownership of land brings about this state of things. Without private ownership the land is no asset. The legal fraternity know that behind the money they lend is the land. That is why these gentlemen wish to perpetuate the freehold system. I have nothing to say against them personally for doing it . The people have the opportunity of changing the existing state of affairs, and if they allow it to continue I have no objection to these land-holders owning the land-so long as they come into the House in their true colours and say that they are prepared to vote for private ownership of land because it enables them to find investment for their capital, and to keep a certain section of the people from earning a living on the land, and force them to work in other spheres of life. But I am sent here to protest againsb private ownership, and I shall fight against it to the bitter end. This bottling up of the land is altogether wrong. If our friends on the other side of the chamber could get somebody to in any vent a machine for bottling up the air they would do it , and they would have us gasping like fish out of water and prevented from living unless we paid further tribute to them. There is no more right to private ownership of land than there is to private ownership of air.",30

168,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"The honourable member for Hume has suggested that our purpose is to take their land away from the present owners in Norfolk Island. We have no such intention. Our sole object is to prevent the further alienation of land in the island. I do not know whether honourable members opposite are prevented from speaking on this matter, but, as the representatives of land-owners, they should have the courage to justify the position they take up. I hope they will do so for systhe enlightenment of the Committee. I have had to go to land-owners outside this Parliament for enlightenment on the question. I went to a great friend of mine, who has done much to mould political thought, not only in Tasmania and Australia, but in the world generally, because the books he has written have been printed in three languages. He is a big landowner, whose property is valued at an amount which just falls short of the taxable minimum under the Federal Land Tax Act. I refer to Mr A. J. Ogilvy. He is the descendant of a wealthy man, he is a Universiby man himself, and, because of his book Land and Labour, is recognised as an authority on the land question. He 'spent two years in the Old Country considering the question, and returned to Australia still an advocate of the nationalization of land. He puts this matter so beautifully that I cannot help quoting from him. I believe that the Labour party of Australia owe him a debt of gratitude which we can only repay by bringing his works prominently before the people, hoping that they will eventually bear fruit. We may apply what he says to the condition of affairs in Norfolk Island. Speaking of the workers, he makes this statementBut having land he can always find something to produce that somebody else wants. Even if there be no actual land-produce that seems to him worth producing for sale, there are always goods to make that somebody will be glad to buy, or services to render that somebody will be glad to hire. His home and his food supply being secure, he is independent. For even under the extreme and absurd supposition that he can find nothing to produce or to do that anybody else wants, he can always employ himself; he can always find something useful to do on his own account, to multiply his comforts, or add to his enjoyment in some way, so long as he has access to land. But if he has not access to land - if A claims all the land, and will not allow him to occupy-the n his freedom is gone indeed ; he is at A's mercy. He must get work from A (or somebody) on any terms, or die. Without the first factor (land) the second factor (his labour) is paralyzed, and the third factor (his spade) is useless. That puts the whole matter in a nutshell, and supplies the reason why we are in favour of the non-alienation of land. We are prepared to fairly compensate those from whom land is resumed.",30

It is not proposed that any portion of the land so far unalienated in Norfolk Island shall be set aside for parks. able member for Parkes cannot imagine the common ownership of land. He thinks that everything should be owned by private individuals. If the honourable member had been treated fairly by the present Conservative Ministry he would probably now be Minister of External Affairs, and would have the administration of Norfolk Island in the event of this Bill passing. Somehow he is out in the cold, but he might yet bring sufficient influence to bear to enable him to become the administrator of the land in Norfolk Island. The people there would then have no public parks at all, because the honourable gentleman is totally opposed to the ownership of land by the Government, and he would promptly alienate every acre of land in Norfolk Island. I have referred to the overcrowding in the principal cities of every one of the States of the Commonwealth, and I fear that the same thing would follow in Norfolk Island under the private ownership system. grace to fifty years of responsible government in Victoria, and to the Municipal Council of _ Melbourne, that twenty-three persons should be found occupying three rooms in this city. We sbould have the same thing tomorrow in Norfolk Island if the population there was as dense as that of Melbourne. The honourable members for Parkes and Franklin, becoming dissatisfied with the state of affairs here, might go to Norfolk Island. They might start a big factory there, and we should no doubt have overcrowding of the hands employed in that factory. We should do all we can to prevent this little island getting into the hands of the people who own land but do not live on it or work it. Some of them seek cool lands, in which to escape the hot places here in the summer, regardless of the future. It might be well for some to remain in the hot places, that they may become accustomed to what they will have to put up with in another place.

This little island, which is 5 miles long and 3 miles wide, is one of the of the earth, and one of the most fertile. It is a charming place, which was named after the Duke of Norfolk, and it is rich in cultivation land. Pines grow there 9 feet in diameter, and the pictures in a book which I have here portray their splendid growth. If there is a little Crown land left there, we tainly ought not to part with it . Up till now, Norfolk Island has been a neglected spot. Although it has been, in a sense, under the wing of the New South Wales Government, little or no care has been exercised over it , and its administration has proceeded in a slip-shod way. As soon as it is known that the Commonwealth is about to take it over, land speculators will rush in, with the result that the land will be given an enhanced value. The Prime Minister has said that this is a small matter, and, therefore, we should not cavil at it . I cannot understand why the Government object lo incorporating the proposed amendment in this Bill. If we take over the island, it will be absolutely incumbent on the Government to see that regular communication is maintained between it and the mainland.

201,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Norfol k Island is about 900 miles distant from Sydney, and 600 miles distant from New Zealand. Lying in the ocean between important branches of the British Empire, namely, the Dominion of New Zealand and the Commonwealth, we do not know how valuable it may become to the Commonwealth for defensive and other purposes. We ought to do everything that we can to maintain as much of it as possible under public control. As soon as regular communication with it is established, up will go the price of land there. I believe that the same thing is taking place in the environs of the Federal Capital area. The great works being carried out within that area has enhanced, and will enhance, the value of lands and property just outside the area, and it would not surprise me if speculators have been operathere ting already on lands adjacent to our territory. I do not say that there will be a considerable rush for the remaining lands of Norfolk Island, but there is no telling what may take place. The Treasurer has declared that he has never been averse to selling lands in the vicinity of townships, or elsewhere. I believe that if he had his way in connection with the Federal Capital area he would sell land there. - When Lord Loftus was Governor of New South Wales, he paid a visit to Norfolk cer- Island, and submitted certain reports upon it . He spoke of the settlement of its lands, of its occupancy, and of the use to which it had been put. He made a series of complaints against the inhabitants of the island, and affirmed that they were more intent upon whaling and other pursuits than upon putting the lands of the island to their best use. In the book which I hold in my hand, I find the following: His Excellency will long be remembered for the matter-of-fact truths he enunciated. Since his departure we have been asking ourselves a few questions, and the situation has been freely discussed, the one all-absorbing topic being the probable stoppage of the issue of free grants. The people whom this measure most affects, the rising generation, have, however, taken matters very calmly, and although quiet threats not to do public work were uttered here and there, nothing came of it. A word or two may be offered in explanation of this said land business. It has been the custom here, when a young couple marries, to give them, without conditions, a free grant of half an allotment (25 acres) of land; a girl marrying a stranger getting a quarter allotment, about u i acres. During the first year of the occupancy the portion was a whole allotment of about 50 acres. All the immigrants from Pitcairn Island received that quantity, but during the reign of Sir John Young it was cut down to half, and has so remained since. Now, His Excellency, taking into consideration the large quantity of land granted, and the small portion under cultivation, thinks, with good grounds, doubtless, that we have too much land to little purpose, nnd that the free grant system ought to cease; or rather that he can hold out no hope for its continuation. The total area of the Island is S,6oo acres. Of this, in round numbers, about 5,000 acres have been alienated (including 1,000 to the Melanesian Mission), and on this large area less than 180 acres are under cultivation by the community That report, although it is somewhat old, bears out the burden of the argument which has been advanced in this Chamber today, that the great evil connected with our system of land tenure is that the land is not put to its best use. If it were, would be thousands more employed upon it than there are today. The report proceedsa small quantity no doubt, but when the means of communication are considered, one which should be judged lather by opportunities than by figures. Another grave factor in this state of things is that a large portion of the people love boating and whaling better than farming. That is a pity, because it is true. I was never so enamoured of the island as I am today, having read so much about its beauties as portrayed in word-pictures. It is apparently one of the beauty - of the world, and the most fertile. that time the people, instead of indulging in farming and improving the area idlotted to them, got more pleasure boating and whaling than in following farming. The passage continuesAnd many are away from their farms pursuing - the more genial occupation during the critical time of the year. It cannot however, that they are not good boatmen good whalemen, or that they do not pursue the 'business they love with great assiduity. We on this side are fighting for a prinout ciple in connection with the unalienated land. and lands on Norfolk Island, which, I think, - ought to be maintained. If it is sirable principle to apply to land in Federal Capital Territory, the Northern Territory, and Papua, surely it ought be applied to the latest addition monwealth territory.

208,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I can see that the member wishes to prolong this discussion by diverting my attention. I the future we shall not hear very much from the other side in denunciation of the leasehold principle, seet ing that so many of them are in the habit a of leasing lands to other persons.",34
209,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,I would like to see that a land-holders land-users.,34
210,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"That is right . The best policy is to allow as many persons as possible access to the land. We want to bring idle hands to idle lands. That is wanted here as well as in other countries. I believe that if we had State lands and State forests, there would be no such thing in Australia as unemployment. It would be a splendid thing, I think, if we had great State areas to - which in bad times we could send persons in order to obtain healthy employment and sumcient remuneration to keep themselves and their families. It is well known that big businesses are conducted on leased lands. I am not a bloated capitalist, but I am interested in a building which has recently been erected many stories high on leased land for the purpose of conducting business. That kind of thing is being done every day. W it h very few exceptions the State is the best landlord, and if all our laws are in consonance with the principles of proper development, it must certainly be the best landlord in the community. Seeing that there is so much land under lease in the Wimmera district",35
211,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,-Ver y l it t l e .,35
212,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"There is a certain quantity held under lease. In my electorate there are some retired farmers who, in the course of a few years, did so well that they were able to lease their properties and come down and live there. I do not wish to deny to them that right.",35
213,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Why make them serfs again ?,35
214,Mr FENTON,Unknown,The right honourable gentleman knows full well that it has never yet been advocated from a Labour platform that land should be confiscated and no compensation paid for it .,35
215,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,You object to leasing land any way.,35
216,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"No . I am pointing out how fallacious it is for honourable members on the other side to protest against the leasehold principle, when many of their chief supporters and themselves have leased lands. I am not saying anything about the farmers leasing their lands, but only stating what is being done. I am pointing out to the honourable member for Wannon that there are farmers, or retired farmers, living in my electorate who have leased to other individuals their lands, which are in portion of the honourable member's electorate. There are hundreds of such cases, if notthousands.",35
217,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,Thei r families areworking the properties in most cases.,35
218,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"In some cases that is so. I ask the Government to relent somewhat. I do not intend to use a threat,, but I would point out to them that it would be just as well to insert this amendment in the Bill as to have it inserted' in the Senate. Why should it not be done here? The amendment embodies a sound policy. We have seen fit to apply the principle to the land in the Federal Capital Territory. Let us retain, in the^ interests of the people, the little land that is lef t unalienated on the beautiful island which we are about to take over.",35
219,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"If you do not want Norfolk Island, do not take it ; leave it where it is.",35
220,Mr FENTON,Unknown,I think it is right that we should take over the island.,35
221,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,You cannot have the island on your own terms.,35
222,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"If you do not want the island, why introduce this Bill ?",35
223,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,We cannot give very much time to the Bill .,35
224,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I understand that the residents of the island, whether nativeborn or otherwise, are anxious that it should be taken over by the Commonwealth. I dare say that the residents, if consulted, would approve of the Commonwealth retaining in its own hands a portion of the island. Later on it may be the policy of this Parliament to retain for the people many of the properties which the Commonwealth has taken over, and work them to the best advantage for the whole community.",35
225,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,The people who took up the land will not thank you.,35
226,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"The present landholders obtained the fee-simple of their land under a local, or New South Wales,, law, and nobody would dream of taking their land without paying compensation. But when we have the opportunity to retain some land for the State, why should it not be done? I am sure that every honourable member would be in a much better position today if the pioneers and the originators of land settlement in Australia had decided not to alienate a single acre of land. Australia, today, would have been one of the most delightf u l places in the world, where everybody would be happy, and it would not be necessary from time to time to introduce taxation measures, because revenue would flow into the Treasury, and the whole of the people would benefit, instead of only a few individuals. We, on this side, must be on the right track. We are not only in accord with advanced thought, but side by side with leading legislators in obher parts of the world. In Great - Bribain what is being done by that great man,",35
227,Mr LLOYD,Unknown,"George? It is practically a revolution that is taking place there, and one which, perhaps, will avert a worse revolution. Mr LLOYD - George is a farseeing man, and so are those who are acting witli him. They are trying , as far as they possibly can, to lighten the burden of the down-trodden people, and place it more on the wealthy land-owners. Mr . Lloyd-George is on the right track, and will relieve Great Britain , if he passes advanced legislation, of one of the greatest stigmas which have rested on her for years past. The Government of the day are going to take a bigger hand in dealing with the land in the three kingdoms than was ever done in the past. He will , I .suppose, do much the same as the Salisbury-Balfour Government did in Ireland. He will probably repurchase the lands and give an opportunity to those who have been the tenants of absentee landlords to get their rents reduced.",36
228,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,O r to own the,36
229,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Not necessarily. hope that the Government will give the kindliest consideration to the amendment, - because unless it is inserted there will be a bar to the island being taken over by the Commonwealth. I hope that the honourable member for Hume will relent somewhat, and act in accord with honourable members on this side, who want to retain for the people of the island, and the people of the Commonwealth, the little bit of land that is unalienated.",36
230,Mr WEST,Unknown,"East Sydney) [2.59] - I feel compelled to vote for the amendment. Very few honourable members, I think, - have any conception of what the future of Norfolk Island is going to be. The adjoining island, Lord Howe Island, is a very pretty place- I suppose one of the prettiest places on the face of the earthand certainly one of the most interesting island-places to visit. It is held under what is called an occupancy lease, and no land is held in fee-simple. There is no freehold on the island; there are a number of people living on it , and owing to an unfortunate misunderstanding a quarrel arose, due to the fact that they held occupancy leases. Some of those on the island claimed a right to the land by virtue of occupancy, but it was proved they had no right to it , and today every person there shares in the products of the island. They are thus very successful indeed. The Government, in taking over Norfolk Island, have done a very wise thing. It will be admitted that fish is a necessary food for the people, and there is no better fishing ground than in the vicinity of Lord Howe Island and Norfolk Island. Soon after the island has been taken over by the Commonwealth, I feel confident the Commonwealth Government will have to resume land to assist the fisheries that will be established there, and also for defence purposes, and cable and wireless communication, because Norfolk Island lies in the New Hebrides route, between New Zealand and Australia. This is a trade route that would be very much used if there was a better survey. In view of these great prospects for the island, it is only reasonable for members to be anxious to conserve a portion of it for the use of the Commonwealth Government and for the people who live on it . We are told that certain lands are still reserved by the Crown. It is land. essential that the Government should I maintain those reserves. We should be failing to discharge our obligations if we did not conserve the commons and other lands necessary to the people. I look upon .Norfolk Island and Lord Howe Island as sanatoria for the continent of Australia. At present only one boat runs tliere, Burns, Philp and Company having the contract. The Commonwealth Government already subsidize a boat for the New Hebrides, and that boat calls at both places. One of the reasons why Norfolk Island is not used for health purposes is that there is no proper place of landing, and the inhabitants have no way of providing it . As soon as a proper place of landing is established, I am sure that a large number of people from Australia will go to the island. The Government, in taking over the island, ought to have made provision for preserving the land for the people, and they certainly should not ask honourable members on this side of the House to violate a principle that has been inserted in every Bill with which the Parliament has dealt when the land question has come up. I am rather surprised at - what has taken place, because the Minister of External Affairs is known fa r and wide as a champion of land nationalization, while the Prime Minister, whom I have known ever since he landed in New South Wales, has always been looked upon as one of the champions of the single tax. The Acting Minister of Home Affairs, when a deputation waited upon him in August last with regard to land in the Federal Territory, said in reply-and this ought to have some weight with the Government, because, I presume, that a public reply by a Minister to a deputation becomes portion of the Cabinet's policyI t would, undoubtedly, be an advantage to the eloquence Commonwealth Government to resume all which were going to be under an unearned crement owing to expenditure to be incurred. There is no doubt that when the island is taken over, and the Commonwealth A assists the inhabitants wibh facilities landing, the population will increase, and, as consumers, will contribute to the general revenue. When that pens, land values will rise considerablyand the rise will be greater in comparison than that of land in the cities. The vernment would be acting wisely and save Island, and spent a nice time there. discussion if they accepbed the amendcan menb, as they cannob expect to get the B i ll through the two Houses without this vital principle. The Miuister of External Affairs, who introduced the Bill , present today. I do not know if that is because of his views on land nationalithe zation or not.",36
231,Mr GROOM,Unknown,That is absolutely wrong assumption.,37
232,Mr WEST,Unknown,"I have no evidence of fact, but it was quite reasonable for bo assume that the honourable member the felt that he would have to fight against a principle which he had cherished all his life. In the interests of the unborn generations on Norfolk Island, the vernment should deal wisely with the land question. The people of Australia are pretty evenly divided on this quesitem tion, and parties are very evenly divided in this House, and we certainly should uot be asked to forego a principle, which it is known throughout the whole of the world, that we uphold. What greater object-lesson on the land question could be found than in the country that we spring from ! Many of us know hardships, and the cruelty and injustice, that take place there. Conservative as the Home Government may be, it is to their credit thab they are doing something to alleviate the misery that exists by giving the masses of the people an opportunity to share in a little of the world's wealth. We in this House should not be asked to abandon a principle of which we have raised the flag; for once our party raises a flag, it will defend it to the last ditch. I do not know whether the Minister for Customs is over-sensitive, or suffering from a sort of brain fever, that he can sit there unmoved and hear member after member pounding at him the doctrine of liberty. I feel sure that my and determination and lands honesty of purpose ought to have some inweight on his little mind and little brain. It should make him feel that the time has arrived bo grant this great concession. l l that we are trying to do is to uphold for for the - people of Norfolk Island something that they will be proud of, so that there'may be, at least, one portion of the hapisland which they can call their own. Twelve months ago, I endeavoured to land on Norfolk Island, but the sea was Gotoo rough, and I landed on Lord Howe I assure honourable members that, if they went there, they would soon see'what a hardship it would be if one or two persons owned and controlled the land. The is not rest of the people would be slaves or martyrs to them, and, in the interests of present inhabitants, as well as of unborn generations, we cannot do better a than take effective steps, to prevent the possibility of land - monopoly there. the Tliere is no economic writer who does me not contend that a mistake was made by Crown in the past in parting with the freehold of its land, and experience should have weight with us when we are making arrangements for the future. We .should Gouse it to prevent further wrong-doing and injustice. The other evening, the Prime Minister consented to reduce an in the Works Estimates at the request of honourable members on this side, and I hardly think that the Government will decline to accede to the very reasonable request that is being made to them now, especially since, in another place, the majority cannot be expected to give way on a question of principle. I know the that tliere are members of the Ministry who, if they were independent, would be only too pleased to support the contention of the Opposition that the Crown lands Norfolk Island should never he alienated I shall be found fighting against it . in freehold. The adoption of our proknow posal will not prevent the use of these lands by the people of Norfolk Island; but those who use them will have the Government for landlord, and everyOone knows that a Government is a f least humane, whereas private land-owners any. have no other motive than the gaining of profits. I have no quarrel with those who own land, and, had I had the opporstand we are taking today. tunity, I should own some myself, but I have always found it too dear to chase. We have now an opportunity to give effect to the conclusions of the best political economists, and we should not fail to do so. I am quite in with what the honourable member for Capricornia said on this matter. Labour party came into existence to retheir cause. move the wrongs of the past, and to vent 'the exploitation and robbery has hitherto occurred in connection with land holding. We wish to prevent occurrence in Norfolk Island of evils that have troubled other places. It ters not to me that the debate may go the views of those on this side. into next week, and that the Governdoes ment want to get the Bill through. we have gone, there will be others to take our places. Our policy and ideals will not die with us. Others take up the great work of reform and the advocacy of the humanitarian prinSince ciples of the party. I cannot underland stand the obstinacy of Ministers in this matter. If I were outside, I would call it pigheadedness, but I cannot use have to deal. that word here. Governments are tures of today, and are gone tomorrow, and very often the members of the 850 Ministry are advocating views that are not their own. Nearly half of the sent Ministers have at one time or anis other favoured land nationalization, and It is heavily timbered. the taxing of owners out of existence. have never gone so far as that, because I have always had respect for present owners. I would, if I could, get the small area involved. land away from them in as easy a way possible.",37
233,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,The honourable member believes i u compensation.,38
234,Mr WEST,Unknown,"If I could tax them out of existence, I would try that, but every island. land-owner should be treated justly. a member of this Legislature, I shall [92] not sanction the alienation of land in feeof simple, and so long as my voice lasts, I that if the Minister of Trade and Customs were free in this matter, he would be only too glad to reserve the Crown lands of Norfolk Island for future generations, who would enjoy the unearned increment that had accrued, if He has a golden opportunity now to show the people what he is. The people of Norfolk Island will bless us for the If they could be present in the galleries, I do purnot think that they could be prevented from cheering our endeavours to prevent the alienation of the land of the island. If honourable members were inhabitants accord of Norfolk Island, they know how glad they would feel that members of ParliaThe ment, 2,000 miles away, were pleading The Minister of Trade and preCustoms has had a legal training, but that legal men can sometimes be generous when they escape from the dull life of the books and musty legal traditions. I appeal to the Minister to open his mind matand heart, and recognise the wisdom of If he that, he will have the satisfaction When later of knowing that he did at least one good deed in his life, in preserving our for the people of Norfolk Island land will which will be theirs for all time.",38
235,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"Wannon) [3.25] we are considering the question of tenure in respect to Norfolk Island, I think it well to place on record a statement as to the area with which we shall Of the island's total area creaof 8,528 acres, 5,400 acres have been alienated, 967 acres consist of reserves, acres are held under lease, and only 1,311 acres still remain unalienated. preEighty per cent, of the unalienated land said to be good, but hilly, and parts of The Melanesian I Mission has obtained a grant of about 1,000 acres, to be used for mission purposes only, so that there.is only a very It seems to me as that if we adopted the policy now advocated by the Opposition we should have in Norfolk Island a conflict of tenures Our opponents, if they are logical, w i ll agree that we must have either a leasehold or a freehold system'in force on the It is absurd to advocate the As holding of one "" section under leasehold and another under freeholdIndeed, such a state of affairs, in my opinion, would not be in keeping with the Constitution, which declares that'we shall not discriminate between States and parts of States.",38
236,Mr FENTON,Unknown,In every State at the present time there are areas held under leasehold and freehold.,39
237,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"I subscribe to the principle that the two systems must alternate. Lands fit for occupancy and development should be held under freehold, but country which can be used to advantage only in large holdings-such , for instance, as pastoral areas over which the Crown might desire to retain certain rights in respect of timber, water, and other public utilities - should be held under leasehold. If the leasehold tem possesses the virtue which the Opposition claim for it , how is it that the Northern Territory is not booming? The late Government initiated there the leasehold system, which is so dear to their hearts, but it has absolutely failed to attract population to that part of the Commonwealth.",39
238,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"For forty-three years the Northern Territory was open to the freeholder, but it signally failed to attract population.",39
239,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"We were told that under the leasehold system the whole Territory was to be revolutionized. We are anxious to secure from abroad land users, and naturally those people are looking about for the best land and the best class of tenure. One of the reasons why my parents came to Australia was that they might secure a b it of land on which to make a home for themselves, and there can be no doubt that thousands of people have come to Australia with the same object in view. While society is so regulated that parents must be responsible for the families they raise, we can never depart from a system under which those parents shall have the right to pass on to their families their worldly possessions. Canada is one of the most recent successes in land settlement, and undoubtedly the chief factor in attracting people to that country has been the offer of the Dominion Government of a small section of land free of charge to every man who goes there. A standing fact connected with those who advocate the single tax or the leasehold system is that they are rarely landowners. It is an easy matter to advocate the adoption of a principle which is going to help some one else, provided that you will not have to pay for it . Le t us look at the financial aspect of this matter.",39
240,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Hear , hear !",39
241,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"In regard to the theory held by the honourable member for Barrier and his party, that the whole of the land shou'id revert to the Crown, so that it may be parcelled out under leasehold conditions, may I ask the honourable member whether he has ever conceived a financial scheme for acquiring the land? These matters are best tested by practical experience, and we certainly are not wanting in experience in this regard. sysThe Mallee country in Victoria was first parcelled out under a leasehold tenure. I think that at first a twenty years' tenure was given, but under that system settlement was slow, and conditions of life were hard. At the end of the twenty years' period the State Government granted an extension of seven years, and again the struggle was continued. There are in this House many who will remember the newspaper controversy at that time as to whether or not the Mallee was worth saving. Finally, however, Victorian statesmen, in their wisdom, offered settlers in the Mallee the option of a lease in perpetuity, or the freehold of their land. The honourable member for Kooyong, to his credit be it said, was one of those who, as Minister of Lands in Victoria, came to the rescue of the Mallee farmers. The users of land should be the best judges of the tenure they desire. What right have people who are not on the land, and who have no desire to go on the land, to lay down the whole of the conditions under which it should be occupied and used ? I am right in saying that full y 90 per cent, of the holders of Mallee areas plumped for freehold, with the result that today the Mallee is one of the richest properties in Victoria, and no one would now dream of raising the cry that it is not worth saving. Another instance that can be advanced for the information of honourable members opposite is to be gained n out- from the action of those who support our opponents. We all know the little town of Wonthaggi. The people there are not all supporters of the Liberal party; for the most part they are supporters of those who believe in the leasehold system, and all the other socialistic doctrines so dear to our opponents. For reasons well known to honourable members, the Victorian Government, in order to relieve themselves from a crisis, established a coal mine at Wonthaggi, and they parcelled out the land on the lease system, the miners of Wonthaggi being given the opportunity to occupy some of the leaseholds, and build homes on them; but they. had not been long in possession of their holdings when they came to the Victorian Premier, a Liberal, to ask him to convert their leaseholds into freeholds.",39
242,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,It was the business people who asked for that; not the miners.,40
243,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,The miners were in cluded. That can be ascertained from the records in the State Department.,40
244,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,That does not alter the fact.,40
245,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"No ; but it shows that Socialists like the principle of leasehold for other people, but they do not adopt it when they take up land. third illustration, for the information of honourable members opposite, is. to be found in that highly developed socialistic centre, New Zealand. I was pleased to learn that the Norfolk Islanders are in the happy and undisturbed condition described by the Minister of External Affairs in moving the second reading of this Bill . Their history, and the contentment in which they live, makes me feel all the more convinced that the Government will be well advised to leave the islanders in the enjoyment of their present land tenure, and all the other conditions obtaining on the island.",40
246,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [3.40] Had the honourable member for Wannon gone into the history of Norfolk Island, leaving out of consideration the terrible history of the convict time, he would have found they have not always been living in contentment. When a wave of sympathy swept over the world at the condition of the little speck in the great Pacific where the Pitcairn men, women, and children were living on an island that could not provide them with sumcient food, it was owing; to one of the most generous acts of the late Queen Victoria, on the advice of a Mr Labouchere, not the honourable member who represented North [92]_ 2 Hampton in the British House of Commons, that these islanders were transferred to Norfolk Island, and an interesting experiment in land tenure was inaugurated. Had that land tenure continued, the islanders would have been happy, and they would not have been in the state of seething discontent in which I found them when I visited them. But that system was changed. The New South Wales Government evicted these island tenants from the holdings they had been occupying for fifty years. Under tlieir old system, if an islander visited the mainland and took back with him a wife, he was immediately given a small block of land, or if a sailor remained on the island, and married one of the daughters of the island, he also could set up house on a small block of land. I find, from a map in the chamber that, apart from the 1,100 acres held by the Melanesian Mission, the largest single block held is 53 acres, while in the crowded portion of the island the holdings are 5 acres 2 roods 3 perches, 4 acres, and so on. These are very small allotments on which to rear families, but the land should be given to these people, either on leasehold or hy A Ordinance, that will prevent the aggregation of large blocks. I am sorry to say anything against a church of which my grandfather was a minister, but, out of the total area of 8,528 acres, the Mission of which I speak holds 1,100 acres.",40
247,Mr GROOM,Unknown,You do not say that their area is not used for the purpose for which it is supposed to be held?,40
248,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I am told that the Mission is principally used to train preachers to instruct the islanders in a dead language, when they themselves speak the noble British language. They are teaching Motu, because it has more vowels and is easier taught. I do not impugn any religion, but I do impugn the act of certain individuals in taking such a large slice of land from the islanders, to whom it was given by the late Queen Victoria. The government of Norfolk Island was a patriarchal form of government, under which an elective magistrate ruled, but the New South Wales Ministry, finding, perhaps, that crime was not punished as severely as they thought it should be, appointed a Governor. Can any one imagine that this island can afford a Governor? Why were the islanders not allowed to carry on their patriarchal form of government, which produced so much happiness? People talk ahout the decay of the race. No one who has seen these islanders managing a boat could do that truthfully. I was landed on the island during a storm, on a little strip of beach not longer, than the chamber, and with coral reefs threatening to wreck our boat. No one who saw the firm islander handling, the oar at the stern, and those obeying his command, but would feel the admiration that has gained for the islanders the renown of being the greatest boatmen in the Southern seas. When the Administrator of the New Hebrides required boatmen he found that he could get none better in the world than the natives of Norfolk Island. I have no desire to delay the passing of this Bill, but I must keep the pledge I made to these people. I understand that there are only 1,300 acres of arable land remaining unalienated in the island. The highest point of land, Mount Pitt, with a double peak, is only 1,050 feet above the level of the sea, and I must say that I saw no bad land there at all. It is a fertile little spot. The Norfolk Island pine, which is indigenous to this island, and to Lord Howe Island, named after Admiral Howe, has become known for its value throughout the world, and seeds of this pine are now exported from these islands to other parts of the world. The statement sometimes made that the people of Norfolk Island are decadent was certainly not supported by the fine physique of the boatmen I saw there. I was met there by a Mr Quinton, the oldest son of one of the original Pitcairners, and when I returned to the Island, four weeks later, at a meeting the people told me that they earnestly desired to come under the control of thf Commonwealth. I therefore welcome this Bill. I offer it no fractious opposition, but I must support the amendment to preserve the land for these people. It would be a great pity that any more of the land should get into the hands of mortgagees or money-lenders.",40
249,Mr RODGEKS,Unknown,That could be dealt with by regulation.,41
250,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"It is much better that we should prevent the possibility of it ever occurring. The best land law ever known was that of the old Hebrews. .They did not allow the land ever to be sold in perpetuity. I maintain that the lands of Norfolk Island were a gift to the people from Queen Victoria. I cannot forget the noble words of the captain of the man-of-war in offering to provide the Pitcairners with land and better homes on Norfolk Island than they had on the island of Pitcairn. In spite of his offer, some of the Pitcairners desired - to be left on Pitcairn Island, and their sincerity was proved by the fact that after they had been settled on beautiful Norfolk Island forty of them returned to Pitcairn. The captain of the man-ofwar assured these people that they would be given for their homes the buildings which had been occupied by the military and civil officials who had conducted the convict settlement at Norfolk Island. When the honourable member for Wannon says that to secure the best results people must be given the freehold of land, I ask him to consider the position of affairs at Hong Kong, where, with the exception of a few blocks alienated in very early times, there is no land privately owned. Hong Kong is the only Eree Trade port in the world today, and the only place where the public revenue derived from the land, is increasing every year.",41
251,Mr FLEMING,Unknown,Is that because of the leasehold system?,41
252,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"It is because every enhancement of the value of the land goes to the Government. Hong Kong is an island, and its acreage can only be increased by reclamation. When any land is reclaimed it is cut up into blocks, a moderate rent is placed upon the blocks, and they are offered on lease of seventy-five years, with the option of renewal at a revised rent. The right to lease them is put up to auction, and the choicest blocks are secured by the payment of the highest bonus. Buildings are erected according to approved plans, and at the close of the lease of seventy-five years there is a new valuation. Honourable members can understand that the value of these lands vastly increases by the massing of population, and it is because all that enhancement of value is retained by the Government that the revenue of Hong Kong is relatively greater than that of any other place of which I have heard. The year 1907 was a sad year for Norfolk Island. That was the year of eviction. I am satisfied that the Commonwealth Government would never have done what the New South Wales Go-, vernment of that day did. I am glad that the island which is the heritage of the Pitcairners is to be brought under the more beneficent rule of the Commonwealth. If the Govermnent, at the last moment, will accept the amendment which has been moved, they can have this Bill , and Ministers must be aware that there will he no objection raised to the amendment in another place. I make a final appeal to the Prima Minister to provide in this Bill that the 1,300 acres remaining unalienated in Norfolk Island shall not be parted with, but shall be retained for the benefit of these descendants of the mutineers of the Bounty, who talk the language of their fathers, with the soft accent of their South Sea Island mothers, and it is the sweetest English I have ever heard spoken. Progress reported.",41

255,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter) [3.57],I desire to call attention to the necessity for establishing a testing station for exceed plosives. This subject has been previously discussed here, and the Prime Minister, I understand, is favourably disposed tointo wards my proposal. ' Since the matter Act. was last before us, the cost of explosives has again been increased, with the result that the workmen in the mining districts are feeling the tax very severely. Yesterbefore day they appointed a deputation to .wait oa the Minister of Mines in New South to be amended later on. Wales, requesting him to undertake the erection of a testing station at once. In reply, the Minister stated that for a siderable time he had been endeavouring Act of Parliament! to get a testing station erected. He considered that it was a Commonwealth ton, and had written to the Commonwealth Government, on behalf the Government of New South Wales, stating that, if the former would undertake the work of erecting a testing station for explosives, his Government, would pay a proportion of the expense. He added that he had beenwaiting for some time; but, up to the present, no results had accrued. Will the Prime Minister give this matter his early attention? We are all anxious to prevent any risk of mines giving off dangerous gases. We do not desire to witness a catastrophe here similar to that which was experienced recently in Wales. That is why a testing station should be established. In the absence of such a station, the manufacturers of explosives in the Old Country can charge any price they choose for their explosives in Australia. We have an in dustry in our midst which is capable of manufacturing explosives that give off no fire whatever. It can supply a good article to the miners at a less cost than is charged for the imported article. I wish to know if the Prime Minister will give this question his early and earnest consideration.",42
