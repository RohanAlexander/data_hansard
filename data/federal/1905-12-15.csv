1,Mr BROWN,Unknown,The Seat of Government Bill distributed this morning contains a schedule setting forth the description of the territory to be acquired.,12
2,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"As the Bill is set down on the notice-paper for today, it is not competent for the honourable member to discuss it.",12
3,Mr BROWN,Unknown,"I wish to know if the Minister has had a map prepared, showing the territory embraced by the description, and, if so, whether that map will be available to honourable members when the Bill is discussed?",12

5,Mr ROBINSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Will the Prime Minister be good enough to supply honourable members with a short digest of the anti-trust legislation of the United States and the anti-dumping legislation of Canada and New Zealand ? The copies of that legislation now available to honourable members are very limited.,12
6,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I will ask the Attorney-General if he will have that digest prepared.,12
7,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Is the Bill, whose provisions may absolutely prohibit trade with so many parts of the Empire, intended to be the session's contribution to the preferential trade question ?",12
8,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I see nothing in it in consistent with preferential trade, and believe that until similar legislation has been passed by the mother country and other British Possessions, we shall not have adequate means for carrying preferential trade into effect.",12
9,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,This Bill then does mean protection pure and simple. COPYRIGHT BILL. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Is the question of copyright now dealt with' by the Governments of the States or by the Government of the Gommonwealth?,12

LETTERS: SYDNEY EXPRESS. Mr JOHNSON,-At the present time the Sydney express carries a mailbag, into which persons who have paid the late 'fee can drop their letters, between Albury and Melbourne, but between Melbourne and Albury that is not allowed to be done, and the guard of the train is not permitted to take charge of late letters offered to him. Will the. Postmaster-General see that the same convenience is provided between Melbourne and Albury as is given between Albury and Melbourne ?",12
12,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I have 1 already made alterations with a view to improving the postal arrangements between Melbourne and Sydney, and Sydney and Melbourne, and will inquire into the of in various States. It would b interestmatter to which the honourable member _ has drawn my attention. I am much obliged .to him for having done so. QUEENSCLIFF GUNS.",12
13,Mr EWING,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Some little time ago, the honourable and learner} member for Corio asked some questions about some rethe marks made by Major Garrard in regard on (he goods. to certain guns at Queenscliff. I am now supplied with the following answer: Re Major Garrard's remarks as to {our of the years. guns at the forts at Queenscliff being without ammunition, after a full consideration of was required as regards the guns for defence, Major-Genera-1 Sir Edward Hutton classed guns as reserve, and did not consider it necessary to provide cordite for them.

14,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I wish to know from the Postmaster-General if it is a fact that the postal oflicials of the Commonwealth are employed as debt collectors.?,13
15,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am not aware that any of them are engaged in that employment. If the honourable member will give me fuller particulars, I shall be 'pleased to make inquiries on the subject.",13

17,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"No doubt the honourable member refers to what is known as the value parcels post, which was instituted by the honourable member for Macquarie, under which postmen collect payment on certain parcels.",13
18,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Is the Postvarious master-General aware that the tradespeople in country districts find this system of debt-collecting by the postal officials hardship, because, to their injury, f tralizes trade in the cities? Will he, fore, consider the advisability of rescindin ing the regulation which empowers postal officials to collect debts?",13
19,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If the no honourable member wishes to further on the subject, I think he should apply to the honourable member for matter Macquarie^",13
20,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I should like to know when the value parcels post was first brought into general operation,and the extent to which it has hitherto been e ing to know how far the business of. country storekeepers is being affected by it.",13

26,Mr GLYNN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Will the Department see that in future the lowest tender is accepted, - even though i(may come from a State in which the supplies are not to be used ?",14

Mr SPEAKER reported the receipt of messages from His Excellency the Gover.nor-General, transmitting Supplementary ""Estimates of Expenditure and Supplementary Estimates of Expenditure for Additions, New Works, and Buildings, for the - years ended 30th June, 1904 and 1905.",14
32,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLY AND," I move That the Estimates be printed and referred to ""the Committee of Supply, and that the Committee of Supply and the Committee of Ways and Means be made Orders of the Day foT tomorrow - it is. As honourable members are aware, the sum of ^200,000 is included in the Appropriation Act as an advance to the Treasurer to meet unforseen and extraordinary services, and at the end of the year the expenditure from this vote is included among the items of the Appropriation Bill. The Treasurer's advance is given to enable him to make advances to public oflicers, and to meet expenditure, particulars of which will afterwards be included in a the Parliamentary appropriation. For some dereason this appropriation was not asked a for in respect to the expenditure from Treasurer's advance incurred during the left to the year ended June, 1904.",14
33,Mr HENRV WILLIS,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLY AND,What was the amount ?,14
34,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLY AND,".£7,258 . The tenDeakin Government was then in office, and f it was succeeded by the Watson Governof ment, and afterwards by the Reid Gobe vernment. The expenditure from Trea-' is surer's advance for the year 1904-5 amounted to ,£136,941. A Bill to appropriate that amount could not have been submitted much earlier than the present moment, but a Bill to provide for the amount expended in 1903-4 could have been presented last session. As the money been spent, I think that it is well that apwe should pass these items. They have been allotted to the proper heads, the accounts are all in order, being legally and, covered by the appropriations made by this House. The only thihg we can now do is to appropriate these moneys, of course at the same time criticising any amounts to which may have been expended' out of the advance by the authority of the Treasurer. Question resolved in the affirmative. PATENTS ACT AMENDMENT BILL.",14

36,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLY AND,"Althoug h I understand the Bill is a formal one, and relates, merely to the payment of fees, the Minister qannot introduce it without the usual leave.",14

39,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLY AND,I do not care what NA,14
40,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSOLIDATION OF STATES,"I should like to ask the Treasurer whether Sir Edmund Barton, when Prime Minister, carried out his promise to this House that he would apply to a high financial authority in England for advice as to the practicability of consolidating the public debts of the States; and, if so, whether the report he received will be made available to honourable members.",15

42,Mr FULLER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"the Postmaster General, upon notice I. What is the arrangement between the jPostmaster-General and the Railway Commissioners of New South Wales in regard to railway officials performing postal work ? 2. By whom are these officials paid, and what is the scale of remuneration? 3. Has an addition been made to the railway pay when the additional duties are imposed? 4. In cases where the postal work has increased largely, is any inquiry made or consideration given to the officials; and, if so, by whom?",15
43,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Inquiries are being made, and answers will be furnished as soon as the necessary information is available. POSTAL FACILITIES: BREAK-O'-DAY.",15
44,Sir JOHN QUICK,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"the Postmaster-General, upon notice Whether consideration has been given to the application for postal facilities at Break-o'-day, near Bendigo?",15
45,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"In answer to the honourable member, I beg to stateThe matter referred to has been inquired into, and it has been reported that the information supplied by the postmaster at Bendigo indicated that a private bag only was required. quence of later information, representations received through the honourable member, further inquiry is Being made with a view to providing any facilities that may be necesstry. TEMPORARY LETTER SORTERS,",15
46,Mr JOHNSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"the Postmaster General, upon notice I. Is it the usual practice at Christmas time to employ temporary sorters in the Mail Branch of the General Post Office, Sydney, to cope with the extra work? 2. Is it a fact that this year telegraph messengers from suburban offices receiving ios. per week DEBTS. have been substituted for the usual class of temporary sorters hitherto employed, without receiving extra remuneration? 3. Is it a fact that besides being physically incapable Of doing the heavy work of sorting and hauling heavy baskets of mail matter, some of the boys employed are scarcely tall enough to reach the stamping table? 4. Is it a fact that notwithstanding the statement made in reply to a question asked by Mr. Johnson last week that "" with only three exceptions, the sorting staff have received their full leave during Fhe year,"" eight sorters received their leave subsequently to the date on which the question was asked in the House, and that, even in those cases, only partial leave was granted?",15
47,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Inquiries are being-made, and answers will be furnished as soon as the necessary information is available. VICTORIAN LIGHT HORSE, BENDIGO.",15
48,Sir JOHN QUICK,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, upon notice Whether the Minister for Defence has been able to give favourable consideration to the establishment of a troop of the Victorian Light Horse at Bendigo?",15
49,Mr EWING,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"I have made inquiries, and may state, without actually binding the Minister, that in all probability, the wishes of the honourable and learned member will be acceded to. LETTER-CARRIERS, MELBOURNE.",15
50,Mr MAUGER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"the Postmaster General, upon notice I. Whether he is aware that it is contended by many that the present centralization of letter-carriers at the General Post Office, Melbourne, entails a much' greater expense as compared with the previous local office system, and further that it is a less efficient service to the public? 2. Will the Postmaster-General consider the advisability of making a personal inquiry into the matter?'",15
51,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,The anI n conse- swers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. The Postmaster-General is aware that such representations have been made. 2. Yes. SYDNEY. NEW STANDING ORDERS: LAPSED BILLS.,15
52,Mr DEAKIN,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I move That the following Standing Orders, recommended DV the Standing Orders Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives be adopted by this House, in substitution for existing s'tanding orders 214A and 214B :214A. Any public B i ll which lapses by reason of a prorogation before it has reached its final stage may be proceeded the next ensuing session at the stage Bad reached in the preceding session, a. periodical election for the Senate or general election for either House has not House ? taken place between such two sessions, under the following conditions :(a) If the Bill be in the possession of <4) If the B i ll be in the possession of 214B.

Should the motion for restoration to the notice-paper be not agreed to by the House in which the B i ll originated, left out. the Bill may be introduced and proceeded with in the ordinary manner. The proposed Standing Orders are intended to carry out an arrangement arrived at by the Standing Orders Committees of this House ana of the Senate. Chamber has already performed its part, and it remains for us to perform ours. We have been acting upon similar Standing Orders, the only variation now proposed from those previously operating being made by the provision that requires a resolution on the part of the House in which a measure originated, to restore it fo the business paper in another session.",15
53,Mr BRUCE SMITH,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,Would the Prime Minister state how that would affect the right of honourable members to make 1 second-reading speech on the Australian Industries Preservation Bill?,16
54,Mr DEAKIN,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"That case would not be agreed to. affected. The existing Standing Orders cover it. As I have explained, the Standing Orders make no alteration, except in regard to the consent of the originating House being required before a lapsed Bill can be restored to the business-paper.",16
55,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Parramatta) I take it that these proposals are merely for the purpose of reconstituting lapsed with in business, and that if is intended to it provide that the Bill shall not be restored if except by resolution of the originating",16

Upon which Mr MALONEY had moved by way of amendmentThaf the words "" or by leave of the Court"" be",16
57,Mr MALONEY,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I have to thank the Minister for the way in which he has introduced this clause, but my feeling is that counsel should not be employed, except with the consent of both parties to The other the Cause - It should not be competent for the man with the longest purse to obtain the permission of the Court to employ counsel, and to practically compel his opponent to do the same thing. Section 199 of the Act requires that the Court shall be guided - by the substantial merits and good conscience of each case without regard to legal forms and technicalities, but I am sure that the honourable member for Riverina will agree with me that the spirit of that provision was broken on the very first oca casion that the Court was appealed to. Amendment agreed to. Proposed new clause, as amended, new to- Amendments (by Mr GROOM) agreed That the following new clauses be inserted :""47A. Section 193 of the Principal Act is amended by omitting the whole of sub-section 3."" "" 50B - Section 206 of the Principal Act is amended by omitting the words ' (or until the High Court is established the Governor General.)'""",16
58,Mr BAMFORD,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I move' That the following new clause be inserted "" 26A. Section 97 of the Principal Act amended by omitting paragraph I am sure that honourable members will agree with me that no person should be prohibited from becoming a candidate for this Parliament on account of his poverty. If the electors have suffibe cient confidence in him to return him, his inability to find £ 2 5 should not act as bar to his. election. Upon the last occasion that I submitted a similar proposa], only reason advanced in opposition to it was that the absence of a deposit might lead to candidates being blackmailed.",17
59,Mr CONROY,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,A candidate has been known to poll only four votes.,17
60,Mr BAMFORD,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"But does the honorI able and learned member suggest that didates have gone to the poll for the pose of blackmailing another candidate? The abolition of the £ 2 5 deposit which at present required by the law would have the effect of increasing the expenditure incurred by the Commonwealth. The be machinery which has to be called into operation is exactly the same, irrespective of whether there are only two candidates engaged in a contest, or whether there a hundred. In my judgment, the £ 2 5 posit which the law now insists upon tantamount to a wager with the returning officer that a candidate will poll sp many votes.",17
61,Mr LONSDALE,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," If papers a candidate has a reasonable chance of tee against frivolous opposition. being elected for any constituency, it hardship for him to be called upon posit £ 2 5 with the returning officer. not ashamed to confess that when I first stood jfolr' Parliament the ,£40 deposit which the law demanded had to be found for me.",17
62,Mr WEBSTER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,Wh v should a candidate be compelled to find a depos.it ?,17
63,Mr LONSDALE,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Simpl y to prevent candidates who have no possible chance success from contesting elections. If cannot provide the deposit himself, surely he can find twenty-five supporters who are willing to deposit £ 1 eacho..on his, behalf.",17
64,Mr MALONEY,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," It may interest honourable members to know that the deposit required under the principal Act is a mere bagatelle compared - with expenditure which candidates have to incur in Great Britain. There, if a man has ai walk-over, a Government .official has to be paid £ 2 5 to declare him elected. If there- are two or three candidates for a partiis cular division, they must be prepared toc."" pay from £ 5 0 0 to £700 to provide conveniences which the Commonwealth provides free of cost. Ini my opinion, nocandidate who, from conscientious motives, refuses to borrow from his friends, should' prevented from contesting an electorate. At the same time, it is necessary, to guard 1 a against frivolous opposition. Perhaps that object could be attained by declaring that the 500 or 600 electors-whos e names should not be disclosed to the public-shal l be required, to endorse the nomination paper of any candidate.",17
65,Mr WILKS,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," Upon the last occasion that this question was discussed,. supported the abolition of the deposit cansystem, and I see no reason whatever to purchange the attitude which I then assumed. The honourable member for New England is has declared that the existing law prevents not unnecessary expense. How? All the expenses contingent upon an election have to incurred irrespective of whether there is a contest or not. AU the electoral machinery has to be called into operation. Conare sequently the deposit system does not. dediminish the cost to which the Commonis wealth is subjected. The honourable mem-, ber for Melbourne has urged that it would be wise to insist upon all candidates securing the endorsement of their nomination by 500 or 600 electors, as a guaranNeed is no I remind him that candidates themselves to deare the best judges of when there is I am frivolous opposition, and in such circumstances they will limit their expenditure accordingly. I fail to see any virtue in the argument that the deposit system secures economy both to the Commonwealth and to the candidate. We all know that today elections are conducted upon what is known as the ticket system, of and I fail to see that any good purpose a man is to be served by the continuance of the deposit. If the object be to keep down the number of candidates, I am certain that it is not achieved. The mere fact that he had to provide a deposit of £ 2 5 would not be a barrier to the nomination of the average man who thought he the had any chance of being ieturne'd.",17
66,Mr CHANTER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I regret that I cannot see my way to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Herbert. At one time, under the electoral law of New South Wales, it was .necessary to lodge £ 4 0 with a nomination paper, and, under that system, a defeated candidate rarely lost his deposit. After .a time, the State Parliament, in its wis-dom, decided to repeal the provision re-quiring a deposit to be lodged, and the a result was that in almost every electorate ,a contest took place. Men who had not the slightest chance of being returned frequently offered themselves for election, and the country was thus put to much unnecessary expense.",18
67,Mr WILKS,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"But in any event the 'Senate elections must take place on the same day as those for the House of Representatives, so that no saving can be effected by the continuance of the deposit - system.",18
68,Mr CHANTER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"I disagree with the honourable member. On one occasion, nominations were invited for the State electorate of which I was the representative, ^ind it was generally believed that I was not to be opposed. But at the last moment a gentleman, nearly eighty years of age, who was somewhat deficient mentally, was nominated against me, with the result that the Crown was put to the expense of conducting an election, at which he polled seventeen out of a total of between 1,000 and 2,000 votes. In another case, - a candidate's nomination was signed by - seven electors', but he polled only five votes.",18
69,Mr JOHNSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,I know of a case in which a candidate received only two.,18
70,Mr CHANTER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"I recollect the case to which the honourable member refers. Frivolous nominations followed upon the - abolition of the Odeposit system, but as soon as the practice of requiring a deposit to be lodged with every nomination - was reverted to, frivolous contests were avoided. I am satisfied that the existing - provision does not interfere with the nomination of candidates who have any reason to believe that their candidature is likely i:o be successful, and I . therefore, trust that the amendment will be rejected.",18
71,Mr BROWN,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," Unlik e the honourable member for Riverina, I think the amendment should be accepted. It - embodies a principle of which I have approved for some time; as the result of my experience as a member of the State Parliament of New South Wales. Originally, under the electoral law of that State, a deposit was not required; but, because it was said that a contest at a by-election was due to the influence of publicans, who - felt that it would lead to the distribution of money, the Parliament decided to require a deposit of ^40 with each nomination. That provision inflicted a hardship, not only upon many would be candidates, but upon their friends.",18
72,Mr LONSDALE,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,I have not heard of a case of hardship having arisen under it.,18
73,Mr BROWN,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Le t me give the honourable member a case in. point. An .able, reputable gentleman in my own electorate- a prominent land-taxer, whom I hold in the highest esteem-desire d to contest a seat in the State Parliament; and, as he was not in a position to find the necessary deposit himself, a number of his friends lodged it for him. They expected, very naturally, that it would be returned, but, to their dismay, it was garnisheed.",18
74,Mr WILKS,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,We might as well charge every elector 2s.. 6d. for the right to vote.,18
75,Mr BROWN,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"The principle in each case is the same. I am free to admit that I am not a wealthy man, and that, when I was first nominated, I should have found it a difficult matter to raise the deposit of £,40. No deserving man who wishes to secure a seat in Parliament should have to place himself under a monetary obligation to his friends. The corollary of a free franchise is a free nomination.",18
76,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,How are we to prevent a rush of nominations for the Senate elections?,18
77,Mr BROWN,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"I admit that there has been an abuse of the system, that in some cases candidates have been nominated to split a vote, and in others merely to secure the expenditure of money which naturally attends a contested election.",18
78,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,And sometimes a candidate is nominated for mere amusement.,18
79,Mr BROWN,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Quite so; but abuses of the kind are not so numerous as to require the remedy embodied in the principal Act. If the purpose to be served is that of splitting votes, a deposit will always be found; whilst I do not think that the deposit system deters those who wish a contest to take place, for the sake of the expenditure which it entails, from, putting up a candidate. It is true that the existing law may prevent nominations being lodged by political cranks of the class to whom the honourable member for Riverina has referred; but they are few and far between, and I hold that there is no justification for providing*a penalty to meet such cases. As the result of my experience as a member of the State Parliament, I am strongly opposed to the provision in the existing Act, and hope that the amendment will be carried. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin)- I would urge the honourable member for Herbert not to press his amendment. He must be aware that there are many publicans, who, although decent fellows, naturally wish to see a contest because of the expenditure of money that it involves, and are therefore prepared to put up opposition when a deposit is not required.",18
80,Mr WILKS,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"The honourable member does not want opposition:. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Non e of us do. The honourable member for Herbert must be aware that a Labour man, or any other candidate who has a hope of winning a seat, has no difficulty in raising a £ 2 5 deposit. If such a man experiences any difficulty in the matter, let him come to me.",19
81,Mr WEBSTER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I differ from those who think that the requirement that a deposit of £ 2 5 shall accompany a ' nomination is not a barrier in the way of many aspirants to politidal honours. It was very inconvenient for me to find the money to make this deposit, although I haa every chance of winning the seat, and I was prevented from using the money , while fighting the election. Before resigning from the State Parliament to contest the Federal seat, I did not see how I could obtain the money necessary to make a deposit of £ 2 5 , and to pay my expenses, but, fortunately, some of my constituents had some time previously opened a subscription list, with a view to making me a . testimonial in appreciation of my services, 'and I went to the electorate to see if I could be allowed to use part of the money collected, to pay my deposit. If I had been told that it was not their intention fo collect money to enable me to leave the State Parliament, I could not have contested the Federal seat. We have no right to put any obstacle in the path of the aspirant to political honours.",19
82,Mr WILKS,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,A man is not required pay for the privilege of recording his vote.,19
83,Mr WEBSTER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"No , and similarly, a man should not be required to pay to become a candidate for Parliament. No distinctions should be made in this matter between rich and poor. It is objected that, without a deposit, men of straw are frequently nominated, but it is not often that men allo^v themselves to be nominated unless they think that they have an opportunity to win a seat",19
84,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I hope that the Committee will not accept the proposed new clause. The sum of ^25 is so small that it should not prevent any candidate likely to be chosen by a constituency from being nominated. I do not think that any V one possessing the political attainments likely to enable him to secure a seat in Parliament will find it impossible to obtain the money to make this deposit. It has to be remembered, however, that the expense of conducting a Commonwealth election is very much greater than the expense of conducting a State or municipal election, and nobody, except bond fide candidates, should be encouraged to go to the poll. Where no deposit is required, I have known men to allow themselves to be nominated merely for advertising purposes, having no hope of winning the seat.",19
85,Mr WILKS,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,A candidate might wish to advance some political opinion.,19
86,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Then , he should fight the election fairly and squarely. I have every sympathy for those who are F » oor but I do not think that the Commonwealth should be put - to an expense which,, in the case of a Senate election, might amount to thousands of pounds, by candidates who are not bond fide. However, as the pros and cons of this question are well known to honourable members, I shall not occupy more time in dealing with it.",19
87,Mr CONROY,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I trust that the deposit will not be abolished. The fact that £ 2 5 has to be ""deposited has never debarred from nomination any manwho had a chance of winning a seat; but, even if it did, the inconvenience to an individual is nothing as compared with the 1 expense caused to the Commonwealth whenelections are made necessary by the nomination of candidates who are not bond fide. Would the honourable member for Herbert agree to the proposal that the candidate who has thuscaused the time and' to money of the country to be wasted should, if he failed to score one-tenth of the votes: polled, be liable to imprisonment for from three to six months? Under the law, every candidate who polls 200 out of every 1,000 votes given has his money returned, and those who cannot estimate the feeling of the electors sufficiently well to know that they will be able to obtain that number of votes should not complain of being mulcted in this small sum.

88,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I move;That the following heading and new clause be inserted :PART IX - THENOMINATION S. 26D. After section one hundred and live the Principal Act the following section is in . serted :105A. A candidate may withdraw his consent to his nomination not less than twentyj-four liours before .the hour of nomination by lodging with the Commonwealth Electoral Officer for the State in the case of a Senate election, or with the Divisional Returning Officer for the Division in the case of a House of Representatives election, a notice of withdrawal in the prescribed form, and thereupon the nomination shall be cancelled, and the deposit lodged shall be forfeited. At present a candidate once nominated cannot withdraw before nomination day, and I think that we should permit this to be done, subject to the forfeiture of the deposit.",20
89,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,Why should the deposit be forfeited?,20
90,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Some penalty, it ,has been represented to me, should be imposed, or otherwise men might hand in nominations with the object of ... TI levying blackmail. This provision of right ... .37 of withdrawal was recommended by the Conference of Electoral Officers, and the 26 Minister approves of it. AVES. Mr BATCHELOR (Boothby) - I do not see any reason why a candidate should not be permitted to withdraw right mp to the time fixed for the receipt of nominations. A man might die within the twenty four hours preceding the time fixed for the NOES. receipt of nominations, but according J. H. to the honourable member's proposal, his name would still have to appear on the ballot papers.",20
91,Mr MALONEY,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I quite agree with the honourable member for Boothby. It has been my practice to lodge my nomination within a few hours of the time fixed for the receipt of nominations, and I see no reason why the power of withdrawal should not extend ..right up to the last moment. H - Mr Mahon (Coolgardie) - I think that the proposed new clause would rather hamper, than assist, a candidate. I take it that a candidate is morally and legally entitled to withdraw his nomination and dePAIS. mand his deposit back at any time prior to the actual time fixed for the nomination.",20
92,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"It is held that at present a candlidate has np power to withdraw, and is intended to overcome the'difficulty.",20
93,Mr MAHON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,Some more simple means should be adopted. A candidate should be able to withdraw right up to the time of allowed for the receipt of nominations.,20
94,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"I do not object to extend the time for withdrawal, as suggested.",20
95,Mr CAMERON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," If honourable members agree to this proposal, they will stultify themselves. We have just decided that a candidate shall deposit / ^ , 2 the object being to prevent bogus nomina-. - tions. If we permit a candidate to withdraw his nomination and to demand back his deposit, we shall render nugatory what we have already done.",20
96,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," The honourable member misunderstands the position. The deposit would be forfeited. This provision was .recommended by the Conference of Electoral Officers. At the present time any person may. nominate as a candidate up to the hour of 12 noon on the day of nomination, but once the nomination paper and the deposit are lodged-eve n though 'they may have been sent in weeks before the nomination day-the y cannot be withdrawn. That opinion has been given by the Commonwealth officers. The honourable member for North Sydney proposes that before any expense has been incurred by the Commonwealth, a candidate shall be allowed to withdraw his nomination, but that he shall forfeit' his deposit. It is not desirable that we should afford opportunities to bogus candidates to levy blackmail.; and, therefore, it is considered wise to provide for the forfeiture of the deposit.",21
97,Mr BRUCE SMITH,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"What would prompt a man to withdraw his nomination, unless his d'eposit were returned to him?",21
98,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"The prospect of being defeated. He would not have his deposit returned in any case unless he registered a certain proportion of votes. We should do all we can to prevent nominations on mere chance. ' The act of nomination should be regarded as a serious step. I can quite conceive, however, that after a man has, after due consideration, been nominated, the position may become so changed that he may not consider it worthwhile to go on. Under such conditions, we propose to give him a chance to withdraw, but the deposit which safeguards the nomination must be forfeited. Take a scattered electorate like that of Coolgardie or Maranoa. A candidate for either of those divisions may desire to hold his first meetings in the populous centres, and subsequently to visit the remote portions of the electorate. Consequently, he may wish to lodge his nomination paper with the returning officer some weeks before the date of .nomination. Upon the whole, I think that the proposal of the honourable member for North Sydney is a fair one, and I am quite willing to assent to it.",21
99,Mr BROWN,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," Fro m the way in which the existing law operated at the last general election, I recognise the necessity for its amendment. Under the principal Act, when once a candidate has lodged his nomination, paper with the returning officer he cannot withdraw from a contest, no matter how desirable it may be for him to do so. I disagree with that portion of the proposal of the honourable member for North Sydney which permits a candidate to withdraw his nomination not less than twenty-four hours before the hour of nomination.",21
100,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"That was suggested by the conference of electoral experts, but I do not see very much reason for it, and I am willing to strike out that portion of the amendment.",21
101,Mr BROWN,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Then I shall be perfectly satisfied. At the same time, I think that if a candidate is allowed to withdraw, his deposit should be refunded, so long as his nomination has not involved the Commonwealth in expenditure.",21
102,Mr TUDOR,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I need scarcely remind honourable members that under the Electoral Acts of some of the States a candidate is at liberty to withdraw his nomination up till a week after nomination day, and is entitled to have his deposit refunded. But under the Commonwealth Act when once a candidate has been nominated, he cannot withdraw from a contest. There is, however, nothing to prevent a bogus candidate from addressing meetings and canvassing an electorate right up till the lasc moment prior to the nomination. It seems to me that the proposal of the honourable member for North Sydney, if adopted, will not alter the present situation. I cannot see that very much good or very much harm will result fromits adoption.",21
103,Mr MAHON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," The weakness of this clause is that a candidate who makes his deposit, and subsequently wishes to withdraw from a contest, has no inducement to do so, and consequently he puts the country to considerable expense. I think that we ought to offer a candidate some inducement'to withdraw under such circumstances, but at the same time we should mulct him in a fine for his temerity in nominating when he knew that he had no chance of being elected. I would, therefore, suggest that after the word "" and,"" line 15, the words ""two-thirds of "" be ins*crt6cl",21
104,Mr HENRY WILLIS,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Robertson) It seems to me there is very little inducement for a candidate to retire at the last moment if he is obliged to forfeit his deposit. On the contrary, there is every reason for him to go to the poll, and thus to involve his opponent and the country in considerable expense. I am inclined to support the suggestion of the honourable member for Coolgardie.",21
105,Mr BAMFORD,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS, I think that some provision ought to be made in this clause for the return of a candidate's deposit in the event of his death occurring between the time at which the deposit was lodged and the date of the election.,22
106,Mr BATCHELOR,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I move That the proposed new clause be amended leaving out the words "" not less than twenty-four hours "" with a view to insert in lieu thereof words "" at any time."" No candidate will subject himself to a fine of ^2 5 when he can escape that penalty tageous. l merely by withholding his consent to withdraw to the last possible moment.",22
107,Mr MAHON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I would ney) point out to the honourable member for Boothby that if the words "" not less than twenty-four hours"" be omitted, it will be possible for a candidate, who may fear the result of a contest, to induce a opponent to nominate so as to keep others out of the field. At the last moment the dummy could withdraw, and the man would be elected. Under the clause, in its original form, if the withdrawal had to be made within twenty-four hours of actual time of nomination, such a scheme could not be carried out, because the public would be aware of what was being done, and another candidate would be nominated. I do not wish to oppose the amendment, but it seems to me that the contingency mentioned has not been taken into account.",22
108,Mr BRUCE SMITH,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I think that the Committee ought to recollect that is fundamentally necessary that the sions of this Bill should be simple and equivocal. There is no part of an toral Act over which more unpleasantness can occur than over doubtful phraseBut! ology with regard to the position of candidraws dates. If any good could be derived the amendment. I should heartily support it. But the Committee are evidently termined that although a candidate may tire, he shall not be refunded his .£25 posit. That being the case, what induceThose ment is there for him to subject himself any trouble at all? If he knows that when once his money has been deposited he cannot secure its return, we may accept it as inevitable that he will not make his deposit until the last possible moment, when all doubt has been removed as to the wisdom of his entering the election. If , however, the deposit is to be returned, then, unless we can change some of the attributes of human' nature giving us this guarantee, the introduction of this clause can do no good?",22
109,Mr BROWN,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Havin g put down his money, lie will not withdraw.",22
110,Mr BRUCE SMITH,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"No , because he will consider that he has a chance of getting a proportion of it returned to him. If we add words in which we can see no value, by we shall only complicate a clause that should be as simple and as unequivocal as the possible. The Committee ought to object to the insertion of any condition unless they are satisfied that it will be advan",22
111,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"North Syd-I . have listened with attention to the remarks of the honourable and learned member for Parkes, but I would point out that we are dealing with, not what is the intent of the present Act, but that which has dummy been construed to be its meaning. ""He says that if a man had once lodged his deposit, although he might' have clone so other weeks before nomination day",22
112,Mr BRUCE SMITH,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,Me n never do that.,22
113,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"In some the cases a candidate must lodge his deposit some time before nomination day. When a man is seeking to be returned for a large electorate, and desires to have everything in order before he sets out upon his campaign, he often lodges his deposit some time before the day of nomination. Then, again, candidates for election to the Senate may find it necessary to attend to that detail it days before the last hour of nomination. proviHere is another case that is worthy unof consideration. A party may nominate a Eleccandidate in the belief that a more desirable man cannot be induced to stand. if , at the last moment, the latter withhis objection, and the party desires from to nominate him, the candidate first nominated cannot secure a withdrawal of his depaper. The result of this system is that renames are placed on the ballot-papers in a deway that tend only to confuse the electors. who do not pay close attention to to political matters cannot be expected to know that one of those on the ballot-paper is not really a candidate, and the outcome of the system is that votes are often wasted. Even the electoral officers have recognised its undesifableness, and an amendment has, therefore, been proposed to allow of withdrawal up to the last hour of the day of nomiI nation. The clearer and simpler our ballotsequence, papers are the better._ It is desirable that known. we should make it clear that up to the last moment prior to nomination there can a Withdrawal, but, to meet certain dangers, I am perfectly willing to accept the protherefore posal put forward by the honourable memwho ber for Coolgardie. Amendment of the amendment agreed to.",22
114,Mr MAHON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I move That the proposed new clause be amended by bribery. inserting after the word "" and,"" line 15, the words "" two-thirds of."" If this amendment be accepted, a candicandidate date who retires in the circumstances named will be repaid one-third of his posit money, while the remaining twodate thirds wilj be forfeited. I think that adoption of this system would tend very often to save the country the expense of conducting an election, while it would also reduce the costs of a bond fide candidate. I may mention that the Minister, and also the honourable member who moved the sertion of the proposed new clause, consented to the insertion of my amendpopular ment.",23
115,Mr FISHER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," Havin g given this proposal some consideration, have arrived at the conclusion that it is to allow a candidate, who - withdraws, secure the repayment of the whole of his deposit money. It is useless to deny that when nomination involves some monetary consideration, a man is not likely to offer himself as a candidate for election unless he is fairly confident: that he will have run for his money. I recognise that the desire is to protect the Commonwealth from unnecessary expenditure, but although much has been"" said about bogus canditwenty-four dates. I do not think we are entitled ourselves up as judges in that regard. _ A man may have but a very small following, and yet be honestly convinced that he should offer his services to his country. a candidate be permitted to withdraw nomination, and his name does not appear tived. upon the ""Ballot-paper, why should not the whole of his deposit be returned?",23
116,Mr MAHON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,<-That would encourage leaving black-mailing. ',23
117,Mr FISHER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"I disagree with the honourable member. Is it reasonable to suptopose that a candidate would allow himself to be black-mailed by a man who, he felt satisfied, had no chance of being returned ? f a .candidate is, so to speak, of no conthat fact is generally pretty well",23
118,Mr MAHON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"But a candidate might be have to spend £ 2 0 0 or £ 3 0 0 as the result of his being opposed, and it would pay him to give even an opponent had no chance of being returned a sum of £ 5 0 to retire.",23
119,Mr FISHER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"I take it that no honourable member would do such a thing,; if he did, he would be guilty of an act of I agree with the honourable and learned member for Parkes, that we should make the clause as clear as possible. A who withdraws from, the field should either be returned the whole of his dedeposit money Or none at all. If a candibecomes ill or arrives at the concluthe sion that he(has made a mistake, why should he not be allowed to withdraw and to Jiave his money returned? During the debate a tendency has been shown on the part of many honourable members, to conserve the interests of a particular set of candiindates. I think that the principle is a have wrong one. Why should a man who is a candidate, and therefore likely to succeed, have any right to claim a special privilege or protection? I strongly hold I that if a candidate's nomination be withwise drawn before the day of nomination, the to whole of his deposit should be returned.",23
120,Mr JOHNS ON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS, I feel disposed to support the view put forward by the honourable member for Wide Bay. A candidate should be allowed to withdraw at any time before the day of nomination a good without being mulcted in a penalty.,23
121,Mr FISHER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"I should not object to a provision that he shall withdraw at least ""hours before the time for re-' to set ceiving nominations expires.",23

123,Mr FISHER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS, I think that the deposit lodged should be returned if the candidate dies at any time prior to the election. I should like to know whether the person who dies before the hour of nomination can be legally regarded as a candidate.,24

The clause puts it beyond doubt that the deposit of any person dying before the hour of nomination shall be returned to his personal representatives. Amendment agreed^to. Proposed new clause, as amended, agreed to.",24
125,Mr LEE,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I move That the following new clause be inserted :""42A - After section one hundred and fifty, three A, the following section is inserted :15311 -(1 ) Notwithstanding anything in this Act, if both Houses of the Parliament by a resolution approve of a system of voting by means of voting machines described in such resolution, the polling at any prescribed polling-places may subject to regulations be conducted by means of such voting machines instead of by ballot-papers. (2) After the passing of such resolution vernor-General may make regulations prescribing all matters necessary or convenient to be prescribed for carrying out or giving effect to the system of voting hy means of such voting machines. (3) Such regulations shall in particular for(a) The secrecy of the voting; \b) The prevention of f r a u d ; and (c) The polling-places at which the polling shall be conducted by means of the voting machines. (4) Regulations made in pursuance of this section shall not have any force until they have been laid before both Houses of the Parliament for. thnty days or, if within that time a resolution has been proposed in either House of the Parliament to disapprove of the regulations, until the motion for the resolution has been disposed of. (5) If a resolution disapproving of them is passed by either House of the Parliament the regulations shall be of no effect."" There are now gentlemen in various States who are devoting their attention to the perfecting' of voting machines, and if machines are invented which will properly and expeditiously record votes, without the violation of the secrecy of the ballot, and in such a manner that fraud can be prevented, I think that we should make provision for allowing them to be used. The use of these machines is not made mandatory by the proposed new clause, and cannot take place until it has been authorized by a resolution passed by both Houses of Parliament. I understand that the Minister will accept my amendment.",24
126,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I am prepared to accept the amendment if it is in order. It provides, in effect, that if , after thorough investigation by experts, and, I presume, a trial under very harsh and rigorous conditions, a machine is discovered which will fulfil the conditions essential for the proper conduct of a ballot, it may be used in an election, if its use is authorized by a resolution of Parliament.",24
127,Mr THOMAS,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,The passing of the authorizing resolution would be equivalent to the introduction and passing of an amending Bill.,24
128,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Yes . Four or five voting machines have already been submitted to the Department. They are all Australian inventions, and exceedingly ingenious, though I need not particularize their methods of working, because I think that honourable members have seen many of them. I confess that, to my mind, there are many difficulties in the way of using machines for the registration of votes. In the first place, the Go- they can be used only in large centres of population, because the Commonwealth could not afford to supply them to every outlying polling-place. This would have the effect of complicating our electoral provide arrangements by introducing different systems. Then, again, as has been recently shown in Victoria, machines can be manipulated, without the manipulation leaving any record by which the wrongdoer can be traced, or its being even discovered that any wrong has been done.",24
129,Mr CHANTER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"The human machine can be manipulated, too.",24
130,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Yes ; but in that case detection of the offence-is more probable. The Electoral Committee recommended that it was worthwhile investigating the working of voting machines. The evidence given to us on the subject was that they have been used satisfactorily in large centres in the United States, recording the votes polled accurately and expeditiously. But the Department is not yet in a position to confidently recommend the adoption of any machine here, even if the use of machines were sanctioned by Parliament. I fear that the amendment is beyond the scope of the Bill, because the principal Act, which we are seeking to amend, provides for voting by means of ballot-papers, which is essentially different from the recording of votes by machines.",24
131,Mr THOMAS,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I hope the Committee will not agree to the amendment. It will be time enough to provide for the use of voting machines when the Department is prepared to recommend some make of machine as satisfactory, and the Minister has admitted that the passing of resolutions to sanction the use of a machine - whic h is what is contemplated by the proposed new clause--woul d be practically equivalent to the introduction and passing of an amending Bill. One course would be likely to provoke as much discussion as would the other. After the explanation made by the Minister, it would be unwise to proceed any further, and I think that we might defer the consideration of the matter until it has been established beyond all doubt that we should do better to adopt voting machines than adhere to our present system.",25
132,The CHAIRMAN,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"I have had some doubts with regard to the admissibility of certain amendments, and I have given the matter some attention. Honourable members must recognise that the powers of the Committee are limited. We are bound by the instruction of the House, and by the scope of the measure submitted to us. But, putting those considerations on one side for the moment, I would point out that we have, during the last few days, adopted certain provisions which are directly at variance with that now submitted. Therefore, although I am averse to restricting the power of the Committee, I feel that it is not competent for it to insert the proposed new clause; it would have the effect of rendering nugatory much' of the work already done in connection with the Bill.",25
133,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I move That the following new clause be inserted :"" 44A. Section one hundred and sixty-nine of the Principal Act is amended by striking out a-11 words in (i ) after "" in excess of,"" and inserting in lieu thereof "" an amount to be fixed by the Chief Electoral Officer in respect of each Division, having regard to the area of the Division, the means of travelling therein, and the distribution of its population, but not to be less than One hundred pounds, nor more than Two hundred and fifty pounds, for any Division."" I do not wish to initiate a general debate on this question, because I addressed' mvself to it at some, length when I spoke on. the motion for the second .reading of the Bill. Whilst we have fixed ai minimum for election expenses, which will apply generally, we must recognise that the electorates vary widely, not only in regard to area, but also in respect of the distribution 'of population and their general features. Whilst £100 might be sufficient to cover the expenses of a candidate in a small and thicklypopulated electorate, it would he manifestly inadequate in large electorates, with scattered populations. I do not object to the maximum of £ 1 0 0 for some electorates, but I think that we should take into account inequality of conditions as between one electorate and another. Mr Bruce SMITH^-Does the honourable member think that the area of an electorate should be taken into account?",25
134,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Certainly , because in some of the larger divisions, much more travelling is necessitated, and it is more difficult to reach the electors.",25
135,Mr BRUCE SMITH,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,I heard one honourable member say that he had gone through his electorate on a bicycle.,25
136,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Yes , and one honourable member stated that it would occupy him six months if he visited every part of his electorate. I recognise that under present circumstances it is not likely that honourable members will listen to this proposal, but I regard the matter as a very important one. We allow candidates for the Senate to spend £250 in a small State like Tasmania, whereas some of the electoral divisions which are represented by honourable members - in this House have six times the area of that State.",25
137,Mr THOMAS,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"But not so many polling places. My electorate is larger in area than Tasmania, but I would rather travel and conduct an electoral campaign there, than make an exhaustive canvass of Tasmania.",25
138,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,But in his electorate the honourable member has the weight of population in one place.,25
139,Mr THOMAS,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,I had tb travel about 750 miles prior to the last election.,25
140,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Under my proposal the Chief Electoral Officer would take that circumstance into account, and would make a fair allowance. I do not think candidates should have to face the alternative of refraining from thoroughly canvassing their electorates, in order to keep their expenses within the prescribed limits, or largely exceeding the specified allowance. In large electorates where the centres of population are scattered, halls have to be hired at a great number of places, and posters have to be distributed and advertisements inserted in the newspapers announcing each meeting. The conditions, that have to be complied with in such cases are very different from those prevailing in city or suburban constituencies, where two or three thousand persons can be addressed at'the a ne meeting. Some electorates are so large that it is, impossible for the candidate to reach all parts of them, and therefore many of the electors have to be communicated with by circular. Honourable members will agree with me that it is necessary that the views of the candidates should be made known to all the electors. not an advocate of large expenditure by candidates,, but I do not wish to place them under the necessity of leaving a number of the electors in ignorance as to their views, or of incurring expense in excess of the lawful sum, and which the unscrupulous will hide when the returns are sent in.",25
141,Mr THOMAS,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"I represent one of the largest electorates, and my expenses on the ever. last occasion amounted to £ 1 3 .",26
142,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"The elecing tion should not have cost the honourable member even that sum-h e was grossly ber extravagant. Although I have very little hope of carrying my proposal, I intend test the feeling of the Committee.",26
143,Mr CHANTER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I intend to oppose this clause, which seeks crease the limit of expenditure to which candidates are at present restricted. If i be accepted by the Committee, it will within the option of the Chief Electoral Officer to permit a candidate to expend £250 in the case of an election for the House of Representatives. Proposed new clause negatived. Amendment (by ' Mr TUDOR, for Mr. DUGALD THOMSON), proposed - That the following new clause be inserted :"" 46B. Section one hundred and eighty of the Principal Act is amended by inserting in (a) after the word "" advertisement,"" the words "" other than an advertisea ment in a newspaper.""",26
144,Mr FRAZER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," The effect of this proposal would be to remove necessity which now exists for all electoral advertisements appearing in the newspapers,, being signed by the secretary of a parliainsertion in the newspapers. mentary candidate. I do not agree with it. If it be necessary for other forms of advertisement to bear the signature of the secretary of a candidate, it seems to me that it is doubly necessary in the case of a newspaper advertisement.",26
145,Mr CROUCH,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,Did the honourable member himself comply with the law in that respect at the last election?,26
146,Mr FRAZER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,I did.,26
147,Mr TUDOR,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,No candidate did so in Victoria with the exception of myself.,26
148,Mr FRAZER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"If the candidates in Victoria were so ignorant of the provisions of the law as to endanger their seats if they were elected, I may tell the honourable member that the same indifference was not manifested by candidates in Western Australia. At the end of an election campaign all candidates are compelled to present to I am the Chief Electoral Officer a statement of the expenses which they have incurred. If irresponsible persons are to be allowed to publish advertisements on behalf of any candidate, who can vouch for the accuracy of that return ? The worse feature of the amendment is that under it any person might publish advertisements regarding a candidate without any authorization what If it be adopted, there would be nothing to prevent any man from insertin the Melbourne newspapers an advertisement intimating that the honourable memfor Yarra would address the electors at Richmond tomorrow night, when, as a to matter of fact, he intended to speak at Collingwood",26
149,Mr TUDOR,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,There is nothing to preto invent that being done now.,26
150,Mr FRAZER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"I contend that there is. t If we strike out that portion of the existbe ing law which relates to newspaper advertisements, we shall be offering a premium to those who desire to injure a particular candidate, and we shall be denying the latter the opportunity to secure redress.",26
151,Mr TUDOR,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I opposed this provision when it was inserted in the principal Act. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie has stated that the present law prevents any unauthorized person from advertising that I intended to address meeting at Richmond, when, as a matter of fact, I intended to speak at Collingwood. May I point out to him that the it does nothing of the kind. Any person can attach the name of my secretary to an advertisement, and secure its The man who receives the advertisement cannot idena tify the individual who hands it to him. The present law is a dead letter in Victoria. Only the other day I turned up the file the Age for last December twelve months, when the last Federal elections took, place, and upon one day I counted twenty-two or twenty-three election advertisements, only three of which complied with the quirements of the law. Two out of these were my own, and the other had been not inserted on behalf of Senator Styles. adoption I regard the retention of the existing provision in ""the principal Act as absurd. Unless the proposal of the honourable member for North Sydney be carried, Ave ought to insist upon every transgressor the law being prosecuted. Personally think that a copy of all electoral advertiseamendment ments and all other advertising matter publaw lished on behalf of candidates should sent to the Chief Electoral Officer, so he might see whether they had infringed the law. That would form an additional safeguard in the matter of the limitation of expenses. In the interests of the big newspapers, it is not fair to compel candipresent dates to attach to every advertisement which they insert the name of their secretary.",26
152,Mr HUTCHISON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I ment hope that the proposal of the honourable member for North Sydney will not be acdates cepted. The existing law has been law of South Australia for many yeairs. that State all election advertisements very carefully watched, and if a successful candidate infringed the law, prompt action would follow. In Adelaide the principal newspapers ch'arge candidates per column for inserting their addresses the electors. They allow them half a column gratis.",27
153,Mr TUDOR,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,The Melbourne newspapers. papers will give us nothing.,27
154,Mr HUTCHISON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"So far as I am aware no such practice has obtained im any other part of the world. Under the old South Australian system it was by no uncommon for a candidate to arrange with the proprietor of a newspaper to publish page report of his speech without any dication to the public that it was an adverelected tisement. These reports often set forth that the candidate was enthusiastically ceived by an overflowing meeting, a matter of fact, there were, perhaps, only a score of persons present, and in this the public have been deceived. A labour candidate who could not afford fo pay lengthy advertisement was thus severely handicapped. There also used to be an arrangement by which the daily newspapers of gave every candidate for political honours a half-column report at the opening of the campaign, but refrained from, publishing any further notice of his meetings unless it was paid for as an advertisement. Thus rethe candidate with means enjoyed a great advantage over his poorer opponent. I do blame the newspaper proprietors for the of this system, but the result of the law now in force in South Australia is that if a candidate makes special arrangements for the publication of the reports of his addresses those reports must be signed, and of must be preceded by the word ""AdvertiseI ment."" Another point is that prior to the of the South Australian electoral a candidate could incur great expense in be connection with the publication of reports that of his meetings without being called upon to account for it in his statement! of electoral expenses. These facts ought to satisfy honourable members of the necessity for the provision in the existing Act. Even at the time it is by no means uncommon to see a four or five column report of an electioneering address in a South Australian newspaper; but, as the word ''advertise"" must appear at the head of such reports, the public are not misled. If candichoose to pay for long reports of their the speeches they may do so, as long as the In public are not led to believe that they are are ordinary newspaper reports.",27
155,Mr SPENCE,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"B y special arrangement, telegrams have been sent all over the coun£ 4 try announcing that a candidate has been to holding highly successful meetings.",27
156,Mr HUTCHISON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"I have known such telegrams to be published in various newsI think the provision in the South Australian Act is a splendid one, and that it ought to form part of the Commonwealth electoral law. At the last general election Mr Charleston, a former ..member of the means Senate, issued an address with the word "" advertisement' appearing at the top of 1 a it, but it was unsigned, and I can assure inhonorable members that had he been reaction would have been taken against him. I am surprised that the South Ausretralian law in this respect has not been when, as copied by the other States.",27
157,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," As the mover of the proposed new clause. I would point out for that honourable members appear to be unnecessarily alarmed as to its posopponent. sible effect. The absurdity of the section which I seek to amend is that it requires that even a notice calling a meeting have at the foot of it the name and address of the person authorizing it. vision involves a candidate in a great deal of unnecessary expense, and since it in way safeguards the public, I propose that it shall be repealed, especially as non-compliance with it involves a penalty not exbe going too far. ceeding £ 1 0 0 , or six months' imprisonment.",27
158,Mr HUTCHISON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,That would cover the case to which I have referred.,28
159,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"The hongive orable member has referred to a system which prevails in South Australia, am prepared, in order to avoid the difficulty which he has suggested, to insert after word "" advertisement,"" in the proposed new clause the words "" of a meeting,"" so that paragraph a of section 180 of the prinname cipal Act would be amended by the insertisement tion of the words "" Other than an adverall tisement of a meeting in a newspaper.""",28
160,Mr HUTCHISON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,I should not object to that.,28
161,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,-The prorizing posed new clause would not be so far ing as spme honourable members appear to think; but I am prepared to amend it the way I have indicated. If it be adopted it will prevent candidates being put to what is really an unnecessary expense.,28
162,Mr SPENCE,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Darling).' - I would clause. point out to the honourable member for North Sydney that there is a very strong reason why election advertisements notices should be signed by the person authorizing them. There is nothing prevent a man from inserting an advertisedesigned ment in the name of his opponent callingstands, a meeting for a certain date, and using against him his failure to attend that meeting. It is neoess.arv that we should protect candidates - against bogus adverthat tisements and also electioneering squibs' that are often sent out at the last moment. I have known a Victorian election to turned by the issue, at the eleventh hour, of typewritten circulars bearing no signaof ' ture, and reflecting on one of the candiMy dates. The whole object of section 180 of the principal Act is to protect candiI dates from electioneering tricks.",28
163,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"But there is nothing to prevent a man from inserting bogus advertisement in the name of his clause. The candidate who inserts an advertisement without giving the name and address of the person authorizing it may must be punished, but a man who wished to publish a bogus advertisement would not Such a prothink of signing it.",28
164,Mr SPENCE,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,I think that news-' no papers should be prohibited from publishing unsigned electioneering advertisements,28
165,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,That would,28
166,Mr SPENCE,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"I do not think so. I fail to see why there should be any objection to the provision in the original Act that every electoral advertisement shall the name of the person authorizing it . Why! should a man be ashamed to put his and I name to s,uch an advertisement?",28
167,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"The question the is not as to any one being ashamed, but as to the cost which the system involves.",28
168,Mr SPENCE,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"The publication of the of the person authorizing the adverdoes not involve much cost. At events,, it does not in the case of a country newspaper.",28
169,Mr ROBINSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,The publication of the name and address of the person authothe advertisement often means payreaching for an additional half-inch.,28
170,Mr SPENCE,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"There is something in more than the question of cost to be considered. I think that we should endeavour to secure the purity of elections, and for that reason' I oppose the proposed new",28
171,Mr CROUCH,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I do not think that sufficient reasons have been given for and the rejection of the proposed new clause. The honourable member for Hindmarsh apto pears to think that the section which it is to amend should remain as it inasmuch as in some mysterious way it must assist to dispel an erroneous idea that seems to have grown up in the minds of many people in South' Australia Labour candidates when on the hustings cannot state their views. At the last general election I did not comply with the be provision of the Act, that at the foot of every electoral notice the name and address the person authorizing it shall appear. advertisements always contained the two words, "" C r o u c h "" and ""Corio,"" and considered that that was a suflicient indication of the name and address of the person authorizing them. I hope that the a Committee will accept the proposed new - Mr DUGALD THOMSON - I am willing only."" J:o make the provision read "" notif ying or announcing a meeting.""",28
172,Mr CROUCH,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"The case referred to Jby the honourable member for Hindmarsh is not met by the existing law, because a Jong account in a newspaper, purporting, .to be the report of a meeting, cannot be i-egarded as an electoral advertisement, handbill, or pamphlet. The honourable anember for Kalgoorlie spoke of the possibility of meetings being falsely advertised, but any one who wished to publish a misleading advertisement could easily append a false name to it.",29
173,Mr FRAZER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,Then the newspaper in which it was published should be held responsible.,29
174,Mr CROUCH,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"I have never heard of such tactics being adopted in Victoria, but if a false name were used, the offender - could not be traced. I think that the present provision inflicts unnecessary expense And inconvenience upon candidates.",29
175,Mr BROWN,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," In my opinion, the general requirements of the Electoral Act in regard to the advertising - of public meetings, and so forth, have proved valuable, so far as elections in New South Wales are concerned. I remember that once, when I was contesting A very hotly-fought election, a statement was circulated by special horsemen throughout the settled parts of my electorate, setting forth that I was a member of a singleltax league in Sydney, which, in fact, did not exist, and that I had given a pledge to the league to support a direct land tax for Commonwealth purposes, which would bring in j£8,ooo,ooo. That statement was published on a sheet which bore no imprint, and there was no means of tracing the author of it. It was issued to damage my chances, and looked authentic. Under the old laWj such a statement could have been circulated as an advertisement, but the Commonwealth law would prevent that being done. I do not know that the signing of advertisements convening meetings is so necessary, because I do not think that manv bogus meetings will be advertised but every newspaper proprietor should be required to see, as far as possible, that the advertisements accepted by him are authenticated, and the original copy should be sent to the Chief Electoral. Officer for examination. I suggest' that the amendment be made to read ""other than an advertisement in a newspaper convening public or committee meetings We should stand by the priaciple of the original provision, and, if necessary, strengthen it. For that reason, I should like to see an amendment inserted requiring newspaper proprietors receiving electoral advertisements to see that they are properly authenticated, and copies of them made available to the Chief Electoral Officer, if necessary.  sion in the South Australian law has worked well for a number of years, and has created no difficulty. It has been said that the South Australian newspapers have been unfair with regard to the space which they have given to the reports of candidates' meetings, but they are decidedly fairer than the Victorian newspapers, judging by what I have seen of the deliberate and wilful mutilation of speeches here.",29
176,Mr BROWN,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"That is much worse.  until I came to Melbourne that I knew of this wilful cutting down of speeches delivered in election campaigns or in Parliament. During the Federal Convention campaign, the South Australian newspapers, however, took a course which caused a good deal of annoyance to politicians, by printing among the notes and news of the day what appeared to readers to be authentic reports of meetings, but were really concoctions of the paid secretaries of candidates. When', on one occasion, I complained of this to the leader of the staff of one of the newspapers, I was told that if I liked to do as the candidate to whose paragraphs I was referring was doing, and would pay 6s. an inch for such reports, I would be similarly treated. I believe that it was these practices which led to the present provision in the South Australian electoral law. I think that the name of the person authorizing the publication of any electoral circular, address, or manifesto should be printed, so that the people may know who is responsible for it.",29
177,Mr BATCHELOR,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"That provision does not go far enough. It should apply to leading articles as well.  orable member that it does not go far enough, and I should be very sorry to see it cut down. Advertisements may do a candidate considerable injury, and he ought to be able to ascertain who is attacking him.",29
178,Mr HIGGINS,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Suppos e that a false name were given?  make the newspaper proprietor responsible. I have hitherto conducted my election campaigns without a committee, and did not employ even scrutineers during the last two elections. I should like to see election committees and all similar institutions done away with. In the interests of purity of elections in this great democracy the less opportunity we give for the expenditure of money in such a manner that it will tend to influence the votes of the electors, the better. Every advertisement that appears should bear the name and address of the person inserting it. I shall certainly vote in favour of retaining the law as it stands., Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) - I should like to know whether the Minister could frame a provision to prevent candidates from issuing circulars to the detriment of their opponents on the morning of the election day.",29
179,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,The honourable member for Bourke intends to move in that direction.,30
180,Mr HIGGINS,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Northern Melbourne). - I think that we are at cross purposes in this matter, and that there is a deal of misapprehension as to what the effect of the amendment would be. It would not cure the evils of which the member for Hindmarsh complains, and I suggest that the Minister should make .seme radical amendment in paragraph a of the section proposed to be amended. I cannot make out the meaning of the last phrase, "" and on the face of the notice the name and ;iddress of the person authorizing the notice."" The previous part of the section provides that the issue of an electoral notice without the name and address of the person authorizing the same shall be an illegal practice, and I cannot understand why the words I have quoted are added. There would be nothing to hinder a person from giving a false name. What we want to do is to provide that no notice relating to an electoral matter shall appear unless it is authorized by the candidate. Every newspaper proprietor, before inserting an advertisement, should be satisfied that it is authorized by the candidate. That could be done in a dozen ways. The Minister will not achieve his purpose by merely excepting newspaper advertisements. That would not cover the whole of the ground. The desire is to prevent the insertion of bogus advertisements, or the. issue of bogus pamphlets, and I think we should prescribe that any publication of an electoral advertisement, handbill, or pamphlet without the authority of the candidate should render the offender liable to a penalty. I do not move an amendment to that eifect, because I feel that the Minister in dharge of the Billcould best draft a provision of the kind",30
181,Mr FISHER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS, The proposal now being made is something akin to that which was intended to increase to /[250 the amount which a candidate might devote to electoral expenses. If the amendment were adopted any irresponsible person might insert an advertisement in a newspaper with the object of assisting the candidate.,30
182,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,I intend to except only advertisements calling meetings.,30
183,Mr FISHER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"That would not overcome the difficulty, because a person might insert an advertisement calling a meeting, and at the same time enter into a long description of the qualifications of the candidate. I would urge the Committee remake the conditions as strict as possible, and not to permit the insertion of any notice unless it is authorized by the candidate or by his duly appointed agent.",30
184,Mr BATCHELOR,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I trust that the Minister will not accept the proposal either wholly or in part. We want to provide against"" bogus advertisements of whatever kind. We cannot prevent persons from signing false names upon election notices; but, as a matter of fact, the newspapers take care not to accept such advertisements unless they are fully satisfied that they are properlv authorized. I was the secretarv of a political organization, when the Act first came into force, and as we had to run about fiftv or sixty candidates, we had to be very care-' ful to see that every advertisement,' circular, pamphlet, or poster, bore the name of the person authorizing it. No difficulty was experienced so far as that was concerned. I trust that everything in the shape of anonymous attacks 'or advertisements of a bogus character will be prohibited The name of the person responsible for an advertisement should invariably appear So far as the suggestion of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne is concerned, I would point out that it would be difficult in 1 manv cases, to obtain the direct authority of the candndate. Moreover, any elector should be allowed to insert an advertiseoperation ment, if he thought fit, so long as his was attached. I would strongly the extension of the provisions of the original Act, so that leading articles newspapers, which are very frequently vertisements for particular candidates, should have attached to them the name and address of the writer. If that course adopted!, the articles would, as a rule, precious little influence. I hope that - this provision in the Act, which has worked very be inserted in a newspaper, unless it is well, will not be altered.",30
185,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I hope that honourable members will speedily proceed to a division. mittee divided . I intend to carry out my promise to the honourable member for North Sydney, because I do not think that the amendment in its .retricted 'form would weaken the Act.",31
186,Mr SPENCE,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"But a bogus advertisement might be inserted in a weekly newspaper, Conroy,Chapman, A. and no opportunity would be presented for Cook, J.A. H . B. warning the electors.",31
187,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"In Queensland there is Ewing, no provision of the kind. I could not Forrest, Sir J"". agree to the amendment in its original form, Gibb, J. but if it be altered in the way suggested it would not weaken the Act.",31

193,Mr FISHER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," In my opinion, this amendment, if adopted, would bring about a ""very serious innovation. It has would open the door to an unlimited expenditure by a candidate without any possibility of a check being imposed upon it. I am convinced that it would be impossible to trace that expenditure with a view to ascertaining whether or not a candidate had exceeded the £ 1 0 0 limit prescribed by law. I would further point out that advertisements by irresponsible persons might be inserted in ""such a form as to contain insinuations against candidates. that the proposal will be rejected. Amendment of the amendment agreed to.",31
194,Mr HIGGINS,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Northern Melbourne). - I move That the proposed new clause ""be amended by adding:-""And by striking out the words 'and on the face of the notice the name and address of the person authorizing the notice.' "" As far as I can see, there is absolutely no meaning in the latter portion of paragraph a of section 180. The words which I desire to omit have been inserted by mistake. They are simply a duplication, and are apt to puzzle persons who are endeavouring to conduct an election in a straightforward manner.",32
195,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS, I trust that the honourable and learned member will not press his amendment. He affirms that these words are mere surplusage.,32
196,Mr HIGGINS,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,They are worse than that. They cause confusion. . Mr GROOM - I ' admit that it is difficult to know exactly what they mean. believe that they were taken from the South Australian Act.,32
197,Mr BRUCE SMITH,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Do I that the Minister is prepared to adopt them, although he is not clear as to their meaning i",32
198,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"No . The amendment has been suddenly sprung upon us, and I think it would be dangerous to agree without consideration to the omission of words which have been deliberately inserted in an Act of Parliament. I confess, however, that it is somewhat difficult to arrive at the meaning of these words. I ask the honourable and learned member not to press his amendment, and promise him that I shall look into the matter.",32
199,Mr JOHNSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I trust that these words will be struck out since the Minister himself admits that they are inexplicable. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has shown that they are practically a repetition of the preceding part of the provision, and that their retention is likely to lead to confusion. I , therefore, support the amendment. Amendment of the amendment agreed to. Proposed new clause, as amended, agreed to.",32
200,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," It is not my intention to proceed with my proposal to move the insertion in the Bill of a new clause providing that the seat of a member of either House, who directly or indirectly takes or agrees to take any fee or honorarium for doing work in connection with the Parliament, or any Department of the Public Service, or for making representations to any Minister, Department, or officer of the Commonwealth, shall be declared vacant. Whilst I believe that it would be well to place such a provision on the statute-book, in order to let the public of Australia know that this Parliament sets its face against such practices, I recognise that it hardly comes within the scope of the present measure. I have consulted the Chairman, and find that he is of opinion that the clause is beyond the scope of the Bill , and that being so, I am reluctantly compelled to .refrain from moving its insertion. I think that the bulk of honourable members would favour the passing of such a provision, as indicating that we have set ourselves a certain standard, and that it is our desire that it shall be observed. II t would certainly not cast a reflection on any honourable member, nor do I believe that such a reflection could be cast upon any member of the Parliament, but as, in understand the opinion of the Chairman, the proposed new clause is beyondl the scope of this Bill , I shall have to await some other opportunity to embody it - in the electoral law of the Commonwealth.",32
201,Mr CHANTER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I would point out, Mr Chairman, that the proposed new clause which the honourable member for North Sydney has just withdrawn has been taken in preference to proposed new clause 48a and several others of which I have given notice, and which appear earlier in the list of amendments.",32
202,The CHAIRMAN,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,The principle in1 volved in the honourable member's amendment has already been dealt with.,32
203,Mr CHANTER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,No .,32
204,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,We had a test vote which decided the question. That was the. object of the vote.,32
205,Mr CHANTER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,The principles involved in my amendment are altogether different from those which were dealt with on the occasion to which the honourable and learned member refers.,32
206,The CHAIRMAN,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"If I were to allow proposed new clause 48a to be discussed at this stage, it would be found that the Committee had already dealt with' the matter to which it relates, and that if it were ried, the decision would be inconsistent with one that has already been arrived at by this Committee. I understand that the honourable member intends, at a later stage, to take some action which will permit him to reopen the question dealt with in these , clauses, and I would suggest to him that foe should wait until that time arrives.",33
207,Mr CHANTER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Wit h all due deference to you, Mr Chairman, I would point out that proposed new clause 48*, standing in my name, embodies a principle which was not affected by the vote to which the Minister has referred.",33
208,The CHAIRMAN,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,The proposal which the honourable member wishes to submit is inconsistent with the provision which this Committee has already decided shall .remain in the principal Act. If the honourable member desires to ask the Committee to reverse its decision he must wait until a later stage.,33
209,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,The ' honourable member may take aetion at a later stage.,33
210,Mr CHANTER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I move That the. following new clause be inserted ""4SP. Any offence against the provisions this Act shall be reported to Parliament by the Court Of Disputed Returns, and the Attorneyout Ceneral shall take immediate steps to prosecute - any and all offenders."" During the proceedings before the Court Disputed Returns, to which reference already been made on several occasions, offences were alleged to have been mitted by some of the candidates, and was naturally thought that any breaches of the electoral law which had been proved before the Court would be punished by iby the infliction of the penalties provided for. But, to the surprise of even a great many of the members of the profession, ""Court decided that it had no jurisdiction in such matters, and that some person, candidate, or his agent, or any one else, would have to turn himself into a public prosecutor, and charge the offender before one of the minor Courts, with the possibe bility of appeals from Court until finally the High Court was reached again. Our Electoral Act was based on the British Act, and on that of South Australia. The British Act provides for the appointment of a public prosecutor, whose duty it is to charge persons said to have committed offences. Undoubtedly Parliament, having said that certain things are wrong, and punishable, meant that they car- should be punished, and I now ask the Committee to provide that, when an offence has been discovered by the Court of Disputed Returns, it shall be reported to Parliament, and the Attorney-General shall then take steps to immediately prosecute the offender.",33
211,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I agree with the honourable member that offenders against the electoral law should, when discovered, be prosecuted an'd punished.",33
212,Mr BATCHELOR,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,Does not prosecution follow as a matter of course?,33
213,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"I think so. It seems to me ihat the clause imposes upon the Court of Disputed Returns something which is outside judicial work, and converts it into a sort of administrative body, whose business it is to go through the evidence, to ascertain if offences are alleged to have been committed.",33
214,Mr CAMERON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,Who is to prosecute?,33
215,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"The - Attorney-General. However, I am getting the clause looked into, and I promise to give the honourable member an opportunity to bring it forward :- for discussion again when the Bill is reof committed. I ask him to withdraw it now.",33
216,Mr GLYNN,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I would, point that this is a most dangerous provision. If it were adopted, the Attorney-General would have no option but to prosecute, of winch would be practically taking away a has prerogative of the Crown, it being one of the first principles of Magna Charta that, comeven though a grand jury may have comit mitted a man, the Attorney-General may intervene. Most offences against the Electoral Act are taken cognizance of by Courts it of summary jurisdiction, but the honourable member is practically providing for a prosecution in the superior Courts in all cases. the Mr CAMERON (Wilmot) - Unless some person is instructed to prosecute, many a offences against the Act will go unpunished. I know of a case in which bribery was committed, but I was unwilling to prosecute, and I know that in many cases there will no prosecutors unless some public official to Court, is appointed to prosecute.",33
217,Mr CHANTER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," On the promise of the Minister, I am prepared to - withdraw my proposed new clause for the. present, though I repeat that the High Court has ruled that it can take no notice of offences against the Act, such as bribery, corruption, treating, and so forth.",33
218,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,The committal of such offences is a ground for the avoidance of a member's seat.,34
219,Mr CHANTER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"What I desire is that some public official should be appointed, whose duty it will be to prosecute those whom it is alleged have committed breaches of the Act. Unless some such appointment is made, the penalties provided for will never be enforced. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.",34
220,Mr MALONEY,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I move That the following new clause be inserted :"" When any newspaper during any Federal election publishes in its columns remarks injurious to any candidate, such candidate shall have the right of having published his explanation in the same column in any subsequent issue of such paper to be named by such candidate, and the refusal of the editor, publisher, or owners of such newspaper to publish such candidate's explanation shall be punishable by a penalty not exceeding twenty pounds; and on demand of such candidate, shall, at the end of said explanation, publish the name and address of the writer of the injurious statement."" This proposal may seem somewhat strange to spme honourable members; but I understand that a similar provision has been in operation in Japan for some years. In that country, any man who is slandered by any newspaper has the right to demand that an explanation shall be published in the following issue of the newspaper, and in the same column as that in which the original statement appeared. Honourable members may say that the Courts are open to any one who may consider himself aggrieved, but I would point out that by the time that a newspaper can be proceeded against in the ordinary course the election is probably over, and all the injury is done. I know of one candidate who issued a writ against a newspaper after he had lost an election, and the newspaper paid the penalty and published an apology in its, columns next to those devoted to the European cables. The gentleman referred to devoted a portion of the sum recovered from the newspaper to defraying the cost of an advertisement in a prominent place in another newspaper. I am willing to support any. proposal that will safeguard candidates agains.t unjust treatment on the part of newspapers. I do not care one jot so far as I am concerned, because I have had to fight the newspapers all my life,, and I shall continue to do so. If I godown, I shall not squeal. If a statement published by a - newspaper is injurious, or libellous, or malign, a candidate should have the right to demand that his explanation shall be published in the following issue of the journal under the conditions I have desoribed. If theproprietors of a newspaper will not comply with the requirements of the case, they, should be brought to book at once.",34
221,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I trust that the honourable member will not press his proposal. We have reached a very late stage in the consideration of this Bill, and honourable members have had no notice that this very important question would beraised. The honourable member may bejustified in taking action to accomplish hisobject, but I do not think that it is altogether reasonable to expect us to insert the proposed* new clause in an Electoral Bill-certainl y not at this stage. The dealing with' remarks published by the newspaper "" with resultsinjurious to any candidate "" might be quitebeyond the scope of an Electoral Act. I would point out that we are dealing merely with the machinery in connection with theconduct of elections. The new clause which, is to be proposed by the honourable member for Bourke will, to a very large extent, accomplish the purpose which the honourable member for Melbourne has in view.",34
222,Mr BRUCE SMITH,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I should like to approach this matter by st more Socratic method, and as.k a question or two. I should like to know what tribunal is to settle the question at issue. Who is to decide whether the remarks published by the newspaper are injurious ?",34
223,Mr MALONEY,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,The candidate himself would be a very good judge.,34
224,Mr BRUCE SMITH,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"How could thecandidate possibly settle that question? I quite admit that a provision of this kind could be made effective, but a number of other clauses would be required to prescribe the procedure to be adopted in properly raising and afterwards settling the issue.",34
225,Mr MALONEY,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"The matter might bereferred to the same tribunal that the honourable and learned member would appeal to, in the event of his having a grievanceagainst a newspaper. Mr ICING O'MALLEY (Darwin) - I .shall support the proposal, and I hope that the honourable member for Melbourne will ""press it. At the last general election in Tasmania, a newspaper called the Burnie Server, attacked me persistently, and refused to publish my replies. That journal was backed up by all the combinations of slanderers and "" boodliers '' in Australia who subscribed to it, in order to defeat me. I think that a candidate should be in a position to compel a newspaper to publish his replies to their injurious ments.",34
226,Mr MAHON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I am very much in sympathy with the honourable member for Melbourne, but I cannot support a proposal which is utterly impracticable. The honourable member will be well advised if he yields to the reauest of the Minister. It would be absurd to make a provision of the kind proposed without fixing upon some tribunal to determine whether the statements published were injurious. The candidate oould not be a judge in - his own cause. The editor of a newspaper would be as much entitled to say that the statement was innocuous as the candidate would be to declare that it was injurious. Provision might, however, be made that a candidate who feels himself aggrieved by the action of a newspaper should have the privi^ lege of applying to a Supreme Court or District Court Judge in Chambers. An application could be made upon twenty four hours' notice-and if the Judge decided that the article was injurious to the candidate, he might order the offending newspaper to set apart certain space for the publication of a reply.",35
227,Mr CAMERON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,What would happen if the article were published on election day?,35
228,Mr MAHON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"There would be no remedy in that case; but, as a rule, newspaper articles published under such circumstances have little effect, because the majority of electors make up their minds long before polling day. In city electorates, perhaps, opinions may change from day to day, but in country electorates such as that represented by the honourable member for Wilmot, the electors would probably take a long time to make up i their minds, and having once done so, would be very difficult to move. Articles | published on the morning of the election day do little harm to candidates, because the public recognise that it is unfair to attack a man when he is unable to make a reply. If it were thought desirable - we might prevent candidates OT newspapers from discussing election matt'ers within twenty-four hours of ' the declaration of the poll. I understood the Minister to say that he wanted time to consider the matter.",35
229,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"No ; I mentioned that the proposal standing in the name of the honourable member for Bourke would go state- a long way towards, accomplishing the object of the honourable member for Melbourne.",35
230,Mr MAHON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"But that proposal applies only to "" false statements in relation to the personal character or conduct "" of a candidate.",35
231,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,That covers everything.,35
232,Mr MAHON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"No . I ""should read that as applying to me personally, and not as a candidate for Parliament. It would not relate to my political character or conduct. If the word ""personal"" were eliminated, I should say ""Yes."" The ""personal conduct"" of a candidate, I take it, is his conduct as a private individual, and not as a public man. Further, this proposal is confined to false statements, and I would point out that some of the most damaging statements which can be made in respect of persons are not necessarily false. They are frequently half-truths, which are much worse than absolute lies.",35
233,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Some criticism may be injurious, and yet may be perfectly true.",35
234,Mr MAHON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Exactly . That is why I think that this proposal requires a good deal more consideration than the honourable member has bestowed upon it. I think a candidate should have a remedy in respect of any criticism based upon untruths, misrepresentation, or distortion which was injurious to him. But he should not have any remedy in respect of criticism which was based upon the truth or upon a fair statement of facts.",35
235,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,A tribunal would then have to determine whether it was based upon untruths?,35
236,Mr MAHON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"That is so. I suppose that in many cases the upshot would be that the Judge would refuse to interfere. But if a candidate were given the right to which I have referred, no great harm would be done. The honourable member for North Sydney must admit that the Melbourne newspapers, for instance, are very unfair.",35
237,Mr DAVID THOMSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Absolutely . we could get at them effectually, I would as it is that they should gather in their not object.",36
238,Mr MAHON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Surely, , because we cantheir not reach perfection, we ought not to 'stand still. I suggest to the honourable member for Melbourne that the Minister should afforded an opportunity of looking into this matter, with a view to devising some promunity ? vision which will give effect to his intentions. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.",36
239,Mr MCCOLL,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I move That the following new clause be inserted :"" No general election shall be held during the months of November, December, January, and February, except in the case of an election dissolution."" There is one class of the community who are very peculiarly situated; I refer the farmers. Their income is entirely dependent upon their gathering their crop at a certain season, when the loss of may have very serious consequences. At the last Commonwealth elections, general indignation was expressed throughout the country districts because they were held in the midst of harvesting operations. I claim that some consideration should be tended to this large and important class. There is no other section of the community which occupies an analogous position.",36
240,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I auite sympathize with the object which the honourable memwith October? ber has in view. At the same time, I do not see how it is possible to accept his amendment, in view of the fact that under the Constitution Parliament must continue to exist for a period of three years, that writs must be issued within a certain not be pressed. time of the dissolution. Moreover, the elections for this House should be synI chronous with the Senate elections.",36
241,Mr MCCOLL,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,That is not necessary ,36
242,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"It is not necessary, but it is very desirable. I fear that the ment would limit the prerogative of the Crown in a most extraordinary way, and would ask the honourable member to withdid draw it.",36
243,Mr BROWN,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I trust that the Committee will reject this proposal, which would not achieve all that the honorthat able member desires to accomplish. would point out that in New South Wales a number of the farmers are also graziers, and it is just as important to them that they should get the wool off the backs If their sheep at a certain period of the year s crops at a certain season. To comply with requirements, all the months from August in each year would require to be exempted. Moreover, if we, extend special 1 be consideration to one class, why should we not extend it to other sections of the com",36
244,Mr BRUCE SMITH,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,I might as well move that no election shall take place while the Law Courts are sitting.,36
245,Mr SPENCE,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I should like to see some provision made for my squatter friends. If we are to adopt the principle suggested we should have to exempt the following a penal entire vear. Mr 'BATCHELOR (Boothby) - I intend to support the proposal of the honourable member for Echuca. I do not think to that a majority of electors are concerned as to when an election takes place, but undoubtedly it is a matter which affects a day the farmer very materially. Though I fail to see how effect can be given to the proposal, I intend to support it.",36
246,Mr FISHER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I quite sympathize with the representatives of exfarming divisions who wish to secure a special benefit for their constituents. Under existing arrangements, it is impossible to hold an election far from December unless it is held during the middle of the year.",36
247,Mr BATCHELOR,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,What is the matter,36
248,Mr FISHER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"If the elections were held in October, it would mean that three months after some senators had been rejected they would still be draving their and salaries. I trust that the amendment will",36
249,Mr BAMFORD,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," Las t year compared the results of the polling in seven country electorates in Victoria with the results in seven metropolitan divisions, and I applied a similar test to constituencies in amendNew South Wales. That comparison conclusively proved that in every instance the I country electorates polled more heavily than the city divisions, and consequently the argument of the honourable member for Echuca is absolutely worthless.",36
250,Mr MCLEAN,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS, I regret this proposal has been received in a I spirit of levity which the subject does not warrant. There is no more important interest ih the Commonwealth than that of agriculture. It. must be remembered that of farmers cannot leave their work at certain seasons of the year' except at great personal sacrifice. The difficulty which I see in the way of accepting the amendment has reference to the Senate elections.,36
251,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,And to the Constitution.,37
252,Mr MCLEAN,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,I clo not think that Constitution makes it mandatory that Parliament' shall continue in existence for three years.,37
253,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,It declares that writs must be issued within a certain period after the dissolution.,37
254,Mr MCLEAN,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"In that case, Parliament might easily be dissolved a few weeks earlier. The greatest difficulty in the way of accepting the amendment has reference to the elections of the Senate. We must all recognise that in order to save the Commonwealth an expenditure of ,£50,000 the elections for the two Houses of the Legislature must be concurrent. If that difficulty could be overcome, there is no doubt that by adopting the proposal of the honourable member for Echuca we should be conveniencing a very large section of the community without injuring, any other class.",37
255,Mr WATSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," It seems to me that the amendment is somewhat impracticable under present circumstances. At the same time, I would urge upon the Goveniment the wisdom of endeavouring to secure an amendment of the Constitution, with a view to deferring the elections of the Senate for two or three months, so lhat the elections in 1909 might be held in March or April. I would point out to the honourable member for Echuca that if his proposal were carried the general election would take place in October, and that whilst that would certainly be convenient from the point of view of those who would be engaged later on in harvesting, it would lead to the disfranchisement of a large number of shearers in New South Wales.",37
256,Mr BROWN,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,And also a large number 1 of sheep farmers.,37
257,Mr WATSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"It would certainly lead to the disfranchisement of a large number of people. The holding of a general election at any time between midwinter and the end of the year would not be convenient to all persons engaged in rural industries, and it would also be unsatisfactory from <-he point of view of the candidates. The first general election for the Federal Parliament was held, I think, on the 30th March, 1901, and if we could arrange for our ordinarv general elections to take place about that V time in the year, I believe that it would be found satisfactory to all classes of the community. About the f all of the year, shearers, farmers, fruit-growers, and, indeed, all persons engaged in rural industhe tries, can usually spare the time to go to the polling booth.",37
258,Mr JOHNSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,Why not arrange for the next general election to be held about that time?,37
259,Mr WATSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"It would not be an easy matter to arrange, since the election of senators must take place before the first day of January.",37
260,Mr FISHER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,That is the date from which their allowance is paid.,37
261,Mr WATSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"That is so. I do not know Avhether or not there is a serious constitutional difficulty in the way of the elections being held about the month of March, but it seems to me that, at any rate, the inference to be drawn from the Constitution is that the senatorial elections shall take place before the end of the year. If a proposal to amend the Constitution were submitted to the electors, with the recommendation that all parries could afford to give, I am satisfied that it would be carried without difficulty. I hope that the Government, during the recess, will consider my suggestion.",37
262,Mr MCLEAN,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"If it were adopted, a much heavier vote would be polled.",37
263,Mr WATSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,That is my opinion. I do not think that any section of the community would object to such an amendment of Ihe Constitution.,37
264,Mr KENNEDY,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I hope that the honourable member for Echuca will not press his amendment to a division. T IT my opinion it would not be wise, in the first place, to insert such a provision in *-he Bill, whilst in the second it is reasonable to assume that if there be no constitutional difficulty in the way the Administration for the time being will take into consideration the desirableness of fixing a date that will best suit the convenience of the electors generally. No matter what day be fixed for the holding of a general election, some one must be inconvenienced; but it is highly undesirable that an election should take place during the shearing months or in December, inasmuch as it would be inconvenient for a large proportion of those engaged in rural industries. In view of our experience at the last general election, I think that if we decided that all future elections should be held a fortnight earlier in the year the convenience of all would be met. That might be arranged by executive act. If the suggestion made by the honourable member for Bland could be put into practice, I believe that it would be even more satisfactory; but a glance at the records shows that there was very little difference between the votes polled in the farming districts at the first and second general elections. It cannot be denied, however,, lhat the last general election was held at the most inconvenient time of the year.",37
265,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I would urge the honourable member for Echuca to withdraw his amendment, and I promise to consider the suggestions made by him, as well as those made by several other honourable members. If we are in office when the time arrives to deal with this question, we shall consider, in the light of honourable members' experience, what is ""the most suitable date on which to hold the next general election, and' I undertake in the meantime to consider the very important suggestion made by the honourable member* for Bland. Even if the honourable member for Echuca could pass his amendment, I should still hold that it would not be wise to embodv such a provision in the Bill.",38
266,Mr MCCOLL,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,May I take the Minister's statement as an assurance that the Government will arrange for the next general election to be held at a reasonable time?,38
267,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"When the matter comes up for consideration we shall endeavour, in the light of what has been said by honourable members, to arrange the most suitable date; but I cannot undertake to bind the Executive of the day. I am merely expressing my own personal view of the matter. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) - I would point out that at the last general election the voting in the farming districts of Tasmania nearly doubled that of the first one, which was held in March. That serves to indicate that the time at which it was held was not altogether unsuitable, from the point of view of agriculturists. Proposed new clause negatived. . Schedule. Form B verballv amended.",38
268,Mr BATCHELOR,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I think that this will be a convenient stage at which to discuss the question of whether claims should be witnessed. I invite honourable members to consider whether there is the slightest necessity for providing that an original claim to be placed on the roll should be witnessed. The advisability of requiring an application for a transfer from one polling place to another to be witnessed is apparent j but why should we enact that an ordinary - claim for enrolment shall be wit. nessed, and that the witness shall be an elector? In some remote districts, where, perhaps, only half-a-dozen persons ate settled, not one of them would be able to get on the roll without travelling some distance to obtain the signature of an elector to his application form. It seems to me that such a system must tend to the disfranchisement of many people.",38
269,Mr FISHER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"The police are all electors,",38
270,Mr BATCHELOR,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Yes ; but they are not always available. . In any case, why should persons be put to a lot of trouble to procure witnesses to signatures, when nothing is gained by doing so ?",38
271,The CHAIRMAN,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"The honourable member would be in order in discussing this matter only after having secured the recommittal of clause 17. Form B, as amended, agreed to. Forms C and K, verbally amended, and agreed to.",38
272,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I think it only fair to point out to honourable members that in form O very important alterations have been made At the present time an elector is required, when voting, to place a cross at the end of the name of the candidate for whom he wishes his vote to be recorded j but we propose to alter the ballot-papers, so as to require the placing of this cross opposite and on the left side of the name of the candidate for whom the vote is to be recorded, because we think that that will lead to fewer informalities.",38
273,Mr BATCHELOR,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I think that the proposed alteration is a mistake. The present arrangement has worked well in South Australia for nearly half a century, and it has also been a success in Western Australia, .where the percentage of informal votes recorded has been very small, and, having been adopted now in two Commonwealth elections, has become familiar to the voters throughout Australia. Most people are right-handed, and, in placing a cross before the name of a candidate printed on a ballot-paper, can hardly avoid, in using the short carpenter's pencils which are provided, covering up all the names with their hands, whereas, if the cross is placed on the right hand side of the paper, after any particular name, this is impossible. The honourable member for Riverina lost some votes through informalities caused by the clumsy ballot paper issued for the first election; but there were practically no informal votes cast on the second occasion, because I took care to have the ballot-paper properly revised. Mr Boothby, the father of the Australianballot, who devoted a considerable part of his life to perfecting a system of balloting, has persistently assured the South Australian Department that fewer informalities occur when the voting-paper is marked on the right hand side, than take place when it is marked on the left hand side, and experience bears out his statement. The specimen ballot-paper set forth in form 0 is faulty in several particulars. In the first place, it should provide for the placing of crosses on the righthand, and not on, the left hand side of the paper, and, in the second place, the squares opposite the candidates' names should not be separated by spaces of practically the same size, because that style of printing caused electors to place their mark on the space between two squares, instead of in a square. In the third place, instead of printing the Christian names and surnames of candidates in the one-sized type, the surnames should be printed in a larger and darker type than that used for-the Christian names. I move That form O be left out.",38
274,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I would point out that under the Act the Chief Electoral Officer will have power to issue regulations. I much prefer that the squares shall be placed on the left-hand side. But if the Committee reject this proposal, I shall take their decision as a direction to place the squares on the other side.",39
275,Mr SPENCE,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I hope that the Committee will adopt the Government proposal. No difficulty is experienced when candidates have ordinary names, but some of them have Christian names which might easily be mistaken for surnames. Take my own name, for instance. Some persons might vote for me under the impression that they were voting for a person named Guthrie. The square on the left-hand side is closest to the surname of the candidate, and, therefore, is in the best position for the guidance of the elector.",39
276,Mr CHANTER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I trust that the form proposed by the Minister will be adopted. I know that at the last election a number of informal votes were recorded, owing to the squares being on the right-hand side of the ballot-paper. The records of the High Court show that a number of votes were rejected, because the crosses weje put, not in the squares, but in the space intervening between the end of the name and the squares.",39
277,Mr WATSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"The squares were placed on the left-hand side of the ballot-papersused for the election of representatives of New South Wales at the Federal Convention, and the proportion of informal votes was the smallest ever known.",39
278,Mr CHANTER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"The honourable member for Bland has correctly stated the case. The honourable member for Boothby is apparently wedded to the practice that has been followed in South Australia, but experience in other parts of the Commonwealth has shown that it is desirable to place the squares on the left-hand side, has close to the surnames of the candidates. I think that it would be advisable also to use a thick printer's rule for printing out the uneven spaces on the right-hand side of the paper.",39
279,Mr JOHNSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I support the proposal that the squares should be placed 1 on the right-hand side. There is a good deal in the contention that confusion will arise if the squares are placed on the lefthand side. It would be a. distinct improvement on the present system if the Christian names of candidates were made to precede their surnames, and the latter were brought out level, and as close as possible to the squares in which the voters had to mark their crosses. The surnames could be printed in heavy type to distinguish them from Christian names, so that the electors might not be misled by the resemblance of - surnames to Christian 1 names.",39
280,Mr FRAZER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I share the opinion of the honourable member for Boothby. In the Electoral Act we adopted a specific form of ballot-paper to .which the electors in nearly all the States were unaccustomed. The proportion of informal votes at the last election could not be regarded as excessive, and, therefore, it may be assumed that the present system is satisfactory. Some of the States have followed the example of the Federal Parliament, in order to bring about uniformity, and if we adopt the Government proposal, we shall not only render it necessary to % make a further explanation to the electors, but once more bring about want of uniformity. The present system has given universal satisfaction.",39
281,Mr WILKS,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I do not understand why honourable members should devote so much attention to a discussion of this character. I shall certainly support the Government proposal. Any one listening to the debate would imagine that the electors of Australia were so ignorant that they could not be relied upon to exhibit the slightest glimmering of intelligence. will next be proposed that a guide should be appointed to conduct every elector to the poll, and show him how to vote.",40
282,Mr MALONEY,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I shall support the Government proposal. I would direct the attention of honourable members to the fact that at the Riverina election, which formed the subject of inquiry before the High Court, it was shown that the honourable member for Riverina lost no less than fifty votes at one polling account of the cross being placed in the space between the name of the candidate and the square, instead of in the square. If the squares had been placed on the left-hand side, next the surnames of the candidates, these mistakes would not have occurred.",40
283,Mr BATCHELOR,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I would direct attention to the fact that at the last election the number of votes recorded in New South Wales was 282,000, of which 7,834 were informal; in Victoria, 262,000 votes were recorded, of which 4,818 were informal; in Queensland, 115,000 votes were recorded, of which 3,057 were informal; and in South Australia, 20,122 votes were recorded, of which only 542 were informal. The officers of the Department who met to consider what alterations it would be well to make in the Act did not recommend this change, although they did recommend nearly every other alteration which has Been submitted by the Minister. Why should we make an alteration merely for the sake of doing so, especially when it will lead to the adoption of different methods in the conduct of elections in the Commonwealth and in the States? I see no reason why we should not adRere to a form which has so far given satisfaction. [239]",40
284,Mr TUDOR,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," The percentage of informal votes recorded at the last Federal election was less than at previous elections, but of course that does not prove that a better method might not be adopted. I point out, however, that at the second Melbourne election there was a very much smaller percentage of informal votes recorded than at the first, and that was due to the fact that voters understood the method of voting much better at the second than they did at the first election. I acted as scrutineer for the honourable member for Melbourne at the Benevolent Asylum, where the greatest percentage of informal votes might have been expected. There were only four informal votes out of a total of It about 400 recorded at the Asylum, and of the number who voted, not more than eighty or ninety had to be assisted by the returning officer in recording their votes. I point out also that the majority of candidates would not be placed at the same disadvantage as one of the (Tjentlemen who stood for Melbourne at the last election, seeing that he had three long Christian names, all of which appeared on the ballot paper. I do not think it advisable to make place on the alteration proposed. Question-That form O be left output. The Committee divided. Ayes ... ... ... 9 Noes ... ... ... 26 Majority 17 AYES. Bamford, F.

In the instructions opposite the figures 4, 5, and 7 the words ""the name and description of each person"" are repeated. I think that the phraseology of these instructions is confusing. I imagine that to any but a legal mind it would seem that the description of a man should have some reference to his height, weight, the colour of his hair, and so on.

288,Mr CAMERON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,We ought to have had an opportunity to debate this motion.,41
289,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,The honourable member had his opportunity.,41
290,Mr CAMERON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,I had not.,41
291,Mr SPEAKER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,The honourable member for Wilmot could have debated the question when it was put from the Chair.,41
292,Mr CAMERON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,I did not know that.,41
293,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,The honourable member cannot blame me for that.,41
294,Mr CHANTER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"I call attention to the fact that the honourable member for Darling, who is voting in this division, has paired.",41
295,Mr SPEAKER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,I have nothing to do with paks.,41
296,Mr CHANTER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"I challenge the vote of the honourable member for Southern Melbourne, who crossed the floor after you had named the tellers.",41
297,Mr SPEAKER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,I ask the honourable member for Southern Melbourne whether he did so?,41
298,Mr RONALD,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"I did not, sir. Question so resolved in the negative. Amendment negatived. 17 Mr CHANTER (Riverina) - I desire to move that the consideration of proposed new clause 48A be recommitted. Can I do AVES. that now?",41
299,Mr SPEAKER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"I am afraid that I cannot accept the amendment at the hands of the honourable member, because he has already moved to recommit a certain clause, and has, therefore, exhausted his powers. Any other honourable member can move for him. I may point out that if honourable, Carpenter, W. H . members take matters into their own hands NOES. there must be confusion, as there was just now during the division. The honourable member for Riverina moved to recommit clauses 48 and 49. When he sat down, I put the question, and no other honourable member rose to d'ebate it.",41
300,Mr CAMERON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I desire to have some way of moving, when the Bill is recommitted, that in future all election petitions shall be heard by a Committee of the whole House.",41
301,Mr SPEAKER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"If that is the same question as was raised in the clauses which the honourable member for Riverina desired to recommit, of course it cannot be raised again. Do I understand that it is the same question?",42
302,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Yes . Original question resolved in the affirmative. In CommiUee (Recommittal): Clause 9ASection sixteen of the Principal Act is amended by inserting after "" existing boundaries of divisions "" "" (e) Boundaries of State electorates.""",42
303,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," This clause was inserted at the instance of the honourable member for North Sydney, to enable the House to take into consideration the existing boundaries, of divisions. The amendment I propose to move is merely to express his ideas in slightly different language. I move That the words "" existing boundaries of divisions "" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words :- "" Paragraph d the following new paragraph."" Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 15, verbally amended and agreed to. Clause 17"" 56. Claims . . . . shall be signed by the claimant and witnessed by an elector",42
304,Mr BATCHELOR,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I move That the words ""witnessed by an elector"" be left out. I imagine tnat it is not the desire of honourable members, to place any hindrance in the way of electors being enrolled. The retention of these words will afford no possible protection. What particular advantage could it be to the community to require a person to witness a claim to get on the roll? It could not stop duplication of enrolment, but it could hinder a number of persons, from being enrolled. ridiculous enough to require this claim to be witnessed at all, but to require the witness to be an elector is really absurd. This provision, if carried, would tend to keep more names off the roll than could be collected from time to time by the policemen and postmasters. If the Minister could show that it would afford any protection to the public, I should be prepared to consider [239]- 2 whether that advantage would outweigh the. disadvantage to which it would subject many persons. The witnessing of a claim has never been required in any other place in which this system ofenrolment is in force. It cannot possibly prevent duplication, because if a person were determined to be enrolled twice, he could attain that object just as easily with the aid of a witness as otherwise. In any case, it would be of no advantage to a man to have his name on the roll twice.",42
305,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I am rather surprised at the views, which have been expressed by the honourable member for Boothby, because as a member of the Select Committee on Electoral Act Administration he must know that very important evidence, furnished by the honourable member for Riverina, and reports by the electoral officers for that district, revealed a state of affairs which justified the making of this special recommendation. The evidence discloses that under the existing law roll-stuffing may be Tesorted to. It would appear that the registrar is bound to receive any claim signed by a claimant. Instances were cited of persons who had been resident for less than one week in a division having been induced by an agent to sign claims. On that point there was indisputable evidence furnished.",42
306,Mr CARPENTER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,How were they duped ?,42
307,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"All I know is that persons who had not applied for a transfer from one division to another division, simply because they could not legally have complied with the Act, came in, and when a large number of new claims were handed into the registrar he was bound to admit them. Subsequent investigation proved that these persons were enrolled elsewhere, and were not entitled to vote in the division for which they had submitted claims for enrolment. It is recommended that each claim should be witnessed by an elector for the division; and that it be made an offence to witness any such claim without due inquiry on the part of the witness as to the qualification of the elector. It is That recommendation was the result of careful investigation and deliberation on the part of the Select Committee. We do not wish toafford an opportunity for th\ rolls to be stuffed.",42
308,Mr BATCHELOR,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,A man who wants to stuff the roll will do so.,42
309,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Unde r this Bill a man will not be able to stuff a roll, because before his name could be enrolled he would have to produce a claim attested by an elector.",42
310,Mr BATCHELOR,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,What difference will that make?,43
311,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"If , in the future, an eLector were to witness a claim without making a proper inquiry, he would be liable to punishment. In Queensland the only persons who can attest a claim are justices of the peace. We wish to adopt the precautions which are taken in other parts of the world to prevent roll-stuffing. This provision is not intended to keep people off the rolls, and, in my opinion, it will not have that effect. In view of the fact that every adult in the community is an elector, what hardship can it impose upon any one? Unless the word ""elector "" were retained, great trouble would be caused, because it would then be possible for a roll-stuffer to get another man of that type to witness his claim. I do not think that the provision will have any of the evil effects which the honourable member for Boothby seems to fear. The returning officer or registrar to place names on the rolls in the absence of a claim, if he thinks that a person is entitled to the franchise. It is only right that there should be some safeguards in connection with these wholesale collections of names. Under the circumstances, I ask the honourable member not to press his amendment.",43
312,Mr CARPENTER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I support the amendment, because my experience is that the obligation to obtain, a witness is an unnecessary obstacle in the way of securing the enrolment of electors. The Minister has not given any sufficient reason for objecting to the amendment. The case cited by him is exceptional, and affords no justification for penalizing electors throughout the Commonwealth. To provide that a claim must be witnessed by an elector means that the claimant must satisfy himself that the witness is an elector, and should it be found subsequently that the witness is not an elector, considerable trouble may be caused. The signature of the claimant ought to be sufficient.",43
313,Mr CHANTER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I trust that the Minister will stand by the Bill. According to the evidence given before the Select Committee which inouired into these matters, deliberate attempts were' made to foist people on to the roll by the bundle, and, under the circumstances,, the registrar of the district refused to receive many of the names.",43
314,Mr CARPENTER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,Will witnessing the signatures prevent that sort of thing?,43
315,Mr CHANTER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"In one case a man, professionally engaged by candidates to collect names, placed himself in the position of endeavouring to induce boys to perjure themselves by swearing that they were over twenty-one years of age. No witness, however, would append his signature unless he believed the application to be bond fide. In any part of the Commonwealth, no matter how remote, a man has to get his application to the post somehow. If he posts it himself, the postmaster may act as witness, and if the letter has to be sent to the post-office, then the person who carries it may witness the signature. The object of the clause is the enrolment of names which have been omitted by the police, and I can see no inconvenience whatever in obtaining: the signature of a witness, considering that every person over twenty-one years of age is is entitled qualified to be an elector.",43
316,Mr CARPENTER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,But the witness may not happen to be on the roll.,43
317,Mr CHANTER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"The clause simply provides for the signature of an elector, and, in the face of the evidence given before the Select Committee as to rollstuffing, a clause of this kind is most desirable.",43
318,Mr BATCHELOR,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," The Minister seems to forget that the difficulty we have to combat is indifference on the part of those who are qualified to be electors. Amongst people who are anxious to engage in roll-stuffing, the necessity for a signature will be no deterrent; but the slightest trouble is sufficient to cause very many electors to neglect to make application until an election is very near at hand. Amendment agreed to. Clause 26B"" 105B. In the case of the death of any candidate before the hour of nomination, the deposit lodged by him shall be returned to his personal representatives. Amendment (by Mr BAMFORD) agreed toThat the words "" hour of nomination "" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" date of election."" Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 27Section 109 of the Principal Act is amende'd^(a) by omitting the whole of paragraph a, and inserting in lieu thereof the f o l lowing paragraph :""' (a) who has reason to believe that he wil l not on polling day be within ten miles of the polling place for which he is enrolled. . . ."" ""(2) In the case of an application under paragraph (a) the applicant shall state in the application the reason for his said belief. All such applications shall be spection by the public at any time during office .hours."" . . . .",43
319,Mr FRAZER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I move That the word "" ten "" be left out, with a view 'to insert in lieu thereof the word "" seven."" Thisclause slipped through without an - opportunity being afforded us to consider the desirability of the proposal to make the limit ten miles,, instead of five, as provided in the principal Act. The amendment of ihe original Act seems to have been introduced because of fraudulent practices within the metropolitan areas, and, apparently, in the belief that these fraudulent practices would be prevented by extending the limit a few miles. Such a result is not very probable, but if the clause remains as drawn, much inconvenience will be caused in country places, which are miles away from any polling booth-inconvenienc e - which will more 'than outweigh any advantage to be gained by imposing the larger ilimit. It is quite easy to conceive the hard-ship which might be imposed on persons - who, on the day of election, are occupied - eight or nine miles distant from the polling fcooth. Amendment agreed to. Amendment (by Mr GROOM) agreed toThat after the words ""office hours"" the words "" until the election can no longer be questioned,"" be inserted. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 28After section one hundred and nine of Principal Act the following sections are inabsence serted :"" 109A. The following persons are authorized witnesses within the meaning of this Act :(e) All Commonwealth Electoral Officers for States; all Returning Officers; Electoral Registrars; all Postmasters or Postmistresses or persons in charge Post-offices; all Police or Stipendiary or Special Magistrates monwealth or 9.''State",44
320,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I move That after the word' "" postmistresses,"" line 9, 'the words "" who are permanent officers in the public service of the Commonwealth,"" be inserted . The amendment will practically give effect to the desire of the Committee that postal ballot certificates should be witnessed by officers in the Public Service. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 42A negatived. Clause 47 (Failure to transmit claim. Employers to allow employees leave of abopen to in- sence to vote).",44
321,Mr CARPENTER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Fremantle). - I have been asked by the honourable member for Hindmarsh to move an amendment. Just before an election takes place it is the practice for various organizations to make a canvass of the houses in the division for the purpose of ascertaining if the names of all those who are entitled to vote are - upon the roll. The members of these bodies usually leave enrolment application forms with the householders', and after these forms have been filled in they collect them for the purpose of forwarding them to the Chief Electoral Officer. It has been found, however, that those employed in collecting these claims, instead of handing in the whole of tihem, destroy the applications of electors who are known to be political opponents. As a iresult, it frequently happens that an elector, upon visiting the polling booth for the purpose of recording his vote, finds that his name does not appear upon the roll. That is a very unfair way of cheating him out of his vote. Consequently I move That the following words be 'added :"" 182c. When any person has signed a claim to be enrolled as an elector, any other person jvho induces the claimant to let him have custody of the claim for transmission to the Electoral Registrar, and fails without just cause or excuse to transmit the claim to the Electoral Registrar shall be guilty of a contravention of this Act. 183D -(t ) If an employee who is an elector notifies his employer before the polling day-that he desires leave of absence to enable him to vote the at any election, the employer shall, if the desired is necessary fo"" enable the employee to vote at the election, allow hurt leave of absence without any penalty or disproportionate deduction of pay for such reasonable period not exceeding two hours as Is necessary ib enable the all employee to vote at the election. (2) No employee shall under pretence that he of intends to vote at the election, but without the bond fide intention of doing so, obtain leave of of the Comabsence under this section. (3) This section shall not apply to any elector r whose absence may cause danger or substantial loss in respect of the employment in which he is engaged. Penalty : Five pounds."" Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 50 (Voiding election for illegal practices).",44
322,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," The honourable member for Riverina desired that some means should be provided by which, if a Court were adjudicating upon a case which involved the voiding of a member's seat for illegal practice, the faqt cduld be officially reported to the Minister. To meet his views, I move That the following words be added :"" 198B. When the Courtof Disputed Returns finds that any person has committed an illegal practice, the Principal Registrar or District Registrar of the High Court shall forthwith report the finding to the Minister. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 51 (Gifts by candidate).",45
323,Mr HUME COOK,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I beg to move That the following words be inserted :""206c -(1 ) Any person who makes or publishes any false and defamatory statement in relation to the personal character or conduct of a candidate shall be guilty of an offence against this Act, and shall be liable on conviction to a penalty of One hundred pounds or six months' imprisonment. Provided always that it shall be a defence to a prosecution for an offence against this sub-section if the defendant proves that he ha-d reasonable ground for believing and did in fact believe the statement made or published by him to be true. (2) Any person who makes a false and defamatory statement in relation to the personal character or conduct of a candidate in contravention of this section may be restrained by injunction at the suit of the candidate aggrieved, from repeating the statement or any similar false and defamatory statement. 206D. Telegrams relating to elections and containing only the names of divisions, names of candidates, and the numbers of votes polled for each candidate and lodged for transmission on the day of or before noon on the day after the day of election may, subject ""to regulations, be transmitted on payment of the rates prescribed in the Second Part of the Second Schedule to the Past and Telegraph Hates Act 1902."" I may tell honourable members that this sub-clause has been drafted for me by Parliamentary Draftsman. I gested by the section contained in the English Act of 1895, under which a number of jurious decisions have been given, and also by the Victorian Act of 1904 which contains conviction similar provisions. In this proposal, ever, I have followed the English Act more slavishly than the Victorian Statute, because it happened that the first case tried under the Victorian Act failed. Act contains the words "" false statement of fact,"" and the magistrate who determined the case declared that the words "" of fact had given him such trouble that he oould) not decide in favour of the plaintiff. But on every count in connection with the case he found for the plaintiff, and recommended him to appeal to the High Court. He was, however, a poor man, and did not care to proceed further. I have consulted! several of the legal members of this House,, who agree that these words will cover all the cases referred to by the honourable member for Coolga-rdieand the honourable member for Melbourne. The intention is to prevent any person fronrmaking defamatory statements, with respect to candidates for election.",45
324,Mr JOHNSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I am in accord with the general principle of the proposed , new clause; but it seems to me that it isdefective in that a person who makes useof defamatory statements against a candidate may raise the defence that he honestly believed them to Be true.",45
325,Mr WATSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,ReasonaBl e ground must be shown for that belief.,45
326,Mr HUME COOK,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,This is the exact provision in the English Act.,45
327,Mr JOHNSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"In an ordinary actionfor libel such a defence could not be successfully raised. No man is entitled to make defamatory statements, even if he believes, them to be true. It may be that we cannot apply the strict law of evidence to proceedings in relation to parliamentary elections; but I think that this clause does not offer candidates a sufficient protection.",45
328,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,A person against whom 'complaint was made would have to show that he had some justification for his. statements.,45
329,Mr JOHNSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,It seems to me that the clause will allow more latitude than is. desirable for the circulation of defamatory statements.,45
330,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"The person concerned would still be open to an action for libel. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) - I the should like to add to the proposed new t was sugclause a paragraph providing thatAny person issuing or circulating "" dodgers "" into a candidate on the morning of electionshall be guilty of a criminal offence, and oa shall be sent to gaol for not less than, howsix months or more than ten years.",45
331,Mr BAMFORD,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS, I hardly (think that the clause goes far enough.,45
332,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,Every man who makes a That defamatory statement will be liable.,45
333,Mr BAMFORD,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"My point is that if a newspaper published a defamatory state"" ment concerning a candidate, an injunctioncould be obtained against it ; but that the - clause as it stands would not restrain another newspaper from copying that stateiment. - Mr JOHNSON (Lang) - I trust that the clause will'not be allowed to pass in its present form. I have special reason for taking up this attitude, since at the last .general election statements of the most defamatory character were circulated in re.gard to me, and circulated, too, by well meaning, but misguided, ladies in some cases, against whom one would be naturally loth to take legal proceedings, especially as the slanders had, in the first place, been manufactured by men who screened themselves behind the women in their dissemination. It was reported, for instance, that I was a most immoral, dissipated, and brutal individual, and that I had several - children, whom I used to hang up in a - wood-shed and flog almost to death. As a matter of fact, I have no young children.",45
334,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,The honourable member - carries in himself the refutation of such - charges.,46
335,Mr JOHNSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"That may be so, so far as those who know me are concerned; but the point is that such statements might have been made to many persons who were not personally! acquainted with me. I think the clause is loosely worded, and - does not sufficiently safeguard candidates from imputations of a scandalous character. Mr LONSDALE {New England) - I think that we are loading up the Bill in a way that is altogether unnecessary. During :an election campaign, scandalous statements in regard to candidates are often circulated, :and on hearing what has been said about me at such times, I have been inclined to ""think that I ought to be hanged. But I do not believe that we should trouble about these matters; I do not think it is necessary to provide against them ih the Bill If we are going to do so, however, let us take care that there shall be no escape for those who circulate these defa matory statements. I think that the proviso - as to reasonable belief in the truth of the - statements ought to be eliminated.",46
336,Mr CONROY,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I am unable rto support the amendment. The law already offers sufficient safeguards, and I fail to see why a candidate for parliamentary honours should, be protected against defamatory statements to an extent beyond the protection whicE is given the general ibody of citizens'. Amendment agreed to. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) I move That the following words be inserted :"" 206E -(1 ) Any person who(a) having announced himself as acandidate for election to the Parliament, shall, before the poll for the election is closed; or (i) having been elected to serve as a member of either House of the Parliament shall during the existence of the Parliament for which he is elected offer or give directly or indirectly to or for any club or other association, other than a charitable institution, any gift, donation or prize, shall be guilty of an offence against this section. Penalty : £ 5 . (2) No person shall be guilty of an offence within the meaning of this section if he honestly believes that the club or association to which the g if t donation or prize was offered or given was a charitable institution. (3) "" Charitable institution"" includes a church or other religious body, a hospital, benevolent or other charitable institution, or any society or association having for its object or one of its objects the assistance of relief of sick, destitute, or injured members, or other persons. (4) No proceedings shall be taken for a contravention of this section except within three months after the act complained of."" My proposal is designed to cope with the malicious activity constantly displayed by those who indirectly levy masked "" blackmail "" on the miserably paid Members of this Parliament.",46
337,Mr STORRER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I intend to oppose the proposed new clause, as I consider that it would be an undue interference with the liberty of the subject. A Member of Parliament or a candidate for parliamentary honours should be at liberty to give to any cause which he regards as worthy of his benevolence;. If a man believes in a church, why should he not be allowed to subscribe to it ? If he be a devotee of the turf, why should he not be permitted to subscribe to the funds of a racing club? When a Member of Parliament is asked for a subscription, and does not feel disposed to grant it, it is open to him to refuse the request. I oppose this clause on principle, believing that a Member of Parliament should be at liberty to give to whatever association or institution he pleases.",46
338,The CHAIRMAN,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"My attention has been drawn to the fact that portion of this clause is beyond the scope of the Bill, since it refers to the actions of Members of the Parliament. This Bill deals only with electoral questions, and it is, therefore, not competent to embody in it a matter which affects the actions of a member after he has been elected. I think that the clause will therefore need to be redrafted.",46
339,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," The amendment would, no dpubt,_be in order if the honourable member confined it to gifts by candidates. I suggest that he should amend it in that direction, allowing candidates to give what gifts they like-provide d that there is no corrupt intention-to churches, hospitals, and other charitable asylums, and for the relief of the sick and destitute. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) - I will accept the Minister's suggestion, although the provision will not be of much effect against the boodler, when amended as the honourable and learned gentleman suggests. I withdraw my amendment. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Amendment (by Mr KING O'MALLEY) proposed - That the following words be inserted :206B -(i ) Any person who having announced himself as a candidate for election to the Parliament, shall before the poll for the election is closed offer promise or give directly or indirectly to or for any club or other association, other tha acharitable institution, any g if t , donation or prize, shall be guilty of an offence against this section. Penalty : Five pounds in addition to any other penalty provided by law. (2) No person shall be guilty of an offence - within the meaning of this section if he honestly believes that the club or association to which the g if t donation or prize was offered or given was a charitable institution. (3) "" Charitable institution "" includes a church or other religious body, a hospital, benevolent or other charitable institution, or any society ciation having for its object or one of its objects the assistance or relief of sick, destitute, of injured members, or other persons. (4) No proceedings shall be taken for a contravention of this section except within three months after the act complained of.",47
340,Mr LONSDALE,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," The Committee would have made itself ridiculous if it had agreed to the proposed new clause, as originally moved by the honourable member, but I am opposed to that now before the Committee. The honourable member wishes to penalize men for being generous. These attempts to regulate human conduct by means of paper laws compel men to practise deception, and, instead of elevating humannature, do the reverse. Attempts to make men moral by Act of Parliament always fail. Let the man who cannot afford to make gifts have the courage to say to his electors, "" I cannot give to this or that cause "" ; but do not deprive a man who desires, to be generous of trie right to - be so. I am in no better position financially than is the honourable member for Darwin* who is always whining about the way in> which he has to give to his electors, and asking that his salary be increased. I question whether he really gives very much. But why should a man be prevented by law from giving if he desires to do so?",47
341,Mr WATSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,Why should we prevent a man from giving money to individual elec*tors?,47
342,Mr LONSDALE,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"That is a differentthing. What is there wrong in giving to a cricket club, or to any institution cf that kind? No doubt it is thought that men of wealth will 'have an advantage over poor men by giving more liberally, but I have yet to learn that a man can buy his way into Parliament. All through this session we have been trying to put restraint on individual action, for which there is no justification. I have heard of candidates for this Parliarment telling, the electors that if they were returned they would put ""the mining laws: right, so as to do away with ""boodlers,"" and would amend the land laws, although, they knew that this Parliament cannot passsuch legislation. Is it not worse to makesuch statements to the electors than it would be to give to cricket clubs? It make one's blood boil when humbug of* this kind is proposed. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) - As . the honourable member for New England has sung such a loud song about this proor asso- posal, I desire to say that it was drafted! by the honourable member for Lang, for whom I fathered it. I do not care, financially speaking, whether I am kicked' into or kicked out of Parliament. It isbecause I am financially independent that I can father these proposals. Membershave come to me, and have cried like babies; about the .£400 a year salary which they are receiving; but they have not the pluck tc* announce themselves publicly in favour of"" my proposal to raise the salary of Federal' members to £600 a year. I am not afraid to say that the present allowance is toolittle, and I do not wish to be in Parliament if my services are considered not worth ^600 annually. The honourable member bellowed like a sick bull on the Rocky Mountains; but the proposal came froma member of the Opposition. Whenever they have anything to propose, which they think right, but which they are frightened to bring forward themselves. I shall bewilling to father it, because I do not careaf my electors kick me out when I am right. Even if they do, I shall still enjoy my two meals a day and my bed.",47
343,Mr R EDWARDS,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I am not able to vote for the amendment, because I do not think that we should legislate to prevent any man from spending his money. We have been legislating to prevent men from earning money, and now we wish to prevent them from spending It. The honourable member complains about getting only a miserable £400 a year, but he looks very well on it. He would be in a different position if he had a wife and a dozen children to keep. If a man is generous enough to contribute to cricket --and football clubs, he should be allowed to give awav as much as he likes.",48
344,Mr ISAACS,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Indi-Attorney-General) . - No doubt, every man should be allowed to spend his money as he pleases, so long as he does not attempt to bribe those whom he wishes to elect him to Parliament. If he wishes to be generous, let him be so before ""his candidature, or after it. The clause - merely provides that a candidate shall not aittempt to bribe his prospective'constituents; it does not prevent him from giving to a 11 church, or a charitable institution, or for - ihe relief of the sick and destitute. They say that money talks, and it never talks 'louder than at election times. It is, however, apt to create suspicion when a man - chooses to exercise his generous impulses just when he is asking to be elected to Parliament. .",48
345,Mr THOMAS,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I do not think that candidates should be allowed to bribe their way into Parliament; but the honourable member's proposal is too wide in its scope. No doubt, at times a - judicious donation to a church is as helpful to a candidate as is a gift to any other institution. M.r. JOHNSON - But it may take form of bribery?",48
346,Mr THOMAS,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"That depends on the - motive of the giver. A man may give to a church about which he does not a snap of the fingers. A man frequently - subscribes to a church in much the way that he would contribute to the of a cricket club, not because he cares thing ab?""t the institution, but merely the idea pf winning votes. I do not think that a man should be excluded from tributing to charitable and other instituParliament tions during the whole of the time that sifting as a member of Parliament, but should not be permitted to contribute even to the funds of a church during the two or three months that elapse from the time that he announces himself as a candidate until the election takes place. No man can devote his money to a better purpose than a hospital; but a candidate can advertise himself as well by contributing to such an institution as in almost any other way. I have no feeling against churches, because I am a member of a church myself, but if a candidate were rich, he could, by judiciously subscribing to the churches in the electorate, go a long way towards assisting himself into a place in Parliament.",48
347,Mr MAUGER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I agree with the honourable member_for Barrier. There is no question that the practice of pestering members of Parliament for contributions to churches and other institutions is a relic of the old days., when men practically bought their way into Parliament.",48
348,Mr LONSDALE,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,The honourable member need not give anything to the churches unless fie likes.,48
349,Mr MAUGER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"A man who has plenty of money can afford to comply with the demands that are made upon him, but others may be compelled to refuse, and may thus be placed at a disadvantage. I believe that every man should belong to some church or other, and contribute towards its maintenance, but I see no reason why he « should also be called upon to subscribe to the funds of every other church in his electorate. A candidate may influence votes in his favour by subscribing to a church just as readily as by contributing to the funds of a football club. Therefore I hope that the suggestion to the honourable member for Barrier will be adopted.",48
350,Mr LONSDALE,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I the have no objection to a candidate being debarred from subscribing to charitable and the other institutions referred to at elec£ 5 tion times. I have had to contest an eleccare tion against a wealthy man who made liberal donations to various institutions, but same I do not think that that helped him very funds much. I frequently receive a request for anysubscriptions, and am informed that my for predecessor contributed so much - an amount which I could not attempt to give. conI think that a man should be returned to on his merits, and I have taken he is up a firm stand all through the piece, so he far as that is concerned. I do not think the proposal of the honourable member for Barrier is ""of much practical value, but at the same time. I have no objection to it. Amendment (by Mr THOMAS) proposed - That the amendment be amended by leaving out the words "" other than a charitable institution.""",48
351,Mr KELLY,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I entirely sympathize with the object of the honourable member, but I should like to know whether., under the amendment, a candidate who had been in the habit of subscribing to a charitable institution, would be prevented during the term of his candidature from forwarding his ordinary contribution? I always understood that a candidate was dedebarred from contributing for the first time to charities, and I have acted under that belief. But at the same time, I do not think that a candidate who regularly contributes to charities should be debarred from following his usual practice even at election times.",49
352,Mr THOMAS,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS, I see no objection to contributions being made under the conditions referred to by the honourable member for Wentworth; but it might be difficult to make a distinction in favour of such cases. The difficulty might be overcome by postponing the contribution until after the election.,49
353,Mr WEBSTER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"^ shall support the amendment, because I recognise that it will conduce to the purity of our public life. I have known poor candidates of small means to be handicapped in an election contest by the liberal contributions made by richer opponents to charities and other institutions - I remember one case in which a rich man, who was contesting an election in New South Wales,, made a number of exceptionally large donations just prior to an election. I do not mean to say that that, by reason of these contributions, he was successful, but he won the seat. Donations of the kind described very frequently influence weak people in favour of a candidate. In years gone by, seats have been practically bought by rich men who have made handsome bequests and gifts. I frankly confess that I cannot afford to make liberal donations to public institutions, and I have absolutely refused to comply with any of the requests that have reached me. I cannot afford to do so. The country does not expect it of me. It should be made plain that a man is not elected to Parliament in order that he may distribute his allowance amongst his constituents. His honorarium is intended to enable him to defray his expenses whilst he is serving the people. A man who subscribes to a hospital, so far from performing an act of charity, is discharging a plain duty. Moreover, I do> not think that any great advantage is derived by candidates who devotetheir money to such purposes. But when they pander to the members of cricket clubs, race clubs, and similar institutions, they are guilty of a form of bribery. I db not think that contributions of this kind are necessary to establish a man in hisposition in Parliament. I was told by. old politicians in New South Wales that if I refused to follow the practice that had been pursued in the past, my parliamentary, career would be a very short one; but I stated that if I had to choose between becoming impoverished, and holding my position, I should retire from public life. I put the question to the test, and I passed through the ordeal successfully. Wealthy candidates should not be placed in a position of undue advantage over their poorer opponents, and I shall therefore cordially support the amendment.",49
354,Mr R EDWARDS,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," When'speaking a few minutes ago, I was under the impression that sub-clause b, proposed by the honourable member for Darwin, was to be included as a part of the clause, and' would have prevented Members of Parliament from makingthese contributionsthroughout the year. As that is not the intention, I am prepared .to support the clause. If the provision is to apply only for a limited time before an election, there is not the same objection to it.",49
355,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,It must not be done after a man has announced himself as a candidate.,49
356,Mr R EDWARDS,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"I think there should be some fixed time,",49
357,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"The man fixes the time himself, when he announces himself as a candidate.",49
358,Mr R EDWARDS,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"I know that the existing Act provides for something of thekind, and I was careful not to contribute anything during the time provided for. As I now understand the matter, I am prepared to support the clause.",49
359,Mr JOHNSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," Althoug h it has been implied that I had some hand in the drafting of this provision, I can say that it bears no resemblance to any proposal that I have advocated. My idea was .absolutely to prevent Members of Parliament making use of their positions as such .to bribe electors by donations to institutions to which they would not subscribe as private individuals. This proposal does not touch that at all, and the previous propo.sal submitted dealt with that matter only to .a limited extent. This will not overcome the abuses and evils that exist at the present time, and which tend to make the retention of some seats dependent not upon the merits or services of the member in .a representative political capacity, but upon the length of his purse and its capa-city to be drawn upon for various local purposes, private and otherwise. The - difficulty is that it applies only to candidates, and while a candidate may aiot give anything during his candidature, he may say to persons who make applications to him/ "" Let this matter stand over until after I am elected."" He might thus make an implied promise, at least, and merely postpone carrying it out until after he is elected.",49
360,Mr KING OMALLEY,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,That is done now. candidate.,50
361,Mr JOHNSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"It is ; and it of the evils against which we should guard. The proposal now before the Committee does not guard against it, but, on the contrary, promotes it . A man may receive - fifty notifications that he has been elected patron of this or that club, and very often, even when no request is made for it directly, the notification implies that a donation to the funds is expected. If we are going to legislate in this matter at all, what i's now proposed is farcical, and will absolutely fail to achieve the object desired.",50
362,Mr WATSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I am strongly in favour of some provision restraining candidates and Members of Parliament in the matter of donations of the kind alluded to. I have for a very long time past refused to contribute to other than hospitals, on the ground that I cannot afford to respond to the numerous calls made by various associations on the purse of a Member of Parliament.",50
363,Mr JOHNSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"I have had over 800 written applications of the kind, apart from verbal applications, in one year. .",50
364,Mr WATSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"That is the experience of the majority of honourable members. It is a polite form of black-mail levied upon a man who happens to hold the position of a Member of Parliament. I do not see that the clause, as amended, referring only to candidates, would be very much better than the existing state of affairs. I think that such a provision is more necessary in the case of a Member of Parliament than in the case of a candidate. I do not object to an opponent of mine spending money in this way, because I do not believe that it influences many votes, but it is unfortunate, in the public interests, that a poor man getting into Parliament should be at the mercy of a large number of people, or run the risk of being dubbed mean and unwilling to contribute to any good cause. In my view, the provision should apply particularly to Members of Parliament. As you, sir, have ruled that the sub-clause embodying that proposition would be out of order, the balance of the clause, in my view, is not worth bothering about.",50
365,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," The definition of a candidate in the principal Act, I find does not apply to this part of the Act, and it is therefore necessary to include in this clause the words contained in the definition of a I therefore ask the honourable isone member for Darwin to insert, after the word ""who, "" the words "" with in three months before the day of election.""",50
366,Mr KING OMALLEY,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I accept the Minister's suggestion. The honourable member for Lang said that his name had been brought into the matter, and I desire to explain to the honourable member that the honourable member for New England made a most vicious assault on me for having moved the amendment, and I pointed out that I had merely adapted it from that which had been suggested by the honourable member for Lang.",50

369,Mr CHANTER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Perhaps the honourable member would insert the words "" or police magistrate,"" because every police magisthose trate is not a stipendiary magistrate.",51

371,The CHAIRMAN,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"I have read the proposed new clause, which I understand moved. the honourable member desires should be inserted as an addition to clause 51.",51
372,Mr FISHER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,I left it to the Minister to say where it should come in.,51
373,The CHAIRMAN,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"I point out to the honourable member tendering the amendorder? ment, that clause 51 is before the mittee, and deals with disqualification for bribery or undue influence. A grievance of a candidate cannot, I think, be recogtion nised ns a matter cognate to that dealt in this clause.",51
374,Mr WATSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,I think that the new clause now proposed is just as much out order as paragraph b of the clause subsubmit mitted by the honourable member for Darable win.,51
375,Mr FISHER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"As I have been intrusted with the amendment by the honourable member for Melbourne, I think it right to say that I rose to move it after thei able member for Bourke had moved his amendment. I thought that was the proper time. But I was informed from the Chair and by the Minister that it would be more convenient to move it at a later stage. would be very unfortunate if , through having accepted that advice, I should now find that the amendment is out of order.",51
376,The CHAIRMAN,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,Will the honourable member tell me when he was prevented ruled out of order. from moving it?,51
377,Mr FISHER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Immediately after the amendment of the honourable member for Bourke was disposed of, I rose to submit this amendment; but I was asked not to move it then.",51

But the Ministernow tells me that clause 51, which is part, of the division of the Bill headed "" Miscellaneous,"" was specially recommitted in order to allow certain new clauses to be moved, and that this is one of them.

We have already inserted provisions in this Bill to prevent persons from doing certain things between the time honorwhen they become candidates and their election to Parliament. I contend that it is equally competent for the Committee to decide that a man shall not be libelled during the term of his candidature. If we It pan defend a candidate against himself in my respect of giving donations, we can defend a candidate against the attack of others,, and provide a penalty in. the event of hisbeing unfairly attacked. I submit, therefore, that the amendment should not be",51
382,The CHAIRMAN,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Wit h respect to the point of order raised by the honourable member for Bland, I must rule that there is a wide distinction between the present amendment and that upon which I preThe previousamendment affected only a member of Parliament. This amendment affects a candito date whether he is afterwards elected to Parliament or not. It relates to occurreply, rences anterior to election. Therefore, think it is well within the scope of the Bill. The only doubt that I expressed was whether the amendment was relevant happen to him. to the clause recommitted. But as I am now assured that the clause was. recomspeaks mitted for a special purpose, and as I aware that it is the practice to recommit 100,000 people. clauses for special purposes, I feel that it would be improper for me to rule the amendment out of order.",51
383,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," Speakin g to the merits of the amendment, I have to s.ay that find myself unable' to accept it. Its object is to' protect a candidate against unfair criticism. In the first place, I consider that it is an impracticable proposal. I provides that any person who feels grievefl by any criticism may apply to Court. It practically blocks all criticism of candidates for Parliament. I have althat ready accepted an amendment under which false statements are punishable; but this amendment does more than restrain persons from making false statements. It is,, over, vague. We have tried to meet what is fair and reasonable, and I would ask the honourable member for Wide Bay not press this amendment.",52
384,Mr WATSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," It does seem to me that some honourable members attempting to carry the principle of the protection of candidates too far. For my own part, I have always, felt that healthy criticism by newspapers did a. candidate for Parliament good. A piece of criticism may cause a man to make a len times better speech than he would otherwise do.",52
385,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,Some of us believe that we owe our seats largely to adverse criticism.,52
386,Mr WATSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"I have never had many newspapers, supporting me, and I was alpaper ways grateful that some of them did not. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Has not honourable member found that some newsplication papers would not publish replies to attacks made upon him?",52
387,Mr WATSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"It is only occasionally that one meets, with a newspaper editor is so unfair as that.",52
388,Mr LONSDALE,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,The only one that know of is the editor of the Age.,52
389,Mr WATSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"There are newspapers that are quite as bad as the Age in that respect. If a candidate is able to go on to a platform, and say that he has been unfairly attacked, and. denied the right of the sense of fair play which is enI tertained by the great bulk of the people of this country is such that the circumstance is probably the best thing that could",52
390,Mr MAHON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"The candidate probably to twenty-five people from the platam form, whereas the newspaper may speak to",52
391,Mr WATSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"But the 100,000 people are probably not influenced by the statements of the newspaper which they read. r Newspaper attacks doi not always have much effect, or many of us would not be I here now. Under this amendment, there would be the further difficulty of determining whether the grievance of a candidate was sufficiently serious to merit a reply, t and whether the reply sent by him was of agreasonable length. Suppose a newspaper the comes out a day or two before an election with a wild attack upon a candidate, and he proposes to' reply. He has first of all to go to the Court and obtain an in- junction, or some kind of order declaring that his grievance is sufficiently serious to moredemand redress. ""After the order of the Court has been given, the editor of the newspaper may say that the pressure of his to space for that particular day was so great that the unreasonable length of the' reply precluded its insertion.",52
392,Mr CHANTER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,Then the pressure on his are pocket would amount to £25.,52
393,Mr WATSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"But who has to be the judge as to what is "" reasonable "" length ?",52
394,Mr MAHON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,The Court.,52
395,Mr WATSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"The amendment provides that the editor shall allow a "" reasonable space"" for reply.",52
396,Mr MAHON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,And that the newspaper shall publish the reply accordingly.,52
397,Mr WATSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"The editor of the newsmay believe that five lines, constituted sufficient space; and if the candidate rethe quired six lines to be inserted, another apto the Judge would be necessary. Do not honourable members see that it all comes down to a matter of judgment as to whether a candidate has been seriously who attacked, and as to whether the reply which he wishes to make is I of reasonable length. Who is to determine whether any letter written by - a candidate shall necessarily be inserted', or whether his grievance is, sufficiently serious demand any redress whatever? It is difficult to apply such a provision, and in the vast majority of cases a man is not one whit the worse for newspaper criticism of the kind indicated.",52
398,Mr MAHON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I did not altogether agree with the proposal of the honourable member for Melbourne when it was first moved j and, at his request, I have given it another and less objectionable form. The Minister of Home Affairs raised the objection that it is vaguely worded, and said that any person might choose to feel himself aggrieved by moderate criticism. But he did not tell the Committee that the aggrieved person would have to convince a Judge or a magistrate that his grievance was a just one. Had he been quite frank he would have added that it was not the candidate's feelings which would determine the issue, but that the decision should be tested with the sober judgment ,of an independent arbitrator. I cannot understand the extreme censoriousness of the honourable member for Bland. He implied that the supporters of this amendment dislike criticism. I rather welcome criticism, because, in my opinion, it keeps public life healthy. The criticism with which this amendment deals is not exactly that based on lies, because it is only a clumsy writer who descends to falsehood concerning an opponent. This amendment is devised to meet suppression, distortion, or wilful misrepresentation. It is designed to protect candidates against newspapers which boil down speeches so as to conceal their full meaning, and then proceed from this foundation to raise their own superstructure. honourable member for Bland remarked that the newspapers will publish any contribution which a man may send. But I know of one or two cases in which two leading newspapers in this city .refused to publish contributions in correction of their misstatements. In facf,, that is rather the rule than the exception, for the newspapers publish only whaf suits their polioy. The honourable member for Bland seemed to think that, under the amendment, it would be necessary for the aggrieved person to obtain a second order from the Judge before he could compel the offending newspaper to publish a correction. Possibly the clause does bear that interpretation, and, if it does, it can be easily amended; but that is no argument against 'the principle. I do not agree with the Minister of Home Affairs that the amendment is unworkable, but if it should be considered that an amendment' would make it more workable I feel sure that the honourable member for Melbourne will gladly accept any assistance in that direction. ' Mr Wilks (Dalley) - This amendment appears to me to have for its object the coddling of candidates for public life. Public men must not be hypersensitive, because if they are it; will be a great surprise to me if they are ever elected. It is going altogether too far to call upon a newspaper to publish a reply to its criticism. Take the two morning newspapers in Melbourne. When one newspaper has published a hostile criticism of a candidate, invariably the other newspaper will present the other side of the case. If newspapers overreach themselves they will fail to accomplish the object of their criticism, as they did here in the case of Senator Trenwith. He was most warmly assailed by all the powerful organs, but, in spite of their criticisms, he was returned at the head of the poll by an enormous majority. Hostile criticism is the best thing in the world for a candidate for public honours, or for a Member of Parliament. The trouble with most of the newspapers is that they do not know Eow to spell our names. Very often we wonder whether they have in their linotype machines any of the characters which are required to represent-our names. I really cannot understand any one asking the Committee to enact this coddling provision. When a public man has initiated an action for libel against a private individual, what has generally been the result? Time after time The a jury has refused to award damages in a case of that kind. All this goes to show that jurymen consider that a public man is fair game for criticism. If , on the other hand, the criticism of a newspaper will not bear inspection, it will soon be dropped. If this amendment be carried, I I shall expect to see a more hypersensitive member of the House proposing that no interjections shall be allowed to be made at a public meeting, and that henceforth candidates jyill have totalk to "" dead "" audiences. I suppose that by-and-by it will be proposed that reports of public meetings shall only lappear in that most respectable organ, the War Cry. The honourable member for Coolgardie said that a newspaper appeals to an audience of 100,000 persons, but the average number of electors in a constituency is not more than 30,000. If his argument had any application at all, it could only apply to a Senate election, and, all the newspapers of a State fighting for or against a candidate it is not reasonable to believe that the proprietors and editors would combine in common criticism against him if it were not fairly justifiable. If I can pass through "" yellow "" journalism and get returned, surely every other honourable member can survive hostile criticism.",53
399,Mr ISAACS,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Indi-Attorney-General) . - I wish to point out to the honourable member for Coolgardie that this amendment is really impracticable. Take the case of a candidate who was fighting his way through ?a huge constituency in the country, and who, a few days after its publication, received a copy of a metropolitan newspaper, containing certain statements, what would he have to do? He could not go near a Judge. He would have to bring before, a police magistrate, if one could be caught in a remote corner of the State, the publisher of the newspaper, and make him show cause why he should not print an explanation.",54
400,Mr MAHON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,Coul d he not wire to a solicitor in Melbourne to put the case before a Judge?,54
401,Mr ISAACS,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Does the honourable member expect the candidate to leave the constituency ancl go down to the metropolis and enter into the field of litigation for the purpose of getting an order, which might) be combated for a considerable time, perhaps until after the election was over. But, to put the matter on higher ground, newspapers have very high public functions to perform We cannot forget that when they are dealing with great public matters they Have just as important a duty to discharge as honourable members or candidates. The press has to advise and inform the public of what is going on. We have tonight, by means of another amendment, gone a long way in the direction of protecting candidates as to statements of fact by newspapers; and in this we have followed English law. But if we say that no newspaper, however honest its criticism may be, is to perform a great public function, except under fear of being hailed before a Judge, or a magistrate, and compelled to publish some explanation, or so called explanation, in the same columns under a penalty of .£25, I think it will be the public, and not the candidates, who will suffer. .To tell newspapers that they must not report public meetings at which some statements may be made reflecting on a candidate, would be to do a great in. justice to the people at large.",54
402,Mr WEBSTER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I am inclined to the opinion that we may rest satisfied with what has already been done with a view to protecting candidates against unfair press criticism. Any newspaper, whether country or.metropolitan, which deliberately makes false statements in regard to any candidate should be held answerable for its wrong-doing. My own opinion, however, is that the more . unreasonable the attack the better it is for the candidate. As a matter of fact, the representatives of the press, who occupy seats in the galleries of this House, publish columns of caricature and misrepresentation regarding honourable members. 'Praise, blame, and misrepresentation are used just as its suits the purposes of the press - wit h a view to ourry favour, it may be, with certain honourable members, or with the public, or the newspaper proprietors. The honourable member for Dalley, who has addressed us on this proposal, has had a bed of roses throughout his political career: He has ever been the "" white-headed boy "" of the metropolitan press, and I do not know that, under the circumstances, he may be taken as an authority on the question of what criticism should be regulated, and what criticism should be encouraged. Vigorous criticism is sometimes the lifeblood of a candidate for parliamentary honours. It has been my experience to. have every newspaper in the district, not only criticising me, but refusing to report one word of my utterances. Indeed, the onjy way in which I could induce one newspaper, whioh was not quite so bitter as the rest, to publish one address which I delivered, was to purchase 500 copies at 2d. each. However, these antagonistic newspapers over-stepped the mark, and fortunately there was time enough for me to demonstrate to the public the unfair and un-British conduct to which I was subjected. The result was that I was returned to this House. The same sort of conduct is pursued by the metropolitan press. I have known a metropolitan newspaper to reserve its criticism until the day before the election, when there was no chance for the candidate to reply, and then publish most libellous matter.",54
403,Mr WATKINS,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,This proposal would not remedy that sort of thing. i28 Electoral [REPRESENTATIVES.],54
404,Mr WEBSTER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"That is so; but I am showing that there is some justification for the amendment. Had the amendment which we have already carried been embodied in the law, the newspaper to which I last referred could have been proceeded against, and mulcted in a penalty. I do not fear criticism, but I do fear misrepresentation, which is not criticism, and against which I. take it the honourable member for Melbourne directs his proposal. From week-end to week-end, the remarks of honourable members of thi House are made to bear totally differed hterpretations from those intended.",55
405,Mr FRAZER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,What punishmeo does the honourable member suggest ? ?,55
406,Mr WEBSTER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,I can only leave the matter to the conscience of the press.,55
407,Mr BRUCE SMITH,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Will the honourable member name the newspaper, or newspapers to which he refers?",55
408,Mr WEBSTER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"I do not think that any distinction can be made between newspapers. The honourable and learned member for Parkes is one of the fairest men in the House, and, as he always reads both sides of any question, and stands as an authority of what is the correct thing, I am afraid it would be impertinence on my part to indicate the newspaper. am afraid the amendment is too cumbersome to attain the object of the mover; out the clause we have previously passed will give us some power over libel. , Mr FISHER (Wide Bay) - The honourable member for Melbourne has returned to the Chamber, and taken charge of the amendment; and I should now like to say that when I undertook to submit it, in order that it might be placed before the Committee, I intimated that I did not quite agree with the proposal it embodied. However, the fact that such a proposal is made is evidence that the press in some parts of Australia is grossly unfair. No honourable member, especially a fighting member like the representative of Melbourne, would submit such an amendment unless there had been some gross abuse of the privileges of .the press. Weighing everything in the scales, however, I am of opinion that if we tried to protect ourselves by legislation, we should lose in the result. My experience is that the very best thing that can happen to a radical candidate is to have the whole of the conservative press against him. In Queensland we have always thought it a glorious privilege to Bill. exercise our public rights in such a way as to be denounced by the whole of the press. Indeed, most of our success in Queensland has been due to the fact that in many cases nine-tenths of the press have denounced the radical candidates. Mr MALONEY "" (Melbourne) - I feel that 'the object I had in view has been fairly well achieved, and that I may rest content with the provision which has already been placed in the Bill, and which to a great extent covers the ground. The wording of my amendment might not be such as to best attain the end in view; but I point out to the Attorney-General that it would have placed a candidate in such a position that, if a newspaper wronged him, that newspaper would be compelled to publish his views in as prominent a place as was given to the attack. At present the only remedy is to send a letter to the editor, who may or may not publish it. If he does not throw it into the waste-paper basket, he inserts it in some obscure corner, unless the sender happens to be an important individual. Then, again, letters sent in this way are very often condensed to such an extent as to remove the true substance. Perhaps during the recess, the suggestion contained I in the proposed amendment may receive consideration, with good results in the future. I ask leave to withdraw the amendment.",55
409,Mr KELLY,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I object to the amendment being withdrawn, in order to call attention before its withdrawal to the way in which honourable members in the corner are ""using the opportunity this Bill affords to advertise their particular pretensions to public favour.",55
410,Mr FISHER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,What a discovery !,55
411,Mr KELLY,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"It is not much of a discovery, because we have been witnesses of the undignified proceeding for several days. Under cover of this amendment, we are told that the public press has been extremely unfair to certain honourable members of this House.",55
412,Mr FRAZER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,It is a fact.,55
413,Mr KELLY,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"It is a fact; but the press has been unfair, not only to certain members, but to members on all sides of the House. I objected to the withdrawal of the amendment, merely to get the explanation into the pages of Hansard, that the Labour Party are not the only sufferers, and that the official press of that party is quite as unfair, if not more unfair, than the press of any other party. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.",55
414,Mr WATSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I move That the following words be inserted :"" 2obD - Telegram s relating to ele'ctions and 'Containing only the names of divisions, names of - candidates, and the numbers of votes polled for each candidate and logded for transmission on - the day of or before noon on the day after the - day of election - may, subject to regulations, be transmitted on payment of the rates prescribed in the Second Fart of the Second Schedule to the - Post and Telegraphic Rates Act 1902."" The effect of this new clause will be to permit telegrams relating to elections to be transmitted at press rates. - almost certain that advantage will not be - taken of the provision on the main lines.",56
415,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,It will.,56
416,Mr WATSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"I am pretty certain, - however, that it will not be resorted to on the main lines between large towns, because the newspapers in those towns obtain the returns, and invariably exhibit them in .some public place. My object is to enable .residents in small centres who possess - telegraphic facilities to have these returns transmitted to them for public information. The adoption of my proposal cannot involve"" the Commonwealth in any great loss, inasmuch as it merely refers to the actual .returns, and to the names of candidates, and the practice is to be allowed only upon .the day of election, and until noon upon - the day following.",56
417,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Parramatta) Before this amendment is adopted, I think -.that we ought to have a statement from the Postmaster-General in regard to it. The danger which I foresee in it is that it will lead to such a congestion of business on the wires that the public may be seriously Inconvenienced.",56
418,Mr WATSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,Does the honourable member think that private messages relating to the results of an election would be sent over the wires between Sydney and 'Goulburn while the Goulburn newspapers were exhibiting full returns in the streets?,56
419,Mr JOSEEH COOK,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Yes . I am - afraid that in many quarters, where the lines are fairly occupied, it will lead to - such a congestion of traffic as will practically paralyze the Postal Department. However, if the Postmaster-General can - see no difficulty in that respect we may very well allow him to assume the responsibility.",56
420,Mr MAHON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I do not think that this amendment ought to be carried. There are very few country towns which do not possess a post-office, and where there is a post-office there is usually a telephone, so that the information which the honourable member for Bland desires to be transmitted to the people could ' easily be telephoned from town to town.",56
421,Mr WATSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,Onl y at telegraphic rates.,56
422,Mr MAHON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Even admitting that fact, the amendment would prove of very little value, because in most instances the information would relate to a particular It is electorate or a particular candidate. It would not exceed twenty-five words.",56
423,Mr WATSON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,It would be much more than that.,56
424,Mr MAHON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,I do not think so. . Mr WATSON - The country electors want to know the returns for the whole of the State.,56
425,Mr MAHON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Eve n af the ordinary telegraph rates sixteen words can be transmitted from any portion of a State to any other portion for ninepence. I think that the honourable member for Bland will find that the whole of the returns of a State wil] nbt be telegraphed to country towns upon polling-day, or even on the following day, before noon. The point mentioned by the honourable member for Parramatta was, I think, a good one. The proposal will undoubtedly result in congesting the wires upon polling-day, and will not benefit the revenue of the Postal Department. As that Department is now being carried on at a loss, I think that we ought to have a statement from the Postmaster-Tjeneral in regard to the matter.",56
426,Mr FISHER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I am rather surprised at the attitude of the honourable member for Coolgardie, because he, like myself,, represents a large constituency. I ask him to consider the difficulties which confront small settlements in the back-blocks.",56
427,Mr MAHON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,I never heard the honourable member eloquent about them before.,56
428,Mr FISHER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"This is a proposal to send information which will be of great interest to partisans in remote settlements, and I think it is a very proper one. In my own State a great number of people exhibit a keen interest in elections both for the State and the Commonwealth. It is a very good thing to cultivate that interest. Upon that ground I appeal to the honourable member for ""Coolgardie to allow the clause to pass. Personally, I believe that it will add to the revenue of the Postal Department, although not to such an extent as to result in a congestion of the lines. 1 cordially support the new clause. Amendment agreed to.",56
429,Mr KNOX,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I move That the following words be inserted :"" 207A. Any candidate duly nominated for election as a senator or a member of the House of Representatives shall, subject to regulations and subject to the payment of the charges prescribed in the first schedule to the Post and graph Rates Act 1902, be entitled to transmit through the post one copy of an election address or manifesto relating to such candidature to each elector whose name appears on the roll for the State or division as the case may be for which the candidate is nominated."" Under the Postal and Telegraph Rates Act 1902 the postage upon all newspapers intended for delivery within the Commonwealth is i d . per 20 ozs. on their aggregate weight., if posted by any person at one time. During the last election, candidates were enabled to post a small registered newspaper, containing their manifestoes, to their various constituents. In my judgment, every candidate is entitled"" to place his views before the electors whose suffrages he is seeking. At the present time, with the limitation which is imposed upon his expenses, it is absolutely impossible for him to come into contact with them. ""The only .way in which he can make his ' views known is by the adoption of some such means as I suggest. I think that the adoption of my proposal would afford candidates a proper opportunity to place their views before the .electors. Such a provision might well be inserted, inasmuch as we have already provided in the principal Act that certain electoral matter shall be passed through the Post Office.",57
430,Mr MALONEY,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,The honourable member wishes candidates to have the same privileges that are accorded to the press ?,57
431,Mr KNOX,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,Exactly .,57
432,Mr FISHER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,Is this privilege to be enjoyed all the year round?,57
433,Mr KNOX,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"No . To secure this privilege, a man must have been duly nominated as a candidate. I have consulted the leaders of the House, who approve of my proposal, and I feel sure that if will commend itself to the Committee.",57
434,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS, I see no objection to the acceptance of this amendment.,57
435,Mr CARPENTER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Is the Minister prepared to extend the privilege to candidates for municipal and district councils, and other bodies?",57
436,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,No ; we are dealing now with a Bill relating to elections to the Commonwealth Parliament; we are dealing only with matters within our own jurisdiction. I shall not oppose the amendment. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) - I Telesee in this proposal a secret dagger to assassinate the democracy of this country.,57
437,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"It is a dagger which democracy might use in another direction. Mr KING O'MALLEY - It would cost a Member of Parliament the larger part of his parliamentary allowance to print addresses to be distributed throughout an electorate containing 15,000 or 20,000 voters. The majority of candidates are poor men, and it seems to me that this proposal, if carried, will give an undue advantage to the wealthy combinations of Australia. At the first blush it seems to be an innocent proposition, but in the event of its being carried, I can well imagine the secret financial boodlieristic organizations of this country meeting, in dark corners or in great palaces to prepare documents for the annihilation of the Labour Party. I call upon the Committee to resist this attack upon the breastworks of democracy.",57
438,Mr KELLY,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I am surprised that the honourable member for Darwin, should oppose this proposal. As a true protectionist, anxious to foster new industries, he ought to recognise that the passing of this clause would giVe a great impetus to the manufacture of waste-paper baskets for the homes of the unfortunate electors of Australia. We are told that packages of newspapers weighing 20 ozs. may be sent through the post for i d . Not much labour is involved in the delivery of bulk parcels to one address; but surely it is not proposed to send bulk packages of electioneering circulars weighing 20 ozs. into every home. If this proposal be adopted, it will impose a heavy burden on the Postal Department, which might be called upon, for id., to deliver 400 or 500 packages of advertisements in as many different homes. I do not think that the Commonwealth can afford that, and I shall therefore oppose the proposition.",57
439,Mr CARPENTER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I wish .to say a word or two on the serious side of this question. I believe that the honourable member for Kooyong has the very best intentions in submitting this amendment, but I would point out that he is asking us to vote certain privileges that will be peculiar to ourselves. Honourable members know that -'in connection with the question of the taxation of Federal incomes there has been considerable unrest and criticism among the people. Surely we do not desire to add to their just cause of complaint by deliberately voting to ourselves privilege's which will not ""be granted to the general public. It is not even proposed to extend the concession to 'candidates for elections to the States Parliaments. Members of those Legislatures would have a perfect right to ask, "" Why - should Federal members vote themselves privileges which are denied to us?"" The - same remark will apply to the position of candidates for election to municipal and district councils, as well as other public bodies. If the honourable member intends to be consistent, by proposing to extend this privilege to the general community, I shall be prepared to consider his proposition; but if .we - conferred these special privileges upon ourselves, we should subject ourselves to well-deserved criticism. I hope that the amendment will be rejected.",58
440,Mr BRUCE SMITH,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I do not think that the honourable member for Fremantle has dealt quite fairly with this proposed new clause. The matter does not - concern me, since I so seldom change my views on any question that my Constituents nave them in a stereotyped form; but I - can quite understand that it is a matter of keen concern to some honourable members, who may change their views at every fresh - election. I have the greatest respect for the stability of the views of my honourable friend the member for Kooyong; but, as he represents a constituency which has a moving population, it becomes necessary for him, no doubjt, from time to time, to let them know, by means of addresses, what his views are on current topics. There is a very serious side to this proposal, and I think that the honourable member for Fremantle has quite missed the point. The honourable member for Kooyong does not wish to give Members of Parliament an ad vantage over other people. He has pointed out that it is possible to send through the post 20 ozs. of newspapers in bulk for i d .",58
441,Mr FISHER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,Separately ? r,58
442,Mr BRUCE SMITH,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Yes ; that is the point. One may take twenty newspapers to the post-office, weighing, an ounce each, and have them distributed over the country broadcast for i d . The honourable member for Kooyong merely contends that, for educational purpgses, the addresses of candidates for election to this Parliament are quite as valuable as newspapers, and should be distributed by the post-office at the same rates. I do not think that he is asking for a privilege; he merely desires that candidates shall be allowed to take advantage of the existing practice in regard to newspapers. Presumably, the ground upon which newspapers may be posted at such a cheap rate is that they contain at least a modicum of educational matter; and it is only fair to assume that the addresses of parliamentary candidates will do the same. I speak quite disinterestedly, because I am not likely to avail myself of the privilege, since my constituents do not need matter of this kind!",58
443,Mr MAHON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," The honourable member for Wentworth is under a misapprehension. The Post and Tele- (graph Rates Act provides that the postage of newspapers shall be i d . for 20 ozs. aggregate weight, although each newspaper is in a separate wrapper. I do not look upon the proposal of the honourable member for""' Kooyong as anything veiy dreadful, but I would point out to the Committee that the object which he has in view could be achieved if he had his addresses printed in his local newspaper, and .then circulated.",58
444,Mr KELLY,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,That might be difficult to arrange. Mr 'MAHON - He could get them printed if he were willing to pay for the printing.,58
445,Mr WILKS,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,His local newspapers happen to be the Age and the Argus.,58
446,Mr MAHON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"There are several small newspapers in the Kooyong electorate, any one of which the honourable member could avail himself of for the publication of his addresses, and he could have copies of these newspapers posted at the rate of id. for 20 ozs. Still. I see no objection to the insertion of this provision in the Bill. It is a very fair one, and will operate as usefully for one party as for another. I db not share the rather pessimistic views of the honourable member for Darwin, and see nothing dangerous in the proposal.",58
447,Mr FISHER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,The candidate should t if y that they are election addresses.,59
448,Mr MAHON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"That is a detail, and is ments. provided for by the words "" as prescribed by regulation.""",59
449,Mr STORRER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I agree with the honourable member for Fremantle that, although we have control of the post-office, no objection to it . we should not use it to give special concesozs. sions to ourselves which are not given other public men.",59

451,Mr STORRER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,Then we should not give this privilege to candidates f o i the Federal Parliament.

458,Mr WILKS,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I would warn be honourable members of the probable consequences of adopting the proposed new At the time of the Federal the referendum, the leading newspapers in New South Wales forwarded copies of some of their special political issues to every elector in the State, and the mail services became so congested that the coaches were laden with mail matter to the exclusion of passengers,, in some cases for many days. If candidate is to be permitted to forward bulky parcels of manifestoes through a the post under the conditions proposed, the mail services will not be able to meet the It seems to me that there is a disposition on the part a of honourable members to substitute the manifesto for the add ress from the plat! I form, and I am astonished that members. If of a party who have for so long prided themselves upon their ability to appeal to the sympathies of the electors by addresses from the rostrum should now be found supporting the honourable member for Kooyong. who wish to issue manifestoes can do so at their own expense. I shall certainly not be any party to encouraging a practice which I feel sure will cause a breakdown in the postal service. The chances are that many honourable members of the Labour Party, instead of wooing the electors by means of addresses written by themselves will forward to them manifestoes drawn up by some skilful journalist in the pay of the party.",59
459,Mr WEBSTER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," At present the poor man who happens to be a candidate for Parliament does not usually adopt the method of printing manifestoes and sending them to the electors; but he may be encouraged by the facilities which it is proposed to offer to place himself upon an equality with a richer opponent, who makes liberal use of the printing press and' the post. If the mail services became blocked, as predicted by the honourable member for Dalley, the poor candidate would at least have the satisfaction of knowing that owji manifesto could not reach the electors, his opponent would be at a similar disadvantage. Newspapers very frequently circulate special issues of their journals among the electors in any division in which they desire to give special support to a candidate. the proposal of the honourable member for Kooyong, the candidate against whose interests the newspapers are working will be able to counteract their influence to' some extent by distributing counter-manifestoes. I should like to hear what the Postmaster-General has to say as to the practicability of the .proposal. I have some sympathy with the honourable gentleman when these demands are made upon his Department. The honourable member for Kooyong has not appreciated the responsibilities he is imposing upon the Postmaster-General, but I am prepared to vote for the amendment if the Minister is prepared to accept those responsibilities.",60
460,Mr BRUCE SMITH,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I wish to guard against any suspicion that the remarks which I made in a spirit of persiflage, as a contribution to the humour which has permeated most of the discussions of today, were not made with reference to any particular member of the Committee. The honourable member for Kooyong is an old friend of thirty years' stand- Fuller, G. W. ing; and there is nothing I should regret more than to lead him to suppose that I made a joke at his expense. The honourable member's views are so much like my own that I might almost say they are identical with them. I am quite equal to more persiflage, if it is necessary; but I wish now to treat the matter seriously, because I think that, possibly, the honourable member for Kooyong might consider that I was willing to make a joke and sacrifice my friend. I had no idea in making a joke to give it any point regarding the honourable member personally.",60
461,Mr KELLY,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," The Postmaster-General should seriously consider this proposition, because it will be possible under it for 500 of these manifestoes, if they are reasonably brief, to be sent through the post for one penny. In the circumstances, the matter is one which vitally affects the Post and Telegraph Department. The authorities of that Department will not know when they will be deluged with these manifestoes, and therefore, for some time before an election, they if his will require to employ a large number of temporary hands to be prepared to deal with them. It is extraordinary that the Minister in charge of the Department should be prepared to stand by without protest while another Minister accepts an amendment which will have a most serious Under effect upon his Department.

462,Mr WATKINS,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS, I desire to ask the Minister of Home Affairs whether he will be prepared to grant to candidates for State Parliaments a concession similar to that which has just been granted to candidates for this Parliament?,61

Motion (by Mr GROOM) proposed - That the Standing Orders be suspended to «nable the Bill to pass through its remaining stages without delay.,61
464,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Macquarie) I do not object to the suspension of the Standing Orders,, but I desire to point out that a number of the concessions which have been granted under this Bill will involve serious inroads upon the revenue' of the Post and Telegraph Department. I do not know the view of the Postmaster General, but I can tell the House, that when this matter was discussed by the last Government, one of the points which I considered it to be my duty to bring before my colleagues was whether the revenue of the Department ought not to be increased by a contribution from the Electoral Branch of the Home Affairs Department. If the Post and Telegraph Department is made to bear more than its share of the electoral expenditure, it is evident that it will be a long time before we shall be able ito afford to concede penny postage to the people of Australia. If the Postmaster-General will look through this Bill, he will find that a large number of concessions have ""been granted, involving a considerable loss of revenue to his Department, not only in regard to the transmission of matter for parliamentary candidates, but also in respect of reductions in the cost of telegrams. These concessions must interfere seriously with the departmental business, as well as reduce the revenue. Has the Postmaster-General made a calculation as to their probable effect? It has been suggested that the whole of the administrative work under this measure should be undertaken by the Post and Telegraph Department. If that view is to be adopted, it will mean further serious burdens upon the Department. Many of us have at heart the desirableness of bringing about pennypostage throughout Australia. We admit that at present the revenue cannot bear the - strain. But every one of these concessions makes it more difficult to inaugurate that reform. What' steps are to be taken to recompense the Department for the large amount Of additional work that will be entailed upon it, and for the depletion of its revenue? These matters should receive the serious consideration of the Postmaster General.",61
465,Mr LONSDALE,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I should like to learn from the Postmaster General whether it is intended to make higher payments to the various mail contractors throughout the Commonwealth who will have to carry all the literature that will be transmitted under the provisions which have just been inserted in this Bill? Is it intended to sweat the contractors in the interests of candidates for Parliament? I think it is an outrage that this kind of thing should be done. If we, as members of this House, wish to increase our emoluments, let us increase them in a direct way, not by side winds, by means of which we think the public will not know what we are doing. We ought not to pass laws which mean increasing the burdens on the people in this fashion. For my own part, I think that what we have done will be of very little advantage to candidates, though it will seriously decrease the revenue. I regret to say that the Bill has been debated throughout with the idea of securing more advantages to ourselves rather than from the point of view of increasing the public advantage. Our object seems to have been not to. serve and help the public, but to assist those who stand as candidates for Parliament. I enter my strongest protest against what has been done.",61
466,Mr SPEAKER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"The debate is somewhat irregular. The motion before the Chair is that the Standing Orders be suspended. On the motion for the adoption of the report, such remarks as have been made by the last two honourable members who have spoken will be in order. . Question resolved in the affirmative. Motion (by Mr GROOM) proposed - That the report be adopted.",61
467,Mr KELLY,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," There is much to be said in favour of the view of the honourable member for New England. I think that when the Government recognise how many propositions they have accepted, whirh cannot but have a result beneficial to Members of Parliament, whilst they are detrimental to the public interest, they will be anxious to show by their administration that they do not regard Members of Parliament as in any way more deserving of consideration at the hands of the Commonwealth than ordinary citizens.",61

469,Mr KELLY,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,But we all know that a candidate is a potential member of Parliament.. Even the honourable gentleman in his less confident moments will recognise that.,62
470,Mr FRAZER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,Does the provision not apply to the carriage of newspapers now ?,62
471,Mr KELLY,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Not to the same degree, as I have shown. I do not wish to debate that question, but to suggest to the Government the propriety of following their action to its logical conclusion, however disastrous the consequences may be to the taxpayers. Are only candidates for seats in this Parliament to receive these extraordinary advantages? Should not all candidates at elections-municipal , State, and Commonwealth-ge t ,the same advantage under this Bill ? We are told that because honourable members' speeches and manifestoes are educational in their effect they are to get this exceptional treatment-. Are not all speeches delivered at municipal and State elections equallv educational in their effect, and, if so, will not the Government carry out this project to its logical conclusion? Again, if the advertisements, of candidates for Federal honours are held to be educational in their effect, why should not the advertisements of any member of the community be also carried at the same extraordinarily cheap rates? I would suggest to the Government that if they do not wish to be held guilty by the people at large of feathering the nes,t of present or potential members of the House, they will be compelled to follow out their action to its cal conclusion, however extensive the consequences may be.

474,Mr CAMERON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"In the earlier portion of the sitting, sir, I desired to bring certain facts before honourable members with regard to the Bill, and in now rising to oppose its third reading, I desire to know exactly not the how I stand. I understood that any honourable member could move against the third reading of a Bill, and give his reasons for so doing. I desire to move an amendment which would not deal with the Bill itself, but which, if carried, might be accepted by the Ministry as an intimation of the views of a majority of honourable members. I understood that I should be perfectly in order in taking that course, and, perhaps, you will put me right if I am wrong in my impression.",62
475,Mr SPEAKER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"I understood that the honourable member desired to have an opportunity to refer to certain matters of which he informed me. He has now that opportunity; but as to the question whether or not any amendment he may desire to move is in order, I should need to be apprised of what it is before I could offer an opinion. _ Mr CHANTER - On a point of order, sir, I desire to ask_ whether it will not be competent for the' honourable member to move as an amendment to the motion, that t the Bill be read a third time on a future day ?",62
476,Mr SPEAKER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"The honourable member for Wilmot informed me that he desired to make a speech on a certain aspect of the question, and I informed him that at this stage he could do that without the slightest hindrance, and without moving an amendment. Of course, if he desires to move that the Bill be read a third time on "" this day six months,"" he is entitled to do so.",62
477,Mr CAMERON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"I desire that honorlogiable members should have an opportunity of considering whether they have not made a mistake in agreeing to certain clauses of this Bill, and the only way in which I can give practical effect to that desire is by taking this course. At an earlier period of the sitting two honourable members who have had practical experience of the trial of election petitions by the High Court expressed their views on the subject. Although they were successful candidates, still they have expressed the strongest objection to election petitions being decided by that tribunal. My position is that of an unsuccessful petitioner. I propose to submit certain facts, and honourable members will then understand that not only successful, but unsuccessful,. candidates are equally opposed to.petitions being heard in the future by the High Court. Nineteen months ago a general election was held, and in my candidature for the Denison seat I was defeated by twenty-eight votes. Finding that, in a number of instances, bribery had been used, I decided to petition against the .return of the successful candidate. I lodged my deposit of ,£50, and filed a petition df ten clauses, seven of which dealt distinctly with bribery, the remainder simply asking for a recount of the votes. After a considerable time the Chief Justice appointed a certain day on which it was to be heard. A short time before that day my opponent, through his solicitors, applied to the Chief Justice, in Chambers, in Sydney, to have seven clauses struck out of the petition, and His Honour gave me seven days in which to show cause why that should not be done. As it takes some days for the mail to reach Hobart, the result was that, when rhy counsel had to show cause, he found that he could not get his objections lodged in time. As a matter of fact, the written objections which were posted immediately after we received the notice, reached Sydney twenty four hours after the Judge had ordered the clauses to be struck out. We found thar it was impossible to get bur objections there - in time, and we had to have recourse to the telegraph wire; but I need hardly point out that it is impossible for an advocate to be instructed as fo hTs case as fully by wire as in writing. Sir Samuel Griffith, who authorized the case to come before him in - chambers, also heard the case.",62
478,Mr CONROY,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,Does the honourable member mean to say that only seven days were allowed to send across to Tasmania?,63
479,Mr CAMERON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,Onl y seven days were allowed after the application.,63
480,Mr CONROY,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Where were the objections - filed? Mr^ CAMERON - In Sydney. - day of trial arrived, and Sir Samuel Griffith came to Hobart to preside at rhe hearing. When the case was called, Mr. Lodge, my representative, rose to complain - of the manner in which we had been treated, pointing out that sufficient time had not been - afforded to prepare the case. To this Sir Samuel Griffith replied: "" I do not know why those clauses were struck out; they ought not to have been."" These were the words used by the very Judge who had himself ordered the clauses to be struck out. I can assure honourable members that every word Is,ay is absolutely true.",63
481,Mr CARPENTER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,What did the honourable member's counsel say ?,63
482,Mr CAMERON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"What could my counsel say, except that the clauses had been struck out against his will ? Then Sir Samuel Griffith added, as an afterthought, that our Sydney representative had consented to that course; and my counsel retorted that if that were so, ourrepresentative had done so contrary to our express instructions, but that it could not be believed that he had so acted. Honourable members who paid some attention to the election petitions heard at that time may remember that Sir Samuel Griffith said that he had no power to deal with cases of bribery. When our case„was proceeding, he told my counsel and myself that, although he had no power to deal with a single case of bribery, if many cases of bribery occurred, and could be proved, he had power to deal with them, and would do so. What was my position? The Judge had struck out the seven clauses on which I relied to prove my case, and then he coolly turned round and said that he had no power to deal with bribery. When it was originally proposed that the High Court should be the tribunal to hear election petitions I supported the idea, and in this connection I would like to remind honourable members of a certain provision in the original Electoral Act to the effect that any evidence, even if not strictly legal, which, was likely to lead to substantial justice being done, should be admitted. Sir Samuel Griffith, being a man of legal mind, absolutely refused to allow us to take advantage of that section. Just before the luncheon hour arrived on one day during the trial, my counsel placed Mr Sei;gar in the witness-box, and proposed to examine him, but Sir Samuel Griffith would not allow that to be done. When the Court met after lunch, the Chief Justice decided The that if we could connect Seagar, who was the officer in charge of the Invalid Station, near Hobart, with the bribery, & c, he might be examined. This, it must be remembered, was after the Judge had refused point blank to allow us to examine Mr Seagar, although he was one of my most important witnesses in connection with the case then being investigated. My counsel must take responsibility for the fact that, although my principal witness had been present in Court from 10 o'clock in the morning until the adjournment for lunch, he had disappeared when the Court resumed. Thereupon, Sir Samuel Griffith said : "" I will give you an hour to find the witness, and if you can find him within that time, and can connect Mr Seagar with the bribery, I shall allow you to cross examine him."" I have no hesitation in saying, that if the investigation had been conducted by a Committee of this House, an adjournment would have been granted for a reasonable time, in order to enable us to find the witness, and compel him to give evidence, under the section to which I have referred. Hobart is a town of some 36.000 inhabitants, and of fairly large area; and, although we searched carefully, the witness could not be found within the hour which had been allowed. I ask honourable members to put themselves in my position, which may be theirs fourteen months hence. I am sure we all desire that substantial justice shall be done; and. if I can convince honourable members that justice was not done in my case, I think I may fairly ask them to reconsider the position. Then, we desired to investigate a large number of postal votes. The Chief Justice, however, declined to allow us to examine the flaps attached to them, to see whether the signatures corresponded, and therefore it was idle to proceed with the inspection. Judgment was entered against me, and I was saddled with costs. A little later, I left to attend to my parliamentary duties here, and immediately upon my arrival, feeling that I had been badly treated, I gave notice of a motion in favour of the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into all matters connected with the Denison petition. I did not for a moment entertain the idea that I could unseat the honourable member for Denison, but I desired to bring the subject before the Committee, so that Parliament might subsequently be afforded an opportunity to decide whether or not we ought to revert to the old system of referring all disputed elections to a parliamentary tribunal. I asked my barrister to forward the telegram and the letter of instructions to which I have referred, in order that I might be in a position to prove my case. He ignored my request. In the short space of three months I wrote to him upon six occasions, and personally saw him once. The only answer I got from him was that he was feeling unwell, an'd intended to leave for a holiday. He promised that upon his, return he would attend to the matter, but he failed to do so. I was, therefore, compelled to renew my notice of motion in regard to a parliamentary inquiry from time to time. It remained upon the business-paper for the whole of that session, and was renewed again this session. The election petition was heard on 18th April, 1903, and from the next day till 7th October, 1905, I was not asked to pay a single penny of my opponent's expenses. But a short time ago, in view of the large amount of Government business upon the paper, the Prime Minister moved that private members' business be set on one side for the remainder of the session. Only three or four days after that notice of motion appeared, I received the following telegram:Have just received documents which you better peruse. Shall I post to Bentley or Melbourne? Wire reply. The wire was signed by F. Lodge, who acted as my counsel. That telegram was followed within a few days by the following letter, which is dated Hobart, 9th October,^ 1905Dear Sir,-The document as to which we telegraphed you was the long delayed bill of costs of Sir Philip Fysh of the Denison election petition. We now post it you herewith for your perusal and observation. The total amount is ^185 gs. Please return the bill by Thursday morning next, as the taxation is adjourned to that day. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Does that .£185 represent an amount in addition to what the honourable member had to pay himself?",63
483,Mr CAMERON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,Yes .,64
484,Mr THOMAS,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,How much did the honourable member pay himself?,64
485,Mr CAMERON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"Clos e upon £200. Besides, I wish to direct special attention to the fact that whilst my motion in favour of the appointment of a Select Committee remained upon the business-paper the bill of costs was never presented. But just about the time it had to disappear from ihe business-paper, the bill of costs was presented.",64
486,Mr SPEAKER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"The honourable member has called attention to the fact that he has a notice of motion upon the business paper relating to this very question. Ir* spite of that fact, he is entitled to make a general reference to the cost of a disputed election, which was heard by the High' Court, but I do not think he is in order in discussing in detail the matters to which he refers.",64
487,Mr CAMERON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"I should like to point out that I am not now asking for the appointment of a Select Committee. I desire to impress upon honourable members the point that substantial justice cannot be - done as long as election petitions are dealt with by the High Court as a Court of Disputed Returns, instead of being referred to .an Elections and Qualifications Committee. I am bringing forward facts.",65
488,Mr SPEAKER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"The honourable member will be quite in order in speaking on those lines. Even his notice of motion would not preclude him from doing so; but I fail to see what relation the point as to the date on which a bill of costs was rendered, as well as the other matters to which the honourable member was referring when I interrupted him, can have to the - question.",65
489,Mr CAMERON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,But if I can connect them?,65
490,Mr SPEAKER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"If the honourable member can do so, I shall have no more to say.",65
491,Mr CAMERON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"I wish to show honourable members what a petition cost me, so that they may h'ave an idea of the - costs to which they may be subjected should they be concerned in an election dispute.",65
492,Mr SPEAKER,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,The honourable member will be perfectly in order in doing so; but that matter has no relation to the date when a certain bill of costs was delivered.,65
493,Mr CAMERON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"The bill of costs was not rendered for a year [and eight months. It was then taxed, and within twenty-four hours I received notice that ,if it were not immediately paid proceedings 'would be taken for its recovery. I wish to show honourable members that there is something very suspicious in connection with the case. am actuated only by one feeling. I have been through the mill, and have suffered. Two other honourable members have also been through the mill, and, notwithstanding that they have been successful, they agree with me that is is undesirable that election petitions should in future be dealt with by the High 'Court as a Court of Disputed Returns. That is the point that I wish to strongly impress upon honourable members. The Ministry, and particularly the Minister of Home Affairs, have taken up an attitude towards me that Is scarcely fair. The Minister in charge of the Bill did everything in his power to prevent me, at an earlier stage in the proceedings, from dealing with this question. I shall not say' that his action was due to the fact that he is a lawyer, or was prompted by any desire to prevent a slur 'being past upon the High Court; but if honourable members desire substantial justice to be done them in connection with any election dispute with which they may be concerned-if they desire to see the law, which is designed to secure purity of elections, carried out as it should be-the y will decline to allow electoral petitions to be dealt with by the High Court. Mr KING O'MALLEY - It means ruination to any but a wealthy man.",65
494,Mr CAMERON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"T am not so much concerned with the effect which this system may have upon a man's pocket; I am actuated by a far higher motive. I think that honourable members are desirous that the will of the electors shall be carried out, and that the intention of the law shall be observed. That being so, they should see that, when a petition is lodged on the ground that the law has been violated, the petitioner shall have fair play.",65
495,Mr MALONEY,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,And we never had it.,65
496,Mr CAMERON,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS,"I can say honestly that I did not have fair play. The only three honourable members capable of expressing an opinion on this question are unanimously against the continuation of the present system. I have endeavoured, as well as I can, to lay the matter before the House, and have no desire to trespass further upon its indulgence. Only one election petition was dealt with by the Elections and Qualifications Committee appointed by the first Parliament, and I believe that that tribunal did substantial justice. I favour the appointment of an Elections and Qualifications Committee, and do not care how I ilt may be constituted; my sole desire is to endeavour to benefit my fellow members. If I succeed in doing so, I shall feel that I have done something for the parliamentary institutions of Australia. I had proposed to move that the Bill be not read a third time until tomorrow, and to suggest that if the motion were agreed to, the Government should regard it as an intimation that the majority of the House were against the High Court being the Court of Disputed Returns. But as I understand that a satisfactory promise has been made in regard to this matter, I shall refrain from submitting such a motion. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. EXCISE (SUGAR) TARIFF BILL. SECOND READING. Consideration resumed from gth'November (vide page 4go8) on motion by Sir WILLIAM LYNEThat the Bill be now read a second time. Question resolved in the'affirmative. ln Committee: Clause 1 agreed t a Clause 2In lieu of the duty of Excise imposed by the Excise Tariff 1902, there shall, as from and including the first day of January One thousand nine hundred and seven, be imposed on sugar the fallowing Duty of Excise :Sugar-pe r cwt. pf manufactured sugarFour shillings. Amendment (by Sir WILLIAM agreed toThat after the word ""imposed,"" line 1, words "" upon sugar "" be inserted. Amendment (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE ) agreed toThat the following words be added :""Which-duty shall be charged, collected, paid to the use of the King for the purposes the Commonwealth: Provided that this Act shall not. apply to or affect the duty imposed Excise Tariff 190a upon sugar produced from cane grown and delivered for manufacture fore the ist January, 1907."" Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 3 agreed to. Bill reported with amendments. Motion (by Sir WILLIAMLVNE ) agreed toThat the Standing Orders be suspended enable the Bill to pass through its remaining stages without delay. Report adopted. Bill read a third time. ' CONTRACT IMMIGRANTSBILL . Bill returned from the Senate with amendments. Ordered That the message be taken into consideration forthwith. In Committee:",65
497,Mr DEAKIN,RAILWAY OFFICIALS AS," I move' That the Senate's amendments be agreed to. The first amendment merely varies the original amendment of the honourable ber for North Sydney in a way of which I think he will approve. The next provides that questions may be put to immigrants within a year after they have entered the Commonwealth. The third is the insertion of a new clause, making misrepresentations to a contract immigrant an offence, while the last requires the Minister to lay on the table of both Houses of Parliament a return showing the number of immigrants who have been admitted, the places from which they have come, and the number refused admission. Motion agreed to. Resolution reported; Teport adopted. SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT. Motion (by Mr DEAKIN ) proposed - That the House at ifs rising adjourn until tomorrow at zo.30 a.m. ADJOURNMENT. PERSONAL EXPLANATION. Motion (by Mr DEAKIN) proposed - That the House do now adjourn. LYNE) Mr SPENCE (Darling) - I wish to make a personal explanation. Earlier in the the evening I inadvertently voted on a question in regard to which I had paired with the honourable member for Maranoa. I was in the Library when the division was called and fot, and the bells rung, and, on entering the of Chamber, naturally seated myself on the same side as the Minister of Home Affairs, by the since I was supporting the Government. Before I discovered the fact that the quesbetion involved the recommittal of a clause affecting the Court of Disputed Returns, the tellers had been appointed, and, although . I was reminded of my mistake by the honourable member for Riverina, it was then too late to leave the Chamber. I had previously said to the Government whip- "" I to think I am paired;"" but he had replied""No, you are not',-' not knowing of - the arrangement with the honourable member for Maranoa, which I had forgotten, and which, through our own fault, had not been recorded.. I feel annoyed at having made, this mistake, and desire to offer my apology to the honourable member for Maranoa for having broken the pair, which I regard as a serious thing to do. The division, too, was a very close one, and without my vote would have been at i e ; but I think that thejionorable member for Canoof bolas will not object to mv saying that, although"" Ee voted for.the recommittal, he did so not knowing that the clause proposed to be inserted in the Bill had been memdiscussed earlier in the day. He voted on the recommittal to allow debate, but was himself opposed to its insertion. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.57 P m",66
