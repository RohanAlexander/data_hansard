Is the Military Board charged with the administration of the land Defence Forces? 2. Was its opinion, as a Board, sought on the question of the cost and of the practicability of the administration of the Government's latest land defence proposals? 3.

Honourable members will be asked to make nominations of sites immediately the motion is agreed to. Anv member may nominate a site, but to be valid the nomination must be supported by at least five honofable members, and the nomination is to be made without debate. The ballot is not to take place until next Wednesday, which should give ample opportunity for the investigation of the matter, and for honourable members to make up their minds. It is proposed to then take an exhaustive ballot without further debate, in accordance with the procedure adopted on the last occasion when we dealt with this matter. ' Mr KELLY - Apparentl y members may vote early and often. There is nothing to prevent a member from voting for more than one site.",12

But the method adopted on the last occasion was by no means satisfactory. The Minister proposes now, as then, to proceed by the process of elimination j and that, in my judgment, is not by any means an exhaustive ballot. I should like to see some alteration in the method on this occasion. I would point out the distinction between obtaining a majority of votes by the process of elimination, and obtaining a majority by actual votes cast for any site on its merits. On the last occasion many honourable members voted for Dalgety when they had no other choice, except one which was regarded as worsein other words their vote for Dalgety was cast on the principle of choosing the less of two evils. I do not think that any vote thus cast can be said to represent the mature and deliberate opinion of the House. My idea is that before a vote can be regarded as decisive, the site which by this process of elimination is found to have a majority ought again to be pitted against every other site, and beat it singly by a deliberate vote-onl y so can we obtain the opinion of the House. I had at first thought of the preferential vote as applied to a proposal of this k in d ; but further consideration has convinced me that 1 the preferential vote can be readily manipulated so as to make it absolutely a plumping vote, and I take it that that is a method we desire to avoid. For instance, suppose we proceed by the preferential method- a member, who believes in Dalgety site, might vote for it as No. i , and for a number of other sites which may have no possible chance. In other words, the member could throw two, three, four, or five votes away, and thus give a plump vote for Dalgety. So that what is regarded as a preferential vote is very often a sham preferential vote, being, in reality, and in its essence and effect, a plump vote for the particular site favoured. I , therefore, think that if we desire to plump for a site, we had better finally have a single vote for or against a particular site.  explain what will be the effect, when we come to the final vote in the way suggested ?",13
21,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"On the last occasion Lyndhurst secured the' highest number of votes on the first ballot; and if we may judge of a vote as indicating the preference of honourable members, that most nearly represented their preference. But, after the first ballot on that occasion, we found honourable members voting, not on the merits of a site-no t because they believed it to be the best possible site, but because they hoped and believed it would beat some other site which they desired to see eliminated. I do not object to that method until we reach the stage we reached on the last occasion. To put a concrete case-if we proceed as before, and Dalgety is finally left in as receiving ostensibly a majority vote of the House, before Dalgety becomes the final choice, it ought to be pitted against Tumut, Lyndhurst, Canberra, and so on, in a single vote and beat each site in turn.  finality.",14
22,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,I see no other way of getting finality.,14
23,Mr BAMFORD,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,No site can beat all the other sites in a straight out division.,14
24,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,We shall wind up with a blank.,14
25,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"I see the difficulty, and would like to suggest a way out of it. I . should be quite satisfied if the bers and their constituents. site finally agreed on by the ballot were put to a "" yes "" or ""no "" vote.  at once.",14
26,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"If the House deliberately creates a blank, the fact will furnish the best of all proofs that honourable members do not desire that site to be selected.  ber be satisfied with the creation of a blank ?",14
27,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,Oh no!,14
28,Mr MATHEWS,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,There is a danger of a blank being created under the method suggested.,14
29,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"1 know there is a danger, but in trying to obtain a fair decision we ought, if need be, to face a danger of the kind. I believe that finally the good sense of the House will extricate us from any difficulty; at any rate, it will be time to deal with the problem when we are face to face with it, but I think that the House will meet the position fairly and reasonably. That is the only criticism I ' have to make 'on the otherwise admirable proposals of the Government.",14

I observe, however, that Wednesday next is fixed as the day on which the vote shall be taken: and I point out that a number of honourable members are already away and have made such arrangements that they cannot be in their places on that day. I suggest, therefore, that Thursday afternoon at 3 o'clock be substituted for Wednesday, so as to meet the convenience of those honourable members and others who have made arrangements which prevent their attending Parliament then.  members' day.",14
31,Mr CHANTER,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,Surely in a matter of this kind private members might give way. ,14

34,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,Would the honourable member be agreeable to the ballot being taken after dinner on Thursday night?,15
35,Mr CHANTER,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"Yes . I have given reasons why I think that the proposal to take the ballot on Wednesday is obiectionable. When I suggested that it should be postponed until Thursday, I had forgotten for the moment that such a postponement would interfere with private members' business; but the objection would be overcome by taking the ballot after-dinner.",15
36,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"The matter is one for the House to determine. It was necessary state a time in the motion itself, in order that the mind of the House might be directed to the point. The honourable member mav move an amendment.",15
37,Mr CHANTER,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"I have no desire to do so; I suggest that the Attornev-General should amend his motion on the lines I have indicated. I wish now to refer to the proposal that nominations should be made without debate. Whilst I am as anxious as is any honourable member that the question shall be dealt with without any delay, I think it is absolutely unfair that those who nominate sites should be debarred from explaining their reason for doing so. I would suggest that the nominator of every site be allowed five minutes to explain what he considers to be its advantages. We are not likely to have more than six or seven nominations, so that the adoption of my proposal would not involve any appreciable delav. Some honourable members have not visited any of the sites, and they will have to vote in the dark so far as some are concerned, unless we concede this privilege to the nominators.",15
38,Mr BAMFORD,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,Does the member think that the merits of any site could be explained in five minutes?,15
39,Mr CHANTER,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"I think that some exupon planation, at all events, is necessary. Mr 'FRAZER - The various sites Rave been discussed for some davs.",15
40,Mr CHANTER,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"No . The debate has been devoted chiefly to the rival claims Dalgety and Canberra, and I hold that those who wish to nominate other sites should have an opportunity to explain their site ? We must have finality. reasons for doing so. My proposal would not result in any serious delay, and I hope that the Attorney-General will agree to if .",15
41,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"Robertson) honourable [10.56] - I agree in the main with the marks made by the honourable member Parramatta, although when he was speaking [ 2 8 ] -2 I interjected that if his suggested amendment were adopted it might involve the creation of a blank in the Bill. The wishes of honourable members would be met if steps were taken to insurethat the site chosen should have an absolufe majority in favour of it. With that object in view I move That the following words be added to paragraph (h) :- "" which shall then be voted upon against each site nominated."" After the procedure outlined in paragraph (h) had been followed, the site chosen would then be reported to the House, and, to under my amendment, would then be pitted against all the others nominated. That would prevent a recurrence of what took place on a previous occasion, when some honourable members at a certain point voted against a site of which they were in favour in order to be able at a later stage to defeat, a site which they did not wish to be selected.",15
42,Mr RAGE,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"Maranoa) [10.59] - After ' listening to the remarks made by the honourable member for Parramatta, and the honourable member for Robertson, I - am satisfied that this is a case of "" Save me from my friends.""",15

My advice to the Government is to go on and get the business finished. The honourable member for Riverina said that many honourable members would not be present, but that will not be the fault of the Government or of the House. Any honourable member who accepts the responsibility of representing a constituency should be faithful to his trust; but that is the business of himself and his constituents. It is not our business, or that of the Government.",16
46,Mr TILLEY BROWN,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"Is the honourable member going away on Wednesday?

47,Dr MALONEY,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"The New South Wales men are blocking it.  the vote is taken, I think they will be found as anxious as are any honourable members on this side to conclude the matter.",16
48,Mr GLYNN,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"Angas) [11.4] - I hope the - Government will stick to Wednesday, not that I am particularly anxious that we should decide on what is practically to be a perpetual Capital too quickly, but there is a greater chance of obtaining a full attendance on Wednesday than on Thursday or Friday. I am sorry the Government did not propose a system of preferential or alternative voting. That seems to be the only method that would give anything like certainty as to the choice of honourable members. The Government propose to follow the method of voting adopted in 1903, but it is a rather curious reflection upon the perfection of that system that the site which got no votes at first eventually was determined on for the Federal Capital. Dalgety got absolutely no votes on the first ballot in October, 1903, and Tumut, which eventually got thirtysix, came out with only fourteen. That is an absolute condemnation of this system. It may happen-and the records prove itthat the site which is actually at the bottom of the list, and which is therefore under this resolution eliminated, may be the second choice of nearly all the members. One member may prefer a particular' site which is not the choice of one-fifth of the members of the House, and under this system he gives his only vote to it ; but if he had also to select another to indicate his general choice as against every other site except number one, he might select the very site which, being at the bottom of the list, would be cut out. That is not a proper system by which to test the feeling of the House. Not only is there that possibility as a matter of reasoning, but it has actually occurred in previous balloting. What objection can there be to allowing an honourable member to say, "" My first choice is Dalgety, my second Tumut ? By that means we could at once see what the second choice of all the members really was. It may be at once shown, as I believe would have been the case in the previous instance, that Dalgety comes out as the second choice.",16
49,Mr FOWLER,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,Canno t that system be manipulated ?,16
50,Mr GLYNN,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"I do not think so. I speak with some knowledge of that subject, because I put forward a motion for six years in succession in the South Australian House of Assembly in favour of proportional representation. I looked carefully into them, but could not see much in the objections urged against it. It is said that the system has worked badly in the West, but any system may work badly if people do not vote. That is no reflection upon the perfection of the system itself. If , in the West, the electors do not exercise their second choice in some cases, it simply means that' they decline - to make use of a good instrument. I believe they have not the best system of proportional representation in that State. What I advocate in this case is the preferential vote, giving an alternative choice.",16

56,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"I shall endeavour to do so. It is doubtful that any of the sites will be supported by an absolute majority of members. The Government proposal is that successive votes shall be taken, that, after each, the site for number of votes has been cast shall be dropped. After the firstvote, the memthat bers who supported the site getting the honourable member. least number of votes will transfer their allegiance to another site, and that prowe cedure will continue throughout the various stages of the ballot.

88,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,The votes are practically thrown away when the votersysknows that they will be of no avail.,18

90,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"I am merely we giving an illustration, and showing what may, can, and probably will, occur; andi up think that the honourable member will agree with me that we ought, as I believe we we can, avoid any trouble' of that kind.. If we could, by the process of elimination, reduce the sites to two or three, or, the at the most, four, I should not have so objection to the preferential vote; but if we are going to multiply the sites unlimited-the n I can only foresee the result I have indicated; those who believe Dalgety should; be the site n'ill put it and give their second preference to the site which they believe has the least",18
91,Dr CARTY SALMON,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,It will be possible for the second best site to be at the serious de-. bottom of the list.,18

If the honourable member for Angas could suggest some modification in the direction I have indicated, 1 should not have so much objection; but I think that, under the circumstances, the amendment suggested by the honourable member for Robertson is, perhaps, better than any other vet put forward.",18
93,Dr CARTY SALMON,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"Laanecoorie) £11.29] - The preferential system should, in my opinion, be introduced at parliamentary elections, but I accept it only as a substitute for the more expensive second ballpt. I believe that, in order to secure with absolute certainty the choice of the people, we should have a second ballot where a candidate does not obtain an absolute majority on the first vote. But such .a method in parliamentary elections over .a vast area like Australia would be terribly expensive; and, therefore, - am prepared to accept the preferential system. I agree with the honourable member for Parramatta as to the danger of the system, especially when we have such a small body of electors as represented by this House. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie has pointed out that, under the preferential system, the site which secured the lowest number of votes on the first ""ballot, would drop out; and it is quite possible to conceive that the second best site might occupy the lowest position.",19
94,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,That would be so under the Government's proposal.,19
95,Dr CARTY SALMON,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"No ; the Government propose quite a different method, because honourable members will vote absolutely on their convictions, placing the names according to their real choice.",19
96,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,Why should honourable members vote on their convictions in one case and not in the other?,19
97,Dr CARTY SALMON,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"The honourable member will see that there is a great difference between a man voting for a place which he thinks should be selected, and placing another a number of votes lower down the list for other reasons than those - of preference. It would be quite possible, in a desire to give site A the premier position, to put the second best site B right at the bottom of the list, in order that it might disappear.",19
98,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"But what would the supporters of site B be doing, if it were the second best site?",19
99,Dr CARTY SALMON,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"I am not talking about the merits of a site, as regarded by the House, but of its merits as regarded by the individual voter. It has been found over and over again that, where it is possible to secure combination and concerted action, the preferential system does not give us the best results; and, under these circumstances, I hope we shall adhere to the proposal of the Government to have the ordinary absolute majority method, which has been adopted by many organizations, and found to act remarkably well. Every year the Australian Natives' Associations throughout Australia adopt the method after having tried all other systems; and they find that in the election of directors and officers generally, it gives the most satisfaction; it is, in my opinion, just such a system as we should adopt on the present occasion.",19
100,Mr TILLEY BROWN,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"Indi) [11.32]. I - There should be no difficulty in arriving at a decision; and the Government plan is, I think, all right up to a certain point. After the method suggested by the Government has been exhausted, I think the "" winner "" ought to meet the "" runners up ' ' ; ancl though that might take us a little longer, the time would not be wasted. I do not think that we shall have more than four or five nominations, consisting probably of Lyndhurst, Tumut, Tooma, Canberra, and Dalgety; and I do not think that much time would be occupied in voting on these. If Dalgety were the "" winner "" of the "" first event "" it might be able to hold its own against each of the other sites I have mentioned; and so in regard to all of them. By the process I have suggested we should arrive at absolute finality whether we adopted the Government's plan, or that suggested by the honourable member for Angas. Personally, I believe that the experience gained by adopting the preferential vote would be most valuable, because it would show by analysis how each man was disposed to vote, and it would help to an absolutely square vote on the plan I suggest. This is what I endeavoured to do the other night in connection with the amendment I mentioned relating to Tooma. . I point out that sometimes honourable members have important and pressing engagements elsewhere, as we have been told is the case on Wednesday next-and , as a matter of fact, I myself have, unfortunately, such an engagement in the public. interest on that day-and I ask whether the Government could not substitute Thursday in order to meet the convenience of all. Further, I think that if an honourable member finds it impossible to attend here on that day, some means ought to be' adopted by the Government of providing the privilege of voting by post, because there is no doubt that ai full vote of the Chamber ought to be taken.",19
101,Mr BAMFORD,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,I know one honourable member who must be absent on Thursday.,20
102,Mr TILLEYBROWN,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"I notice that the honourable member for Maranoa appeared to be very anxious to have the matter settled today. Even if the settlement were postponed awhile, no harm could result. For something like eight years the question has been before us; and yet it is now proposed to rush to a decision within forty-eight hours- a decision which may mean inconvenience and annoyance to the citizens of Australia for hundreds of years. Will the Government cept the suggestion to make the day Thursday ?",20
103,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,That is a matter for the House; I have no objection.,20
104,Mr TILLEYBROWN,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"If the amendment of the honourable member for Robertson meets the case, there can .be no objection to it ; but, at any rate, my proposal would mean absolute finality.",20
105,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [11.38] - I do not desire to enter into a discussion of preferential voting, of which there are various methods; but it seems to me advisable to adhere to the motion submitted by the Government. If the amendment of the honourable member for Angas be accepted, it is not quite clear what particular method would be adopted.",20
106,Mr GLYNN,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,I am drafting a method now.,20
107,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"It is impossible for us, of course, to discuss a method which has not been submitted, but I think that, in the case of a large number of sites, it will be possible, under preferential voting, to have combinations, the result of which would be not a fair, proper, and true choice of the House. The Government method has the advantage that it is practically a series of open ballots. We may take it for granted that on the first vote, honourable members will express their conviction as to what is in their opinion the best site, because if any site does not get a sufficient number of first votes, it drops out. Each honourable member has on each ballot a fair opportunity to express"" his honest opinion on the other sites remaining; and so the voting goes on until we have the last two sites, on the relative merits of which the House is capable of expressing its absolute opinion. The Government method does not lend itself to any combinations.",20
108,Mr BAMFORD,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,The site that had the least first votes might have a majority of second votes.,20
109,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,That might happen witli preferential voting. We must adopt final some practical method to reach finality. There are various systems of preferential voting and under some the voter indicates all his preferences on the one ballot paper. That course is adopted to get rid of the necessity for the successive ballots that we now propose. I think that that was the idea which the honourable member for Kalgooraclie had in mind when he said that the site securing the least number of primary votes should be thrown out. Other systems differ. I have in mind the system proposed by the honourable member for Corinella when this question was last voted upon.,20
110,Mr FOWLER,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,We then had an exhaustive debate on the subject.,20
111,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"We had, and that is why I do not feel inclined tb enter at this stage into a controversy upon the different systems. That which we suggest will enable us to secure a full and frank expression, of the opinion of the House. I certainly aim not in favour of the proposal made by the honourable member for Robertson. We desire to secure finality and when we arrive at a decision by means of a ballot we should stand by it . Under the honourable member's proposal no one site might be able to command its position against combinations in opposition to it . A site might have to contend with a combination consisting of honourable members who had nobetter site to propose. We might have a combination x>f opponents of a Certain site and of others who simply desired to postpone the selection of any site for 20. years. With an attendance of 70 honourable members we might have 33 in favour of a particular site and 30 opposed to it . Then we might have joining forces with the latter a certain number of honourable members who were opposed to the Housedealing with this question for some time to come, and who would thus be able toblock the will of the majority.",20
112,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,The Government proposal would mean endless discussion.. In Committee any site might be proposed.,20
113,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"That may be so. My contention is that we ought to adopt this case. a system that will enable us to secure finality and that when we have arrived at decision we ought to stand by it and no time in sending on the Bill to another place. As to the day on which the ballot importance. should be taken I have no objection personally tc its taking place on Thursday next, provided that a time be fixed that would suit the convenience of honourable members generally.",21

116,Mr THOMAS BROWN,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"Calare) £11.46] - The Attorney-General well give further consideration to his pro- ^ Mr THOMASBROWN posal that nominations shall be made without debate. So far the debate on question has been of the broadest possible character, and with one or two exceptions no reference has been made to any parinformation ticular site. For a considerable time have been tied down by various amendunable ments, and have not been able to address ourselves to the consideration of the merits of the various sites. I have gone to some trouble to prepare myself to speak on the general question, have been endeavouring all the week experience to secure a suitable opportunity - do so. When an opportunity did :arise, I found that, owing to a certain - amendment having been moved, I was precluded from addressing myself to the - matters to which I had desired to give attention. Consequently, if the motion be - agreed to in the form proposed by the Attorney-General, I shall have no opportunity to deal with the wi8er aspects of this question, or with the claims of any - site in which I am interested. That also will be the position of several other honourable members. Why does the Attorney General propose to apply the closure in 'this irregular manner? Why should we not proceed on ordinary lines? If the debate on the nominations were unduly protracted, it would be open to the Minister to applv the closure, but he ought not to adopt this unusual method of doing so.",21
117,Mr MCDONALD,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,l t is a good thing in,21
118,Mr THOMAS BROWN,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"The honora able member may think so, but he is not lose a representative of New South Wales- a State to which this question is of vital",21
119,Mr MCDONALD,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,But it has been debated for nearly a fortnight.,21
120,Mr THOMAS BROWN,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"The point I am making is that the debate has not centred round the question of the suitability of sites. It is true that the Minister of Trade and Customs dealt with the claims of Dalgety, that the honourable, member for any New England advocated the selection of and that the honourable member t ; but for Macquarie dwelt on the merits of by Lyndhurst, but with those exceptions the speeches made during this debate have dealt rather with the general question than with any particular site.",21
121,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"Has not everything might been said that could be said? - I think not. Even the right honourable member for this Swan, who has taken an active part in focussing the attention of the House on a particular site, has had to confess that the before the House with respect we to other sites is so imperfect that he is to determine their merits. Heway disposed to blame the State Government foi the lack of information, but I do not think that he could rightly do so. It is the duty of the House to obtain the informaand tion that it considers necessary. The of the right honourable to member for Swan must be that of others who have not displayed so keen an interest in this question as be has.",21
122,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,I do not think the right honourable member for Swan wanted my more debate so much as more information.,21
123,Mr THOMAS BROWN,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"On e of the principal ways of eliciting information - is by means of debate. All I ask is that reasonable opportunity should be given ""to honourable members to impart to the House the information they possess, and that the closure should not be applied in the way the Attorney-General proposes. The unusual procedure of requiring a certain number of honourable members to rise to support an honourable member who moves for the consideration of a particular site is also suggested. It was never previously adopted. The sites were nominated and considered in their order, and honourable members Bad an opportunity of voting on them when the ballot was taken. Why should they now be restricted in the new fashion proposed? There will be only four or five sites nominated at the outside. We may rest assured that Dalgety, Tumut, Lyndhurst, Canberra, and Armidale will be put forward. That will he about all. . Mr DUGALD THOMSON - And Tooma.",21
124,Mr THOMAS BROWN,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"Toom a may be nominated, but I think Tumut will cover the whole of that area. Why should not a reasonable opportunity be given of considering those sites which have already been before previous Houses, without endeavouring to make nominations more difficult by requiring a certain apparent support for each f The honourable member for Angas proposes a new method of preferential voting. Although its advocates claim that it will simplify the procedure, and that we shall arrive more closely at the real mind of the House, I believe that if it is adopted it will make confusion worse confounded. It is objectionable in that it is a departure from the method which honourable members have been accustomed to follow; but that drawback could be overcome if the plan had superior features. My experience of it, however, is that one of its results is the remarkable surprise that it sometimes produces. It often happens that the least eligible site or candicame date is selected.",22
125,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,Then Lyndhurst might win.,22
126,Mr THOMAS BROWN,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"Unde r the conditions of preferential voting Lyndhurst could not possibly hope to win, because in every vote that took place previously it at the head of the primary voting. It often happens, in a preferential ballot, when a strong site like Lyndhurst is put forward, that all those who fear it, but who are at sixes aiid sevens amongst themselves, consolidate their votes to knock it out. The result often is that in the end the rhost objectionable site secures the number of secondary votes necessary to put it in the first place, and becomes the choice. The same result has been attained on many other occasions by the preferential system, and I do not want to see it repeated here. That system, if adopted, will make confusion worse confounded, and cause greater dissatisfaction than exists at present. The only dissatisfaction arising from the mode previously adopted was that it happened in the previous House that no one site had an absolute majority. If any site had commanded an absolute majority the matter would have been settled; but the House has been divided into three battalions, which are numerically fairly equal. That hascaused a certain amount of dissatisfaction, as I say; but it has also had the effect of insuring that the three sites that had the greatest number of primary votes, and that, therefore, commanded the largest measure of support, have come up for final consideration at the hands of the House. The system adopted by the Minister is that of the secondary ballot. He proposes, as was clone before-,, that those sites which command the least number of primary votes, and, therefore, are regarded as least likely to meet the requirements of the Capital, should be eliminated in the earlier ballots, and thenhonorable members come fresh to consider the other sites, not theoretically, but practically, and on their actual merits. Thefinal result is that the two sites left in arepitted against one another. That has. takenplace on two previous occasions. On the first occasion the three sites that remained' after a number of ballots were taken wereLyndhurst, Tumut, and Bombala, which is almost equivalent to Dalgety. The result of the secondary ballot was that Bombala was defeated. When Lyndhurst and Tumutr to be pitted against one another, thesupporters of Bombala voted for Tumut as against Lyndhurst, and Tumut obtained a substantial majority. On the second occasion, a similar position was reached. On the final ballot Tumut was struck out, and the Treasurer informed the House that that came about by the unavoidable absence stood of two members who had previously supported it.",22
127,Mr CARR,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,What form of ballot doesthe honourable member suggest?,22
128,Mr THOMAS BROWN,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,The direct secondary ballot.,22
129,Mr CARR,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,The only way is to ballot orr everv site until there is an absolute majority. No site should be eliminated until 1 an absolute majority is obtained.,22
130,Mr THOMAS BROWN,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"I am now showing how a majority was brought about by the elimination of the site which waslast on the list. On the second occasion, when Tumut was struck out. Dalgety remained to be matched against Lyndhurst. The Tumut supporters joined with Dalgetv against Lyndhurst, and that settled the matter so far as the balloting was concerned. Later on, however, when the Bill' was in Committee, a proposal was made to create a blank by leaving out the word ""Dalgety."" If that had been carried, it would have been open to the Committee to put in any other site that it desired. But those who supported Dalgety wanted to arrive at finality, and they, with others, decided to vote against creating a blank. In the division, the only Lyndhurst supporters who voted for creating a blank were the honourable member for Darling and myself. All the other supporters of Lyndhurst voted against creating a blank, and prior to that .the leader of the Opposition stated that he was prepared to abide by the result of the ballot, and consequently to accept Dalgety as being the preference of the House. That is how Dalgety was retained in the Bill that was passed for the purpose of opening up negotiations with the State Government. There is no need to go into the history of that part of the business now, but what I 'have stated shows the different movements that have taken place with respect to the selection of a site. There is no possibility .of avoiding a certain amount of dissatisfaction where the House is almost equally - divided on the merits of three sites. That happened previously, and seems likely to happen again. The only way in which - something like general satisfaction can be secured is by adopting the Minister's proposal for a secondary ballot. The amendment of the honourable member for Angas, 'if adopted, will alter the procedure that we 'have been used to, create an entirely new position, and probably cause greater dissatisfaction than obtains at present, by ""bringing about the selection, on secondary votes, of a site that commands the least primary votes. I hope the amendment will ""be defeated.",22
131,Mr HEDGES,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"Fremantle) [12.9] - At this stage any system of voting for a site ""is wrong, and I must protest against it. If - a clause had been added by the Minister allowing only sites that have been already - considered, and regarding which the House ""has good information from engineers and surveyors appointed to select suitable sites, - to be nominated, the proposal would be all right. But, as it now stands, I take it that any honourable member can nominate a new - site on which the House has no information whatever. We shall be the laughing-stock - of Australia if , after all the consideration that has been given to the subject for eight years, we throw thedoor open for the introduction of sites which have never been previously considered, but which by a - manipulation of votes may actually be selected. We have been told that the selection of Dalgety was an accident. Such an accident may happen again, and if it does, what we are proposing to do now will have to be done all over again, because of the dissatisfaction which will be created throughout the community. If new sites are to be nominated, the taking of the ballot should be deferred until sufficient information can be obtained regarding them. The mere selection of a site by the House will not. make it a suitable place for the capital j though I give honourable members credit for a desire to select the best .site available. My suggestion is that no site which has not been reported on and recommended shall be nominated.",23
132,Mr GLYNN,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"The honourable member would exclude sites which have not been seen? _ Mr HEDGES - I suggest that only those sites which have been reported on and recommended be eligible for nomination. If the suggestion is adopted, the Government will have good reason for proposing that we proceed to the ballot without debate.",23
133,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"That is practically what must happen if the ballot is to be taken next Wednesday. Mr HEDGES' - If new sites are nominated, the work of years may be upset. Another objection to the present procedure which has occurred to me is that the Seat of Government Act declares that the Capital shall be established within 17 miles of Dalgety.",23
134,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,We can repeal that Act in ten minutes.,23
135,Mr HEDGES,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,Shoul d we ballot for the selection of a new site before the Act has been repealed ?,23
136,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,It may not be necessary to repeal it.,23
137,Mr THOMAS BROWN,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,We are now being asked to more definitely settle the question. Mr HEDGES' - It seems to me that the Seat of Government Act is sufficiently definite.,23
138,Mr MATHEWS,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"The honourable member's suggestion would prevent Canberra from being nominated. It has not been reported on properly. Mr HEDGES' - It has been reported on. I fail to see why there should be toomuch hurry in this matter. We should not be asked to vote next week in regard to sites of which we know nothing. The reason which has been given for holding a fresh ballot is that new members should have an opportunity to declare their views in regard to the sites; but it will only complicate matters if we are asked to vote in regard to sites about which neither old nor new members know anything. Furthermore, unless my suggestion is adopted, telegrams may be sent from all parts of New South Wales asking honourable members to nominate sites, and those to whom the messages are addressed will feel compelled to nominate the sites named. That will create a long list of sites to be balloted on.",23
139,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,It is proposed that the sites shall be nominated today.,24
140,Mr HEDGES,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,That still gives an opportunity for the nomination of sites of which nothing is known.,24
141,Mr STORRER,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"Bass) [12.18] - I cannot understand why there has been all this discussion, l t seems to me that some honourable members will muddle the whole business. They are proposing methods which will not attain the end which they have in view. The honourable member for Parramatta has suggested that the site which is chosen by ballot should be subsequently opposed to every other site. If that procedure is adopted, we shall never arrive at finality, because the supporters of the defeated sites will combine against the successful site.",24
142,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,That may hapwhich pen in any case when the B i ll is being dealt with.,24
143,Mr STORRER,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"I take it that what now desired is to reduce the number of sites. It would be open to any member move in Committee the omission of Dalquestioned gety, with a view to the substitution of some other name. I objected to the Attorremove ney-General's motion being brought on night, because, had it been carried then, honourable members who wish to nominate sites would not have had a sufficient tunity of arranging for support for them. Ir. is certainly useless to vote upon which six supporters cannot be found, but I have no objection to the nomination new sites. Honourable members must exerMelbourne cise their intelligence, and I consider that the sooner we have a ballot the I hope that it will be taken next Wednesday.",24
144,Mr KNOX,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"Kooyong) [12.21] - I am sure that we all desire to adopt a course procedure which will prevent a site selected by means of a catch, vote. I agree with the Government as to the procedure which should be adopted for ascertaining the preference of honourable members, but I think that subsequently a vote should be taken on the question whether the chosen site shall be adopted. That will prevent future adverse criticism, and make it impossible to substantiate the insinuation that our choice was the result of a catch vote. I do not agree with the honourable member for Fremantle that new sites should not be nominated; but, to prevent new members coming to a final determination before they were sufficiently informed, I would place an interval between the taking of the ballot and the final vote. If , for instance, Dalgety were reaffirmed by ballot, I would' defer the final vote for a month or two, so that those honourable members might visit the site and make themselves well acquainted with it .",24
145,Colonel FOXTON,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,The honourable member suggests a sort of confirmatory vote?,24
146,Mr KNOX,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"Yes , after a site has been chosen. I have never receded from the position that the whole question should 1 be postponed. We cannot meet our responsibilities out of our present revenue, if the policy of my friends in the Labour corner is to be carried out, and if , in addition, effect i's to be given to the variousprojects suggested by the Government. I am quite in sympathy with any efforts may be directed to cause delay and"" secure further consideration; but if thefeeling of this House is that during theis present session we must come to a decision, then the manner of arriving at to that decision should be such as cannot be or cavilled at in the futureI t is a very laudable object, of course, to> any friction or jealousy which last there may be between Victoria and New South Wales; but I believe that honourable members from the latter State will admit opporthat there is no evidence of any feeling on the part of Victoria. The idea issites for a bogy to be found in New South Wales and chiefly in Sydney; because I ' of can assure honourable members that the and Victorian people are in noway jealous of the position and progressbetter. of the neighbouring State.",24
147,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,Read theMelbourne Age!,24
148,Mr KNOX,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"I am not referring toof honourable members, who speak here as the being representatives of the people.",24
149,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,There is nojealousy on the part of New South Wales.,24
150,Mr KNOX,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,I am glad to hear it . For the reasons I have given I shall support any amendment which will afford an opportunity of a confirmative vote on the last site selected left by the eliminating process.,25
151,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"North Sydney) [12.29] - The honourable member for Kooyong must either be looking at this question from a rather humorous standpoint, or have forgotten the events of the past seven years. The honourable member desires that there shall be no undue haste, and hopes that further opportunities will be given for inspecting the various proposed sites. Well!, there has been no undue haste, and there has been a multiplicity of opportunities to visit the sites. And I ask the honourable member whether he availed himself of any of these opportunities.",25
152,Mr KNOX,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"1 preferred to have the sites reported on by capable expert men, because I attached greater importance to that than to a personal inspection.",25
153,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,But the honourable member wishes for further opportunity for inspection.,25
154,Mr KNOX,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,That i's for any honourable members who so desire.,25
155,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"And yet the honourable member himself prefers to rely on the reports of expert officers. There have been reports produced^ byCommissioners at much trouble and expense; and I point out to the honourable member, who says he attaches such importance to the opinions of experts, that those Commissioners placed Dalgety at the bottom ot the list.",25
156,Mr KNOX,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"But they placed Albury at the top, and that i's the site I desire. Mr DUiGALD THOMSON - The honourable member supported Dalgety.",25
157,Mr KNOX,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,As a final resort.,25
158,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"I think stage that every opportunity has been given both for inspection by honourable members and reports by Commissioners, and to suggest any further delay, when advantage does not seem to have been taken of opportunities afforded in the past, is, I think, quite unreasonable.",25
159,Mr KNOX,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,Ne w members have not had an opportunity.,25
160,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"Oppor tunities have been presented this Parliament if those new members had cared to avail themselves of them, because I am quite sure that the Government would have afforded every facility. We all desire to adopt an honest method of arriving at a conclusion. While some objections can be taken to either of the methods suggested, I think the one proposed by the Government has proved in the past one which will enable us to arrive at an honest and effective decision. There is the one difficulty, I admit, that, when there are only three or four sites left, a site ma^ be selected which does not represent the opinion of the larger number of voters. Let us suppose, for instance, that there, are four sites, and that site A obtains twelve votes, B obtains twenty-two votes, C obtains twenty votes, and D obtains twenty votes. According to the method proposed, A drops out, and the twelve votes are divided, four being given, say, to B, three to C, and five to D , leaving B with twenty-six votes, C with twenty-three votes, and D with twenty-five votes; and, therefore, B wins. But it may be that those who gave the five votes allotted' to D might have desired, had they known D would not be selected, to give their votes to C ; and if that had been done C would have had twenty-eight against twenty-six votes for B. I dare say that, when the number of sites had been reduced to four, the proposal of the honourable member for Angas might operate beneficially; but there is the other method suggested by the honourable .member for Robertson of, with a knowledge of the facts, allowing the five votes, which, were given to D , to be distributed; that is to say, B and C could be pitted against each other, and then the votes would arrange themselves according to the desire of the voters. To my mind, it would be sufficient to apply the preferential vote to the last four sites left in ; and the honourable member for Robertson proposes nothing more than can be done at a later under the Bill . I do not object to any method, so long as it cannot be used dishonestly. The danger of the preferential vote is that at the start second votes may be deliberately thrown away on sites which have no chance.",25
161,Mr CARR,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,There is the other alternative of taking a vote on every si^e-until an absolute majority is obtained for one.,25
162,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"That is practically the proposal .of the Government, two sites being left at the last.",25
163,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,But the honourable member for Robertson suggests that the whole of the ten or fifteen sites should then be pitted against the one left in.,25
164,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"It may not be necessary to pit the whole of the ten or fifteen sites against that site; but there may be wrong selection, due to the fact I have already pointed out.",26
165,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"It would be possible to create a blank, and never fill it again.",26
166,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"There is that possibility, whatever we do.",26
167,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,Not it the House accepts its own method of 'determining the sites.,26
168,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"In i the Committee stage, a proposal may be made to excise site A proposed in the Bill. If , according to the Minister, there is no actual majority for any one site, there may be combination, with the result that a blank is created, and every site that has been proposed-and more, because there is no limit-ma y be moved in an endeavour to fill the blank. Where is the difference between the methods? The proposal of the honourable member for Robertson may assist to get over the difficulty. The trouble about preferential voting is that sites may be nominated which have no chance, and on which second votes may be thrown away. That cannot be done so easily in a big election throughout a State, although it is done to some extent; but it is easy where, in the present case, there is a limited ber of sites, and a limited number of voters.",26
169,Mr GLYNN,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"Would not a man be foolish to throw away his vote on his second choice, seeing that it could not operate until he had lost his first?",26
170,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,I admit that when the number of sites is reduced to three or four it becomes dangerous to throw away one's second vote,26
171,Mr GLYNN,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,It is always dangerous to throw away one's second vote.,26
172,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"If by doing so some honourable members could throw out the strongest competitor against the site which they favoured, they would secure the selection of their first choice.",26
173,Mr GLYNN,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"Not by means of second votes. . Mr DUGALD THOMSON - Certainly . If the second preferences of others were honestly given, they would obtain a lot of second votes for their site, and secure its selection. If they threw away their second votes on .a site that had no chance, they would not strengthen . the position of a dangerous competitor, whereas tTie second votes of the supporters of that site, if honestly cast, would assist theirs.",26
174,Mr GLYNN,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,But one's second vote never applies until one has lost .his first vote.,26
175,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"I am aware of that. I want to point out to the Minister that the proposal made by the honourable member for Robertson would get fid of the objection to which I have referred. If the contention of the Minister is that it might lead to a deadlock, I would reply that a deadlock might occur in the Committee stage of the Bill itself. I see no objection to the honourable member for Robertson's amendment.",26
176,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"Cook) [12.44] Although the honourable member for Kooyong has declared that he desires a confirmative vote, I am inclined to think from his remarks that what he really wants is a ""put-ofEtive'' vote. We are beginning now to find out what is the milk in the cocoanut so far as some honourable members are concerned. The honourable member for Kooyong desires the settlement of this question to be deferred for two months, whilst the honourable member for Fremantle and the honourable member for Indi also plead for delay, the honourable member for Fremantle urging that further opportunityas should be given for inspecting all the sites. num- It is worth noting that thosehonorable members voted last night for the amendment on the motion for the second reading of the Bill. I do not think that any of them would, visit the suggested sites, even if the furtherconsideration of this question were deferred. They have had ample opportunity to do so, and I am confident that the honourable member for Kooyong would not avail himself of any further opportunity. As to the method of voting, it appears to me that whatever system is selected the ingenuity of honourable members will enable them to devise a wav to cast dishonest votes if they wish to do so. The exhaustive ballot, to my mind, is fairer than the preferential system. Preferential voting would enable honourable members to play off one site against another-to vote for a weak site in order to advantage or improve the position of another which they favoured. If honourable members could be relied upon to honestly give their first votes for the site that they desired to be chosen, and their secondary votes for that which they next favoured, the preferential system would work fairly. But my experience of preferential voting satisfies me that the ingenuity of honourable members would enable them to devise a means of bringing about a result that was not intended. The Government proposal is about as fair a one as we could have, and, consequently, 1 propose to support it. It was adopted after considerable inquiry and debate when this question was last voted upon.",26
177,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,It was used on two occasions.,27
178,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"After a lengthy debate as to the fairest method of arriving at a decision. I am forced to draw the conclusion from the fact that such a keen debate has again taken place on the method of voting to be adopted that there must be a desire on the part of some honourable members to find a method by which some site other than that which has a majority behind it will come out on top. The views expressed by the honourable member for Kooyong, the honourable member for Fremantle, and some of the representatives of Victoria satisfy me that they have no real desire to have this question settled. Even if we postponed its further consideration for two or three months, what guarantee should we have that it would be finally dealt with within the next four years? We do not know what will happen within the next six months. The Government proposals have stood the test of debate in this House on two previous occasions, and I think they might fairly be accepted as the most reasonable system to adopt in order that the site which has a majority of honourable members behind it may come out as the choice of Parliament in the final sol t J 01*1",27
179,Mr FOWLER,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"Perth) [12.48] - Listen ing to this debate I am reminded of the difficulty we have sometimes in settling a very simple matter. It is good that there should be some diversity of opinion on subjects coming before us, but sometimes' we have rather too great a variety, and business would be expedited if we could secure a greater measure of uniformity. On. a previous occasion we had a very long debate on the subject, and experts were busily engaged in attempting to evolve an almost perfect system of voting. We then had honourable members, some of whom I regret to say are not now with us, expending a great deal of time and energy on an effort to discover the very best method of voting on this question. The debate on that occasion was to me both interesting and instructive, and I followed it very carefully. Honourable members like myself who listened to it will agree that the decision we arrived at, after a very exhaustive discussion, to adopt a method similar to that now proposed by the Government, was in accordance with the evidence then before us. It was found that some of these fancy systems of voting would not operate so well in practice as in theory- a .trouble that very frequently afflicts the affairs of humanity. The system now proposed by the Government, while opento objection, .seems to me to be the very best by which we can arrive at an honest decision. I admit that there are one or two difficulties, but the objection to the other suggested systems is that they lend themselves to methods that I should not like to designate as trickery, but which amount to a process of overreaching with the object of bringing about a selection contrary to the views of the majority. If honourable members would record their honest preferences, the preferential system would perhaps be the best; but I agree with other honourable members who have .pointed out that the system lends itself very peculiarly to an effort to put the most dangerous competitors altogether out of their due relation, as a matter of preference. Such a system is liable to misuse. In connection with a question of this kind, on which honourable members have the strongest opinions-anc l honest opinionsthey will use every legitimate means to achieve the object they .have in view. That being so, and whilst I am perfectly willing-to give honourable members an opportunity to record their preferences in a fair and aboveboard manner, I think that it would be wise to put beyond them the temptation to record a vote on the second and following choices that would not exactly indicate their true preferences, but would materially assist the cause of the site they have really at heart. I want the vote to be as honest and straightforward as possible, and I see no reason to forsake the Government proposal for anything that, so far as my judgment goes, would be worse. The Government proposal may not be perfect, but I think it is one by which we shall be best able to obtain something like a representative decision.",27
180,Mr MATHEWS,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"Melbourne Ports) [ -55]--On e of the candidates in the i l I2 lustration given by the honourable member for North Sydney dropped out with' twelve primary votes, which were then divided amongst the others. It is, however, quite possible, that that individual would have the whole of the secondary votes of the rest. Of course, iti any new electoral system, one must expect defects, but I have always objected to the elimination of the last candidate on the list, because cases have been known where, if secondary votes could have been taken into account, he would have been elected. I am rather inclined to support the preferagainst ential system moved by the honourable member for Angas but for the. fact that if six sites were submitted it would be necessary to take twenty-five divisions fore the matter was decided. That, with perhaps discussions in between the divisions, would take a very long time. The. honourable member for Parramatta put the case very forcibly and I am rather inclined to agree with him. Supposing Lyndhurst, Canberra, and Dalgety are submitted, while I support Dalgety I do not wish to see Lyndhurst selected in any circumstances. If it came to a vote between Lyndhurst and Dalgety, and Dalgety were beaten, I , failing Dalgety, would support Canberra, and if Canberra could be reintroduced into the ballot it might afterwards beat Lyndhurst. I believe that a system of preferential voting could be vised whereby in one division each honourable member's preference for every site could be shown. At the least six sites' Lyndhurst, Dalgety, Armidale; Tumut, Canberra, and perhaps Tooma-wil l probablv be nominated. If , in the final ballot under the system proposed by the Attorney-'General, Lyndhurst beat Dalgety, then in fairness Lyndhurst ought to stand against Tooma, Armidale, Tumut, and Canberra in turn to see if it could beat them. If , when Lyndhuist was matched against Canberra, Canberra happened to win, then Canberra in its turn ought also to meet every other site.",27
181,Unknown,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,Sitting suspended from I to 2.15 f - ,28
182,Mr MATHEWS,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"I wish to put forward a suggestion under which, by one vote alone, we could settle the preference of every site proposed. I assume that the six sites I have already named are nominated. I would put them on the voting paper, numbering them one to six, from top to bottom. I would place the same names at the top so as to make six columns. Each honourable member would indicate by his vote his preference for each site as against each of the others, and that preference could be seen at a glance. For instance, as between Armidale andLyndhurst, I should, when voting, express my preference for Armidale. Then if Armidale knocked Lyndhurst out and the question'of Armidale against Dalgety were raised, following down the ballot. paper it would be seen that I preferred Dalgety to Armidale. Then if Dalgety were pitted Tooma my ballot paper would also show that I preferred Dalgety, and similarly with Tumut and Canberra. If Dalgety were knocked out in the counting of be the votes by Lyndhurst, I would have my chance again. Lyndhurst would be pitted against Canberra, and my voting paper would show that I preferred Canberra. Therefore, by marking this one preferential voting paper every honourable member could express his true opinion as regarded each site compared with each other. Consequently, if there were six candidates we should take only one vote instead of twenty-five. I do not care for the exhaustive ballot system, because under it a site that might be acceptable to honourable members could easily be knocked out. It is alleged now that the selection of Dalgety on a previous de- occasion was an accident. We are also told horrible tales about that site, but I think they are misstatements of facts. We are assured that Dalgety was only selected as the less of two evils, and that if , at the final stage, it could have been pitted against Tumut, Tumut might have won. If a preferential ballot paper on the lines ' of the diagram I have explained had been used, it could have been examined to show which site honourable members preferred as between Tumut and Dalgety. The more sites were submitted the greater would be the necessity for adopting the course which I now advocate. If , say, twelve sites were nominated, it would be necessary to take about 120 divim sions under any other system, whereas one vote would suffice under my system. I object to the method proposed by the honourable member for North Sydney, because while "" D "" in his illustration, which received twenty primary votes, was eliminated, it is quite possible that it might have been the secondary choice of many honourable members in preference to another site. That is not a good system. It means losing one site which meets with misfortune at the start. It is said that Dalgety did not command a vote at the beginning of the ballot on the last occasion, and yet it was eventually selected. Even if the method proposed by the Minister is followed the site which wins ought to beat every other site proposed before it becomes the choice of the House. If it fails to do that, the one that beats it ought also to be called upon to beat all the others in turn. How many divisions would have to be taken to get finality by that method? My proposal is a simple way of arriving at the true preferential choice of honourable members by one vote, no matter how many sites are nominated.",28
183,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"Coolgardie) [2.22] - The Attorney-General proposes that the House should receive nominations without debate. If that is agreed to, it is doubtful whether an amendment will be permissible. Whatever sites may be nominated, I wish to move as an addition thereto the provision contained in section 3 of the Seat of Government Act 1904,' that "" the territory to be granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth should contain an area of not less than 900 square miles, and have access to the sea."" I know that those conditions can be put in the Bill , but I would like to have them attached by the House to its choice, so that the Government would have no option in negotiating with the Government of New South Wales but to insist on their observance.",29
184,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,The Government could not negotiate with the Government of New South Wales on the choice of the House until the House incorporated it in an Act.,29
185,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,T r u e ; but the sooner we proclaim the essential conditions to the acceptance of any site the better.,29
186,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,Thos e conditions are already in the Act.,29
187,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"But the decision of the House last night shows that the Act is not worth the paper it is printed on. If that Act were valid, why have not the Government proceeded to establish the Capital? Why is all the turmoil and wrangle of another ballot being repeated in this Chamber?",29
188,Mr DEAKIN,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,Because the boundaries of the particular site at Dalgety w'ere not defined.,29
189,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"The Prime Minister h quite correct, but he will see that the practical effect of last night's vote was to eliminate Dalgetv from the Bill now before us.",29
190,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,No . The original Act stands.'and a Bill to further define the territorv is before the House.,29
191,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"Ye s : but. with the word Dalgety, in effect, struck out. ] Is not that the precise position, putting technicalities and legal equivocations aside? No other meaning can attach to the vote to have another ballot. I should like to know fro m you, Mr Speaker, whether I can move as an amendment the insertion of a provision to the effect that the territory shall comprise not less than 900 square miles, and have access to the sea?",29
192,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"I cannot accept that amendment, the onl y matter now before us being the determination of the site. If the motion is carried in anything like its present form, I shall have to invite nominations of sites without any qualifications, but only nominations supported by at least five members will be recorded.",29
193,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"I am obliged to vou, sir, for a clear statement of the position. It enables us to see our limitations now rather than later on, when the opportunity of action shall have passed. At the same time, I am not satisfied with the position. As to the difference between the procedure of the Government and that suggested by the honourable member for Angas, I have only to say that if the House thoroughly understood, as he does, the advantages of the preferential system, it would adopt it . That system has more good points than any other, is least liable to be affected by accident, and furnishes slight opportunity for the adoption of certain expedients by those who wish to secure particular results. The Government ask us to proceed forthwith to ballot for a site. Last night, however, the plea put forward for a ballot was that there are a large number of new members who have not had an opportunity to express their views on this matter, and therefore it is necessary to review our former decision. If that argument has any validity, we should not proceed to a ballot until they have had an opportunity to inspect the various sites. At present they know of them only by reading, or from conversations with other members who have visited them. It seems to me that the ballot should be deferred for at least six months, to give new members an opportunity to visit, and make themselves acquainted with, the sites. I should like to move an amendment in that direction.",29
194,Dr CARTY SALMON,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,That is the logical consequence of last night's vote.,29
195,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"Yes . We ought not to risk the selection of a site which may be wholly unsuitable. Could members who had not visited the sites tell their constituents lhat they voted to secure the site best in the interests of all Australia? If it is objected that the adoption of my suggestion would cause delay, I reply that the responsibility for that rests with the representatives of Sydney, who last night voted almost to a man to re-open the question.",29
196,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"If the honourable member wishes to move such an amendment as he has suggested, it will be necessary for the honourable and learned member for Angas to temporarily withdraw his amendment. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.",30

198,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"Lang) [2.35] - I understand that if the motion is carried as it stands, we shall have to proceed to a ballot for the sites, this afternoon. The motion readsThat this House do forthwith proceed to determine the opinion of members as to the site of the Seat of Government.",30
199,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"But it is provided in the second part of the motionThat an open exhaustive ballot be taken on Wednesday, 7th October.",30
200,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"The two sentences seem contradictory. The opinion of members cannot be ascertained without a ballot or vote of some kind. By carrying the first part of the motion, we commit ourselves to the determination of the question forthwith.",30
201,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"I think that the plain and expressed intention is that the House shall forthwith proceed to a determination by the nomination of sites, to be submitted to ballot next Wednesday. The first Stage towards determination will be entered upon immediately the motion is agreed to.",30
202,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"But the words which I have quoted in the resolution seem to imply finality forthwith. As long as that is not intended, we can vote on that portion; but I understand that it is'now in-, tended to take the ballot on Thursday.",30
203,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"I have proposed Wednesday, but if the ballot can be taken early on' Thursday, that will be equally satisfactory, The motion can be amended later on; but it is not competent for me to move an amendment, as I have already spoken.",30
204,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"In that case I shall, unless the Minister does so, later propose the substitution of ""Thursday"" for "" Wednesday.""",30
205,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [2.40] - I ask the honourable member for Coolgardie not to press the amendment, which can only result in a further delay of six months, and practically means the shelving of the question. I think that the House, as a whole, desires to have the matter finally determined; and it would be better to proceed with the work of selection. Such an amendment is unjust to the State of New South Wales, and will practically result in the loss of all the time previously expended on the question.",30
206,Mr COON,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"Batman) [2.41] - I support the amendment because I think that the House would be wise to postpone this question. In the course of the last sitting, we heard many reasons advanced why we should not proceed with the Manufactures Encouragement Bill, one being that the Commonwealth is not in a position to find the necessary money, and that before any further steps are taken, a financial statement should be laid before us. We are now asked by the same members who advance these arguments, to proceed at oncewith the establishment of a bush capital; but I think the time has arrived when the people should have something to say on the matter. There is, ""it appears,, dissatisfaction with the decision of a previous Parliament; and if the question were postponed for a further six months, we should, I think, be in a better position to deal with it. In my opinion there is nohurry, because there is much other important _ business which has a prior claim for consideration.",30
207,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,Wentworth) [2.43] - I did' not anticipate hearing the jesuitical casuistry,30
208,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,The honourable member is not in order.,30
209,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"Then I withdraw the words, and say that I did not anticipatehearing a particular form of argument from the honourable member for Batman, although \ I expected it from the honourable member for Coolgardie, whose views on this question are, it is well known, swayed very largely by his antipathy towards New South Wales. But the honourable member for Batman, if my memory serves me aright, showed by his vote yesterday, an anxiety not only to settle the question, but to regard it as settled?' He voted that a certain site should be regarded' as the site for all time, and his main opposition to holding a ballot in order that a fair expression of opinion might be obtained, was that Parliament had already signified its intention. It was for that reason I fell into the error of describing, in the words to which you, sir, object, the speech I regret having had to listen to. I hope that this House will not stultify itself, after declaring that it desired to proceed to the choice of a site, by now declaring that there should be a delay of six months. Therefore, in the interests of the reputation of the House, I urge honourable members to proceed at once, as we agreed last night, to select the best site for the Capital.",30
210,Mr REID,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"East Sydney) [2.45] - It is quite ominous that the honourable member for Batman should, for the first time in his political career, venture to suggest a course which is seemingly in opposition to the course mapped out by the Government. It is the first time, since the honourable member entered the House, that he has reflected the slightest shade of discord on a Ministerial proposition. I say that that is ominous, because, if the honourable member really believed that the Government were sincere in their professed desire 'to have this matter brought to a conclusion, it is simply inconceivable that he should take up his present position. I feel sure that this honourable and loyal supporter of the political conglomeration on the other side would shrink at the last moment from venturing to make such a speech, if he had not received assurance, either direct or telepathic, from the Administration that postponement is really what they desire to bring about.",31
211,Mr HUME COOK,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,No . *' coon '' has bolted up a tree !,31
212,Mr REID,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"The honourable member for Batman is not moved by eccentric impulses of that kind; he is a sort of Ministerial sundial, and I am at a loss to understand what the new development means. I do not at all complain of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Coolgardie, who has, in the most straightforward way, avowed his belief and desire that the question should be shelved for the present, ancl deserves every credit for so doing. The amendment which he has moved will enable all those who hold the same ideas as himself, either secretly or Openly, to give a straightforward vote. I think that the honourable member has a right, and that every honourable member who happens to represent a part of Ausa That tralia which is not altogether mean New South Wales-ha s a right, to call on honourable members to show their real opinion. Those who are in favour of delaying the matter ought to vote with the honourable member, who has given them a fair and open challenge; and those, on the other hand, who are opposed to delay, are given an opportunity of showing that they are honestly in favour of progress. Therefore, instead of endeavouring for one moment to criticise the course the honourable member has taken, I hail his proposition as one upon which there ought.to be a clear and straightforward division, representing the actual convictions of honourable members on this important question.",31
213,Mr MCDONALD,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,How would the honourable member for Parkes vote on this question ?,31
214,Mr REID,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"I do not think that the honourable member for Parkes is here, and I decline to enter into any conjecture of that kind. I do not think I may discuss the preferential voting proposal on this amendment.",31
215,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,There is only one' amendment before the Chair.,31
216,Mr REID,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"Then I shall content myself with the remark that my objection 'to preferential voting is that it may be abused. In theory, it is a perfect suggestion, but in practice I am afraid it might not prove the best possible course. I really feel that the Government have been a little lax in allowing these debates to be prolonged as they have been; and I am beginning to feel a little uneasy.",31
217,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,The right honourable member knows that the business was Our little brought on as quickly as possible.,31
218,Mr REID,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,But the Government do not seem to have anymomentum behind their proposals.,31

220,Mr REID,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"I have not spoken for four days; and yet this political object, which one can scarcely see through a microscope, endeavours to reproach me for making one or two observations, while, at the same time, he actually chides me for not attending the House. That only shows the extreme to which political malignity, concentrated in an insignificant intellectual space, can go. Amendment (Mr Mahon'S) negatived.

That cannot be considered unfair to private members, while it has the additional advantage that those who, for business or other reasons, desire to leave by the afternoon trains, will be able to do so after recording their votes.",32

227,Mr HUME COOK,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,The Government propose to give private members an equal amount of time on the Thursday evening.,32
228,Mr REID,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,That will mean the whole evening.,32

Though the presence of the honourable gentleman may not be of very great moment, so far as the vote is concerned, the arrangement proposed would, I think, be. a personal compliment to him. For all these reasons, I hope the House will agree to the amendment.",32
232,Mr REID,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,East Sydney) [2.54] - I should like to know the attitude of the Government in reference to the proposals which have been placed before us. Which is the Government going to adopt ?,32
233,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,It is a member of the Government who is proposing this amendment.,32
234,Mr REID,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,Then I understand that the other proposal is withdrawn.,32
235,Mr MCDONALD,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,Kennedy) [2.55] - Is there ever going to be a time in the history of this Government when they will know Daltheir own minds for a few hours together?,32
236,Mr HUME COOK,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"That is very unfair, we are trying to meet honourable members'"" i Mr MCDONALD - There was one day view last week when seventy-three memberspresent; and had the Government deto suit the convenience of honourable members they should have availed themselves of that opportunity to invite theto sit on and dispose of this busi",32
237,Mr HUME COOK,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,But honourable members were not prepared to sit on.,32
238,Mr MCDONALD,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"When this amendment was first suggested, I heard two or three honourable members, who were sitting close to me, say that they could not bepresent on Thursday. It would appear, amendment would convenience some honourable members, it would inconvenience others. The Government ought to stick to their guns and go on with the business set down for discussion, whether honourable members arepresent or not.",32
239,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"I was informed* this morning that the alteration was designed to meet the convenience of a largenumber of the Labour Party, who wereleaving Melbourne, and would not return until Thursday. {",32
240,Mr MCDONALD,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"It is true thatsome of our party will be away, but they will be here on Tuesday next at 3 o'clock.",32
241,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,I was told thattwo of them would not return until Thursday.,32
242,Mr MCDONALD,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"On e of the honourable members whom the Treasurer has e v i dently in mind will be away for a week, so that this amendment will not suit hisconvenience. I think that we are establishing a dangerous precedent in specially fixing a time for the taking of votes, and that sooner or later it will be abused.",32
243,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"Darling Downs-Attor 'ney-General) [2.57] - I do not think that the honourable member's criticism of the Government is reasonable. understood from the first that the procedure on this question must be altogether different from that usually adopted. very fact that a ballot is to be taken shows that the vote must be essentially a personal one, and honourable members should make it their business to be here.",33
244,Mr MCDONALD,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,The House does not recognise pairs.,33
245,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"But honourable members do; and to suit their convenience, pairing is allowed.",33
246,Mr FRAZER,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"A pair-book is kept on the table, and pairs are recorded in Hansard.",33
247,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,That is so; they are not recorded in the Votes and Proceedings.,33
248,Mr MCDONALD,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,l s it not the duty of honourable members to attend?,33
249,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"Certainly ; but we know that honourable members often have public duties to attend to outside the House, and that we must from time to time endeavour to meet their convenience. We have laid down a definite course of procedure, and have asked honourable members to assist us in arriving at a determination. morning it was suggested by quite a number of honourable members that the taking of the ballot on Thursday next would suit the convenience of the House. No exception was taken to that suggestion, and we now desire to fix a time on Thursday when the ballot shall be taken, so that honourable members may make arrangements to be present. We propose to make good later in the evening the time usually devoted to private members' business, which is occupied in taking the ballot; and, so far from treating this matter in the way that has been suggested by the leader of the. Opposition and others, the Government are endeavouring to press it to a decision. Amendment agreed to.",33
250,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,Parramatta) [3.1] - I am not quite sure what is the feeling of the House as to the proposal of the Government that nominations should be made without debate.,33
251,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"We have already dealt with an amendment relating to a paragraph subsequent to that in which the question of nominations is dealt with, so that it cannot now be re-opened.

256,Mr TILLEY BROWN,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,It is. Question so resolved in the negative. Amendment negatived.,34
257,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"Parramatta) [3.12] - I move That all the words after the word "" Speaker,"" in paragraph (i) be left out. All the purposes for which the ballot to be taken will be served if those words are left out. There will be an opporfinal. tunity in Committee on the Bill to test the successful site against every other nominated, and we shall then do precisely what we desired to do through the ballot. Our proposal would simply have saved the time of the House. I anxious that before we get to the Comshall mittee stage on the Bill the House shall not have committed itself, as it would by adopting those words, to an assertion that the ballot indicates fairly the final judgment of the House upon the question of the Capital Site.",34
258,Mr GLYNN,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,This is a matter of protion. cedure. I do not think it will affect attitude on the Bill subsequently.,34
259,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"No , but it will have the same effect as it had before, that bound. in Committee on the Bill some honourable members will say that, as the ballot been taken, they will abide by it. The Attornev-General is one of those. ballot that is about to ""be taken will not reflect the deliberate opinion of the House.",34
260,Dr CARTY SALMON,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,Then what is use of taking it?,34
261,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"Not very much, in the way in which the House has deinterfere cided to take it. What I wanted was carry the matter to finality, and get the - deliberate judgment of the House recorded by means of the ballot. Honourable bers have prevented that being done, now I want to avoid a contingency which occurred on the last occasion, and will questionably occur again.",34
262,Mr CHANTER,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,Is there not a general agreement that when the ballot is taken it shall be considered final ?,34
263,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"There may be such an agreement amongst those who believe in that method of taking the ballot, but there can be no understanding of kind amongst those who believe that the ballot will not reflect the true opinion the House. Our contention all through that the ballot as. proposed to be taken will not select the site by a majority of the votes cast in the House on the merits of the sites themselves. Sites will be pitted one against the other, and the ballot will be ineffective for the purpose for which it is intended. I wish to delete these words so that honourable members who desire to see the final vote of the House taken in the proper way in Committee on the Bill may not consider themselves is bound to vote for the Bill as it stands, because they regard the ballot as being",34
264,Mr ROBERTS,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,That means that the site whole subject will be again opened up be able to after we have balloted.,34
265,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"It will all be opened up in any case, whether we ballot am or not. The Bill will be before us, we be asked to vote for the delimitation of the site in the neighbourhood of Daldo gety, and no power of Parliament can prevent honourable members from trying in Committee to insert some other word than "" Dalgety."" It therefore seems idle at this stage to leave those words in the mo. They can mean nothing, except that our the House is bound by the vote which it will have just given. Those who favour Dalgety will no doubt feel themselves",34
266,Mr ROBERTS,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"If the words mean nohas thing, why object to them? The Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Practicall y they mean nothing, since we- have to face a further discussion of the site in the Bill, but they will mean, if adopted, that some the honourable members may feel themselves bound later on to agree with the result of the ballot. My amendment will not with the effectiveness of the to ballot as now proposed. I would not object even to a direction being given to the Speaker to place the result of the ballot memon the records of the House, but I do and not want to commit the House to saying that the site selected is to be deemed the unsite preferred by honourable members, because if the same method is adopted as on a previous occasion I do not think that that site will be the final decisive and deliberate choice of the House. Mr FISHER' (Wide Bay) [3.20] Whilst I agree with the honourable member the for Parramatta, that the striking out cf the words will neither add to nor diminish of the power of honourable members to deal with the question in Committee on the Bill in whatever way they desire, I do not agree with the honourable""member's argumental ments against their retention. The honmethod orable member asserts that we must prothere ceed to pit the selected site against other site. To proceed in that way would be to beat the air. If there are five sites, each man will stick to his choice; the one believe in it. which has an absolute majority will be selected by exhaustive ballot; .and if then begin again on the prejudicial system proposed, the supporters of the other four will combine against the successful fifth, and there, will undoubtedly be a majority against it. We are asked like little chilnot dren to believe that that would be a true, manly, honourable, and Straightforward way of selecting the Capita] site. I would be nothing of the kind. will be no finality at all if the successful site has afterwards to be pitted against all the unsuccessful ones. The same thing would apply if five candidates were nominated, Mr Speaker, for your distinguished and honourable office. If , after one obtained an absolute majority, we ceeded to put the question again before Parramatta. lie was"" allowed to take the chair, we should simply begin de novo, and there would be endless trouble. I hope we shall for Wide Bay. choose the method by which we previously selected the site that secured an absolute majority.",34
267,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,It was not satisThere factory.,35
268,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"It is an axiom that always choose the best of a had lot systems. We cannot get an ideally accubers, rate system of ascertaining the will of majority, but we choose the best we get. I do not wish to encourage the idea that after the ballot is taken and a site selected we are to go over the whole again.",35
269,Mr MCDONALD,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"If one site has absolute majority, how can it be defeated by any combination? ' M.r. FISHER - The result can be Bill? easily altered. If there 'are five nominations, and the successful site is submitted again, there will be a combination of supporters of the other four against it, whereas in an exhaustive ballot ever site is defeated drops out, and who voted for it have no option but to for one of the others.",35
270,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"The honourable member says that an absolute majority the House can be obtained, and can then be nullified.",35
271,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"That argument is food for political infants. By the suggested by the honourable member will be a combination of four against every one, and that one must be defeated.",35
272,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,Thos e who vote against it will do so because they do not,35
273,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"It would be all right we if we could select as many sites as honourable members advocated, but the Constitution, provides that only one site shall be selected, and that in the State of New South Wales. Therefore we must get, if the site that an absolute majority of members prefer against all other sites in the first instance, at least that site which t is preferred by the largest number afterThere wards. By a combination of the second and third votes, the site which is most satisfactory to the greatest number will ultimately be chosen. To argue the point further would be a work of supererogation.",35
274,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [3.25] - I cannot accept the proamendment of the honourable member for,35
275,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"I should think not, after the speech, of the honourable member",35
276,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"The honourable member has a capacity for making insinuations which are not always supported by facts. will be a large number of sites in competition, and the difficulty is to devise we a system for eliminating all'but that one of which, in the opinion of honourable memis, on the whole, the best. It is the realized that it may be impossible to obcan tain a site commanding the support of a majority on a straight-out vote, and, therefore, the procedure set out in the motion ground is proposed. The honourable member for Parramatta wishes us to be free to set on an one side the result of that procedure.",35
277,Mr FOWLER,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,Will not honourable members be free to do so in Committee on the,35
278,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"They will be withintheir rights in doing so, but the' procedure the proposed is an attempt to obtain an expression of opinion as to the site most .whatacceptable to honourable members as a those whole. It may be that the site selected vote on the ballot may be defeated by a combination. It would be possible, in a House of seventy, if thirty-three favoured of the selected site, and thirty were opposed' to it, for the remaining seven, who were desirous of preventing any selection being made, to create a blank under the procedure suggested by the honourable member for Parramatta. We must have some method of. getting at finality.",35
279,Mr GLYNN,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"Angas) [3.28] - It seems to me not to matter much whether the amendment be carried or not. We cannot bind the House by the expression of our individual opinions, but, as the ballot method of ascertaining those opinions could not be followed in Committee, the Government have proposed the procedure set out in the motion. In any case, we should De inconsistent if we agreed to any other site than Dalgety, because, in agreefng to the second reading of the Bill, we should have affirmed the desirability of establishing the Capital at that place.",36
280,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"Hindmarsh) [3.30]. - It ""seems to me that if the proposal of the honourable member for Parramatta were adopted, the object he has in view might be defeated. I do not agree with the honourable member for Wide Bay that, although there might be an .absolute majority for a site, that site might be lost if subsequently pitted against each of the other sites. But if the result of the ballot were to reaffirm Dalgety, and the matter had to go to a subsequent vote, honourable members, who, Hke the honourable member for Coolgardie, wish to cause delay, might bring about its rejection. If any site has an absolute majority, that will determine the question.",36
281,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"I wish to make it clear that a site has a real, and not a manipulated, majority.",36
282,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"I think that the honourable member's proposal would defeat his ends. Members who might vote in the ballot for the Dalgety site as being, in their opinion, the best to adopt some thirty years hence, might, in division, vote against it. I hope that the amendment will not be carried. Amendment negatived. Question, as amended, resolved in the affirmative.",36
283,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"I now, in pursuance of the requirements of the motion, direct that the bells be rung for five minutes, to summon honourable members who may desire to nominate sites, and I shall be prepared to receive nominations from now until the rising of the House, at anv time when no other business is in hand.

285,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURE OF GRAIN,"A nomination should be made by an honourable member rising in his place, and mentioning the name of the site which he desires to nominate. It will then be necessary, as in the case of formal motions for adjournment, for five honourable members tp rise and support the nomination."" When that takes place, the nomination will be recorded.",36
