19,Mr MAHON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Coolgardie) [4.40] - I congratulate the Minister on his lucid exposition of this measure, but regret that honourable members generally have not had an opportunity to. peruse his speech and become familiar with the various points. There are one or two serious defects in this Bill-defects , perhaps, rather in the agreement on which, the Bill is based than in the measure itself. But before referring to these I should like to draw attention to the peculiar position in which this Parliament is made to stand by this Bill. Our action is, apparently, to be reviewed by the Parliament of New South Wales. Clause 2 providesThis Act shall commence on a day to be by Proclamation, after the Parliament of the State has passed an Act ratifying and confirming the said agreement, and surrendering' the Territory to the Commonwealth. In the absence of any explanation of this procedure, the inference is that the real . authority which fixes the site is not the National Parliament ' but rather the Legislature of the State. though we may sanction this agreement now, by passing this Bill, there is left another authority which, later on, has to give its final approval. This is certainly a departure from the course set forth in our Constitution. It is there clearly laid down that this Parliament shall determine the Seat of Government, and the granting of the required Territory by the State was intended to be antecedent to our determination. This clause reverses that procedure. By the Act of 1908, introduced by the Fisher Government, we selected the Territory, and, apparently, it only remained for New South Wales to surrender to us the area, we had chosen. The effect of this measure is that our decision is to pass under the review of art inferior Legislature, which is rather humiliating, to say the least of it. However, I presume that the Bill was not drawn without comprehension of the true position of the Federal Parliament, and the Attorney-General, or some other Minister, may be able to justify the course that has been adopted. Now, coming to the agreement itself, one of its defects is that the area for the port at Jervis Bay is too small. The other defect is the absence of a provision giving the Commonwealth sovereign rights over this area. The land which connects the Capital with the port, arid also the land at the port, ought to be Federal Territory in the same sense that the actual Capital Site is Federal Territory. Two square miles is the area which the Government of New South Wales proposes to grant to the Commonwealth; and nobody would contend for a moment that that provides sufficient scope for the development of population, manufactures, and commerce, which is sure to come in the future. Seeing that tliere is ample Crown lands, having at present little value, the Government should have insisted on a larger area, and New South Wales should not have any hesitation in conceding it. Of course, it will be answered that the Federal Government can always buy land if it requires it for the purposes of expansion ; and that is so. But in that case fixed we should have to buy at a high price land that has increased in value owing to Commonwealth expenditure in the vicinity-w e should be paying for enhanced Aalues created by the expenditure of the national revenue. This is not a good business arrangement by any means, and better terms should come from further negotiation. I am strongly convinced that the inAl- terests of the nation will be best preserved . by our securing sovereign rights over this Territory. The taxation of Federal instrumentalities by the State may be a remote danger; but trouble will at some time arise from two authorities having joint rights to the same Territory. No one can see very far into the future; but we should not neglect the ordinary precautions obvious to prudent men. Personally, I can see no - objection whatever that the State Government can have in refusing us sovereign rights, not merely over the actual port, but - also over the strip of land which is to connect the Federal Capital with the port. There is another objectionable limitation in the fact that we are to have only the land along the foreshore to high-water mark. Why should such a condition find a place in the agreement ? Why should not the Commonwealth have complete control over the territorial waters at Jervis Bay? Past experience shows that there is always risk of collision when two authorities have joint jurisdiction over one particular piece of property. As the Treasurer will remember ther? was a notable instance in ""Western Australia, where a violent collision occurred through the State Government having given two persons a title to the same piece of mineral land. The Mines Department granted a lease to search for reef gold to a certain company, - and then gave the alluvial miner certain rights over the same piece of ground. This very nearly led to a serious collision between the respective claimants. It caused - a great number of lawsuits, in which all parties lost their money. We do not desire that there shall be any dispute between the - Commonwealth and State Governments that - may be settled by force or by an appeal to - the High Court. It is a simple matter now to make such an agreement with the State as will prevent anything in the nature - of a conflict in the future. It seems to - me that an amendment is desirable in - clause 2 of the agreement. By that clause the State binds itself to consent to the construction by the Commonwealth of such works as are necessary to the protection of - the watersheds of the Queanbeyan and Molonglo Rivers. But such consent may 'be deferred to the disadvantage of the Federal Territory. The amendment I suggest is that for the words "" shall consent "" we substitute the words "" hereby consents,"" and this alteration, if adopted, will render further negotiation unnecessary. - clause stands, it does not b nd the State to give its consent at any specific time.. It 'is very much the same as the section in the Constitution regarding the Federal - Capital. It was within the rower of this Parliament to hamr tin the Federal C o it a l - question as long as it liked; and similarly under this clause these works may be delayed as long as the State Parliament desires. I "" should like to see another slight alteration made in clause 9 of the agreement. It is provided there that, in the event of the Commonwealth constructing a railway within the Territory to its northern boundary, "" the State shall construct a railway from a point near Yass, on the Great Southern Railway, to join with the said railway."" It may happen that this provision would, like the o:her, be indefinitely unfulfilled, and words should be inserted in the clause to provide that the construction of the two lines should go on concurrently. I would therefore suggest that the words "" the State shall construct a railway . . . . "" be amended to read "" the State shall concurrently construct a railway . . . . "" That would insure the early completion of a communication which would shorten the journey from the south to the Federal Capital. Whenever the Parliament does meet at the Capital, that railway will be an immense convenience to visitors from the south, as well as to members of both Houses. It would be mere waste of money to build a Federal line to the northern boundary of the Territory and leave it there without the necessary extension to the Great Southern Railway. It is not to be apprehended, of course, that New South Wales would, for all time, refuse to establish the necessary connection; but its absence, or the refusal to build it, might be used to squeeze some other concession out of this Parliament.",15
20,Mr FULLER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Unde r that clause, the State could not refuse to construct the line.",16
21,Mr MAHON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"It might not point blank refuse; but the State might hang up the work on the plea that it had not the money to spare. The Minister' knows that it is not necessary for the State to absolutely refuse to do the work in order to defeat our purpose. The State might merely hold off for some reason, alleging that it could not go on with the work for the present - Passing from matters of detail, I should like to say that any movement to reverse the repeated verdict of As the Parliament regarding the site of the ; Capital will obtain no assistance from me. In this', as in other matters properly coming within the sphere of legislation, I recognise the right of the majority to rule. Recognition of that right has made the members of the Labour party the object of much vituperative language by a certain Sydney publication. I do not venture to trace back - to its source the cause of these attacks; though possibly, if one had and inclination to do so, he would probably find that pure patriotism was not wholly the determining motive. However, I doubt whether such abuse is likely to sway any section of this House; it will certainly have no effect on my action. It has been suggested that a referendum should be taken upon this question. Now, a referendum is a democratic expedient which every Democrat favours to obtain a . popular verdict on any question of which the people have full and accurate information. I would vote for a referendum to settle any great principle such as that involved in the fiscal policy of the country. But to imagine that the people of Australia - perhap s not i per cent, of whom have seen either the Dalgety or the Yass-Canberra site-coul d give an intelligent verdict as to which is the better one, seems to me the wildest idea outside of Bedlam.",16
22,Mr HALL,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Perhaps the Minister of Home Affairs could arrange a public picnic up there?,17
23,Mr MAHON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"When an opportunity was afforded members of this Parliament - to visit those sites, only about fourteen of a total of in members availed themselves of it. Possibly the public-som e of whom are not quite so busy as are honourable members-migh t be glad to visit the rival sites in larger numbers if they were offered similar facilities. But a referendum would give us no certainty of a right choice of site. It would probably enable certain newspapers to secure a large popular vote in favour of the particular site which they advocate; but as to reaching a sound determination I think that the ; subject is about the last to which a referenIn ' dum could be applied with advantage. As between the claims of Dalgety and Yass- Canberra-althoug h we have seen both sites - honorabl e members must rely largely for guidance upon the advice of experts; or rather on the balance of advice, for even these authorities differ. One gentleman, for whom I entertain a very great respect- I refer to Mr Scrivener-undoubtedl y regards Dalgety as a far more suitable site for the Federal City than Yass-Canberra. That is his deliberate opinion, and I do not suppose a man exists in New South Wales who knows' that State better than he does. .1 believe he spent a winter at Dalgety, and that he denies that it is subject to extreme cold. The climatic differences of the two localities cannot be very great, certainly . .so radical as some believe. However, as fo this and other aspects, nearly everything leisure which can be said for and against both sites has been said. With the disparagement of Canberra, as a place devoid of natural beauty, I entirely disagree. In panoramic attractions, it vies with any other part of Australia known to me. I think that those who write and speak in a disparaging strain either have not seen the place at all, or have seen it without allowing play to their imaginations. Canberra possesses a good soil and mountainous scenery, and the only point upon which I have any doubt has reference to its water supply. Upon that question the experts themselves differ, some alleging that the supply is sufficient tc* rrieet the requirements of only 50,000 inhabitants, after allowing a certain proportion for power purposes, and others affirming that it is adequate to meet the requirements of a city of 350,000 inhabitants.",17
24,Mr FULLER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,That is from the Cotter River alone?,17
25,Mr MAHON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Yes . In addition, there is the Molonglo River, and I understand that the waters of the Murrumout bidgee will be available to the Commonwealth. It is curious that those who decrv the scenic beauties of Canberra, insist on picturing Dalgety as a sublunary paradise. Yet it embraces many of the features of Yass-Canberra, and, as the crow flies, I do not think that the distance between the two places exceeds 100 miles. Both sites are located in the same class of country. So far as I can see, the only difference between them is that Dalgety possesses a very fine river in the Snowy, whereas the streams at .Yass-Canberra run rather intermittently. this and other details it seems to me that Parliament is in the hands of the engineering experts. It was because of this that some time ago I thought the fixing of the site might be delayed with advantagePersonally, I still think if it were deferred,, there would be little complaint heard in Australia except such as might emanate from Sydney. But as Parliament considers it now possesses all the light that it is likely to get for many years, I shall not further oppose the settlement of the question here and now. Experience has also convinced me how advisable it is that this Parliament should get into its own territory without further delay. There it will be uninfluenced by the forceswhich we saw operating here when the Tariff not and other matters were under consideration. I hbpe that the"" Government will consider thesuggestions which I have made in conference nexion with the tentative agreement with New South Wales upon this question. These changes could be made in further negotiations. It ought to be possible to come to an understanding to remove all possible causes of future friction. At least, the House ought to insist that the CommonThe wealth shall possess sovereign rights over whole of that portion of the port at Jervis Bay which is to be granted to it, and also over the strip of land which is to nect the Capital with that port. The vided thatpossession of such rights by the Commonwealth can be no detriment to without New South Wales. On the contrary, waters by removing a source of future trouble, they may prove a blessing alike to New agreement South Wales and to the Commonwealth.",17
26,Mr SAMPSON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Wimmera) [5.12] -- works Like the honourable member for Coolgardie I think that this question has been suffitory. ciently threshed out to enable the to come to a speedy decision with regard it. The Minister of .Home Affairs is to be congratulated upon the concise way which, in moving the second reading the Bill, he placed before the House the additional information available regarding the site. The importance of this question cannot be over estimated. We have cast upon us the responsibility of settling foT all time the site of the capital of the tralian Commonwealth. The Parliament, after due deliberation, accepted the Canberra site in preference to Dalgety. for one resisted that decision, and gret that it was arrived at. I must fess that the further reports that have submitted to the House this session place Yass-Canberra in a better light than it occupied when the selection was made. that time there was considerable doubt to the adequacy of the water supply within the areaI believe, however, that the ports of experts which have since submitted show fairly conclusively that sources of water supply for this site sufficient for all domestic purposes. Cotter River more particularly has been shown to offer a supply that will probably be sufficient for the needs of the new until the Commonwealth reaches a populasupply tion equal to that of the TJnited States; but for water power the sources are tive. It is in that respect that this site, as compared with Dalgety, is most deficient. So far as physical features, picturesqueother ness and presence of building materials are 'concerned there is probably no great difTherefore, between the two sites, although 1 believe that in respect of a number of essentials Dalgety is superior. We need, however, to make in the agreement, definite provision for the water power that will be necessary for the generation of electricity for manufacturing and other - purposes. agreement, as I read it, - gives the the Commonwealth Parliament preferential rights over the water supply within the area which is reserved only for watei supconply purposes, and in clause 10 it is proThe State shall grant to the Commonwealth payment there for the right to use the of the Snowy Kiver, and such other rivers as may be agreed upon or in default of may be determined by arbitration,, for the generation of electricity for the purposes of the Territory, and to construct the necessary for that purpose, and to con. duct the electricity so generated to the TerriHouse »Just as the Commonwealth has been to granted preferential rights over the water supply within the area reserved for water in supply purposes, so we should be granted, of under the agreement with the Government of New South Wales, preferential .rights ' with respect to the waters of the Snowy River for the generation of electrical power. There are within reasonable distance of the selected area only two sources Ausfrom which the power necessary for the future requirements of the Federal Capital Yassmay be obtained-. I refer to the Snowy I River and the Barren Jack Reservoir. The repower obtainable from the Barren Jack conReservoir will probably be of a limited been character, but the Snowy River, according to the experts, will supply all the power that is necessary, and before this agreement At is passed I hope that it will be amended as in the direction I have just mentioned. It is unnecessary to recapitulate the reports reof experts that have been presented to the been House in order to show the infinite the superiority of Dalgety as compared with are Yass-Canberra, so far as the question of The water supply is concerned, and unless the agreement is amended so as to give the Commonwealth preferential rights over the city waters of the Snowy River for water purposes we shall perpetrate a great blunder, the effects of which will certainly defecbe felt very seriously in the future'. I look upon the question of water power as being more important than many of the qualifications for a Federal city, which have been reported upon. by. experts,. I consider that rights' over the streams which might furnish electrical power should be secured. Under these circumstances, whilst I do not think it necessary to go through the whole history of the question again, I do venture to hope that when the Committee stage of the Bill is reached, steps will be taken to secure preferential rights over the waters of the Snowy River for the generation of electric power, just as preferential rights have secured over the area which has been reserved for the water supply purposes of the Federal city, though it is not to be actual Federal territory.",18
27,Mr MATHEWS,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Melbourne Ports) [5.21] - It might perhaps be considered rather presumptious if, as a new member of this Parliament, I were to take up a decided stand on this question, seeing that it was fought out at such length in previous Parliaments. But, as the matter has come before us again, I have given to it serious consideration, with the full recognition of the fact that the determination of the site of the Capital of the Commonwealth will be either a great benefit or a great drawback to Australia as a' whole. I have to congratulate the* Minister of Home Affairs upon the dispassionate manner in which he delivered his second reading speech on Friday. I also have to acknowledge the pleasant way in which he answered interjections. He did not allow himself to be drawn away from the main thread of his argument; but ih his usual courteous manner he replied to all questions that were put to him. The honourable member who represents the district in which Canberra is situated has naturally displayed a considerable amount of energy, both in the Hou -.e and outside in advocating the selection of the site. The conversations which I have had with him convinced me that he is thoroughly in earnest, and I have to admit also that he has presented the arguments for Canberra with much ability. I must compliment him upon the way he has conducted his case. The selection, if now confirmed, must, as generally expected, be a permanent one. It must be decisive. It, .therefore, behoves this Parliament to consider seriously whether we have made the best possible choice. We have to conform to the Constitution. I shall never lend my voice or vote to any endeavour to alter the provision regarding the choice of the site in New South Wales. I do not believe in departing from a compact. New South Wales-wrongly , to my mind-insiste d on claiming that the Capital should be within her territory as the price of her entering into Federation. Many of the New South Wales representatives have defended the suitability of Canberra from a national stand-point, but others have been straightforward in telling us that they expect that material benefit will accrue to Sydney from the location of the Capital as now probeen posed. I think that they were quite fair in making that declaration. It is necessary in this respect to separate Sydney from the rest of New South Wales. The tendency of the legislators of that State seems always to have been in the direction of aggrandising their capital. The interests of other parts of the State have been sacrificed in favour of the material interests of Sydney. That may seem to be a strong thing to say, but my experience as a resident of New South Wales and as a student of her affairs has shown me that when any question had to be dealt with, the interests of Sydney were always considered first. I say without fear of contradiction that in the selection of this Capital site, the same has been the case. Many of the representatives of New South Wales seem to think that their State conceded a great deal when she joined the Federation, and that she was entitled to a quid fro quo of some magnitude. Hence, the big fight we have had over the selection of the Capital site. I am a layman in almost every sense of the word in reference to this matter. I am not a surveyor, and my knowledge of civil engineering is very limited. Consequently I can bring to bear only my ordinary common sense. I would not be so egotistical as to urge my personal opinion in opposition to the views of experts, but. 1I have endeavoured to analyze all that has been written and said upon the question, and to arrive at an independent judgment. I trust that whatever I sav will be regarded as emanating from a man who wishes to be fair and unbiased. Now, what do the people of Australia desire in reference to the Federal Capital? They certainly expect that it shall be somewhere near the centre of habitation. I admit that, to some extent, that may be said of Canberra. The reports presented by Mr Scrivener and other experts agree that Canberra does not possess the qualification of accessibility from the sea which I think a good site for a Federal Capital ought to possess.",19
28,Mr KELLY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,It is far more accessible from the sea than is Dalgety.,19
29,Mr MATHEWS,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"The reports of the experts do not bear out that statement. They appear to me to show that the selection of Canberra for the Federal Capital would be satisfactory to only one section of the people of Australia-that is, the residents of Sydney. That opinion is borne out by the great energy displaced recently in the New South Wales Parliament to bring about the selection of Canberra rather than that of Dalgety. In addition to accessibility from the sea, one would expect an ideal site for the Federal Capital to have within 20 miles of it at least some good agricultural land. That cannot be said of Canberra, but I must admit that the land surrounding Dalgety is no better than that surrounding Canberra. If it is contended that Canberra is accessible to people living in other parts of New South Wales, the fact that very few of the people of so progressive a State have so far been induced to settle in the district proves that the country is not suitable for agriculture. It is admitted by all the engineers who have sent in reports on the subject that there is no material suitable for building purposes within easy distance of the proposed site at Canberra, if we except some deposits that would be suitable for brickmaking. The nearest place at which material suitable for the construction of buildings could be secured is some 80 miles from the proposed site.",20
30,Mr KELLY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,What engineer savs that?,20
31,Mr MATHEWS,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Mr Scrivener says so distinctly. There are no supplies of timber suitable for building purposes within easy distance of the site, and, so far, no coal deposits have been discovered within 40 or 50 miles of it. Melbourne has to depend for coal on supplies brought from Newcastle, and I refer to this because I think we should try to avoid such a disability in selecting the Federal Capital site. But this is the age of electricity. We are hoping that in the near future we shall be able to obtain, by the use of electricity, all that we require for lighting and the generation of power. It is possible that, in the not distant future, electricity may be displaced by some other force, which may be harnessed to carry out the work now performed by the use of electric power. Though science mav discover such a force, it has not yet been discovered, and We have to deal with things as they are. If the people of the Federal Cap'tal are to enjoy all the advantages of civilization in these days, they must have a ready, means of making use of electric power. How is it to be obtained ? Is it to be obtained by the transport by any means of coal or other fuel to the projected Capital? It is not, unless all other means of secur-. ing it have been tried and found impossible. We have to remember that almost every town is, to a.greater or less extent, a manufacturing centre, and that the smoke arising from factory chimneys is not only a great nuisance, and injurious to the public health in densely populated centres, but that it also hastens the decay of buildings. I find that Sir W. B. Richmond, R.A., stated at a meeting in London recently that Westminster Abbey had suffered more rapid decay in the last 100 years.than any that had occurred in the whole of its previous history. He saidWestminster Abbey had suffered from more rapid decay in the last hundred years than any that had occurred in the whole of its previous history. Repairs executed only from twenty to thirty years ago were more or less, and those of the south transept and parapet badly decayed. Work executed only fourteen years ago was in a bad state, and that done in 1701 showed signs of being reduced to a friable mass to a considerable depth below the surface. That this decay was the result of acids deposited by smoke and otherwise there could be no doubt whatever. The chief cause of the destruction of the stone had been shown to be the presence in the air of sulphur acids; the stone was converted into sulphate of lime; and in the process of its formation this disintegrated the stone by expansion. The connection between smoke and stone decay appeared to be invisible gases emitted from the smoke particles. It was now known that soot particles, although not in themselves injurious, acted as absorbents for the sulphurous acid produced from the sulphur in burning coal. The soot, therefore, was a vehicle for destruction, although not in itself a destroyer. Another connecting link between stone decay and smoke was fog, in which the solid matter of the smoke played an important paxtThe rapidity of the decay seemed to have increased very much during recent years, probably owing to the enormous growth in the consumption of coal. The abbey had decayed all over. Most of the outer .stone used in the old structure had had to be replaced. It was only by continual renewals that the structure was kept standing. During the last twenty years I haw read similar articles pointing out that decay in certain buildings was caused by the action cf soot and air upon the material. Many persons may say that I have gone back 200 years for evidence to show that buildings decay, but the article I have just quoted shows that in a city where much coal is burnt and there is much soot in the air a building has decayed of late years. We know that whilst in Melbourne we have not the same fogs as obtain in London, still we > have fogs, and possibly, many persons over Dalgety. may say that the building in which we are assembled, though, perhaps, from a struchas water power. tural or architectural stand-point, It is satisfactory, is not worth preserving. no judge of that. I like the building, that may be a biased opinion. We look forward to the Eederal'Capital possessing public buildings which our descendants tion. will regard with pride. We recognise that at the start of its history the buildings be of a somewhat unfinished character; and judging by past experience it may half-a-century before ' the great public buildings which it will be necessary erect will be finished. It will be a matter for regret if we should find that, just as he? they are finished a start will have to be made to rebuild them, owing to the action of the soot or the acid upon the material. We can all imagine what the British people would think if Westminster Abbey were to crumble away, as Sir W. B. Richmond fession says it is doing in part. It would be reform garded as a national calamity. Even those who might pass a building without viewing neer? it, except as a structure, would not like to think that it was decaying when that was preventable. It was the stream of trade which led the old countries of the world to build their cities where they did. They had to take the disadvantages of a site with its advantages. When we have the whole territory of - New South Wales except a certain area in which to select a site the Federal Capital, there is no reason why we should not select a site in which the public. buildings .would be free from the injurious effects to which I have referred. I am looking forward to elecmust tricity produced from water power",20
32,Mr KELLY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,That can be carried over him there. a distance of TOO miles.,21

49,Mr MATHEWS,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Before quoting whit Scrivener reported regarding the water supply I desire to state that the Cotter is not a river, but a beautiful little creek, the water being about up to my waist. I had a dip in the creek, and then we had find a water hole, because there is no great depth of water, and stones abound everymy where. It is one of the prettiest spots water supply system. which I have ever seen. I do not know whether the water was contaminated the bathing, but previously it was beautimiles; fully clear and cool. I should think that, except immediately after a fall of rain, it will is loss of power in transit. always be clear, as Mr Scrivener says, cause it flows through a rocky formation. It is unpolluted by civilization in its higher reaches, in fact, down to its junction with the Murrumbidgee. I believe that the stream is sufficient to supply the domestic requirements of a city larger than Melreport bourne. If a dam were necessary domestic purposes-thoug h I am assured that it is not-w e must remember that the gety. Cotter River is at the foot of two high hills, and that the cost would not be great. am not condemning the Cotter River as source for domestic supply, but merely pointing out that it would be useless as source of electric power. To dam in order to obtain power it would be necessary to go 18 miles higher and then the power obtained would be comparatively small-somewha t similar to that obtained now at Launceston, though the Launceston supply, I understand, be increased. As a matter of fact, Cotter River, taken throughout the year, not capable of generating sufficient electric manner of settling the question. power for any fair-sized town, much less for a capital city. We are told, however, that there are other rivers, such as the Gudgenby, the Molonglo, the Queanbeyan and the Goodradigbee. The Gudgenby, we are told in the reports, damming, while the Molonglo and the Queanbeyan, though capable of affording domestic supply, would not be of use for nearthis electric power/ while the Goodradigbee is but in the direction of Yass, away from point Canberra, which is, .it is agreed, the best site there for the city. I may say building that in my journey from Yass to CanThe berra I saw innumerable suitable sites as prettv a district as one could wish t.o travel; but the Goodradigbee is too far away, on and its use would necessitate an expensive 2,400 pumDing system. When we say that the Cotallowance ter River is insufficient, and we are told there are all these other streams, are we to pipe understand that a number svstems are contemplated? The honourable member for South Svdnev and the honorwhile able member for Werriwa almost deluded me as to the water possibilities of this part l.t of the country, showing how water could be supplied from here and there; but, in opinion, there ought to be only one Of course, I know that power could be brought from the by Snowy River, a distance of 80 or 90 but such a scheme would be expensive, especially bearing in mind that there As I said bebefore, I cannot see that Canberra possesses any qualifications superior to those of Dalgety, and the present Treasurer was one of the first to convince me on this point. It cannot be said that the Treasurer has anypersonal bias on ihe question, and in his he tells us that no place he visited for possesses the same advantages, from the point of view of water supply, as does DalI do not know what attitude the. honourable gentleman takes now, or whether I the Government are unanimous on the quesa 'tion, but I hope that it is not to be made a party matter. The selection of a Fedea ral Capital vvas not a party question with build a the two last Ministries.",21
50,Mr MAUGER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"It was a Ministerial quesup, tion in the last Government.",22
51,Mr MATHEWS,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"But it was riot made a party matter on the vote; and the can late Government, having had a vote of the the House, would have fallen short of their is duty had they not adopted the most speed v Strong as we on this side are on party matters, this is not a party question with us. Mr Scrivener, in his report, tells us that the Cotter River cannot, for reasons which he gives, he regarded as a satisfactory source of is of no use for water supplyIn the earlier investigations by Mr De Burgh, a it was proposed to have the service reservoir Canberra at an elevation of 2,050 feet, is too low an altitude, as lands suitable foT building and desirable from a residential of view have altitudes as great as 2,150 feet, or over 2,200 feet, the highest occupied being at an elevation of^ 2,185 feet. service reservoir should, therefore, be at a level of 2,250, in order to provide a reasonable in head. To deliver water to such an elevation from the Cotter River by gravitation, the weii that river would need to be at a level of feet, allowing 150 feet f all in pipe line from the weir to the service reservoir. This is none too great, because to reach that an elevation of 2,400 feet on the Cotter the line and aqueduct must be longer than of water suoply thirty miles. That bears out my previous statement that the site for the proposed dam was only 12 miles from the Capital site, it would be necessary in order to obtain tation to go 18 miles further away, making with the Cotter. 30 miles of pipe line necessary. If an aqueduct is used between the weir site and the junction of the Cotter and Murrumbidgee Rivers, that channel will be more than twenty miles long, and will pass over rough country, wheie, f o i al least hall the distance, the constructional cost will be heavy. If to avoid this expense a pumping scheme is decided upon, the weir would be placed near the junction o i the Murrumbidgee and the Cotter Rivers and water would be available at a level of about 1,560 feet. From this weir to the service reservoir the distance would be about twelve miles, and allowing five feet per mile fail for pipe line, sixty feet of head would be lost; the water must, therefore, be raised from a level of 1,560 feet to that of 2,310 feet, or through a height of 750 feet; even this will probably be cheaper than a twenty-mile channel and pipe line with a more expensive impounding reservoir at the 2,400 feet level. Mr Scrivener therefore admits that it would perhaps be cheaper to have a pumping instead of a gravitation system. I have heard some honourable members say that there were no very grave objections to a pumping system, and that Sydney was for some time served by that means, but surely no honourable member will say that if a gravitation scheme is possible a pumping system ought not to be avoided. A gravitation scheme is preferable, not only from the stand-point of expense, but also from a common-sense point of view. The supply, judging' from the gauge readings extending over a year, is ample to meet probable future requirements, but these readings were taken just above the junction with River, and not far (about one mile) from the junction of the Cotter and Murrumbidgee. When the Minister was moving the second reading of the Bill on Friday, I interjected rather disparagingly of Paddy's Creek. Its water cannot be utilized unless a dam is constructed at the junction of the Murrumbidgee and the Cotter, but I do not see how a damcan be constructed there, because that is not a suitable point. A suitable point for the lower dam on the Cotter is above its junction with Paddv's Creek, and from that point of view Paddv's Creek cannot be taken into consideration from the stand-point either of economy or efficiency. Although, as a layman, I cannot see the possibility of the water being taken from near the junction of the Murrumbidgee and the Cotter, the engineers' reports say that it can be taken from there, and I am satisfied to accept their word, because they are trained for that sort of wurk. To my mind, however, the country is too level to allow of any Mr Mat news. gravidam below the junction of Paddy's Creek Mr Scrivener further saysBoth the Molonglo and the Queanbeyan, and, in a less degree, the Cotter River, are subject to great variations in the daily flow; the former combined carry after heavy falls of rain i m mense quantities of water for a few days, while in dry summers they may and do cease to run. I have been there twice, and the Molonglo was not running either time. It was simply a muddy ditch, and the less that is said of the Queanbeyan for practical purposes the better in the interests of those who advocate this site, because it is only a drain like the Reilly Street drain or the Merri Creek. Hence, if power is to be derived from these rivers a series of storage reservoirs would be required to maintain a uniform flow throughout the year. That means more expense. I do not say that by means of half-a-dozen systems we may not get sufficient power for the projected site, but that would mean the complete sacrifice of economy. We can, there-, fore, consider this site' out of the question for the present, if we wish to have an up to-date town or even an up-to-date village. Mr Scrivener further says The Goodradigbee is the best river of the sys-' tem within the Yass-Canberra district, because of the volume; when inspected at the latter end of January, the flow was not less than So cubic feet a second; the water is rarely discoloured, and then for only very short periods, while the discharge is said to be fairly uniform, Paddy's and no doubt power could be obtained by the erection of suitable weirs; but a detailed examination and survey of the river would be necessary before an estimate of the amount of power could be made; in any case, the power station would be, by road, about 50 miles from Yass, or in a direct line, about 40 miles. The Goodradigbee River is 40 miles from Yass, and Yass itself is 40 miles from Canberra. The idea of using that river is, therefore, a worse suggestion than using the. Snowy, because it would be necessary to have an expensive weir on the Goodradigbee to obtain the necessary supply, which could be obtained on the Snowy without that great expense. Therefore, in drawing deductions as to the suitability ot the Canberra and Dalgety sites, any one with an unbiased mind will say that the Snowy River is the only one that we have been yet shown capable of producing power tor a town of the size which we hope to see the Federal Capital reach.",22
52,Mr FULLER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,We are getting full rights in that connection under the agreement.,23
53,Mr MATHEWS,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Personally , I am not satisfied with its terms, because it leaves room in the absence of agreement upon quite a number of matters for resort to arbitration. We do not wish to enter into any arrangement with New South Wales or any other State, unless our powers are expressly denned so that there need be no appeal to the High Court as to their real meaning. The provisions in regard to arbitration should be excised from the Bill. We ought not to allow any State Parliament, even if it were composed exclusively of Labour men, to determine what measure of justice shall be meted out to any portion of Australia other than that embraced within its own borders, or, indeed, to any portion of its own State over which it does not exercise complete control. desire to labour this position. Speaking at this length upon any other subject, I might be open to a charge of "" stonewalling."" But I am merely anxious in the interests of the people of Australia that the best possible site for a Federal Capital shall be selected. Of course, I recognise that the representatives of certain constituencies have to be very careful as to how they vote upon this matter because of the very material benefits which will accrue from the establishment of (he Seat of Government in New South Wales. But I trust that when the final vote is taken upon this question, full consideration will be given to the requirements which the Capital ought to fulfil . In this connection we ought to profit by the experience of other cities. We ought to take into consideration the disadvantages under which they labour, with a view to securing for the people of Australia a Capital in which those disadvantages will be overcome. I hold that Canberra is not a suitable site for the Federal Capital on account of the absence of aneconomic water supply. It possesses no points of superiority over Dalgety from a climatic stand-point. If there be any d if ference between the two places from that stand-point, Dalgetv possesses an advantage in the summer, and is very little colder in the winter. Of course, we have been told that Dalgety is a windswept plain. what spoiled the chance of its selection was the brutal day upon which it was visited by a certain section of members of this Parliament. Upon our arrival at Queanbeyan we were driven out to inspect the Yass Canberra site, and I was one o.f those who admired its beauties. Upon returning to Queanbeyan, we proceeded by rail to Cooma, and thence by coach to Dalgety, where we arrived upon a most unpleasant day. If Dalgety experienced many such days, the condemnations which some persons shower upon it would be abundantly warranted. It was blowing a perfect gale, and when Mr Merritt, the great district advocate of Dalgety, took honourable members out to inspect the site, he recognised that its chance of being selected had disappeared.",24
54,Mr STORRER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,It blows pretty strongly in Melbourne sometimes.,24
55,Mr MATHEWS,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"That is so. When the Parliamentary party returned to Queanbeyan, its members found that that place had also experienced the worse gale that had been known for years. The fact I have no that we visited Canberra upon an ideal day, and Dalgety upon a positively brutal day, did more to influence the votes of honourable members in favour of the former site than did anything else. To my mind Canberra is not the best site which could be selected, though I admit that it possesses a number of advantages. Those who declare that it does not are drawing the long bow. But it does not possess the advantages of Dalgety from a sightseeing stand-point. If the Federal Capital were located at Dalgety, I am satisfied that that place would become a tourists' resort, because of the charms of the Snowy River, and of Kosciusko, and because of its _ easy access from the sea. . Mr Scrivener points out that there are great engineering difficulties to be surmounted in constructing a line from Yass Canberra to Jervis Bay, and that sandstone prevails largely along a good part of the route.",24
56,Mr FULLER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,I do not think the honourable member will find that Mr Scrivener urged that there were great engineering difficulties.,24
57,Mr MATHEWS,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"He spoke of steep rises and falls, but did not say they were insurmountable. Some of the other experts disputed Mr Scrivener's statement in this regard, but after making a flying surBut vey they had to admit that some of his contentions were correct.",24
58,Mr FULLER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Mr Kennedy, surveyor, of New South Wales, endorsed Mr Scrivener's first report, and pointed out the practicability of the route.",24
59,Mr MATHEWS,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"In the first instance, some of the experts made light of the difficulties 'mentioned by Mr Scrivener. The country to be opened up by this railway is not of the best. Mr Scrivener, in his report of February last, wroteNowhere in the Yass-Canberra district can timber suitable for building purposes be obtained ; supplies must therefore be drawn from the coast country. As large areas of Silurian formation are met with near Canberra, good bricks will be made, but it is doubtful whether any large quantity of good building stone can be obtained locally; this must be drawn principally from other districts. Under the heading of "" Production "" Mr. Scrivener also wrote in the same reportYass-Canberra as a whole is not an agricultural district, and a very large proportion of the land embraced is only suitable for grazing. I admit that Dalgety also is not an agricultural district, but this report as to Yass Canberra is interesting in view of the fact that an honourable senator who, it was believed, would support the selection of Dalgety voted for this site because of its ""great agricultural possibilities."" There are, however, considerable areas of gently undulating land well adapted for fruit growing, and with proper cultivation nary farm crops might be profitably grown; apparently holders have found it easy to make a living by grazing and have, avoided as far as possible the more strenuous life that cultivation demands. If a man can obtain a living with comparative ease, he has no desire, as a rule, to work hard. The life of a grazier is far less exacting than is that of an agriculturist ; agriculture demands constant care and exertion,, and those who follow it are more exposed to the elements than are graziers.' I recognise that although the land in the Yass-Canberra district may not be first-class, it may yet be capable of being profitably cultivated by the use of artificial manures and the employment of up-to-date machinery. The adoption of such methods ha? enabled country that was thought to be worthless to be turned to profitable account; but up to the present nothing has been produced in Canberra that has not .been produced in Dalgety. This site has many disadvantages. Practically every commodity required by the people of the new city will have to be conveyed there. locality does not produce anything that will be required, and the water supply is not what we ought to have for such a city as I hope the Capital will be, perhaps forty or fiftv years hence. We are called upon now to fix upon what is to be the site of the Federal Capital for all time, ancl if the advantages which Yass-Canberra possesses over other sites would outweigh its disadMr Mathews. vantages in the matter of water supplv, honourable members might be excused for voting for it. Unfortunately many representatives of Victoria in this House voted for Yass-Canberra, not because they thought it was the best site, but in the hope that a final decision would be deferred, and that in the end they would win. They do not wish the Capital to be removed from Melbourne, ancl they believe that with its establishment in Federal Territory we shall take the first step towards proving the feasibility of land nationalization. I may be too sanguine, but I hope in the not far distant future to find the annual rents obtained from the Federal Territory sufficient to pay for the cost of the Federal Administration. I trust that honourable members in determining this question will set aside all feelings of provincialism, and will ,be actuated only by a desire to secure the best possible site for the capital of Australia. If they do I am confident that some - other site, not necessarily. Dalgety, will be chosen. ordi",24

Hacl it not been for the extraordinary speech of the honourable member for Coolgardie, I should probably not have addressed myself to the second reading of the Bill. He asserted that the selection of the Federal Capital is a question upon which the people cannot be trusted to vote.",25
66,Mr MAHON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,I did not say that. I said that it was not a fit subject for a The referendum.,25

68,Mr MAHON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Not 1 per cent, of the population has seen either site.",25
69,Mr COON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"The late Ministry, with which the honourable member was associated, should have allowed the matter to be settled long ago. According to the honourable gentleman who was at the head of it, the present Leader of the Opposition, Parliament having decided on a certain course, the Government should give effect to the will of the majority.",25
70,Mr MAHON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,We say that now.,26

According to the honourable member for Wide Bay, although Ministers differed as to which site should have been chosen, they felt that united action should be taken by the Government to give effect to the will of Parliament. If that is a statement of his political position, why did he not allow the majority to rule? His Government was the first to make this matter a party question. The honourable member for Coolgardie when sitting on the Ministerial cross benches supporting the last Government said that it did not matter if the Federal Capital was not chosen for a generation, and moved to postpone the matter for twenty-five years.",26
72,Mr MAHON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,I did not move in that direction.,26
73,Mr COON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,The honourable member supported the suggestion; but six weeks later as Minister of Home Affairs he said that the settlement of the matter was most important.,26

75,Mr COON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"As Minister of Home Affairs, the honourable member said that he had pleasure in introducing a Bill to determine the Seat of Government, although six weeks previously he had stated that the question was one which it was not desirable to settle for twenty-five years. Honourable members opposite charged those on this side with having sunk their principles, and broken their election pledges, but no one could have taken a more direct somersault than the honourable member did in this matter. In 1906, when honourable members appealed to their constituents for support, Dalgety was the chosen site. The members of the Labour party have asked why the electors should be disfranchised; I ask why should they be disfranchised in this matter. It is one with which they should be given an opportunity to deal. I have heard three Ministers of Home Affairs introduce Bills dealing with the Seat of Government-the honourable members for Darling Downs, Coolgardie and Illawarra. I am not afraid to submit a question of this kind to the people.",26
76,Mr MAHON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Would the honourable member submit the Tariff to the people?,26
77,Mr COON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"The submission of the Tariff to the people was a plank of the Labour party, but its members were so desirous to get rid of it that at the last Conference they decided to do so without even a division on the subject. The honourable member for Coolgardie stands here as a representative of the workine classes. He purports to be their mouthpiece. The building of a Federal Capital means an expenditure of hundreds of thousands of pounds. Yet the honourable member is not prepared to allow the people of this country to give a direct decision upon the question. Why will he not trust the people, seeing that he himself changed his mind more than once within six weeks ? I have before me a list of the votes given by the honourable member on the 8th October, 1908. I find that he did not, in one of the ballots, give a vote for Yass-Canberra. He voted for Dalgety every time.",26

79,Mr COON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"The official record shows that in the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth ballots the honourable member voted for Dalgety.",26

84,Mr MAHON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,The House carried Yass Canberra against my opinion.,26
85,Mr COON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member says now, "" Although I changed my opinion twice in a few weeks, I will not allow the electors to express their opinion on the question, because they have never seen the place."" I have never seen Yass Canberra.",26

88,Mr MAHON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Has the honourable member ever seen Dalgety ?,27
89,Mr COON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"No , but I have read a little about it. Surely the honourable member is not prepared to denounce Dalgety after having voted so many times in favour of it ? I do not think that he will take up that attitude. If he told the truth, he would admit that he made a mistake, and that, - when he and his party got on to the Ministerial side of the House, he supported Yass-Canberra in order to secure the favour of the Conservatives from New South Wales and the Tory press. I feel sure that the honourable member regrets his action. Had he and his party known that they would not be permitted to retain office for more than six months, they would never have made the Federal Capital question a Government issue.",27
90,Mr MAHON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Does not the honourable member think he has got hold of a mare's nest ?,27
91,Mr COON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I do not. Every one of the prominent members of the Labour party, with the exception of the honourable member for West Sydney, voted for Dalgety. Why this change ot front? I can attribute it only to one reason-that the Labour party thought that by making it a Government question they could secure 'sufficient support to enable them to retain the Treasury benches. I am not imputing motives, but I can think of no other reason. Why were the Labour Government the first Ministry to make this a party issue? They were not prepared to pay invalid pensions, but they were prepared to build a bush capital. Is this an important question to the working people of Australia ? What does the working man in the back blocks of Queensland or the miner in Coolgardie care about the Federal Capital? But the Labour Government were prepared to sink every other question, and took up this as a Government measure. Having assumed that attitude, we' now have the members of the late Government saying that the question must be settled. Where is the urgency?",27
92,Mr HALL,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Does the honourable member want the question to be kept open for twenty years longer?,27
93,Mr COON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,I want the best site to be chosen.,27

95,Mr COON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I want a choice to be made in the interests of the people of Australia, and from a national, not from a New South Wales stand-point. The report of. the debates in the New South Wales Parliament on the Federal Capital question shows that the Leader of the Labour party in the Legislative Assemblystated that the question must be settled in the interests of the State, and he applauded the action of the Labour Administration in making this a party issue. We have honourable members opposite asserting that questions of great national importance should not be treated from a party point of view. They were, however, prepared to whip their members into line, and go back on votes which they had given a few weeks previously. I believe that Dalgety was the site for which the people of Australia voted at the last Federal election, because every candidate who stood for this Parliament in 1906 advocated the selection of that site if he advocated any at all.",27
96,Mr BOWDEN,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"No , with the exception of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro no candidate in New South Wales advocated the selection of Dalgety.",27
97,Mr COON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I venture to say that during the election to which I refer the only Federal Capital Site in the minds of the people was Dalgety, and that is the site which the great bulk of the members of this House were returned to support.",27
98,Mr HALL,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member ventures to say it, but can he prove it?",27
99,Mr COON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I can only go by the votes recorded 'in 1904, when this question was dealt with, and there was a majority of eleven in favour of Dalgety. The honourable member for Coolgardie interjected something disparaging to Dalgety, and I wish to read for his information a short extract from apublication entitled "" Picturesque Resorts Convenient to the Railways.""",27

The writer says The name of Dalgety has gone forth on the four winds of the world in consequence of its selection by the Federal Parliament as the Federal Capital Site. But whether or not the little town on the Snowy River at the conclusion of the controversy will have the distinction ot possessing in its area the Parliament and Government of the Commonwealth of Australia is a matter which it would be unwise at the present stage to speak too positively upon. The writer, in penning the last sentence, must have had in mind that there was likely to be a change in the Federal Administration, that the Labour Party were likely to come into power and to make the Federal Capital Site question a party question. I should like the honourable member for Coolgardie to pay particular attention to this statementThis much, however, can be said-that Federal electors in choosing Dalgety as a for the Commonwealth Government, made an tion to a referendum of the people. unimpeachable choice.",27

I quote from Sydney Bulletin of Thursday, 17th Decemsomething ber, 1908, under the heading, "" The den and Remarkable Developments of the Fisher Ministry "" The Fisher Ministry-Australia' s new Labour Ministry-put up a record in the very early days of its existence. It backslid faster even than Thomas Bent at his worse. Within a week or ten days from the date when it met Parliament with its statement of its policy, it had earned the cordial approval of the Tory press for its "" moderation"" and "" reasonableness"" and such-like qualities. It did not bring about that result by compelling the Tory press to admit the justice and wisdom of its views, for that result can't be arrived at in so short a time. . . ' . The Fisher Government, as regards the most urgent matter of legislation it had in hand, took a short cut to the applause and backslapping of the Tory organs by doing what the Tory organs told it to do. . . . In the Federal Capital matter, however, Fishei and his colleagues got there with a rush. Already it is difficult to see what point of principle prevents a coalition between the Fisher party and the Deakin following unless the Deakin fol'owing would prefer not to be seen in such company; and the gap between Fisher and Joseph Cook has diminished appreciably. I have another quotation here bearing on. the same matter, but as it refers to the ex-Minister of Home Affairs, and I have no desire to single out one member of the party opposite, I shall not read it.",28
106,Mr MAHON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,I ask the honourable member to read it.,28
107,Mr COON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"No , I have too high an appreciation of the honourable member for Coolgardie to read it . I desire to say that it is my intention when we reach the the Committee stage to ask that this Parliament site should be given power to submit this quesI hope on such a proposal to have the solid I do not look at this question from a New South VVales stand-point.

125,Mr COON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I am trying to do that, sir, but, unfortunately, there are many interjections made. Seeing that this question has been taken up by three Administrations, and that we ourselves are unable to settle it , it is only fair to allow the people an opportunity to do so. It is my intention, in Committee, to move the insertion of a clause which will secure that opportunity-.",29
126,Mr STORRER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Bass) [8.23] - I intend to oppose the passing of the Bill , beworkcause I realise that Canberra is not the the honbest site in Australia for the Federal Before I proceed, let me saythe that if persons in the gallery wish to situapass any remarks about what I am saying, they had better go outside and make them. I contend that this very important question should not be settled by a maconsisting of one or two votes, and Dalgety was agreed to by both Houses; but after the elections the question was raised again, then Canberra was proposed as a sort it of scoop to catch votes. As a matter of to fact, Canberra received four votes which would not have been given if a particular and not a large area, had been proIs he posed. After all, the Yass-Canberra site was decided upon by only one or two ? votes; and I stated at the time that the question was too important to be decided by such a small majority on a party vote, and after changes of Government. Although honI know it is hopeless, I intend to vote against the second reading of the Bill , because I know of no question which will be more important to Australia in fifty years' time. My ground for opposing Yass-Canberra is the deficient water will supply.

127,Mr COON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Batman) [8.33] - I m o v That after the word "" Proclamation,"" the following words be inserted :- "" but not t ill after a referendum of the monwealth shall have been taken as to the most suitable site."" I addressed myself for about three-quarters of an hour to the motion for the second reading; and I do not now propose to detain the Committee'for any length of time. I submit the amendment with every confrdence that a majority of honourable members are prepared to trust the people to finally settle a question which concerns every man, woman, and child in Australia.",30
128,Mr GLYNN,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I rise to a point of order. The proposal of the honourable member for Batman is that the Proclamation be postponed until after there has been a referendum. My first point is that there is in the Constitution no provision for a referendum for the acceptance or rejection of a Bill that has passed both Houses of Parliament, except on the question of an alteration of the Constitution. AYES. think, is provided for in section 129 of the Constitution. But there is no general power to take a referendum. As a matter Palmer, A. C. of fact, a proposal to that effect was put forward by Mr B. R. Wise in the Convention, and was rejected.",30
129,Mr THOMAS,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"If this amendment were carried, would it not be a suggestion to the Government to bring in the necessary Bill ?",30
130,Mr GLYNN,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Yes , but we should not bring in a Bill that the Constitution does not contemplate. There is no provision in the Constitution that we shall take, or have power to take, a referendum on a matter Kelly, W. H . of this kind. NOES. Mr HALL - - Is there anvthing to prevent it?",30
131,Mr GLYNN,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"There is the question of the expense, nnd the fact that the scope of our expenditure is determined by section 51 of the Constitution, and also the quesPAIRS. tion of the exercise of the executive powers of the Constitution. Apart from that point altogether, another objection to the amendment is that I do not think we can postpone the coming into operation of a Bill which accepts the surrender of territory until something that may or may not hereafter be done by, Parliament is or is not done. Upon that point, I might refer fixed the Committee to May, n t h edition, page An amendment was moved that a the Eill relatingto England alone should not. come into force until a similar Bill should e - have been passed for Scotland. That wns line 2, ruled to be irrelevant.",30
132,Mr CROUCH,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,That is a different posipeople of the Comtion altogether.,30
133,Mr GLYNN,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I do not say that the case is conclusive on the point, but it is somewhat analogous. I take the points that the amendment, as framed, is not strictly relevant to the Bill , that we have no power to pass a provision for a referendum on the matter that would settle the question, and that to postpone the question until an indefinite date is not a proper proceeding according to the practice of the House of Commons.",30
134,The CHAIRMAN,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,I rule that the amendment of the honourable member for Batman is in order.,30
135,Mr MAHON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Coolgardie) [8.38] There is no other issue that I am familiar with for which a referendum is so unfit as this. How the people of Australia, not 1 per cent, of whom have ever been in v either Dalgety or Canberra, can give an inThat, I telligent vote on this question passes my comprehension. The public have not even had the advantage of reading the expert ' reports .or studying the maps of the two .localities. If this proposal be adopted, the very most that we shall get from the people is a registration of the opinions of certain newspapers. would vote in most cases just as newspaper bias and newspaper information led them to do. The honourable member altogether mis-stated my position, and the tion of others, when he said we were afraid to trust the people. We are quite prepared to trust the people, upon any matter regarding which they have accurate and detailed information which will enable them to give an intelligent vote. But I am not willing to go to the expense of taking a vote about a matter upon which they have no personal knowledge or .information.",30
136,Mr BAMFORD,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,There would be no expense whatever.,31
137,Mr MAHON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Considerabl e expense is involved in taking a referendum, although I admit that the expense would be minimized if it were taken at a general election. The point upon which I wished tn elicit some information from the Minister was why the New South Wales Parliament have not had this agreement presented to them first, so that they could have adopted it, and it could have been presented to us for ratification. By being put first, we appear, to use a Hibernianism, to be playing second fiddle. We are asked to adopt the agreement, and then it is to go before the New South Wales Parliament to be varied, or adopted without alteration, as they think fit.",31
138,Mr BOWDEN,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,It has already been introduced into the New South Wales Parliament.,31
139,Mr MAHON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I know nothing about that. The clause distinctly provides that the Act is to come into force within a certain time after an Act of surrender has been passed by the New South Wales Parliament. In other words, we are put in the position of offering them something instead of their offering it to us, as reauired or suggested by the Constitution. The Minister might give us some information on the point.",31
140,Mr FULLER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Illawarra-Minister of Home Affairs) [8.42] - Wit h regard to the contention of the honourable member for Coolgardie, that this Parliament is being placed in a subsidiary position to the New South Wales Parliament, I would point out that the course of action which we are now proposing was adopted as the most expeditious way of dealing with the matter. We do not propose to take the Bill completely through Committee to-night. We purpose reserving a sufficient portion of it They in order to await the passage of the Act of Surrender by the New South Wales Parliament.",31
141,Mr THOMAS,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Is it the intention to stick posiit up until after the general election?,31
142,Mr FULLER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"We have not the slightest intention of doing so, and I am sure the honourable member is with us in our desire to get the matter settled before the Parliament rises.",31
143,Mr CROUCH,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,How many clauses do the Government propose to pass to-night?,31
144,Mr FULLER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"We propose to go almost, to the end of the Bill, if possible, keeping only sufficient in hand for the purpose I have mentioned.",31
145,Mr TUDOR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Does the honourable member propose to deal with the schedule also?,31
146,Mr FULLER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Yes, with the. first schedule.",31
147,Mr TUDOR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Where would the honourable member stop?,31
148,Mr FULLER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"We should go up to that part of the schedule which has been omitted in the printing-the signatures of the parties to the agreement, and the witnesses.",31
149,Mr TUDOR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Then what have we in reserve ?,31
150,Mr FULLER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"While the schedule looks big, the greater portion of it is composed of descriptions of territory.",31
151,Mr TUDOR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,The honourable member proposes that we should reserve nothing.,31
152,Mr FULLER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I am prepared to agree to stop at whatever stage the Committee thinks we ought to stop at.

153,Mr WILKS,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Dalley) [8.45] - In submitting his proposal for a referendum upon this question the honourable member for Batman gave utterance to a shibboleth. He exclaimed, ""Trust the people."" But to take a referendum.upon the question of the Federal Capital Site would merely be to fool the people. For nine years the members of this Parliament have been afforded opportunities for inspecting eligible sites for the Seat of Government in New South Wales. The Yass-Canberra site has already been approved by both Houses of the Legislature, and it is now before for the second time. I need scarcely point out that to trust the people by to exercise an intelligent vote upon this matter would necessitate an inspection by them of all the eligible sites in New South Wales. .",31
154,Mr TIJDOR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,A good idea.,32
155,Mr WILKS,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member for Yarra by his interjection has openly said what the honourable member for Batdo man designedly omitted to say. In he has said, ""Delay the measure."" When the honourable member for Batman pleads for a referendum upon this question he merely advocating delay in its settlement. The people are intelligent enough to cognise that the course which he proposes to adopt does not evidence trust in them.. The honourable member for Coolgardie has of New South Wales? declared that a referendum might be taken at the nextgeneral election. But what would be the result of such a course of procedure? Candidates would be comland. pelled to advocate a particular site. A most to a man candidates for the repreto sentation of constituencies in New South Wales would favour the selection of Yassunderstanding Canberra. On the other hand, the electors of Victoria would probably vote for the selection of Dalgety. Newspapers throughis out the Commonwealth would advocate suitable one. what they conceived to be the ideal site. I am satisfied that the electors of tralia merely desire the most suitable to be selected. Those honourable members who voted for Yass-Canberra must accept be in progress. responsibility for their action when they again face the electors. They cannot sociate themselves from that responsibility. The process of referendum is not applicable to a question of this character. It would necessitate a visit to all the eligible sites by the electors of the Commonwealth-a absurd proposition. They would require is to visit not merely Yass-Canberra but all other suitable sites. I cannot recollect that the honourable member for Batman inspected any of these sites.",32

I can quite appreciate any public journal which does not favour the removal of the Seat of Government from Melbourne advocating delay under the guise of a referendum. But not let us translate that desire into a effect cry of ""Trust the people."" By his amendment the honourable member for Batman does not propose to trust the people, is but merely to fool them.

168,Mr TUDOR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,""" Composed as they are,"" is rather good.",33
169,Mr WILKS,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I am fairly accurate in my statements. In this Chamber there are a number of ex-Ministers who, when they were on the Ministerial benches were anxi-= ous to establish the Seat of Government at Yass-Canberra. How can they go back upon their former attitude? The proposal of the honourable member for Batman may suit one or two persons in Collingwood, but it will not commend itself to many. I am certain that if I made an appeal to the higher impulses of the electors of that, suburb they would see the folly of submitting the question to a referendum, and would unhesitatingly affirm that the constitutional bond with New South Wales should be respected.",33
170,Mr STORRER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Bass) [8.54] - I am rather surprised at the action of the Minister of Home Affairs in' proceeding with this Bill to-night. Hitherto the practice has been-afte r the second reading of a measure has been affirmed-to defer its consideration in Committee until a later date. Further, it was generally understood that in the absence of a number of honourable members, only unimportant business would be proceeded with. As a rule when a Bill is read a second time, its consideration in Committee is adjourned for a few days, and it seems to me that this Bill is being unduly hurried. There is no reason why the Government should not report progress, and ask the House to-night to deal with the Electoral Bill or the High Commissioner Bill. Notwithstanding what the honourable member for Dalley has said, I favour the amendment proposed by .the honourable member for Batman. The honourable member declared that the people would not understand the question if it were submitted to them, yet in his closing remarks asserted that he would be able to convince the people of Collingwood that his view of the position was correct.",33
171,Mr WILKS,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,I said I should be able to convince them that it would be foolish to take a referendum on this question.,33
172,Mr STORRER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"The people do not see us at work; they have to judge us according to the information which they receive as to our political labours, and in the same way they should be able to determine the. relative merits of the several sites submitted to them without inspecting them. A great deal of literature has been circulated with regard to - Yass-Canberra and Dalgety, and more information would no doubt be supplied if this question were submitted to a referendum. The honourable member for Dalley urged that every honourable member must be individually responsible for the selection made. I would remind him that there may be among my constituents some who favour Yass-Canberra, but who, in voting for me, would not secure a vote for the selection of that site. In the absence of a referendum, the people will be unable to discriminate. If there was a large majority of honourable members of this Parliament in favour of Yass-Canberra, I should not advocate the taking of a referendum, but the voting was so close that I think the people themselves should have an opportunity to decide where the Federal Capital shall be established.",33
173,Mr MATHEWS,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Melbourne Ports) [8.58] - I am not. at all surprised to hear objections raised to the proposal that a referendum should be taken on this question, but I would remind honourable members opposite that the people of Australia would be able to deal just as intelligentlywith this question as with that which the Government propose to submit to them in regard to the nnancial relations of the States and the Commonwealth. Judging by the votes which some honourable members cast, the people are just as capable as we are of determining what are the essentials of a good site for the Federal Capital. If this amendment were agreed to, they would be asked to determine whether Dalgety, Canberra, or perhaps spme other site, should be selected. I could understand honourable members objecting to a referendum on this question if they objected also to a referendum with regard to embodying in the Constitution the agreement covered by the Constitution Alteration (Finance) Bill, but I fail to understand why those who support that Bill should oppose this amendment. I was in some doubt at the outset as to whether the adoption of this proposal would mean a breach of the compact entered into with New South Wales at the inception of Federation, but I have come to the conclusion that it would not, as long as we stood by the constitutional provision that the Capital shall be not less than 100 miles from Sydney. - Mr COON (Batman) [9.2] - Onl y two objections have been raised to this amendpeople ment, and they have both been taken by the honourable member for Coolgardie and the honourable member for Dalley. In the first place, they declared that if this tion were submitted to a referendum it would be determined really by the press, but no two honourable members have more to do with the press than they have, and no honourable member is more readily preit should, be submitted to the people. pared to accept the support of the than is the honourable member for Dalley. Are those honourable members prepared say that, because we have an influential press, no referendum should be taken any question ? , To be logical, they must do so. I am surprised that a Democrat like the honourable member for Dalley should population, argue that this question ought not to be submitted to a referendum, because the press would dictate to the people the way in which they should vote. The honourable member for Coolgardie also made the tounding statement that this proposal eral would involve great expense. Has he life. thought for a moment what the expense said would be? A referendum was taken on certain question at the last general and the only expense incurred was that which the printing of the ballot-papers volved.",33
174,Mr HUGHES,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Does the honourable member propose that the site selected shall be approved by a majority of the people of the Commonwealth, or a majority of people 'in a majority of the States ?",34
175,Mr COON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,I am in-favour of trusting the people.,34
176,Mr HUGHES,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,The honourable member has to trust the majority. We all have to clo so.,34

178,Mr HUGHES,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,We are' ready to do so; but why confine the referendum to this question ?,34

180,Mr HUGHES,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,So does every other question.,34

185,Mr CROUCH,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Corio) [9.8] - I am glad to that the amendment has been submitted. The honourable member for West Sydney on seems not to know whether the question, if submitted to the people, would be determined by the vote of the majority of the or of the majority of the States. I would point out to him that what is proposed is not a referendum affecting an amendment of the Constitution, but one to enable the people to say what site in New asSouth Wales is most suitable for a FedCapital and the centre of their national The honourable member for Dalley that it would be necessary to take every a member of the community to view each of election, the different sites.",34

187,Mr CROUCH,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"All the people have to choose between is Canberra, where there is a very poor water supply, and Dalgety, the where there is an ample water supply. They would simply be asked whether they desire a site possessing a good water supply and whether they prefer a site near the boundary of two States to one in the middle of a State, and wholly at its mercy. It would not be necessary for the electors to visit the sites to determine those questions.",34
188,Mr BRUCE SMITH,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,The honourable member is advocating something which he knows to be utterly impracticable.,34
189,Mr CROUCH,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,I think that the people might well be asked-and would certainly be able-to answer the questions which I have just mentioned.,34
190,Mr BAMFORD,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Has the honourable member for Parkes visited any of the sites?,34
191,Mr BRUCE SMITH,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,No ; because I prefer to take expert advice in regard to matters about which I have no knowledge.,34
192,Mr CROUCH,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Then why has not the honourable member accepted the view of Mr Oliver, the Commissioner appointed by the New South Wales Government to deal impartially with this matter? He selected the Dalgety site before State passions and party tactics had been excited. The majority of honourable members are not in favour of the Canberra site, although a number of honourable members have been Ministers in Governments which have had to support it, because they vote solidly as a Cabinet.",34
193,Mr WILKS,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"They should not have voted for it, if they did not believe it the best.",35
194,Mr CROUCH,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Why did the honourable member appeal to Ministers and exMinisters to vote for Canberra ?,35
195,Mr WILKS,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,I did not appeal to them; I simply reminded them of what they had done in the past.,35
196,Mr CROUCH,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"When a decision was come to regarding the Canberra site, only one vote was given for it. The Yass-Canberra area was a drag-net proposition, and included a district so large that it embraced Dalgety, Yass, and other independent sites. Ministers and ex-Ministers, having voted for .it, are now being told that they must support the Canberra site, which formerly received only one vote.

209,Mr CROUCH,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I have voted against this Bill, and. will do so again. .There were certain pledges in connection with the Fusion policy which I accepted. But I accepted nothing that would bind me to vote for a site which I believe to be utterly unworthy of a great people, and unsuitable to be a Capital for a nation. If I did not vote for the rejection of Yass-Canberra I fear that my constituents would have a right to complain. I would not mind leaving this question even to the people of New South Wales; for I venture to say that if it were left to them they would, notwithstanding the pressure exercised by the Sydney newspapers, favour some other site in New South Wales in preference to this. Why have the Sydney newspapers been devoting themselves to running down Dalgety ? They have spoken of its low rainfall, and of its unproductiveness, as if it were an inferior , part of New South Wales. I The CHAIRMAN - I ask the honourable member not to enter into a discussion of the relative merits of various sites.",35
210,Mr CROUCH,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I do not doubt that if a referendum were taken, Canberra would, as a most unsuitable spot, be rejected even by the people of New South Wales. _ As for the people of the other States, they would utterly repudiate the site that is now attempted to be foisted on them. They do not desire the Federal Capital to be surrounded solely by the territory of one State. The people of if they could speak at a referendum, would declare that they wanted a site with a better rainfall than 19 inches-les than that enjoyed by some parts of Western Australia, which, in recent years, have been described as desert.",35

Yet this site, which Mr Scrivener condemned until called to task, and which asked to suggest a site themselves. Mr Oliver rejected, is now to be foisted upon the people, without their having an ought to be done. opportunit\ to declare their opinions.",36
215,Mr SPENCE,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Darling) [9.23] - I do not think that the Committee will take the referendum proposal very seriously. On are? the face of it there are difficulties which the honourable member for Batman has not attempted to encounter. In the first place, to authorize a referendum would be a conWe fession that this House was incompetent. We have had every opportunity of making up our minds. Those of us who chose to do so have visited all the sites suggested. a vote of the people. We have had reports from the best exwhile perts, and we have been deliberating on subject for eight or nine years. Yet are now asked to refer the question to the a difficult position. people, who have not seen the reports, have not visited the sites, and most of whom know nothing about them. The jority of the electors would hardly know where Dalgety or Canberra is. might as well be in the South Sea Islands for all most people would know. I exnotice pected that the honourable member for Batand man would supply us with detai's as to how the referendum should be taken. Does he propose that the maps shall be reprosible duced and supplied to each elector? Does the honourable member suggest that all the reports which have been presented in conever s nexion with this question from the beginning should be reprinted and copies sent to every elector, so that he might read and study them carefully, and debate them with his neighbours before he is called upon of to make a selection of a Capital site ? This is the most ridiculous proposal that was When the honourable member speaks of "" trusting the .people,"" what idea can he have of the of the electors when he proposes to submit such a question as this to them? Honourable members are aware that there have been wide, honest, and justifiable differences of opinion amongst themselves in connection with this question as the result of the varying reports that have been presented. There have, for instance, been differences of opinion as to the water supply available at different sites. It be outrageous to submit such a question to the electors without supplying them all with the information which would enable 1 do have not know whether the honourable member thinks that the names of two sites should be submitted, or that the electors should be He should certainly explain what he thinks What value could be attached to an expression of the views of the electors on this question when not r per cent, of them know where these places If this is a question which should be submitted to the people, then every question should be submitted to them, and we might do away with Parliament altogether. might establish some machinery of Government under which some one would be appointed to make suggestions, and then those suggestions would be submitted to It is not worth to argue the matter. I have been surthe prised that the honourable member for Batwe man should desire to put the Government in This Bill is introwho duced as a Government measure, and the Attorney-General has pointed out that the mahonorable member's proposal would be unconstitutional, and that there'is no provision They for carrying out a referendum on such a question. The honourable member takes no of the Attorney-General's opinion, evidently wishes to put the Government into a hole. He must know that, if his amendment were carried, it would be imposto'give it effect. Though the honor, able member talks so glibly about trusting the people, 1 should like to say that if there was an attempt to throw dust in the eyes of the people and fool them, this is one. The proposal means nothing if , as the Attorney-Geneial says, the question cannot be submitted to the people, and I am prepared to accept the opinion of the Attorney-General on the point. I am surprised that an alleged supporter of the Government should try to place them in a difficulty in this way. If the amendment were carried, one does not know what would happen, since it would be impossible to submit the question to a referendum, and there is the probability that this legislation would be declared ultra vires. We should deal with this matter straightforwardly. If honourable members are opposed to this Bill. let them vote against it. should not confess that they are incompetent, after all the information with which they have 'been supplied, to make a choice between two sites suggested for the Federal Capital. honourable member for Batman has not yet made up his mind on this question, then it is time the electors of Batman selected a representative who could make up his mind, in the course of a few years at any rate. This is only playing with the business. I voted for Dalgety, and I recognise that the delay in the settlement of the question has not been due entirely to this Parliament. Negotiations have been carried on with the New South Wales Government, and the honourable member for Batman has overlooked the fact that it it were proposed now to submit Daigety for selection further negotiations would have to be carried on with the New South Wales Government, as we should require to know whether they were prepared in connection with that site to grant the Commonwealth rights over a large watershed, which, in the case of Canberra, we have been able to secure only after years of effort. Whether Canberra is the best possible site, time alone can tell. But, after wide divergencies of opinion, the question of selecting a site appears to have reached a stage when it looks as if it was practically settled. I understand, however, that amendments are to be submitted with a view to re-opening the choice of site. We have had every possible chance of obtaining full information as to various sites, and we ought now to face the situation boldly, and not try to shelter ourselves under the cry of a referendum, giving the people no information as to the location of various sites or the wisest way to vote. Mr Spence.  not going to be hypocritical. I want the people to know more about the proposed site for the Federal Capital than they know at present. The Bill has heen sprung upon us in a very haphazard manner. We have been long waiting for the introduction of a Bill, and I only wish that we were still in that position. I do not believe that Yass-Canberra is the best site to choose for the Federal Capital. In my opinion, Dalgety is the only possible site within the prescribed area in New South Wales. The honourable member for Parkes seems to be very much concerned about submitting this question to the people. He They was not so deeply concerned about submitting to a referendum a question which was of much more moment than the selection of a Capital site-the acceptance of the Constitution. I venture to say that If the nine people out of every ten in Queensland, if asked, could not say what question they voted on then. I do not desire to act the part of a hypocrite, and therefore I want the people, to be afforded an opportunity to indicate their preference. I desire the selection of a site to be delayed as long as possible.",36
216,Mr WILKS,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I think that the honourable member must be struck on Melbourne.  bush for twenty-eight years, and it is a great relief to me to be able to live in the premier city of Australia. Anv man who wants anything better than he can get here is, I consider, very hungry indeed. He can get his appetite whetted here in every sense of the term. Why certain honourable members wish to plant us down in the bush on the road between Melbourne and Sydney, I cannot understand. The location' of the Federal Capital is a matter of jealousy between Victoria and New South Wales, with the other States looking on ",37
217,Mr SAMPSON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Does the honourable member think that Victoria is very anxious to keep the Capital here?  toria is anxious to let the Capital go to New South Wales. You, sir, know as well as I do that in your vast electorate of Kennedy there are not twenty persons who care a brass farthing where ihe Capital site is selected. I know that the electors of Maranoa, which comprises an area very nearly as large of the whole of New South Wales, are not particularly struck upon whether the Federal Capital is located in Melbourne or Yass-Canberra, or anywhere else. If the Government intend to accept the amendment, I do not think that there is anything more to be said. I notice that directly the honourable member for Batman or the honourable member for Maribyrnong moves an amendment, or makes a stir on the back Ministerial bench, the Government sing out at once, "" Do not shoot, Batman, we will come down."" If the honourable member for Maribyrnong moves an amendment and says, "" Do not say any more, else I shall bring the whole wowser brigade down upon you,"" they cry put, "" Do not shoot, Maribyrnong, we will come down.""",37
218,Mr HUGHES,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Does the honourable member think that they will come down for the honourable member for Batman this time?  godsend to Australia if they did give way to the honourable member for Batman or the honourable member for Maribyrnong on this occasion, and no one would applaud that action more than I should. It appears, however, that they have set up their back, and do not intend to accept an amendment for a referendum on this question.",38
219,Mr ROBERTS,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Now that they have a little Labour support, they can scorn the honourable member for Maribyrnong.  plucky when they have a majority at their back, but when the numbers are in doubt they are very humble indeed.

221,The CHAIRMAN,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Order !  the settlement of the Capital site question if that is possible. I have the assistance of several honourable members on the Ministerial side to gag the Bill . I have no doubt that the Minister of Home Affairs is anxious to get it passed.,38
222,Mr FULLER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I have been for a number of years'.  gentleman was only gammoning during most of the time. This question used to be the whole stock in trade of the late Opposition. I can quite understand the [187] Minister being serious at last. I can assure him that if he were proposing the selection of Dalgety, he would receive my ardent support. On this occasion, however, I am with the honourable memher for Batman, not because I desire the question to be referred to the people, but because I want its settlement delayed.",38
223,Mr HUGHES,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"West Sydney) [9.40] I think that the honourable member for Maranoa has put forth the true reason which actuated the honourable member for Batman in submitting this amendment, and that is to delay the settlement of this question. He seeks, by a parade of democratic principles, to hide those manifold divagations which have obtruded themselves upon the public notice, but which cannot be hidden by this or any other device. He speaks about trusting the people, but he seeks to befool them, although only on one particular point. He will not trust them to say whether he should remain in politics or not- a question which I take it has become a burning one. When he asks, "" Are there not more important questions than the selection of the Capital site?"" I reply, "" Infinitely,"" and "" h e "" is one of those questions which, I hope, will shortly either settle themselves or be settled. If he wants to trust the people on this question, he should give them a chance to express their opinion. New South Wales is a large territory",38
224,Mr WILKS,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,It would take him a good while to go round it.,38
225,Mr HUGHES,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I have been going round New South Wales a good deal, one way or the other, but I do not know all its beauty spots. The Constitution precludes the people of the Commonwealth from giving a fair, unbiased vote on this question, because there is a ring drawn round Sydney, as if it were suffering from the plague, and no place within 100 miles of that city can be selected as a site, for the Federal Capital. The honourable member for Batman has asked the Committee to insert in the clause these wordsbut not until after a referendum of the people . of the Commonwealth shall be taken as to the most suitable site. I propose to ask him to insert in his amendment after the word "" a f t e r "" the following wordssuch an amendment of the Constitution shall have been presented to the people as is necessary to permit of any part of the State of New South Wales being selected as the most suitable site by the people of the Commonwealth at a referendum to be taken at the next general . election.",38
226,Mr TUDOR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Why not give the people a chance to choose a site in Australia, not in New South Wales merely ?",39
227,Mr HUGHES,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Because the Constitution provides that the Federal Capital shall be established in New South Wales. For nearly nine years the Federal Capital has been in Melbourne, and I think that it would be a fair, cheap, and sensible thing if it were established in Sydney. My honourable friend has talked about Dalgety and Canberra. I prefer Yass-Canberra to Dalgety, but if I had a chance I should vote for the place which in my opinion is very much more suitable, and which, if chosen, would save the Commonwealth the expenditure of ,£250,000 during the next five years.",39
228,Mr TUDOR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,What place?,39
229,Mr HUGHES,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Sydney ! If the Commonwealth is going' to erect any buildings in Yass-Canberra during the next five years it will spend that sum. Why should it be spent? It would be absolutely absurd to do so. The people of the Commonwealth, if asked revindicate a preference, - might not know Yass-Canberra from Dalgety. When we ourselves visited the latter place a few years ago, it was only just emerging from its time-honoured designation of Buckley's Crossing. I believe it was not where Buckley crossed, but where he "" fell in , "" and from this we have the phrase "" Buckley's show,"" though it was not a very good show at the best. My own experience has been such that I should not dream of voting for Dalgety. On the occasion of my visit, I noticed that the Chairman of Committees and other honourable members, most of whom voted for that site, were in the coach with the 'blinds down, and never saw anything; and the gentleman on the box seat, who was showing the beauties of the place, owned the country, I believe, for as many miles round as one could see. I said to the sergeant of police, with whom I was riding, "" Good God, is it always as cold as this?"" and, . when he had got me to drop behind a little, he whispered, "" This is the warmest winter we have had for seventeen years."" There were only three men who went into the Snowy River- Mr Miller, the member for Monaro in the State Parliament of New South Wales, the late honourable member for South Sydney, Mr G. B. Edwards, and myself. As for Mr Miller, nothing could kill him. He actually recovered . from an attack of anthrax- a disease wl-l.:h no other human being has ever survived. But its effects upon the average man may be judged by those produced upon Mr Edwards, whose health suffered so severely that he has been out of Parliament for the last three years, and I myself have suffered very seriously. If I had to choose between Dalgety and Melbourne, I should never, dream of voting for the former. Statistics are no guide; doubtless there are men living at the North Pole or thereaboutshealthy men who can subsist on blubber, candles, and food of that sort-bu t I say that, a man who could survive a winter at Dalgety ought to be elected for life. Madrid is described as a place where the people alternately suffer from pneumonia and sunstroke, and. Dalgety is that, only worse.",39
230,Mr TUDOR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Some people are pretty healthy at Dalgety-the honourable member will remember Charlie Hedges.,39
231,Mr HUGHES,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Yes , but he was a lunatic. On the occasion of a visit the place was thronged with men from Snowy River, and the place seems to produce men from Snowy River, who are quite insane, though, I .admit, harmless. I cheerfully agree that there are some gentlemen here who seem admirably adapted for such a climate, but it is not for me to particularize. I decline to ask the people to vote as between Dalgety and Yass-Canberra, when they can never know what Dalgety really is. I say most emphatically that, if any one here really thought the Commonwealth Parliament was going to Dalgety, he would-, give up politics.",39
232,Dr MALONEY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,I for one would not.,39
233,Mr HUGHES,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member did not visit the place-h e knew too much. I think the facts I have cited are sufficient to damn Dalgety a hundred times over, and I ask the honourable member for Batman if he will accept my suggested amendment.",39
234,Mr COON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,I shall.,39
235,Mr HUGHES,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Then I proposeThat the amendment be amended by leaving out all the words after the word "" a f t e r , "" with a view to insert in 4ieu thereof the following words :- "" such an amendment o""f the Constitution shall have been presented to the people as is necessary to permit of any part of the State of New South Wales being selected as the most suitable site by the people of the Commonwealth at a referendum to be taken at the next"" general election.""",39
236,Mr KELLY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Wentworth) [ 9 . 5 3 ] - 1 cannot help feeling that the efforts to bring rabout a referendum for the first time in connection with this question are efforts, not to 1 gain the opinion of the Australian people, but to postpone a settlement for still a further period. Those who support the amendment are not serving the Australian people, but some of the richest interests in Australia, namely, the Melbourne press, who are the most anxious that the settlement of this question shall be postponed. We do not find bitterness shown by the people of this State, but we find it every morning, when this question is before Parliament, in the leaders of the Melbourne daily papers. And why? Because the moment the Commonwealth Parliament goes to the new Capital, the great Melbourne dailies will have to pay a largely enhanced price for the collection of Federal news. Some time ago, I found out that the added cost to the Melbourne Age and Argus of having to report the Federal Parliament from some place outside Melbourne would be £ 1 , 5 0 0 a year each.",39
237,Dr MALONEY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"It would be much less than that if the telephone were used, as in the case of Lord Rosebery's speech on the Budget at Glasgow.",40
238,Mr KELLY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I was simply stating the figures, so far as I was able to get them, representing what these people themselves would anticipate would be the added cost.",40
239,Dr MALONEY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,That is on the basis of the present absurd w'ay of doing the work.,40
240,Mr KELLY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member for Melbourne recognises that, with "" the present absurd method "" of collecting news items, and of being represented at Government Departments, the added cost to those papers would be what I have mentioned. The cost of transmitting telegrams is not the greatest part of the expense. those papers would have to have at least a couple of representatives at a capital outside Melbourne, doing nothing else all the year round but looking after Federal affairs, watching the interests of their papers, and collecting news generally.",40
241,Dr MALONEY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Is that the case now with the Svdney press?,40
242,Mr KELLY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I think each of the Sydney daily papers keeps two representatives in this House, and there may be others in the Senate.",40
243,Dr MALONEY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,That is good for the fourth estate.,40
244,Mr KELLY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Cannot the honourable member see that it is good for the fourth estate in this city that the Federal Parliament should sit here, where the reporters can fit in their gallery work in this build[187]-2 ing with the general work of the newspapers? Those journals, which have clamoured all these years for Dalgety, did not start to clamour lot it until the Premier of New South Wales stated that his State would never grant Dalgety to the Commonwealth. From the moment that they discovered that Dalgety was a safe place to clamour for, we have heard from them nothing but the virtues and merits of that place.",40
245,Mr TUDOR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,The honourable member is wrong. They were in favour of Dalgety long before the New South Wales Premier said that he would not let the Commonwealth have it .,40
246,Mr KELLY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I do not think so; but of course our memories are always subject to error. The Melbourne press is the sole difficulty at the present time in regard to this question. Do honourable members think that the honourable member for Batman would have had the temerity to oppose his own Government if he had not thought there was a still stronger force behind him in his own electorate? What is that force? Is it the force of the suffrages of his own public-the will of his own section of the Democracy-o r is it not purely the self-interest of one or two plutocrats ordering a number of gentlemen, who are willing to sell their intelligences to earn their daily bread, to write certain leaders, which they, on their part, will cause to be disseminated around the honourable member's electorate, and so help that Democrat back to his seat in this Chamber?",40
247,Mr TUDOR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,The honourable member for Batman has as much .right to his opinion on this question as the honourable member Each of for Wentworth had to his on the question of a Military College.,40
248,Mr KELLY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Of course he has. but he has also a marvellous facility for forecasting the leaders of the Age. Even if he is not quick enough to forecast them, he is very rapid in making a good second to them ! We are bound at this juncture to.consider, not the monetary exigencies of the two Melbourne morning ""dailies, but our duty to the people who sent us here. Surely our first duty is to honour the Constitution under which we hold our places. That Constitution clearly lays it down that the Federal Capital shall be within the limits of New South Wales, and that until it is selected the Parliament shall meet in Melbourne. Any man interpreting the spirit of the Constitution can see that we are intended to select in New South Wales a place which complies with all the demands of the Federal agencies, and most likely to meet with the commendation of and give satisfaction to the people of New Soutli Wales. That section was inbers serted in the Constitution in order to meet the objection which the people of New South Wales, rightly or wrongly, felt when asked to enter into Federation. said, "" We have to make too great sacriences fices. "" We are going to get too few benefitsI out of this Federation."" I do not ask honourable members to say that New South Wales was right in that attitude, but I ment. would remind them that it was on account of the complaint that New South Wales was not getting sufficient out tion that she was allowed to have the Capital under the Constitution. If that means anything, it means that the Capital was inpress tended to be of some benefit to that State. much A large part of the complaint recently made it confers, against the choice of Canberra has been that New South Wales is pursuing a purely selfish course in advocating that site.",40
249,Mr MATHEWS,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Sydney , not New South Wales. M.r. KELLY - I presume the honourable member is willing to trust the people of New South Wales as to the choice of a site for the Capital?",41
250,Mr MATHEWS,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Yes .,41

258,Mr MATHEWS,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,I said the interests Sydney predominatect.,41
259,Mr KELLY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member has changed his ground. All these efforts for a referendum are put forth as a last resort to delay the settlement of the question. Some honourable members may vote to delay it out of an honest belief that the best site 1 is has not yet been chosen. On a question like the selection of a site for the Federal Capital, it is possible for honourable memto hold many different opinions, but I believe a large section of those who will support this amendment will be guided purely by the expediency of supporting the They requests of those large capitalistic influwhich govern the press of this city. cannot help saying that, because I believe it, and I commend it to the attention of those who propose to vote for the amend",41

I think too virtues cant altogether is talked about the of the press and the benefits which although that sort of thing may help honourable members at different periods of their careers. There is no question that the two daily papers of Melbourne alone have the greatest interest in this matter, and they are fighting most tenaciously for the selection of Dalgety- a choice which they believe will inevitably postpone the settlement of this question indefinitely. Another paper which advocates the same site is the Sydney Bulletin. What guides it Heaven only knows, but, as it has occasionally changed its opinions, even upon ""so a question as the Tobacco Trust, I hope that even the Sydney Bulletin askmay acquire a farm or two at Canberra, and thus be induced to change its opinion  ?",41
262,Mr KELLY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Exactly . I recollect the triumph which the honourable member is for Mernda scored over the Bulletin, and I quote it with a view to showing that the feverish .opposition of that journal to the of selection of Canberra may possibly be founded upon none too secure a basis. I remember a very violent article which the Lone Hanoi published against the honorhe able member for Mernda-a n article in which he was held up to public contempt of and ridicule. The following week a fullpage advertisement in regard to a certain manufacture appeared in the Bulletin, and the next issue of the Lone Hand contained an apology to the honourable member for Mernda ! Recognising that the Bulletin is susceptible to such influences, I have no doubt it will yet discover that Canberra is a place in which this Parliament .may fitly transact its business",41
263,Mr TUDOR,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Does the honourable member suggest that a couple of full-page advertisements would suffice to alter the opinion of the Bulletin upon this question ?,42
264,Mr KELLY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I do not know what interest the Bulletin has in it from an sition stand-point. But if it be actuated by the same high principles actuated it when it attacked the Tobacco Trust, I dare say that no more inducement would be required to change its opinion upon this question than was required change it upon that occasion. I was taken in saying that the full-page adverquickly tisement to which I have referred appeared only for one week. I think it appeared weekly for a considerable time.",42

268,Mr KELLY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Beyon d the fact that article to which I have alluded contained a number of lies, I admit that I cannot connect it with any statement which the Bulletin has made in regard to Canberra. I trust that no real friend of the Bil l support any amendment which may be subcause mitted in favour of taking a referendum upon this question. All such proposals are submitted only for one purpose-tha of delaying its settlement. I commend the authors of such amendments-thos e ardent advocates of Democracy-to the the Federal Capital? plutocrat's who sit behind the editorial chairs of the two Melbourne morning newspapers. The latter will, doubtless, nise their valuable services, and will their best to make the simple-minded Demofor crats in their electorates at the coming elections.",42
269,Mr WILKS,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Dalley) [10.10] to direct attention to the change which has come over certain honourable members within the past two hours. When the honourable member for Batman submitted his amendment he was deeply concerned that the electors should be afforded an opportunity of expressing their opinion upon this question. He not only made one speech upon it, but subsequently he ingeniously .endeavpured to twist the arguments which oppohad been advanced by honourable members merely who are opposed to it. But in the meanwhich time the honourable member for West Sydney had suggested that he would like to make an addition to that amendment. Thereupon the honourable member for Batto man-realizin g that the Committee did not misfavour his proposal-ros e to the bait as as a shark rises to a piece of pork. He is a very cunning gentleman. He is not concerned ^y_ith whether or not the Constitution should be amended so as to permit of the Federal Capital being established anywhere in New South Wales. All that he desires is delay. Consequently he asks himself : "" Why should I not accept the proposal of the honourable member for me West Sydney ? By doing so - I may get Labour support, and I shall certainly sucand ceed in placing some New South Wales representatives in a most embarrassing posiI tion. "" But in so doing I am satisfied that he will defeat the end which he has in view. The honourable member for West Sydney merely desires that a referendum upon the desirableness or otherwise of amending the Constitution shall be taken at the the coming election, so as to permit of Sydney being made the Federal Capital. But is the honourable member for Batman favourable to the establishment of the Seat of Government in Sydney? Certainly the will honourable member for West Sydney is, behe made that statement in his opening remarks. He declared that Canberra was not the brightest spot in New South t Wales. My complaint is that an embarrassment of riches is to be found there.",42
270,Mr CROUCH,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Why not make Sydney Mf . WILKS - I can imagine the honrecogorable member for Corio bursting his do boiler to get to Sydney. Would he vote establishing the Seat of Government realise their virtues at Sydney?,42
271,Mr CROUCH,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,I would vote for Sydney - I wish in preference to Canberra.,42
272,Mr WILKS,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"The political lives of the honourable member for Corio and the honourable member for Batman would not be worth a moment''S' purchase if they voted in f avour of establishing the Federal Capitheir tal in Sydney. Nevertheless the people Victoria merely desire that the .Seat of Government .shall be located in the best place in New South Wales. The love and trust of the people which was evidenced by the honourable member for Batman lasted for only three-quarters of an hour, beproposal cause he now declares that he is willing to accept the proposal of the honourable member for West Sydney. Is it able to think that we should be able, in practically the dying hours of the session, to pass a Bill through this Parliament viding for an amendment of the Constituable tion vvith .regard to this .question ? If honourable .members believe that Yass-Canberra is not a good site for the Capital, they should vote against it, and not resort to subterfuge to .secure its defeat. It is degrading for an honourable member to cry, ""Let us trust the people; let us have referendum,"" and within three-quarters an hour to support .an amendment providpolitical ing for an amendment of the Constitution. The honourable member for Batman is actfor ing either as a shrewd second-hand dealer or with a true sense of his responsibility as a parliamentarian. He is seeking now to use another weapon to achieve his obing ject. Finding that the numbers are against his proposal, he now desires to make use of the proposition put forward by the orable member for West Sydney, who, my way of thinking, has been too open. His amendment would throw over New South Wales, although his idea is no doubt that Sydney should be the Capital of Commonwealth. I .agree with him that should. But how would such a proposition be received in the other States'? The have a right to try to mould public opinion, just as public men endeavour to do so, and the editor of a Melbourne daily paper is no better and no worse than editor of a Sydney daily newspaper. is fighting for his own hand, and for he thinks is popular in his own State. press of Melbourne probably think that they are voicing the public thought of toria, and the Sydney daily newspapers probably believe that they are moulding, directing, or properly gauging the public opinion of New South Wales. I have quarrel with them; but if I had my choice, Sydney would certainly be the Federal Capital. I believe that the majority of Mr Wilks. the people of Melbourne, when they found that the Capital couldrootbe established-in. own State, would vote for the selecof tion of Sydney. The Constitution, however, stands in the way of its selection, and, after a struggle .extending over nine years, we are endeavouring to secure a final settlement of this question. I cannot - understand the Ministry - accepting such a as *his, and I hope that the Minister of Home Affairs will strongly oppose it. The honourable member for West Sydney reasonhas raised the popular cry of "" Sydney.' r But Sydney is not - now in the balance; the question is whether or not w; are to reach profinality. If Yass-Canberra is an undesirsite, then honourable members should vote - against the'Bill. If the Ministry think that 'the selection of that site would be detrimental to the best interests of Australia, a they ought not to hesitate to oppose it. If - in their inner consciousness they felt that Ithey could not support the selection of fhis a site, they should not have put this Bill of before Parliament in pursuance of a mere arrangement. .1 accept the decision of the Parliament, although I voted! Armidale, - which is further from - Sydney than, any other site that has beer* selected. My electorate is a suburb of Sydney, but I voted for Armidale, believthat the trend of population was northwards; and that fifty years hence Armidale would practically be the centre of populahontion in Australia. I was, however, outto voted. This Bill has just come down from another place, and the honourable member for Batman, after proposing a referendum to determine the question, suddenly accepts the a further proposition for an amendment of it the Constitution. He is "" playing the game."" Does he think we are such fools press as to be unable to recognise that fact? The honourable member for Batman has never visited any of the suggested sites, and I newsask him to say whether he would accept is the Sydney as the Federal Capital? I pause Each for a reply; but he dare not answer; he what dare not say that he would vote for Sydney The as the Federal Capital. He now desires to make shuttlecocks of honourable members. VicWhilst he has a right to express his ownviews, he must not expect to be free from criticism. The honourable member took me v to task for urging that his proposed reno ferendum would involve considerable expense. When I made that statement, I was referring to the cost, - not of printing the ballot-papers, but of conveying the electors to the several sites to enable them to arrive at an honest decision. Unless they made .an inspection of each, they could not do so. The' honourable member for Batman's proposal is one, not to trust, but to fool, the people. I regret that the honourable member for West Sydney has been made use of ; his amendment would' simply mean delay. The honourable member for"" Maranoa said that he would support any proposal that would delay the settlement of this question, but, as an Australian citizen, as a member for a New South Wales constituency, and as a representative of - the people in the National Parliament, I appeal to honourable members to say whether New South Wales has had fair play. If Yass-Canberra has nothing to recommend it, then New South Wales is not so small 'and. mean as to be unable to exist unless that site is selected. She does not appeal' to this Parliament as a mendicant, saying, "" If we do not have the Capital, we shall be: ruined."" Surely if Sydney, or Melbourne; or both cities, are progressing by leaps and bounds, it should be a source of gratification to every Australian. I refuse to allow it to b« said that New South Wales will be injured by not getting the Capital. I do not desire that any one shall vote for the - settlement of this question as an act of grace to New South Wales. I ask only that honourable members shall act honestly and straightforwardly. The Constitution provides that the Parliament shall meet in Melbourne until the Seat of Government has been determined. Surely nine years is a sufficiently long, period to wait for termination? The Canberra site is the only one which, has. commanded the support pf a majority. No doubt it would suit the honourable member for Batman were I to press the claims' of Armidale, while other honourable members suggested other sites. would be glad' to see us fighting and wrangling. Heknows, too, that the amendment of the honourable member for West Sydney will cause still' further delay.",42
273,Mr CROUCH,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,It is not right to say,44
274,Mr WILKS,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"If the amendment of the .honourable member for West Sydney be carried, an amendment of the Constitution must precede the determination of the Capital site question. Mr CROUCH:-Quite so.",44
275,Mr WILKS,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"That is an honest admission. The honourable member claims that next Parliament should have an opportunity to deal with this matter. No doubt he would later suggest that the Parliament following it should have a like opportunity, and so on for ever. This game has been played already in three Parliaments, it being stated each time that, new members having been elected, they should be given an opportunity to visit the sites, and express their opinions upon them. I would rather honourable members say that they are opposed to settling the question, wishing to stay in Melbourne, than that they should put forward these diabolical subterfuges. If the honourable member for Batman, and other Victorian representatives, would say that they are determined that Parliament shall not be removed from Melbourne, I should be prepared to meet them. I have always opposed the referring of complicated questions to the people. Honourable members who advocate the referendum and the press writers who support it know that it is impossible to get a clear expression of the people's opinion on a subject like this. All newspaper writers use the weapons of cajolery and deception. I am not concerned with the view taken by the Bulletin, or with that taken by the Daily Telegraph* Sydney Morning Herald, or Melbourne Argus. Surely a man can make up his own mind without coming under the cover of a newspaper.",44
276,Mr STORRER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Who has done'so?,44
277,Mr WILKS,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Severa l honourable members. As the honourable member for Maranoa has said, it is hypocritical for honourable members to declare in favour of a rea deferendumby way of securing delay. Let us have a straight out vote. I trust that both amendments will be defeated. The honourable member for' West Sydney knows that the Committee is not in favour of his. amendment, although Sydney is pre-emi1 He nently the site for a Federal Capital.",44
278,Dr MALONEY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Melbourne) [10.32] The honourable member for Batman desires that the measure shall not come into operation until a referendum has been taken as to the most suitable site for a capital, while that. the honourable member for West Sydney desires an amendment of the Constitution which will enable the people to choose any part of New South Wales as a suitable site, thus widening their scope of choice.
