ELECTORAL ROLLS.  formation to the effect that in some of the offices of tihe Electoral Registrars there are no rolls of recent date on view, and that in one of these offices the roll hibited is nine years old. I ask the Honorary, Minister if he will see that a copy of the certified roll is placed on view - for the inspection of the public in the office of every Electoral Registrar 1",12
1,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The certified roll is constantly being altered, but the Electoral Registrars are by law required to keep for public inspection a roll embodyMinister ing the most recent corrections within their knowledge. If the honourable memordinary ber will bring under my notice any parduringfchestay ticular case in which this provision has waters ? been disregarded, I shall have the matter made the subject of an urgent inquiry. INVALID AND OLD-AGE PENSIONS make inquiries.",12
2,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"There seems to be in the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Bill no clause defining ""benevolent asylum."" Will the Attorney-General take into sideration the question whether it would not be well to insert in the Bill a definimilitary tion clause ? A definition' may be reister, quired, because it is well known that certain gentleman named Dudley once described Parliament as a benevolent stitution.",12
3,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"I think it would bo better to deal with these questions when the Bill is brought forward for discussion.

4,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I understood from a conversation with my honourable colleague recently that .fchepreliminary promulgating proclamation would be ready almost directly. I shall ask him about it as soon as I have an opportunity. DEFENCE REGULATIONS.,12
5,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"In view of the increasing number of regulations emanating from the Defence Department, I ask the Honorary Minister if he will bring under the notice offcheMinister of Defence the indesirability of having a bound copy of the regulations made for the use of honourable members ? It is impossible for an individual member fco deal' with these exregulations unless they are arranged in consecutive order, and put together ?",12

10,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The opinions of the State Commandants have been expressed and tabulated in the paper referred to, as the result of an instruction by the last Minister of Defence-that they should report on the canteen question after the year's camps had been concluded. I know of no contemplated change of any kind whatever.",13
11,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"The paper that has been circulated among honourable members in regard to military canteens comprises only the reports of the State Commandants. Will the Prime kindly have laid on the table of the House, with a view to their printing, the reports of the officers commanding are the men who really know how a camp is conducted 1",13
12,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I shall ascertain whether there are such reports, and if I find that they exist, I shall be glad to do what the honourable member asks. COMMONWEALTH BANK.",13
13,Sir JOHN PORREST,Unknown,"A few days ago the honourable member for Capricornia asked me whether a list of the permanent officers in the service of the Commonwealth Bank similar to the list of the officers under the control of the Public Service Commissioner could be published. I referred the matter to the Governor of the bauk, and his reply is that the information asked for is confidential, and cannot be made public. Later :",13
14,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Does the think there * is any reason for keeping secret the names of the officials employed in the Commonwealth Bank, and will the right honourable gentleman take into consideration the question of whether there should not be an amendment of our legislation dealing with the Commonwealth Bank to provide that the information now obtainable in regard to all other branches of the Public Service-informatio n as to I the date of their appointment and so forth I - shal l be supplied with respect to officers of the bank?",13
15,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,"I gave the honourable member, in reply to a previous question, the answer that I received irom the Governor of the bank. If it is not satisfactory to him, I shall be quite willing to submit to the Governor any question that he chooses to put on the notice paper. The honourable member knows that the Treasurer has no control over the Governor of the bank. COCKBU RN SOUND NAVALBASE .",13
16,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,"Yesterday I asked the Prime Minister a question, on notice, about the instruction the Government would issue to Sir Maurice Fitzmaurice, and the reply was that a copy of Admira l Henderson's report would be handed to that gentleman. I wish to know whether it is the intention to hand to him a copy of the report without a covering memoMinister randum. If an instruction is to be issued to him, will a copy of it be laid on the table ? who Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I know nothing of any instruction. I told the honourable member in as plain language as I could use what our idea is in getting this oflicer out. 1 do not know what the honourable member wants. If he explains himself precisely I shall try to meet him.",13
17,Mr EISHER,Unknown,Surely the Government has some object in getting out this officer ?,13
18,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I hav© explained our object to the House on a number of occasions. POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT. POSTAL MECHANICS' AWARD - TASMANIA N MAIL CONTRACT-TELEPHONE GUARANTEES. Mr BRU CE SMITH - I ask the Postmaster-General whether, uuder an award of Mr Justice Higgins, the Department Treasurer will now have to pay boys of fifteen or sixteen years of age, who, as apprentices, are learning their business, the sum of £168 a year?",13
19,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"I am advised that, under the award, youths under twenty-one are entitled to the same pay as men of any age, namely, £ 1 6 8 per annum, but I think that part of the award was made under a misapprehension by the Judge, and the Department is applying to him to amend or to rectify it. The application will be heard on the 20th inst.",13
20,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Postmaster-General whether the contract with the shipping companies for the carriage of mails between Melbourne and Tasmania for a subsidy of £15,000 a year has been signed and, if not, whether he will hold it over u n t i l the House has dealt with the motion submitted by the that honourable member for Darwin?",13
21,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"The contract has not yet been signed, but tions have been agreed to, so that I think it would be very unfair to hold it over any longer.",14
22,Mr KENDELL,Unknown,"Will the Postmaster General obtain a report as to the number of country telephone lines erected i toria under the guarantee system on which 2067): a loss to the Department has occurred, and in respect to which the guarantees have had to be enforced?",14

25,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,Certainly . GOVERNMENTPRINTING : PORT I DARWIN.,14
26,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"Seeing that there is no provision on the Estimates for the erection of a Government Printing Office and the provision of a printing plant Port Darwin, will the Minister of External Affairs state whether it is the in tention of the Government to have the Government printing required there done, as in the past, by contract?",14
27,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I have not considered any alteration of the existing policy, and no alteration has been suggested. OLD-AGE PENSIONS.  upon notice Whether it would be possible in the districts to make arrangements to pay the age pensioners their fortnightly allowance by cheque ?",14
28,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,"It is not conknown sidered advisable to do so, as the expense of administering the Act would be much increased. There would be great difficulty in getting receipts, also in insuring payment to the righ t person. GOVERNMENT HOUSE, SYDNEY. that  ister, upon noticeIn view of the fact that Government House, Sydney, has been vacant for the past six months, and is in charge of a caretaker, can the monwealth Government make arrangements with the State Government of New South Wales so the Governor General may occupy the same pending the settlement of the appeal case to be heard by the Privy Council?",14

30,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"Wimmera) [2.49] have in subdivision 2, an item of £8,486 , in respect of "" Building for Den all partment of Treasury and other Departinforments."" The amount appropriated under would this heading last year was £22,750, and the actual expenditure was £29,375. I should like the Minister to explain whether this item refers to the new Commonwealth buildings in the Treasury Gardens. f it does, will the honourable gentleman state whether the estimated cost was exceeded, arid how the cost of this building, which was erected by day labour, compares with the cost of buildings of a similar at character carried out by contract?",14
31,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth-Honorar y Minister) [2.50] - The building referred to by the honourable member has now been completed, and is in occupation by some of the Commonwealth Departments. A good deal of the £8,000 expenditure set down was incurred last year, and the object of the vote is to wipe off practically an old obligation. The original estimate of the cost of the building was £34,000 for the front portion, aud £27,000 for the big wing erected at the country back, or a total estimated cost of old- £61,000. The actual cost has turned out to be £63,000, which must be regarded as very close to the estimate. If I had that the honourable member would require such information as details of comparisons of the cost of buildings erected under different systems I should have been prepared with the information. In the circumstances I have only to say if the honourable member for Wimmera will put the question on the nbusiness-paper I shall be happy to supply the information for which he has asked.",14
32,Mr BRUCESMITH,Unknown,"Parkes) [2.52]. Com- - I do not think the method of supplying information in answer to questions to be asked in this House, as suggested by the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, is a good or a fair one. In matters of this sort we expect the Minister in charge of Estimates to be able to supply the information asked for by honourable members.",14
33,Mr KELLY,Unknown,The honourable member could not expect a Minister to be prepared to supply information as to the cubic cost of erecting all the buildings in the Commonwealth.,15
34,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"I admit that an estimate of the cost of a building by cubic measurement would require to be carefully made by officers of the Department concerned, but usually the Minister in charge of Estimates has a permanent officer of his Department present with all the papers, from which answers may be given on the spot to reasonable questions put by members of the Committee. I should like to know, for instance, what was the original contract for this building, if there was one?",15
35,Mr KELLV,Unknown,There was no contract for the building. It was erected by day labour.,15
36,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"I should like to know, in view of the erection of this building at a cost of nearly £70,000, whether any arrangements have been made as to what is to be done with it in the future? We are about to enter upon the erection of a. Parliament House and public offices at the Eederal Capital. Assuming that their erection takes twice as long as the Government architect has estimated-tw o and a half years-it would seem that we have been erecting a building at a cost of, roughly, £65,000, because there is still a good deal to be done before the offices in question are fully equipped, without any announced prospect of our being able to dispose of it when the Public Departments are moved to the Federal Capital. Though we may embark upon an expenditure of £65,000 in a very light-hearted way, it is a serious item, and I should like to know whether there is any record in the Public Departments of an arrangement with the State Government of Victoria for taking over this building from the Commonwealth.  offices here.",15
37,Mr KELLY,Unknown,It is estimated that accommodation provided by this building will continue to be required.,15
38,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,That is all right; that is what I wished to know.,15
39,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter) [2.55] We must continue to have Commonwealth offices in Melbourne as well as in all the other capitals, and there need be uo trouble on that score. In view of the Minister's statement that the original estimate of the cost of this building has been exceeded by only £2,000, I should like to ask whetlier there have not been some alterations of the plans on which the original estimate was based? The Minister may say whether the difference between the original estimate of £61,000 and the actual cost, £63,000, is not accounted for hy alterations of the original plan ?",15
40,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth-Honorar y Minister) [2.56] - There have been some alterations of the original plan, but nothing of any importance. I have admitted that the actual expenditure is very close to the estimated cost. The actual cost of these buildings is sometimes a little under, and sometimes in excess of, the original estimate.",15
41,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"But there has been additional work carried out for the additional £2,000.",15
42,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Nothin g to speak of.,15
43,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay) [2.57] - I think that the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs might have given a moro frank and direct answer to the question put by the honourable member for Parkes. The building under discussion formed, a subject of controversy inside and outside this House as to the system adopted for its erection. The Vice-President of the Executive Council spent some of his time in another place in saying that it would not have cost one-half as much as it has cost if it had been erected under the contract system. I do not know what view the present Government take of the matter, but I am of opinion that this building is one of the very best in Melbourne, for appearance, equipment, and finish. It is healthy and comfortable, and has been constructed with a view to utility for the conduct of public business. So far from the building being likely to be unused when this Parliament leaves Melbourne for the Federal Capital, my opinion is that it will not be found large enough to accommodate the necessary theofficials of the Commonwealth Government, even though the population should remain as it is at present.",15
44,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,What will it save the Commonwealth in rental?,15
45,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I believe that the amount paid in rents in Melbourne runs to from £10,000 to £11,000 a year for offices occupied in addition to the buildings in question. If we were to leave Melbourne now we should be able to save a considerable portion of the interest on the cost of this building in the shape of rental.",16
46,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The rental paid in the past for the building occupied by the Home Affairs Department, and which might have been reduced, has been £875 a year. Four per cent, on £27,000 would represent over £1,000 annually. I admit that these are much better offices.",16
47,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"They are infinitely better offices. Apar t from considerations of convenience and utility, the erection of this building from a purely monetary point of view has been an excellent in vestment. It must not be forgotten that the loss of time to the public in having the Government offices scattered throughout the city is serious. People coming to Melbourne to interview the Public Departments lose much of their time in travelling between the different offices. I enter my protest against the statements which were made concerning the men who were employed on that building. Honourable members who go before the public and make statements which wilfully misrepresent the position, and who do not withdraw those statements when the facts are borne out by their own Minister",16
48,Mr KELLY,Unknown,There have been no facts produced today.,16
49,Mr FISHER,Unknown,It has been proved that the work was carried out for a very slight increase upon the estimated cost.,16
50,Mr KELLY,Unknown,The estimated cost may have been high.,16
51,Mr FISHER,Unknown,That is a charge by the Honorary Minister against his own officers. What is the suggestion ?,16
52,Mr KELLY,Unknown,What is it? Mr .FISHER - That the permanent officials of the Commonwealth made a high estimate of the cost in order to save themselves.,16
53,Mr KELLY,Unknown,That statement is absolutely unworthy of the honourable member and of the position which he occupies.,16
54,Mr FISHER,Unknown,What were the words used by this responsible Minister? said that the estimated cost may have been high.,16
55,Mr BENNETT,Unknown,There is no doubt about it.,16
56,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Her e is another in stance. The responsible Minister tones down his statement, but the irresponsible member for Gippsland does not.",16
57,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The departmental officers had to give effect to the policy of the late Administration, and erect this building by means of day labour.",16
58,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The late Government accept full responsibility for their day labour policy, and if the present Ministry wish to make out a case against that policy they are at liberty to do so.",16
59,Mr KELLY,Unknown,The honourable member has answered himself now.,16
60,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The Honorary Minister made a blunder. He put his foot in it , and was backed up by the honourable member for North Sydney.",16
61,Colonel RYBIE,Unknown,"I ' said that the estimated cost was based upon the day-labour system, and, therefore, had to be high.",16
62,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I have no doubt that underneath all this quibbling is a desire to get back to the contract"" system. That is the ambition of the Government. What is preventing them from adopting that system ? If they desire to do so, uobody can stop them, seeing that they have tlieir majority. I repeat that the Treasury building is a credit to the officers who designed it , as well as to the workmen who erected it . I believe that it was erected cheaper than it could have been erected under the contract system. A great many honourable members who have criticised it and the workmen who were engaged upon it , have shown themselves desirous of extorting more from labour than they are prepared to return to it . The building will always remain, from the stand-point of appearance and utility, a monument to those who constructed it .",16
63,Mr BRUCESMITH,Unknown,"Parkes) [3.5]. - The ex-Prime Minister has addressed a somewhat heated statement to the Committee under the impression that he was proving the superiority of the day-labour system. Apparently he forgets that the departmental estimate was' based upon the day-labour system. All that he has proved is that the day-labour work did not cost more than the day-labour estimate. He . If an estimate had been made of the cost of the building under the contract system we should probably have seen that it could have been erected for £15,000 or £20,000 less than the amount for which it was constructed by day labour. The honourable member for Wide Bay and his followers may laugh, b ut I propose to place before the Committee one or two concrete instances. I had occasion to mention in the House, the other day, a case in which the Government, doubtless upon the day labour principle, had offered to construct a telephone line a distance of 14 miles for £ 4 8 0 . The people of the district, however, grew so tired of the delay in initiating the work that they carried it out themselves by contract at a cost of £120 . That is to say, they completed the undertaking for 25 per cent, of the departmental estimate.",16
64,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"The cost of the of wire, insulators, and posts is not included in that amount.",17
65,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"This is very interesting. I know for a fact that people who carried out this work took wire from the Government store, that they were charged for it , and that cost of the wire is included in the £ 1 2 W it h in the past month we had a judgshould ment from Mr Justice Heydon in regard to some work which was done in New South Wales. He stated that, according to the admissions of the union representative in Court, one day's piece-work equal to twelve days' day-work.",17
66,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Twelv e days?,17
67,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"He gave, as Ids own judgment, that one day's piecework was equal to twenty days' day-work. I admit that the judgments of Mr Justice Heydon are not as popular as are those of another Judge. But I know very well that he is quite as capable as is nny other Judge on the Bench. am prepared to allow 50 per cent, for exaggeration of witnesses, if necessary, and I say that a very l u r i d light is still thrown upon the difference between contract and day labour. Yet the ex-Prime Minister works himself up into a yeasty frenzy because this work has been completed at no more than the estimate on day-labour principles. U n fortunately, the present Minister cannot give us the information; but I should like to know what would have been the estimate for this particular work if it had been, calculated on the contract principle. I am glad to hear from the ex-Prime M in ister that in putting up this building, no matter how extravagantly it may have been built by day labour, careful consideration was given to the fact that it would be required for Federal purposes, even after the Capital is removed to Canberra.",17
68,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,They are taking up all the staircases again for some reason or another.,17
69,Mr BRUC ESMITH,Unknown,"I remember a picture in Punch of a man who had a wall built by day labour, aud found that it was much out of plumb. A workman came in , and, after inspecting it , said, "" Why , you have been leanin' agin it . "" It is quite possible somebody has been ""leanin' a g in "" the staircases in this new building, so that within a few months the completion of it by day labour, the Government find it necessary to take them out again. When the ex-Prime Minister was congratulating himthe self on the wonderful performance of his the party, I regret that he did not take the trouble, for his own satisfaction, to have the an estimate made of what the building 0 . would cost by contract work; for then we be able to see what it would have cost had it been carried out in that way, instead of by the wasteful principle which the Labour Government adopted.",17
70,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Wide Bay) [3.12] - I was think some one has been leaning against the honourable member.,17
71,Mr FENTON,Unknown,And he has fallen in .,17
72,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Yes , badly. The honourable member is against day labour, and in favour of contract work.",17
73,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,The two largest unions in Australia will not work by day labour.,17
74,Mr KELLY,Unknown,The Opposition W h i p is I against day labour in his own case. He is for piece-work all the time.,17
75,Mr FISHER,Unknown,A little evidence is worth a lot of opinion. I shall quote a statement made by the officials responsible for the construction of public works in Queensland.,17
76,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,I can bring you twenty statements in favour of contract work.,17
77,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The honourable member knows something of work carried out by contract. He remembers the MCSharry case.,17
78,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,So does Mr Justice Barton.,17
79,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Othe r honourable members remember the Robb case. Those were the piping times for contractors. Since then Queensland has done a great part of her work by day labour.,17
80,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,You are going to make a summer out of one swallow.,18
81,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The honourable member will not object to me quoting the present Secretary for Railways in Queensland, who is in no way associated with the party to which I belong, but is a member of a Government that is practically compelled by the arguments advanced by our party to adopt the day-labour principle.",18
82,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,I undertake to quote plenty of cases in an opposite direction.,18
83,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I have no objection, if the honourable member will permit me to put in first the evidence of an adverse witness.",18
84,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Does it refer to railway construction or to buildings ?,18
85,Mr FISHER,Unknown,It refers to railway construction.,18
86,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"That is on a different basis altogether, because there is an element of risk to the contractor in railway construction.",18
87,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Order !,18
88,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Does the Honorary Minister say there is any difference between constructing a railway bridge or a railway station by day labour, and constructing a house or building by the same method ?",18
89,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Certainly .,18
90,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The building is the simpler work.,18
91,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Therefore , the building contractor has not to cover himself against risk.",18
92,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"I must request honourable members, including the Minister in charge of these Estimates, to exercise a little restraint in the matter of interjections, otherwise it will be impossible for Eansard to record the speech of any honourable member.",18
93,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Le t me quote the re ways, in Queensland, on the 25th September, 1912, as reported in the Queensland Hansard, volume 112, page 1291I am handing in, for the information of honourable members, a return prepared in 1897 for the then Chief Engineer of all railways built by him under contract between 1881 and 1893. "" The total expenditure was £5,491,720, the mileage 1,144.94, and the average cost per mile ^4.796This return includes all railways built between 1881 and 1896 in the southern division, a few in the central division, but none in the northern division, as the central division wasonly taken over by the then Chief Engineer in 1887, and the northern division in 1892. A return has been prepared by me of all railways built by day labour since its inception in 1900 up to 1911. The total expenditure was ,£3,413,249, the mileage 1,144.59, and the average cost per mile £2,982."" OPPOSITION MEMBERS - Hear , hear. THE SECRETARY FOR RAILWAYS - The fact that the mileage in both returns is practically the same is merely a coincidence. "" This return includes a ll railways built throughout the State during these years. The total difference in expenditure is £2,078,471 in favour of day labour."" OPPOSITION MEMBERS - Hear , hear.",18
94,Mr KIRWAN,Unknown,"I hope the Liberals in the Federal Parliament will read this. THE SECRETARY FOR RAILWAYS - "" The average cost per mile is £1,814 per mile in favour of day labour."" OPPOSITION MEMBERS - Hear , hear. The SECRETARY FOR RAILWAYS - In case honourable members should think that the statements are not prepared on ""all-fours,""- I have no time to read all the headings-the y will find, as a matter of fact, that in the day-labour statement is included land and resumption surveys, and for some reason that is not included in the contract return.",18
95,Mr HUXHAM,Unknown,What would that amount to'? The SECRETARY FOR RAILWAYS - It would amount to a good sum.,18
96,Mr FOLEY,Unknown,"It is a pity you did not give the wages paid in each case. The SECRETARY FOR RAILWAYS - I cannot possibly read through all this return. "" The difference between the contract and - day-labour cost is increased when it is considered that(a) Between 1881 and 1896, a considerable mileage was laid with lighter rails than was the case in the day-labour period. {&) The day-labour return includes a large mileage in the northern division, where labour and material are more costly than in the southern and central divisions, and where the climate militates against the best work being got out of the men (r) Between 1881 and 1896, timber for bridges and sleepers was more plentif u l , and a more suitable class of labour for railway work was obtainable than between 1900-1911. (a!) Bridges built in the contract period were for 8-ton axle loads only, whilst nearly a ll those built in the day labour period are for 12-ton axle loads, to provide additional strength for heavy rolling-stock. (e) The wages rates generally were higher in the day-labour period than in the contract, and the prices for explosives, cement, & c , & c , had largely increased. (/) A greater number of sleepers per mile were used in the day-labour period than _ in the contract, in the southern division. For the purpose of further comparison, I have token the railways built in the southern division only by contract, and compared them with those built by day labour in the same division. find thatThe total expenditure by contract was {£5,185,144, t n e the average cost per mile £4,882. The total expenditure by day labour was £i,673>653. e mileage 567.89, and the average cost per mile £2,947. As a further comparison, I have taken those railways built by contract and day labour in the same country, and find thatThe total expenditure by contract was £1,025,452, the mileage 241.09, and the average cost per mile £4,253. The total expenditure by day labour was £599,630, the mileage 205.74, and the average cost per mile ,£2,914. Summarizing these figures, I find that(a). Comparing all lines shown in return as being built by day labour, the result is ;£i,8i4 per mile in favour of day labour. (i) Comparing those built by contract in the southern division with those built by day labour in the same division, the result is £1,935 P e r m of clay labour. \c) Comparing lines built by contract with those built in similar country by day labour, the result is £1,339 P in favour of day labour. Taking the saving at £1,000 only per mile, and ignoring the facts mentioned in clause 9, the total saving effected through having built the lines By day labour instead of at the contract rates existing in 1881-1896, would be £1,144,590. These comparisons between day labour and contract could be enlarged, and greater accuracy obtained, if the Chief Accountant were instructed to prepare a table (the books in my office do not contain the information, for reason mentioned in clause 3) showing the cost of lines built by contract throughout the State for, say, twenty years prior to the commencement of the dav-labour system, and comparing the cost per mile with my return of the day-labour cost per mile' during 1900-1911, the accuracy of which return I would invite him to check. This - comparison would largely settle the question,, as the great expenditure and mileage dealt with in both cases would make the average result fairly equitable. Land and surveys have not been included in the statement of contract cost. I have excluded them from the day-labour statement for the purpose of making comparison. converted the miles and chains in the day-labour statement to miles and decimals, to agree with the contract statement."" A very large table follows, which I hope honourable members will peruse before attempt to plunge into this matter with out evidence, relying upon prejudice, honestly believing that if we tract system it would be the means of saving the people's money.

The Government Archi tect and the Director-General of Works are officers whom the Commonwealth should be glad to have at the salaries which they are paid. It is open to the Government to get all information on this subject from their officers. Ministers have already shown their capacity for investigations made with the end of gaining a little kudos for themselves, or of discovering matters detrimental to their predecessors, which might be of in terest to the public and to the press. They are always looking to the gallery to see how the reporters there are regarding them. If there was anything of that nature to be found in relation to this matter it would have been revealed by the Minister. I ask for the fullest publicity for the acts of their predecessors. Our Administration could not be free from errors. No Government, having to create staffs to control the expenditure of an enormous sum of money ou constructional works, and to repair seven years of Federal neglect, could fail to I make mistakes. Such mistakes as were made, however, are such as must be in cidental to all business undertakings, even the best conducted. If Ministers have anything to reveal, I hope that they life. will reveal it during the discussion nf the Estimates.",20
135,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth-Honorar y Minister) [3.35] - The remarks of the Leader of the Opposition had as much to do with the case as the "" flowers that bloom in the Spring."" The question has been raised, rather to my regret, since the matter which it concerns has now been closed, whether day labour should have been employed in the construction of these buildings; but the right, honourable gentleman, with that air of sublime belief in himself which he always assumes, produced evidence totally valueless for its discussion. He seemed astounded when I said that the employment of day labour for the construction of railways had nothiug to do with its employment for the construction of buildings. He asked whether it is iiot easier to make a railway than to put up a building. Of course, it is. why considerations favouring the employment of day labour for the construction of railways do not apply to the erection of buildings. '",20
136,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Why ?,21
137,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Because there is no element of risk in the construction of buildings, against which contractors have to protect themselves. If you wish to make a true comparison of the cost of the day-labour aud contract systems, you must eliminate the element of risk in order to get absolute bedrock contract ' prices. In tendering for railway construction, contractors must always cover themselves against the risk of discovering rock of a different nature from that expected, and against similar risks, aud, therefore, in such contracts, you do not get bed-rock prices on which to make a comparison. In building construction, there are no such risks. That a comparison between the cost of contract work and day-labour work can be properly made in connection with buildings, is proved by the fact that the members of the last Government dared not put the matter to the test in connection with the erection of the Treasury building. When they had a chance to prove that they were right in the contention that the day-labour system was the cheaper, they refrained from doing so. If they knew that they were right, why did they not prove it by calling for tenders for the erection of this building ? Had they been right, the tender prices would have been higher than the day-labour price, but they refrained from calling for tenders. As to the employment of day labour in connection with railway construction, I ask honourable members to defer its discussion until some item affecting railway construction comes forward in the course of the consideration of the Estimates. I rose merely to reply to what was said by the Leader of the Opposition. The fact that when in office he and his Ministers funked a comparison of the day-labour and contract systems in connection with the erectiou of this building is a sufficient answer to the right honourable member, and if he wants a further answer I ask him to apply to the present Minister for Public Works in New South Wales, who, after a Government day-labour orgy extending over a period of three years, is satisfied to hand over railway construction in the State to a private conThat is tractor.",21

139,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Do you rule, sir, that no reference may be made, by ' way of analogy or comparison, to the day-labour and contract systems; that we must confine our remarks wholly to the construction of this building?",21

141,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,That covers everything.,21
142,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"I allowed the Leader of the Opposition to refer to railway construction by way of illustration, but, had I known that he would enter into the subject so exhaustively, I should not have allowed him to refer to it . An incidental reference to railway construction is admissible, but I cannot allow a debate on railway construction generally, or the discussion of the question whether railways should be buil t by day labour or by contract.",21

160,Mr RILEY,Unknown,We stand by that.,23
161,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,My policy is the very opposite. We have a right to demand that public expenditure of this kind shall be put to the test of public tender.,23
162,Mr RILEY,Unknown,It was put to the test years ago.,23
163,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"Quite so; but, since then, the conditions have totally changed. As to the estimates of expenditure made by public officers, we have no guarantee that those estimates are reliable. What I suggest is that we should adopt the principle that has been followed many times in the States-the principle of submitting everything possible to public tender, and allowing the officers of the Public Works Department to put in a tender on the distinct understanding that if it is below that of any outside contractor, the Department shall be allowed to do the work, but that the responsible Minister shall not allow depart from the specifications. The Minister controlling the Department should see, in such a case, that it carries the specifications in every detail, and fils every condition which would have be observed by a public tenderer. If in such circumstances, the Department of Home Affairs could win a contract to out a work by day labour, I , for should have no objection whatever to the work being done by the State, but, until such a test is applied, I shall stand by the policy I have stated, and which I believe has the support of every honourable member on this side.

I am glad to be able to poiut to the consistency of the Leader of the Opposition, who, believing in the principle of day labour, is prepared to have his own work done under that system.

169,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"He replied to the charge before leaving; but when honorout able members make an attack, they ought fulto remain to hear the reply, instead of to hurrying away, as has been done in the , three specific instances I have mentioned.",23
170,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"The honourable carry member for Wimmera had to leave. one, Mr ROBERTS - He had a perfect right to leave if he wished, but some"" degree of decency should be observed in matters of this kind. Having raised a question which was brought prominently before the electors in the most irresponsible way at the last general election, the honourable member should have remained to hear the debate carried to its conclusion. The building which has been the subject of this discussion was erected by day labour, the policy of the Government which started the work, and practically completed it , being that of preference to day labour as opposed to the contract system. We won the elections on that policy, and, during our term of office, observed it to the letter. There were no half-measures with us. We believe that the day-labour system is preferable from the point of view of the taxpayers, in that it gives better work, superior material, more lasting aud more f a it h f vice, and is better from the point of view of the workmen, who are'expected, and, indeed, are required, to give a reasonable return for the money they receive. Under the day-labour system nothing is scamped. There is uo jerry building, no shovelling in of muck where cement ought to be used, and none of the hundrod-and-one things indulged in under the contract system, to the monetary advancement of the friends of honourable members opposite. If illustrations of the way in which contractors have scamped their work, rendered unf a it h f u l service, and sweated their employees, are desired by my honourable friends opposite, they can have them side by side with their statements as to the cost of the day-labour system. day-labour system will be found in the long run to be the superior one. As to the suggestion that it should be put to the test of public tender, I would point out that everything would depend upon the policy of the Government in power for the time being. If , for instance, tenders were called at the present time, the prices submitted would be High, because contractors would know that an immense preference would be given to them by the present Government.",23
171,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,The member does not suggest that the departmental officers would do anything of that kind ?,24
172,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"The officers have nothing to do with that feature. They would simply observe policy of the Government, has declared its preference for the contract system. There is nothing wrong with that. Contractors are not fools, nor are they tame individuals. They will not feed out of your hand, but will take from you all they possibly can. Knowing the policy of the Governmeut, they will tender, and their tenders will be accepted, to the detriment of the general taxpayer. On the other hand, if there should happen to be a Government in power who believe in the day-labour system, and contractors have a reasonable belief that the work may be given to a Department, they will tender at exceedingly low prices, and will lose only a triflin g deposit if they do not subsequently accept the contract. No true test can be made in the way suggested by the honourable member for Wakefield. We have to rely upon the honour of our officers, and I regret very u l sermuch that honourable members opposite should insinuate that they are not honourable men, but will lean one way or another. So far as my experience goes, I say that they are absolutely impartial in the conduct of their work. The Director General of Works, it must not be forgotten, has his reputation as a professional man at stake, and has no reason for leaning either to a Labour or a Liberal Government.",24
173,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,He has to administer the policy of the Government.,24
174,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"The honourable member is referring now to an entirely different matter. There is no need for the Director-General of Works or any other officer of the Government to lean towards the policy of the Government in carrying The out their duties. The Director-General of Works is asked to prepare estimates of a work, aud he does so in accordance with his professional knowledge, and in an uprigh t and honourable way. The building in question is a credit to the officers, and provides the maximum of utilit y to the Departments at the minimum of cost.",24
175,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Is it true that they are taking the stairs out?,24
176,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"It may be. The honourable member, by his interjection, suggests that there is something wrong honourable with the building.",24
177,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,I wished only to know the facts.,24
178,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I know the innocence of the question. There may be some flaw in connection with the building, the but does the honourable member for which Franklin suggest that where a work is carried out by contract alterations have never to be made? I have a vivid recollection that engines supplied to the South Australian Governmeut, under contract, were more often on the stocks than those made in the Government workshops. Whilst, in the first instance, the engines supplied by private contractors might have been ii pound or two cheaper than those made by the Government, i u the long run they cose considerably more than the Government engines, though the latter hauled greater loads and covered greater distances. In South Australia, also, in accordance with a policy with which the honourable member for Wakefield may have had something to do, private contractors were given an advantage of 10 per cent, over and above the Government estimate. It may be that the stairs are being taken out of the new Treasury building, but that does not indicate that the day-labour system is wrong, though I am satisfied that it will be one of the insinuations conveyed from the public platform before long. Coming to the point raised by the honourable member for Parkes, I wish he had remained in the chamber. However, the honourable member has seen fit to fight and run away, perhaps with the hope of fighting another day. He generally makes charges in this House, and then runs away, and continues to repeat them outside without a scintilla of justification, and he invariably misrepresents the true position. This afternoon the Minister stated that the estimated cost of the construction of this building was £61,000, and the actual cost £63,000, but the honourable member for Parkes, in speaking on the matter five minutes later raised the cost to £70,000, adding £7,000 to the actual cost in order to meet his view of the case. When corrected, the honourable member came down to £65,000, still adding £2,000 to the actual cost, according to the official figures supplied by the Minister. I do not propose to refer to the honourable member's statement concerning the honourable member for Wide Bay and the erection of cottages. was no justification for it , but it was on a par with what we commonly hear from honourable members opposite or their paid canvassers outside. They are continually raising bogies, knowing well that a certain percentage of the electors will always be misled by their misstatements, which are discreditable in the extreme, and for which there is no justification. The honourable member for Parkes very much prefers the contract system to the day-labour system in the construction of public works. I can very well understand why, if my reading is correct of the Hansard published by the State Parliament of which he was a member some years ago. There is on record the famous, or infamous, MCSharry case. That was a case between MCSharry and the New South Wales Government in connection with the construction of a railway. When the work was completed, there was a difference of opinion between the contractor and the Government amounting to some hundreds of thousands of pounds. That is not infrequently the case. I believe that there are railway contractors in New South Wales today who are looking to the State Government for some £200,000 for "" e x t r as "" in connection with certain contracts. The honourable member for Wakefield wants a test of tender prices without taking "" extras"" into consideration. Possibly the love of the honourable member for Parkes for the contract system is accounted for in this way: When the New South Wales Government and their contractor MCSharry differed as to the cost of a certain work, the honourable member came in as a sort of attorney, solicitor, arbitrator, or arbitrator's assistant. No one seemed to know what he was at the time. We do know, however, that the honourable member received a refresher of £ 1 6 5s. per day of five hours-no t of eight hours; I hope the honourable member for Wakefield will take a note of that. I do not kuow what the honourable memher got for a start in connection with the matter referred to. It may have been £ 5 0 or £60, but he received refreshers for a couple of years or so at the rate, of £16 5s. per day of five hours, and whether he worked or not.",24
179,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,What does the honourable member for Wakefield think of that? Mr RICHARD FOSTER:-It was real There good pay.',25
180,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"It was; and that, no doubt, is one of the reasons why the honourable member for Parkes is anxious for a return to the contract system. There are little triflin g pickings of this description which go to the friends of the contractors and the supporters of the system.

Assuming the Arbitrator would have permitted an adjournment of a month, to enable another counsel to read up the brief, a fresh fee of about 250 guineas would have had to be paid, with innumerable consultation fees.

197,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"If the Government have anything to complain of in regard to the erection of the Treasury building, why does not the Minister obtain from his responsible officers all the information that is available, and place it on-^the table of the House? During the last election campaign Senator MCColl, who, before the contest, was a dry farmer, walked past two buildings, one of which was being erected by the Victorian Government under the contract system, whilst the other was being erected by the Commonwealth under the day-labour system. On the strength of what he saw while walking past these two buildings, Senator MCColl went into the country and made all sorts of statements detrimental to the Commonwealth structure. Other gentlemen on the same side of politics followed in his footsteps. Paid canvassers did likewise. In fact, the Treasury building was made quite a feature of the political fight in some electorates. It is the duty of the Minister controlling the Department either to lay the ghosts which have been raised, or to prove his case. . Until railway station, Sydney. all the information which he possesses is available-and I venture to say that that information would be produced in a very brief period if it told against the day labour system-honorabl e members opposite ought to refrain from attempting to make political capital out of it . Personally, I think that the building will be a valuable one to the Commonwealth. It will be required, even when this Parliament has quitted Melbourne and is established in the Federal Capital. dentally, I may remark that, unless the Government obtain some Labour support in this Chamber, their proposed expenditure upon the Federal Capital will be reduced.",27

201,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Honourable members opposite are continually suggesting that we do not desire an election, when, as a matter of fact, it is within the power of ' any one of them to bring about a dissolution of this House within forty-eight hours.",27
202,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"South Sydney) [4.20] - I am highly pleased with the finish and workmanship of the new Treasury building. I am' glad to know that in its erection the Departmental estimate of £61,000 has been exceeded by only £2,000. That is a mere bagatelle com-' pared with what the Commonwealth would have been called upon to pay uuder the contract system, had any alterations of design been necessary. Had the building been erected by contract, any such alterations would have been regarded as extras. I would further point out that, in cases where extras are charged, litigation usually follows. A contractor is always pleased to have an alteration made in his plans, because his contract is thereby broken, and he is in a position to charge what he chooses for extras. I feel sure that the Commonwealth will make a mistake if it substitutes the contract for the day labour system. Let me give one illustration. At the present time we are building a parcels post-office near the The contract for its erection was let for £47,000. A f t e r four storeys had been erected, it was decided to put up an additional two storeys. The contractor, of course, had his gear on the job, and he therefore received £18,000 for the erection of the two additional storeys. Then it was resolved to put in a sub-way, for which the Government had to pay £2,500. That building has cost more than £65,000, and the veriest layman who sees it will Inci- say that, from the stand-point of style and finish no comparison can be instituted between it and the new Treasury building in Melbourne. In the latter, there is more accommodation for the public, and the Government have obtained ample mem- value for their money. I regret that towards the end of last session, many sneers were indulged in about'' the man on the job."" The Departmental estimate of the cost of the Treasury building was £61,000, and despite the increased prices of material, it has been carried out for £63,000. The Government are to be congratulated upon this result. I also desire to point out that it is more difficult to construct, a large building than it is to construct so many miles of railway. Y e t more money has been made out of railway contracts than out of building contracts. A man may lose a fortune by accepting a building contract, because the slightest alteration in the cost of labour or materials may utterly dislocate his estimate. He has necessarily to incur a good deal of risk. There are only a certain number of contractors who can tender for the erection of a large building. There may be perhaps a dozen in Sydney, aud a similar number in Melbourne. Let us suppose that tenders are called for a Government work involving the expenditure of £60,000 or £70,000. Tliese men understand each other and work together. If a contractor has his hands full for two or three years ahead, he will not want the contract, aud consequently will put in a very high tender. Thus, these men practically arrange amongst themselves who shall get particular contracts. The Governmeut should, therefore, adhere to the day-labour system. If they do so, I am satisfied that the taxpayers will get the best possible results. At any rate, I shall oppose the adoption of any wholesale system of contract.",27
203,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"Hindmarsh) [4,30] - The blue-books of every State teem with proof of the superiority of the day-labour system over that of contract. To repeat the old arguments in favour of it is really like slaying the slain. In fact, there is* only one reason that I can understand for this recent agitation, and that is the increase of wages among the working classes of the community. The others do not talk of the huge profits made on their side. I recently pointed out that the wealth of this country had increased last year by £150,000,000. The late Government did not do all their work by day labour, and rightly so. There are circumstances when the contract system should be resorted to. The day-labour system will always be of advantage under any Government strong enough to see that fair work is being done, but if we get a Government so miserably weak as to be unable, through its officers, to see that fair and reasonable work is done, then contract work would be of advantage for the time being. I wish to refer to something that occurred in Victoria a few years ago in connection with the celebrated building of railway locomotives at the Newport railway workshops. There was a statement by the Railways Commissioners that they objected to the capital cost of the railways being increased by the huge cost of locomotives, and after much correspondence, Sir Thomas Bent, who was then in power, gave a contract for the building of locomotives to the Newport workshops, as a result'of which the Victorian Government were able to build their locomotives for £21 Is. a ton less than they cost at Ballarat. This is no new matter which the Labour party have invented; we find this on the official records of the Victorian Parliament, on page 10 of the report of the Royal Commission on the cost of making railway locomotives at the Phoenix Foundry, Ballarat, and at the Newport railway workshops. The costs of one engine built at the Phoenix Foundry, Ballarat, are compared with the costs of one built at the Newport workshops. In the case of the Phoenix Foundry, an average of five is taken, the costs being as follow: Works in contract, £3,200; cost of materials supplied by Department, £985: freight, £ 3 5 ; inspection, £ 5 4 ; drawings, patterns, office expenses, &c, £ 5 0 ; total cost per engine, £4,324; total cost per ton, £67 2s. In the case of the Newport workshops, an average is taken of the first ten as follows:-Work s in contract, £2,174; cost of materials supplied by the Department, £1,008; freight and inspection, n i l ; drawings, patterns, office expenses, Seo., £ 5 0 ; total cost per engine, £3,232; total cost per ton, £50 3s. The average costs of the second ten built at the Newport workshops are given as follow:-Work s in contract, £1,921; cost of materials supplied by Department, £980; drawings, patterns, office expenses, &c, £50; total cost per engine, £2,951: total cost per ton, £46 Is. The difference between the locomotive built at Newport and that built at Ballarat was therefore £21 Is. per ton.",28
204,Mr TUDOH,Unknown,The Phcenix Foundry engine cost nearly 50 per cent. more.,28
205,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"How can any one, unless he is perfectly blinded by prejudice or hatred, escape evidence of this character ? And it is merely a sample of the evidence that can be found in all the blue-books of Australian States. Notwithstanding this, we have the plea for contract labour cropping up repeatedly, and the only conclusion I can come to is that contractors have had such a remarkably good innings during the good times, and they are so jealous of the increased wages secured hy the workmen, that they have simply run riot in the matter. I would like an inquiry made into this question, so that the Commonwealth can secure a reporb similar to that I have quoted. It is of no use for honourable members to skite all over Australia without proof of their statements. Here is a record of what has taken place in Victoria, where the capital cost of the railways was loaded up in an unjust way at the expense of the Victorian taxpayers. We should see, as soon as possible, that, in the face of evibig staff of men has been engaged. dence, the capital cost of Commonwealth works is not loaded up by an attempt on the part of the present Administration, in their determination to keep faith with the crowd behind them, to introduce a system which has been a curse to and a tax upon the people.  not sit aud listen to some of the remarks made in advocacy of the day-labour system without giving one or two illustrations on the other side. I u the suburb of Ashfield, Sydney, the Post and Telegraph Department were altering, by day labour, the poles on a telephone line at the same time that the electric light company were altering, by contract, the lighting system from gas to electricity; and the company were putting up five poles to every .pole put up by the Postal Department. That was the evidence of my own eyes, and it is quite convincing that the contract system is a great deal better than the day-labour system. Mr LAIB D SMITH - How many wires did the telephone posts carry?  about wires; I am talking about the poles that were being put up. There were five men. in each gang, and the five men working for the contractor put up five poles for the electric light company in one day. The poles were 5 feet in the ground.",28
206,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,What sort of sinking was it?  cisely the same in both cases. The two gangs were working within a chain of one another.,29
207,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Will you give the specifications for both jobs?  giving the evidence of a hard working man and what I saw with my own eyes. I had a look at the holes, and discovered they were in the same class of country, and both gangs were using the same class of tools. I wish to read an extract from just the Albury Banner, one of the most reputable papers outside the cities of Australia. It reads as followsTHE DAY-LABOUR STROKE - Nearl y everybody in Albury has had something to say regarding the day-labour principle as applied to the work of undergrounding the telephone wires at Albury, and nobody, apart from political advocates of the policy, has had a word to say in its favour. The work has proceeded in the most leisurely manner possible, although a very Much space might be occupied by the publication of local comments that have been made by observant people regarding this much-vaunted principle in the carrying out of public works, as favoured by the Labour party. This is the second local experiment in the day-labour stroke on public works, and it is not unlikely that the second experience will be as costly as the first to the taxpayers. Another large job in the town is being carried out by contract, and the celerity with which the work is proceeding has evoked much comment favourable to that system as against the easy stride of day labour.",29
208,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"That is the evidence of a prejudiced individual.  the Albury Banner. They are commenting on facts as they saw them in one of the most important towns in my electorate, and I have received letters from men in that town, practical men, who know what they are talking about, which led me to submit a question to the Postmaster-General the other day asking whether the Post Office was wedded to the day-labour system. These are the comments going through the length and breadth of the Hume electorate.",29
209,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"Fro m irresponsible people.  men who find the money irresponsible people. He who pays the piper should call the tune. I have simjily pointed out one or two facts on the other side of this question to honourable members who, one after the other, stand up here and laud the day-labour system, when I know that there"" are many opponents of that, system, at any rate in my electorate.",29
210,Mr WEST,Unknown,"East Sydney) [4.45] - I am glad to have ail opportunity to express my views on this matter, and to reply to some of the statements made in regard to day labour. We ought to try, if possible, to act in a business-like manner. I propose to state the result of my experience and study of the question for a number of years, and to adduce proofs that the system pursued by the late Government is the best one for Australia. It is my duty, I think, to endeavour to educate the present Government to the proper way of carrying out public works. There is no doubt that, during the election campaign, many very silly and outrageous statements were made. The question of contract versus day labour is no new one. It has been uuder consideration during the forty years in which I have been acquainted with the public life of New South Wales. Whenever an opportunity has been afforded to really test one system against the other, so far as the taxpayers are cerned, day labour has always come out on top. That system is pursued, not only in New South Wales, but in Germany and France. In Great Britain, the larger councils, like those at London, Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester, and Glasgow, carry out all their works, especially their public utilities, by means of day labour. It must be apparent to an unprejudiced observer that, in employing day labour, there is only one object in view, and that is to carry out the work well and efficiently. A man who takes a contraot to carry out a public work is not actuated by love, for he has no love for his client. He simply seizes the opportunity to enrich himself as much as he possibly can; and why should he not do sot I do not fall out with a man who adopts that course. I can speak from an experience of many contracts as a contractor. But in the capacity of foreman and manager-that is before I engaged in business-I always carried out a contract with the view of serving my employer. If an opportunity arose, or if a flaw in the estimates was found, I availed myself of the opening to enrich the man I was serving, and I would have been a traitor to him if I had not served him in that way. That practice runs through the ramification of contracts. No matter whether it is a contract for the construction of a railway or for the erection of a building, a contractor will try to do as little work as possible. We ought to look at the broad aspect of the question. Honestly carried out and properly supervised, there is no question that the day labour system is the best one for Australia. With the employment of day labour, the Government have the opportunity of obtaining the best mechanics. The best mechanic will not slum his work. It is the experience of not only myself, but of all men who have engaged labour, that the more skilled and capable a man Mr V/est. is the more determined he is not to do jerry work. Every contractor will endorse my statement that it is impossible to get bad work from a good mechanic. The superiority of the day-labour system is pretty well emphasized by an examination of the structure which has been referred to in this discussion. On two occasions I went through the building, and, if my judgment will have any weight with honourable members, I can assure them that the work was carried out in a conmanner creditable to the mechanics employed. We are now told that some alterations are required. The experience of every contractor is that, in the case of a structure of that kind, there is always the possibility of alterations being required to the extent of some thousands of pounds. An architect, whether public or private, endeavours, as far as possible, to ascertain what is in the mind of his client, and sets that out on paper; and when the contract is approaching completion the client' may see that he would like some alterations made to meet the requirements of the structure, and he necessarily has them made. That is - no unusual thing. That does not furnish a reason for condemning the use of day labour in erecting the Treasury building. Some reference has been made to its cost. It is well known that an architect bases the cost of a work at so much per cubic foot; that is, so far as his ability allows him to make an estimate. As a rule, he does not take out the quantities. He gets out a perspective view of the proposed structure, and takes nut a few of the details, and on that information he estimates the cost of the work at so much per cubic foot. No architect gets out an estimate of the actual cost until he passes the plan on to the contractor. Very few architects are able to state what the labour cost is likely to be. It is only by practice that a man can arrive at an estimate. It takes a great deal of time before he can get at the actual cost. The cost of the material, of course, is easily obtained. A quantity surveyor can get out the quantities, but he cannot estimate the actual cost of labour. So that the probable cost of a building is not arrived at until a contract is put into the hands of a contractor. An honourable member on the other side has said, "" Before we adopt the day-labour principle for a public work, we should get a price from a contractor.""What an extraordinary system for the Government of the Commonwealth to adopt-to ask a man who has been out all day supervising a contract to burn the midnight oil, to go through the ordeal of ascertaining the probable cost, and send in a price, in order to be told afterwards that calling for prices was only an experiment on the part of the Government to see what the cost of day labour was likely to be! I do not know where the honourable member picked up such an idea. That is simply a system of persecuting persons, or putting them to unjustifiable expense and trouble, only to be told afterwards by the Government, "" We got the information for the purpose of comparing the cost with the cost of the structure if erected by day labour."" In New South Wales, we have had a great fight for day labour. On every occasion a test has been made, it has been found to be the better system. Some years ago, under-ground tunnels for the telephone lines were laid down by day labour. An inquiry into the work was held, but there was no report made. The honourable member for Parramatta was on the Select Committee. He was so interested in the experiments that he took a very active part in the inquiry. that time, he was one of the champions of day labour. The Select Committee also included our late departed friend, Sir William Lyne. The honourable member for Parramatta actually convinced Sir William Lyne and other members of the State Government that the day-labour system was the best one to adopt for carrying out public works. In every railway contract provision is made to meet things unforeseen, such as a fall of earth. Sometimes the prices are fixed by schedule and sometimes by mutual agreement. The Minister has stated that there is more possibility of loss in the case of a building contract than in the case of a railway contract. My experience is that if a contractor makes out his tender properly, he can hardly lose on a railway contract. I am speaking of a man who has had considerable experience, and has taken the precaution to seek the advice of other persons. Very many things are possible in the case of a building contract that are not possible in the case of a railway contract. When the Minister said there was no possibility of loss on a building contract, he was talking of a matter of which he had no knowledge. In regard to railways, I wish to make an incidental reference to what has taken place in New South Wales. When Mr Griffith took charge of the Public Works Department, he entered upon a defence of the Department in justice to his officers. Honourable members on the other side seem to entertain no respect for the gentlemen who are employed in public offices. If they did, they would certainly be lenient in criticism, because, unfortunately, those persons have no possibility of defending themselves. I know many of the officers in the Public Works Department of New South Wales. I believe that it employs some of the most honest and intelligent men to be found in any portion of the world, and many of them have been my life-long friends. Honourable members on the other side ought to be more careful in regard to some of the statements they make, or the reflections they cast against public officers for party purposes. The extract readsMr Griffith entered upon a defence of his public works policy and the day-labour system. When he came into office, he said, he found that there were a number of highly reputable firms who seemed to have a monopoly of the public works of this State. Amongst the contractors of New South At Wales-and I believe it is the case in the other States-ther e are certain gentlemen who appear to be able to get the ear of the Public Works Department, or to have a better grasp of things. It may be that they are able to grasp clearly the intention of the officers. They certainly seem to have a better knowledge than is possessed by a great many contractors, with the result that the price they put in always comes pretty near to the estimated cost of the work. I know from experience that there was some way in which certain contractors could get a better knowledge than could be obtained by an average man. My advice to a stranger is to be very careful not to tender for a public work until he has gained some experience and knowledge. The report continuesWhere a firm of railway contractors made a profit of over £1.00,000 out of a £300,000 job, he took the view that this profit of £100,000 should remain in the Works Department for the construction of another railway. Mr Griffith was carrying out the pledge that he made to look after the public interests when he took office under the Crown. The Government had been attacked for its day-labour system, and Mr Wade singled aut the Moree-Mungindi railway, and said that the Government had wasted money on it. A seclion of this line, Moree to Garah, was now open to traffic, and, although the Government paid is. a day more, and afforded privileges to the men denied by the contractors, involving a total expenditure of £8,000, it carried out the work for £13,000 less than the lowest tender received by his predecessor in office. Those are facts that honourable members should bear in mind. To give further proof of the advantages of Ihe day-labour system, the Government had called for tenders for the erection of thirty additional cottages at Daceyville; but the lowest tender received was £ n o per cottage more than it cost the Government with its own officers. These cottages cost between £400 and £500, but not more than £600 each. If this Government persists in adopting the contract system, Ministers will not be able to say they were not warned against it by the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition spoke of the great savings effected by the day-labour system in the construction of Government railways in Queensland, but I can give an example of a still more substantial saving i u New South Wales. The following particulars relating to railway construction in that State were compiled by the Chief Engineer for Railway Construction : Taking the whole of the railways constructed from 1897 (when the day-labour system was lirst initiated) up to 30th June of the present year, the following figures show the mileage nnd the total cost of the lines actually completed and handed over to the Commissioner. [As the North-coast line from Dungog to Taree was constructed partly by day labour, and partly by contract, it could not, of course, be included in this comparison.] The books of the Department show that, within the period named, there have been constructed under the contract system 404$ miles of railway, at a cost of £1,744,460, or on average per mile of £4,309. Under the day-labour system, there have been constructed 765 miles of line, at an aggregate cost of £2,540,897, or an average of £3,321 per mile. In the case of ihe contract lines, the total exceeded the estimates by the sum of £229,880 - equa l to 15 per cent-wherea s on the day labour lines the total cost worked out at £282 less than the total estimates. No Minister can give any positive statement as to the exact cost of the work under the contract system, because it cannot be known in advance what the extras will come to. These extras may be due to blunders by departmental officers, or to other things. I have been a contractor, and in some of my contracts have lost money, though doing well out of others. Contracting is a lottery; the contractor puts down his money and takes his chances of making a profit. conditions, changes in the price of material, breakdowns, accidents, and a Mr West. 6 thousand and one things that cannot be foreseen, affect the success or failure of a contract.",29
211,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,F r o m what newspaper was the honourable member quoting?,32
212,Mr WEST,Unknown,"Not from the Worker, but from a Liberal organ which is wholly opposed to the day-labour system. The action of the Opposition in protesting against the adoption of the contract system by this Government is due to the desire of honourable members on this side to prevent loss to the public. As the guardian angels of the public, we wish to keep Ministers on the path that will lead to the country's prosperity and their own salvation. Ministers have shown themselves too anxious to put the late progressive Government at fault, and to find pegs on which to hang complaints against its administration. They have thus overstepped the bounds of decency, and ignored the best interests of the people. As one who has studied these matters, and who has a practical knowledge of construction, I advise them to revert to the day-labour system. I look forward to the time when the industrial community will obtain the full value of its labour. No doubt, there are honourable members opposite who also think that the workers should get a fair return for their labour, and that the wealth of the country should be equitably distributed. Those who hold this view have the right to ask the Government not to adopt the system which will allow individuals to make more than a just profit. In the past, some contractors have become almost millionaires. As a Democrat, and in the interests of my fellow cost men, I , urge the distribution of Government expenditure among as many persons as possible. I hope that aspersions against the workers to the effect that they are guilty of loafing will not be repeated. Instances like that brought forward by the honourable member for Hume 'should have no weight with the Committee. The statement which he read was probably penned at election time, and was due to an exercise of the imagination. We certainly do not know the facts. Probably the honourable member himself does not know who wrote the paragraph that he read. The writer may have had animus against certain men, or may have been Climatic the friend of some one who thought that he should have been given a contract for the work. No such person could be a proper judge of the manner in which the work was done.",32
213,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"^The honourable member's time has expired. Colonel RYRIE (North Sydney) [5.15]. - I have listened to this interesting dissertation on the day-labour and contract systems. In regard to the question of railway construction, I should like to point out that the Minister of Works in New South Wales, Mr Griffith, set out full of enthusiasm to construct by day labour the North Coast railway, bo which the honourable member for Easb Sydney has just referred. Ee found ib necessary, however, to resort to the contract system to carry on the work. The employment of day labour on the North Coast railway was responsible for a very large increase in the cost of construction, and Mr Griffith had to admit that day labour was, in part, a failure.",33
214,Mr WEST,Unknown,The contractor threw up the work.,33
215,Colonel RYRIE,Unknown,"The contractor was bought out because of a land slide. He stood to lose £30,000, but the work was taken over by Mr Griffith, and he did not have to pay a shilling. The Minisber practically made him a present of £30,000, which he was prepared' to lose, and, in addition, bought up his old plant, consisting of a lot of broken-down crocks of horses, and hundreds of barrows, drays, &c, along the line, for which he gave top prices. In reality, therefore, Mr Griffith, made the conbracbor a presenb of aboub £40,000, and took over the contract. If the day-labour system was the success that honourable members would have us believe it was in the construction of railways in New South Wales, how comes it that the Minister of Works in that State, Mr Griffith, recently brought down a Bill to hand over railway construction works in - the Sbabe to Messrs. Norton, Griffiths and Company, a big firm of English contractors?",33
216,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Nothin g of the kind.,33
217,Colonel RYRIE,Unknown,"It is an absolute fact. The Minister proposed to give Messrs. Norton, Grifliths and Company £3,000,000 worth of railway construction works.",33
218,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,The Bill was thrown out.,33
219,Colonel RYRIE,Unknown,I know that it was; but it was not the wish of the Minisber that it should be rejected.,33
220,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Some of his own colleagues voted againsb ib.,33
221,Colonel RYRIE,Unknown,"I am aware of that. But this action on the part of the Minister of Works in New South Wales shows that the day-labour system is not the success which the Opposition would have us believe. The Leader of the Opposition presented figures to prove that day labour was more economical than the contract system. Figures, however, can be made to prove anything. We could bring forward dozens of cases showing that the contracb system is more economical than is that of day labour. As an instance of what happens in connection with the employment of day labour, I would refer to the removal of two trees in front of the Education Department's offices in Sydney. For some time a number of men were engaged in that work, which cost something like £90. I saw the work going on. There were men employed with'little saws-suc h as a lady might use in pruning small trees in her garden-cuttin g off branches bit by bit, and carrying them away. Now and again they seemed to have a consultation. Then a man would spit on his hands, pick up one of these small saws and saw off another little piece of timber. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Would not the honourable member do the same ?",33
222,Colonel RYRIE,Unknown,"If I were employed by the Government on the day-labour system I would probably do so. Indeed, every man would, knowing that he could put on the Government stroke when employed by the State. The good old Government is a fine milch cow.",33
223,Mr WEST,Unknown,This is a slander on the working man.,33
224,Colonel RYRIE,Unknown,"No ; it is only human nature for men to do as little as possible for as much pay as they can gefc, more especially when they are employed by the Government. It was interesting to notice how often these men bhoughb ib necessary bo spit on their hands. They seemed capable of producing a most remarkable quantity of saliva. Given three good axemen, accustomed bo grubbing, I could have removed those bwo brees for £15, and have made money oub of the job. As it was, the work was carried oub by day labour ab a cost of about £90. The day-labour system will result every time in men taking advantage of their being employed by the Government. There is no one to see that they do a day's work for a day's pay. In the case of railway construction, for instance, the men are employed in gaugs, and are all unionists. The ganger himself is a unionist, and is not going to fall out with the men under him, because he knows that if he did his life would be made miserable. We know to what men are subjected if they try to speed up those under them. The longer the job lasts, the longer the ganger will have a good billet, and the longer his pay will continue. Then there is the District Superintendent. He is not going to fall out with the ganger and tbose under him by endeavouring to speed them up. Who, then, is going to speed them up? It is no one's business to do so. There is no - doubt that in such gangs there are honest workmen.",33
225,Mr WEST,Unknown,The honourable member would have a whip behind them.,34
226,Colonel RYRIE,Unknown,"If the honourable member had much to do with workmen he would know that where there are in a gang two or three good men who are prepared to do a solid day's work for their j>ay-me n who are ' ' tigering ' ' into work-tli e others will look at them, and say, ""What are you doing? Do you want to 'nark'' the job? Are you ' smoodging ' to the boss? Go steady."" A good man is not allowed to do a good - day's work.",34
227,Mr WEST,Unknown,The honourable gentleman seems to know all about it .,34
228,Colonel RYRIE,Unknown,"And the honourable member also knows all ahout it. I have just as much sympathy for a bond fide worker as he has, and I think that I would prove a better boss than he would be. In every instance men take advantage of being employed by the Government. TJnder the contract system, however, the contractor keeps an eye on what is going on, and a man who will not do a fair day's work for a fair day's pay is - discharged. Under the day-labour system the position is different; very few men are discharged from a Government job. The "" Government stroke "" is going - on all the time, and undoubtedly the day labour system results in gross extravagance and waste of public money.",34
229,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,West Sydney) [5.24]. - I regret that in discussing this matter we have not the advantage of the patronage of even one Minister.,34
230,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,The Honorary Minister is here.,34
231,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Bu the is not in the chamber. Mr GREENE:-There are two present.,34
232,Mr WEST,Unknown,I think we ought to have a quorum. [Quorum formed.],34
233,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The subject of discussion for some time this afternoon has been the merits of day labour as opposed to the contract system. It would be only fair to ask the Government, since this is a question of policy, and one which, to fchem, is of vital import, to make a statement as to what they propose to do in reference to it . During the election campaign we were ti'eated every day to dissertations about the evils of day labour, and the gross extravagance of the previous Government. We were told that if the Liberal party came into power they would restore the contract system. But now that they have come into power, they are reduced to that pathetic state of ineptitude in this matter which characterizes them generally, and they do not propose to make even a statement in regard to their intentions. And we find their them supported in this attitude by men who were returned because they denounced the day-labour system, and who will yet continue to support them, although they have not the courage to put the contract system into force in one case out of twenty. This policy of substituting contract for day labour, so far aa it is a policy of theirs, has been watered down by them. It is going to be applied with discrimination. It is not to be applied to the construction of railways; it may be applied to the erection of only certain classes of buildings. That being so, day labour is to hold the field, except in certain cases. This is the pathetic position of the Government in this most important matter. The party which, when in Opposition and before the country, declared that the day-labour system was costing the - Commonwealth hundreds of thousands of pounds, which came into power to effect economy, now calmly and shamelessly abandons every pretence at giving effect to a policy which it declares to be the right for one that it declares to be a wrong one. If the day-labour system is wrong, why not end it? Why not denounce it, and furnish us with instances where it has resulted in loss? True, we have had one or two cases cited this afternoon. The honourable member for Hume spoke of some telephone poles and certain public works at Albury, whilst the honourable member for North Sydney gave us a graphic illustration of the manner in which workmen employed by the State Government of New South Wales carried out their duties under the day labour system. But what of that' Are we to accept the statements of those two honourable members as setting forth the reasons that have induced the Government to abandon day-labour for the contract system ? Are we to assume that the present Prime Minister-wh o came into prominence in public life as one who substituted day-labour for the contract system, and who gained, in the Parliament of New South Wales, notoriety and kudos, upon which he lived for years because he substituted day labour for contract-base s his recantation upon what these two honourable members have told ua this afternoon? But if lie has better reasons, why does he not declare them? If the honourable gentleman has any better reason to offer, why does he not tell the Committee what it is? If he knows something which will support his statements to the electors that the day-labour system is a canker, which destroys the fibre of the working men of the country, and under which they sponge upon the public Treasury, and use the State as a milch cow, why does he not tell us what, it is, and act upon the policy upon which he was returned? When we were in office we had the courage to put into force our policy of preference to unionists, because we believed in it . The present Government do not believe in the day-labour system, but they have not the courage even to indicate what their policy is to be. Recently the Prime Minister said that the Government are not in power legislatively, or even so far as administration is concerned. Both these statements are absolutely untrue, but the second is particularly false, because, so far as administration is concerned, the honourable gentleman can decide whether these public works shall be constructed by day labour or under the contract system. I challenge him to give effect to the policy upon which he was returned. If he does not believe in day labour, let him show that he has the courage of his convictions in connection with one thing, at any rate. The honourable gentleman poses as a man of iron in liis allegiance to principle, but when it comes to adhering to principles, when it comes to putting all to the hazard of the die, and doing something which will expose him and his policy to the test of experience, he does nothing. He says that he does it very well; but, in fact, he does it very ill . We have been treated to dissertations - suc h as they were-upo n the many defects of the day-labour system. We were told that its chief defect is that human nature is so constituted that it cannot stand the day-labour system. But how does it differ from the contract system, so far as the workman is concerned? It does not differ at all. The workman is always a day labourer, and works for daily wages. What, then, is this talk about human nature ? Is there something in the nature of a Workman which does not appear in the nature of a contractor ? If there is, what is it ? Are we to suppose that, when the Contractors Association manifested those outpourings of enthusiasm when the Prime Minister and his party were returned to power, that they were animated by pure patriotism, and a philanthropic desire to help the taxpayer ? We know that human nature is as firmly embedded in the contractor as in the workman. We know why the contractors were glad when the honourable (gentleman assumed office. They were glad because they saw again opening before them those Elysian paddocks in which they had fattened at the expense of the taxpayer, but which we had closed to them. But are they glad now, I wonder? The Prime Minister has not even kept faith with them. I do not for a moment deny the statement of the honourable member for North Sydney as to the results of day labour here or there; but for every case that he can mention where a day labourer has not done an honest day's work for an honest day's pay, I will give him fifty cases where contractors have cheated the community, and have cheated the individual; have poisoned him, or attempted to do it ; have sent him to war with guns which were not fit to be used, with saddles in which no man could ride, with stirrupleathers which no man dare trust himself to, with powder that would not stand the test of use, with supplies of food that were underweight and unfit for use. Why, sir, in the list of all the Judases that have ever battened upon this world, the contractor stands at the very head and front. Yet we are asked to believe the workman fleecesfchecommuniby while the contractor protects ib. The conbracb sysbem is now to be elevated to the dignity of a religion, and we are supposed to fall down and worship the contractor. If this bedaubed and bemuddied idol is to be put on the throne again, let us hear something from the Prime Minister as to why it should be so. Why did the honourable gentleman substitute day labour for the contract system in the State of New South Wales? He did so because the contractor was a failure. Why does the honourable member for Wentworth leave out all reference to railways when we are contrasting the two systems of construction? He did so because it so happened that if railways are considered the contrast is most unfavorable to the contractor. The honourable gentleman says that there is something so curious about the construction of railways, that while day labour cannot be trusted in the construction of buildings, it can be trusted to build a railway. It would appear from this that human nature, which is at the same time a very simple and a very complex thing, manifests itself according to circumstances. But I think it may be safely said that honourable gentlemen opposite hesitate bo give us any reason why they are, or are not, going to recommend a change-for we do not know what they are going to do-because the case for day labour has been made so strong by railway and other construction work in Australia that they dare not put the matter fco the tes.t. For every £1 expended on otlier public works, £20 has been expended on railways; and if , therefore, we are able to say that in the construction of railways the day-labour system has more than held ibs own, the onus is upon honourable members opposite to show that day-labour has failed. not deny that it has failed in many instances; but I say that for one case day labour has failed we can find ten cases where the contract system has failed. The honourable member for East Sydney has said that the essential to success under either the contract or the day-labour system is exactly the same, namely, supervision. With proper supervision, the day-labour system will succeed, and wilh bad supervision it will not. Exactly the same may be said of the contract system. I wish to say, in fairness bo the day-labour sysMr Hughes. bem as ib exisbs at present in the Postmaster-General's Department, that there lately came under my notice the construction of a telephone line in New South Wales, and I ask the Postmaster General to supply this House with information as to the rate at which the men of the Telephone .Construction Branch of his Department do their work, and the cost per pole or per mile, whichever is the more suitable unit for comparison. I venture to say bhat these men are a welltrained, good class of men, who do not loaf, and who do as good work as any men in this Chamber, or outside of it, can do.",34
234,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"The honourable gentleman' has asked for a return, but we have not got it ready yet.",36
235,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I do not think that the Postmaster-General should allow the statement made by the honourable member for Hume to pass, as if the honourable member described a typical case of the way in which the public servants of the Commonwealth carry out their work. It may be that one gang in ten dofchethings the honourable member has complained of, but I say that, taking them by and large, the public servants of the Commonwealth do their work honestly and well. I should have liked the Prime Minisber to take sufficient interesb in bhis debate bo bell us something of what he proposes to do. Ib might furnish bim with another text upon which he can hang a discourse later in the week. I suggest to the honourable gentleman, if he did tell the Committee something now, his next discourse would have an advantage, over all those he has previously delivered, in that it would be hung upon some facts, and would have at least some substratum of that which was, or is, rather than of that which mighb be. The honourable gentleman says that I do the policy of the Government is, ' We 1 are going on."" Great Heavens! They wher,e are going on. Going on where? I do not wish to trespass further upon the time of the Committee, bufc I do think that when we are asked to spend money upon public works in this way, we have a right, as representatives of the people, bo know whether the contract system, which we were positively assured by honourable members opposite meant great savings bo the people, is bo be pub in force or nob; or whether, when our friends said that the substitution of the contract for the day-labour system would greatly lighten the burdens of the people, they were only talking with their tongues i their cheeks. There may be, and I hope there will be soon, another opportunity of laying this question before the people. genial ? When it comes, we shall be able to say that all the Prime Minister said concernthat ing the way in which he was going to save the people's money was only so much labour. "" bunkum "" by which he hoped to fool them.",36

That is agreed to by nearly do the work. - everybody, but some honourable members opposite seem to take the view that the nowadays. .Australian people ought to get as much as they possibly can out of the labourer, especially if his work is underground in the trenches. The honourable member for Hume told us that he had done a orable hard day's work in his time, and knew what hard work was. I have no doubt cover their error. that he got away from it as soon as sible. I do not know his history, but probably got into business, and made inoney by buying and selling. I venture to say that the honourable member for Riverina will not assert that ducts of his station are produced without labour, and pretty hard labour at that. The men who build his fences, his rouseabouts, and his boundary riders, all do a fair day's work.",37
238,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Does it not make the orable member for Capricornia tremble think of all this hard work?,37
239,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I can tell the honourable gentleman what I thought on the subject this morning, when I was walking the streets of Brighton. I felt very grateful, indeed, that I had not to hard work that I saw some men doing. I saw a man, employed as a scavenger, ing round from house to house, and l i tins of rubbish, vile smelling in some labourer ? cases, and I felt very grateful indeed bhat it was not necessary for me to all my time in doing that kind of work. I felt very grateful, and I think that should be the attitude of any person is not compelled to work hard. Since State should be an ideal employer, why should it employ detectives to discover when a labourer straightens his back? While something is due by the individual .to society, we must not forget that somen thing is also due by society to the individual. What is there about the life of a labourer in the trenches which is con",37
240,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,I do not think the honourable member's remarks have any connection with the question of day,37
241,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I am discussing the employment of labour in the erection of buildings. Men are required to excavate earth, to carry the hod, &c. If , occasionally, they are found to be taking their n time over a piece of work for the nation, the nation has a remedy through its offiemcers. That remedy is to get machinery to No man can complain of the adoption of labour-saving machinery He would be a very foolish individual if he attempted to do so. I fail to see that we have cause for comor plaint against any labourer if he does pause occasionally in his work. Let hon-. members opposite attempt fco do the work of labourers, and they will soon disWe must view this posmatter from the stand-point of absolute he justice. Whafc is society giving the labourer who works only four hours a day instead of eight hours ? If we consult our mortality tables in order to ascertain how the prolong the labourer lives",37
242,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Thes e observations are too general in character to be connected with this particular item.,37
243,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,I do not wish to take up the time of the Committee unnecessarily. hon The question is whether this building to should be constructed by day labour or by contract.,37
244,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"If the honourable member will connect his remarks in that around way, he will be in order.",37
245,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Organize d society, in the do the shape of the National Government",37
246,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Is the honourable memgober's point that the day labourer has not f t in g to work so hard as has the contract,37
247,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Yes . Nobody should spend ask him to work so hard. There are some contractors who will pay a fair wage for a fair day's work, but there are others who who are actuated by the principles which the are held by the honourable memher for North Sydney, who said that a contractor is entitled to speed up his men. W h at does this speeding up mean? It means that the contractor makes the labourer shorten his life by expending so many more foot tons of energy during each week than he would otherwise be called upon to expend. I do not think there is any justification for the repeated attacks which have been made upon the day labour system. I hope that this building will be constructed by day labour as far as possible. Some honourable members opposite have asked, "" How did you build your house ? Was it constructed by day labour? Did you have the painting of it carried out by day labour ?"" I would remind them that individual members of the community have not a Works Department and a staff to undertake these duties. If a man wishes to paint a house, will he employ a man on day labour, or will he hand over ths work to some decent employer ? The State, on the other hand, has its own Works Department and a trained staff of officials to carry out its undertakings. I have no doubt that there is very little difference between the cost of the day labour and the contract systems. A contractor has to make a profit. If he does not make it out of his estimate, he very often makes it out of extras. Under the day-labour system the labourer has not to work so hard, and the profit that would otherwise go to the contractor is received by him, either in the form of better wages or of lighter work. I hope that the Government will adhere to that system as far as possible.",37
248,Mr FALKINE R,Unknown,"Riverina) [5.55] I would not have spoken upon this item but for the fact that the honourable member for Capricornia has made a personal reference to me. Time after time honourable members opposite give one the idea that all wealth is the product of labour. That is an absolute fallacy. Only the other day, I read, in an English review, an article dealing with the position of workmen in America and in England. It showed that the workmen in England were almost in a state of starvation, simply because their efforts - were not directed by brains.",38
249,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,I am afraid that the honourable member's remarks are far away from the item under discussion.,38
250,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,"Anyhow, I have got in the reference which I desired, and I will now resume my seat. Mr KI NG O'MALLEY (Darwin) [5.56] - I wish to say a few words in regard to the Treasury Building, which has been the subject of-discussion even in the remotest corners of the Commonwealth. It is a great mistake to start by condemning either the day-labour or the contract system. There are times when we can* build a lot cheaper by day labour than by contract, and there are other occasions when we can build cheaper by contract than by day labour. In the latter case we may be far removed from a plant, and there may be a contractor in the vicinity who has a plant which will enable him to undertake the work. The whole trouble is that when we wish to do work quickly we cannot have it carried out hy contract. Why? In the first place, .plans and specifications have to be prepared, and these have subsequently to be submitted to the requisitioning Department. Then tenders have to be called, and this involves further delay, so that the work cannot be carried out as expeditiously as it could be undertaken by day labour. I quickly discovered that when I became Minister of Home Affairs. But the wholetrouble is to be found in the want of system. Day labour is only good if it is systematized. It is good in the Depart: ment of Home Affairs now because it has been systematized. That Department is quite ready to take over the works of the whole Commonwealth. In regard to the Treasury Building, I wish to' say that I purchased the ground on which it stands from the Victorian Government for £7,000. They would not have sold it to a private individual for less than £15,000 or £20,000. The point which I had to consider was whether it was advisable for the Commonwealth to pay £10,000 or £11,000 a year as rental for offices in Melbourne. After discussing the matter carefully with the officers of the Department, I concluded that we ought to have our own building.",38
251,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"Not officers, but gilt-spurred roosters. Mr KI NG O'MALLEY - They are' all changed now. They met a business' man, and they changed accordingly. That is the reason why I submitted a pro-' posal to acquire the block in Sydney uponwhich we might erect our own buildings, which could be let until the Government required them. If the Government need them, they will have the buildings ready.",38
252,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,You are wider off the mark than I was. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The honourable member was describing wealth. Wealth is the product of land with intelligent labour applied.,38
253,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"Order ! Mr KI NG O'MALLEY - I apologize. The idea was to have our own Commonwealth buildings in all the States. The new building in Melbourne has cost £70,000, including the ground, but not including the bullion chamber. actual cost of the building in round figures was £63,000. In addition to this, the ground cost £7,000; and we spent £7,400 on a bullion room. When We move to Canberra, which will be in, at least, seven years' time, this building will contain the whole of the offices of the Commonwealth in Melbourne, for which we are now paying £10,000 a year in rent. The actual cost of the Building, exclusive of the bullion chamber, cubes out at 9fd. per foot. State Government estimated a complete building, with 14,000 superficial feet of floor area, at a cost of £16,000, without fireproof construction-an y person can go down and see it-but , after going into the matter carefully, we found that the building would not suit. We considered it was no use building, as post-offices various buildings have been built, all over Australia, suitable only for villages, We put in a costs system. but of no use when a community grows; so we decided to put up a proper building to house our officers. Our building provides 44,000 superficial feet of floor space, with fireproof construction, at a cost of £63,000. The rental charge of the building,' worked out on the basis of 5 per cent, on the capital outlay on the building and land, is 19d. per square foot. The rentals paid by the Department in Melbourne at the present time average from 36d. to 48d. per square foot.  - chamber cost? Mr KING O'MALLEY - It cost £7,400; making the total cost of the building £70,400; or, with the land, £77,400. But the bullion chamber is - extra. That building could not have been put up by any contractor for less, - nor could it have been built so substantially. I went there every day and saw 4he men working. They were working honestly and conscientiously.",39
254,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,What is the reason for the present alterations? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Something happened to the cement in the front steps; but the company which supplied the cement is now replacing them at its own expense. I do not wish to be hard on the contractor. The best thing in the world sometimes comes out defective without the knowledge of the officials in charge of the production. Something got into the cement that was used- I do The not know the chemical names-and to a slight extent prevented it being worked. The Commonwealth does not wish to be always a tenant. Did we ever know a man go out and fight for a house in which he is a tenant as hard as he would for his own home?,39
255,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"That is right-for the freehold. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I do not care whether it is freehold or not, but I The would rather the Government held the freehold of land, because then I would have more money for building houses and to let on rent.  them. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Yes , I would. In the Home Affairs Departand ment, day-labour work can be carried out as cheaply as in any place in the world. It was about completed when I got the "" royal order of the boot,"" and I handed itover to my successor. I am' glad we did it . When the Chief Architect of the Department was in America he had the benefit of an hour's interview with Mr. Thompson, of the firm of Thompson and Starratt, one of the greatest builders of skyscrapers in the world, pud brought back the latest ideas on system, and we have put them into the Home Affairs Department. That is why the Department is in a position today to tell honourable members every two weeks the cost of material and labour employed on any work. The Honorary Minister can give - a statement like a hank balance if it is required.  tect did not bring back with him some of the gangers on those skyscrapers. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Will my friend say that all contractors aro immaculate ?  Mr KI NG O'MALLEY - In the United States, after spending millions on two warships, they had to knock them oufc as not fit to go to sea, and goingfcotry some of the contractors. I suppose those contractors would have their seats in an aristocratic church on Eifth Avenue.",39
256,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,The contractor who plastered this House should be tried also. Mr KI NG O'MALLEY - The trouble in regard to contracts is the extras. A friend of mine came to me recently with a bill for £400 for extras on a little terrace of cottages. He did not know whether he would have to put his boots up to study Hebrew.,40
257,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"Did you take him ou ? Mr KI NG O'MALLEY - Neve r mind about that. Extras are the curse of contracting. At times, contracting is better than day labour, but it all depends upon the system.",40
258,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Does the honourable member say that day labour would be better than contracting if we could be sure of our specifications, and that they would not be altered? Mr KI NG O ' MALLEY - It all detimber, pends. Before I took charge of the Home Affairs Department, nearly all the small contractors were ruined, because they had to wait so long for their money. I came across one man who was nearly mad. The Department had owed him a few pounds for many months. I said to liim, "" Come here, brother, and I will have a talk with you "" ; and, after a while, I found where liis money was. All that is altered now. An officer settles an account at once. The Minister can tell you now that this has been all arranged. Previously, day labour work was not organized. It was in a state of chaos. To-day, there is no place in the world where better value can be obtained for the inoney than at the Federal Capital. Colonel Miller, the Administrator at Canberra, is a very able and intellectual man. Of course, he grew up in a. Department, and he became twisted in red-tape, but I got it off him after a terrible struggle, and he is all right now. The danger of contract work is in changing the plans. When we let a contract for the Parcels Post Office, in Sydney, we did not provide for the two extra storeys. When I went into the matter, I discovered that it would be wrong to put"" a small building on such valuable ground, and so we decided to put on an additional two storeys. Of course, we had to pay what the contractor asked!",40
259,Mr JOHN THOMSON,Unknown,Why did you they are not think of that at the time?,40
260,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"I was green then; I was an animated rubber-stamp. When, finally, I found that we had made a mistake, we had to pay for it ; but if the work had been going ou by day labour, we could have goue on with it right away. We would have had the plant tliere to do so. However, we had not the plant there. That is why I say the great trouble with contractors is that you have to j>ay extra for every little change you make. It is different when you are working ou the day-labour system. You have a good superintendent, a good boss, a man who has his coat off, and his sleeves rolled up, and walks around. If he finds a workman, not doing his work, he puts him off. You have a system aud time-sheets, making each man keep his own time, witTi a timekeeper going round every twenty hours checking them, and you have a costs system instead of the old method by which the clerk of works had to buy his own and if he required 22 feet timber, and the merchant did not have any 22 feeb lengbhs, timber 25 feet in length was bought, aud 3 feet cut off each piece. The loss is not so much because the little mau gets something extra by loafing an hour or two. That is not where the loss is. The great economic loss is in the purchasing of material, and in the handling of it .",40
261,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"That is so. Mr KI NG O'MALLEY - I was uob long before I discovered that, but, or course, I sat still and looked on.",40
262,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,Why did you not put it right? Mr KI NG O ' MALLEY - I did. It is right now.,40
263,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,It is not.,40
264,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,I left it to my successor.,40
265,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"They put it right. Mr KING O'MALLEY-No . Let the honourable member be honest about this matter. My successor would not make such a statement. Surely we can treat each other here as men. When I was a member of the Pleasant Hour Club, in America, we used to treat each other like men, and not like highway robbers. We come into this Parliament, and cannot say a word in favour of each other. Why? It is because of this cursed party system of which we are frightened. Mr RICHAR D FOSTER - Why do you drop it ?",40
266,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,Why does not the honourable member do so?,41
267,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Order ! This is irregular.,41
268,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"We are all working for the taxpayers of Australia. We ought to act here like the managing board of a big institution, and try to see if we cannot evolve systems and schemes that will benefit Australia and its taxpayers, instead of hating 'each other.",41
269,Mr KELLY,Unknown,That is a well-deserved rebuke for a great deal of what has happened here this afternoon.,41
270,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"I am. not speaking of any side. Take another point. It is very easy to sit down and get out the sections and dimensions, and calculate the cost. There was no costing system in the Home Affairs Department when I went there, but there is now. Let the Minister insist upon the quantities being taken out for every building, and not allow the officers to go out with their plans and start to work, and, if a corner is not right, pull it down, plumb it , and put it up again. That has been the curse of day labour. When the officers have taken out the quantities, let the Minister hold them to the quantities, and make them responsible. Let him go to the contractors and engage their best men. He can always go to the contractors, and, by paying a little extra wages, get their best men; but do not let him overstaff. When there is too big a staff at the top, they are eating up the working men from the bottom. W it h a proper system, there is no doubt in my mind that the Department can put up buildings quite as good as the contractor can do, and save 'his profits. Does a man take a contract as a benevolent despot, or because he is a Christian philanthropist who wants to do good for the community? No ; he takes a contract to make a profit, and I say "" A m e n "" to him. There is no reason why a Government should not carry out public works if they have their buyers and proper supervision for the related branches of engineering or architecture, as the case may be. The whole trouble is that there are too many overlapping officers. There are too many buyers of material, one d r if t in g into another. If the Departments had each a representative [77] works in the Home Affairs Office, the representative of the Post Office could say, not as the draughtsman was drawing, "" You want to put a footway here, or a doghouse there,"" and'then everything would work all right. When one Department gets out a plan and sends it to another Department, the latter gets a message by telephone that the other's oflicer has not come back from somewhere. That is the cause of delay and extra cost. When a Works Department is established under the control of the Minister of - Home Affairs, and the works officer of every Department goes there with authority and sits under the Director-General of Works, and points out what has to be done, day labour will beat the world. That is all I have to say on the. subject.",41
271,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Le t us have this item before dinner, please.",41
272,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Maribyrnong) [6.20] I do not know about letting the Government have the item before dinner. At any rate, I shall'not detain the Committee very long. I believe that the day labour system has resulted in .the saving of thousands of pounds in the carrying out of governmental, municipal, and other public works. The Commonwealth, as an employer, should pay the best wages and offer the best conditions;.then they would obtain' the best workmen, which would result in the best work being done. Those advantages, uuder day labour, have been 'obtained, to a very large extent, in connection with big public undertakings, and I trust that this Parliament will be the last institution to tliink of abandoning such a very fine system as day labour. I wish to endorse the remarks made by the ex-Minister of Home Affairs. There, is one great advantage which must accrue to a big concern like the Federal Government in carrying, out their own works. Whether the material be timber, bricks, cement, or anything else, a very large quantity is always required, and the Government can buy their requirements much more cheaply than any private contractor can possibly do, thus saving to the taxpayer big sums of money. Take, for instance, the use of timber in the construction of offices and other buildings. Unfortunately, most contractors, and even some Government Departments, do not allow the timber they use of its a sufficient time to season. Many of the defects which are noticeable in some of the most recently erected private buildings are due to a shrinkage of the timber owing to its use in a green state. is quite true that a 'private capitalist may not have sufficient money to lay in a stock to be properly seasoned, so that the best services can be got out of the timber when it is placed in the building. the Home Affairs Department, operating, as it does, for the other Departments, has erected a timber-3easoning shed in Maribyrnong. I believe that there is also a timber-seasoning shed on the Capital site, and at Sydney, and other State capitals. Practical men in the Departments, and practical, men outside, agree that these seasoning establishments will be of immense value in the construction of public works in the future. One of the reasons why buildings have lasted so long in older countries is that very well seasoned timbers were used in their construction. The question of purchasing timber and other material, and using seasoned timber, must always be taken into serious consideration. I intend to clude my remarks before the time arrives for adjourning for dinner, because I understand that one of the big bones of contention in the Estimates is to be found at the bottom of the page. will be an unfortunate thing if we cease to criticise when schemes are brought forward, whether by the Treasurer or other members of the Government; but practically every criticism which has fallen from honourable members on the other side today has been a serious onslaught upon the capabilities of public officers, ancl some very unfair aspersions have been cast upon worthy public servants. What does a shire council do when it calls for tenders? Its engineer prepares plans and specifications, and sets down a price, so that, when tenders are submitted, the shire council has its own engineer's estimates to go by when it is considering whether the contractors are seeking to fleece them or not. The same procedure ought bo be followed in the Home Affairs Department; in facb, I believe ib is being followed. expert officers should draw up plans and specifications, and say whab a work is likely bo cosb. Seeing bhat we already have officers of that bype, ib would be a piby, indeed, bo pay them a big salary merely to look afber contractors and see that they make no mistakes in carrying Mr Fenton. out contracts. What we ought to do is to put their abilities and capabilities to the best possible use. Whether it is in conIt nexion with the construction of a railway or a building or an underground tunnel, the best plan is to let the expert officers have a body of capable men at' their service. Ask any contractor in this But or any other city what is their best asset in carrying on contracts, and he will say that it is the well-trained body of men whom he has under his control. If it is a good thing for a private contractor to get round him a well-trained body of men, how much more essential is it , if we intend to be practical, for the Departmenbs bo follow the example of the contractors, and thus save their profits? In Melbourne, there is one body that has been very particular in giving their work to contractors. Persons have had to pay thousands of pounds more into the coffers of the Metropolitan Board of Works simply on account of the immense profibs which conbracbors made in carrying oub works for bhat hody. The Comcon- monwealth has saved such profibs, and ib oughb bo adhere bo that policy. This afternoon, the ex-Prime Minister showed by a quotation that on a certain number of railway lines in Queensland about It £1,250,000 or £1,500,000 was saved. Surely, it is worth the while of this Parliament, if it is wise, to employ the practical men in the Public Departments in carrying out the erection of public buildings! Although a very large number of honourable members, particularly on the Governmenb side, are anxious bo reverb to the contract system, still, I believe that some members of the Ministry know so much about the virtues of the day-labour system that, even bhpugh they may be, so to speak, flogged into a certain position for. a time, they will be very glad to get out of it . As the exAttorney-General has pointed out, they are not showing that boldness which is expected of them. If they believe in the contract system they should say, "" We are not going to employ day labour on public works."" They have not taken The that step, and- I do nob wish to use a threat-the y dare not do it , because the bulk of the evidence is undoubtedly in favour of day labour End against the contract system. I trust that the day labour system will be continued, because that will be the means of saving thousands of pounds to the taxpayers, and securing a better class of work. gards the building about which there has been so much discussion today, I question whether, for the same sum, we could get a similar building erected. No contractor would ever erect a building like that for the same money, notwithstanding that the ex-Minister of Home Affairs excised from his calculation the cost of building a strong-room for the bullion. The alteration of the building for that purpose cost a very considerable sum.",41

That his speech was a most tactless one was shown by the fact that, time. directly he sat down, ten others rose to reply to him. If I might advise him, would suggest that, instead of continually attempting to belittle those on this he should try to give the Committee i formation. The position of honourable members opposite in regard to the confrom tract system is easily understood. They have to stand by the contractors.",43

276,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"The fault I find with the Treasurer is that he has nothing to say on these matters. Sir JOHN: FOBBEST, - This matter is not within my Department.",43
277,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"The Treasurer knows that, had he given us a proper explanation this afternoon, we would by now be half-way through the Estimates. The trouble that has arisen has been caused by his leaving things to his assistant, the Honorary Minister, who tried to show that there was no relevance in what was said by the Leader of the Opposition regarding the advantages gained by the adoption of the day-labour system for the construction of railways in Queensland. We do not know what it would have cost to erect our Treasury building by contract; but I do not hesitate to say that it would have cost considerably more than it did had it been carried out under the contract system. The honourable member for Wakefield tried to introduce a comparison between its cost per cubic foot and that of the Victorian Agricultural Museum close by.

Does the honourable member for Wakefield say that there is any comparison between the State agricultural building alongside of the Com",43
281,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,No .,43
282,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"There is no comparison between them. I saw both buildings almost daily during the whole time that they were in course of erection, and know that in architectural structure and general finish they differ greatly. The Commonwealth building contains a strong-room, which cost an enormous sum, and is built on concrete foundations, for which an excavation was made to a depth of from 18 to 20 feet. Probably the Commonwealth building will be standing long after the building of the Agricultura l Department is in ruins. It is idle to make a comparison between the two buildings, and any statement as to the cost of the building of the Agricultura l Department is useless for arriving at a determination as to what the Commonwealth building should have cost. Mention has been made of the difference between tenders for engines submitted in this State by the Phoenix Foundry- a private concern --and the Newport Workshops- a Government Department. The Attorney General, when I referred to the matter on a former occasion, said that these facts were the best argument we had for the day-labour system. A Commission of experts was appointed to look into the matter. I do not think there was a Labour member on the Commission. The Newport Workshops offered to construct engines for £800 or £900 less than the Phoenix Foundry would do the work for, and the Commission's report was that, adding various shop charges, interest on capital, and so forth, the Newport Workshop's price would still be £400 less than the price of the Phoenix Foundry- a clear admission that a State Department, when properly organized, could do work more cheaply than private individuals. The construction of ten engines was given to the Newport Workshops, and, after the work had been carried out, it was found that, by reason of the experience gained, other engines could be made for £600 or £700 less than the tender of the Phoenix Foundry.",43
283,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,The present Treasurer did a tremendous amount of work by day-labour in Western Australia.,44
284,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"There are many works which, in the public interest, sliould be carried out by day labour to save the contractor's profits. Of course, where there is something to be done in a back-country town, it is not wise for the Government to incur the expense of sending a staff and plant 200 or 300 miles to do the work. In such places local men are best intrusted with what has to be done, because they have material, plant, and labour at command; but in the big cities the Government should do its own work by day labour. I hope that the Treasurer and Attorney-General will see the wisdom of keeping the Assistant Minister quiet in future. If he makes other speeches like that of this afternoon, he will succeed in raising the ire of honourable members on this side, and that will not result in the quicker passing of the Estimates.  rather surprised at the statement made by the honourable member for Kennedy that we are compelled to adopt the contract system. My answer to hini is that we are impelled to do so by common-sense reasons, and by the belief that the affairs of the Commonwealth should be carried on by us just as we would conduct our own businesses. Honourable members, whether they belong to the Liberal party or to the Labour party, when they have any work to be executed, invariably have it carried out by contract.",44
285,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"They do not.  think wise to adopt in connection with our own private enterprises should be equally worthy of application to the business of the Commonwealth. We have learned much from actual experience in New South Wales concerning the advantages of the contract system over that of day labour. The adoption of the day-labour system in New South Wales has increased the cost of Government works by something like 42 per cent., while the time occupied has been in many cases from three to four months, and, in some cases, twelve months, longer than would have been taken had contracts been let for them. This delay has occasioned further loss, since the works are not interestpaying until they are completed. I have some concrete factsand figures to put before the Committee. For instance, when we visited the HMAS. Australia a few days ago, we all saw the car-sheds afc Fort Macquarie. The estimated cosfc of those buildings was £17,000, but the actual cost of erecting them by day labour was £37,000, or (a loss to the country of £20,000. For the construction of the Tabulam Bridge, over the Clarence River, the tender was £9,879, but the cost of building it by day labour was £15,669, or a loss to the country of £5,710. I come now to the Pyrmont Post-ofiice, the tender for which was £2,660, whereas the cost of building it by day labour was £4,509, a difference of £1,849. The tender for the Newcastle Post-office was £19,335, and the cost by day labour £33,000, or a loss of £13,665. The estimated cost of Lyne Park was £7,000, and the actual cost, under the day labour system, £11,427, or a loss of £4,427. Then, again, the tender for the construction of Camden Bridge was £8,238, and the cost of constructing it by day labour £10,284, a loss of £2,046. The tender for erecting a public school at Millthorpe, which is 8 miles from the town of Blayney, in which I live, was £800, but it cost by day labour £1,600, or' a loss of £800, while the time occupied in building it was three months longer than that specified in the conditions of contract. I find that the total of the estimates, or tenders, in respect of these new works was £64,912, and the day-labour cost £113,489, showing a net loss to the counwas try of £48,577, or a difference of 42 cent. No wonder New South Wales is in the market,, because, for every £ that she borrows, she gets only as much as 10s. would have secured under the tract system.   adopt the day-labour system throughout the Commonwealth, I am afraid that Australia will be in the market, and, deed, up for sale. One of my principal objections to the day-labour system that, unfortunately, in many cases, the overseers and men engaged on the do it in their own time, and in their way, because they are' part and parcel one big political machine. That is where the difficulty arises. The sooner we sepathe rate these matters from politics, and adopt a principle that is being observed throughwould out the rest of the civilized world, better. I defy honourable members to point to one civilized country apart from Australia in which the day-labour system has been adopted byfcheGovernment. The sooner we resort fco the rational system of having our public works carried out contract, the better it will be for the payers, whom we represent. Recently, the State Government of New South Wales decided to remove two Moreton Bay fig-trees which stood in front of offices of the Department of Public In struction in Sydney, and, although timber is not very tough, it cost £72 to grub out these two trees by day labour. In conclusion, I would remind my honBay fig. orable friends of the Opposition that two of the biggest organizations in Australia are in favour of the contract system. The first of these is the shearers' organization cut them. - w e all know that the shearers believe in doing their work by contract-and the second is the Coal Miners the coal miners also favouring the contract system. I fail to understand how honourable members opposite can claim to be consistent when they depart from this very excellent rule.",44
286,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Gwydir) [8.9] - I must have been refreshing fco honourable members fco listen to the catalogue which has just been read by the juvenile memthe ber for Calare. It is not the first time that the honourable member has indicated that, in his opinion, everything done by this Parliament, before his electionto i wrong, and that there is no possible per chance of our doing what is right until he is given an opportunity to show how 1 that desirable end may be secured. I do not know what his profession is, but he conevidently poses as an authority on all things. If the honourable member had some knowledge of the question now under discussion, we might have listened to him some attention and interest. But, as showing what his knowledge is, let me relate the facts in regardfcofcheerection inof the Newcastle Post-office- a work with which I am familiar. The reason for is the increased cost was that the Government decidedfcouse a freestone that was Works much harder to work, but far more own durable, than that for which the original of specifications provided. For the increased expenditure, the Department got double value, inasmuch as the stone actually used has double the life of that which have been used under the original the specification. I understand something about this matter, although, perhaps, the honourable member does not. Ee has gone to the Liberal organization authority for his information, andfchafcauthority has never been characterized by truthfulness. by His statements in regard fco other works taxare quite on a par with his assertions in reference to the Newcastle Post-office. The honourable member said that the Moreton Bay fig-tree is not a very hard the timber. Apparently, he does not know that it is about the most difficult tree in the Australia to grub. There is no tree whose roots and tendrils extend further in the ground than do those of the Moreton  to follow up the roots; they would simply",45
287,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"Of course, they would have to take them up when they were going to Association, build on the site.",45
288,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"The Moreton Bay fig-trees which were removed from the front of the offices of the Department of Public Instruction in Sydney were the largest, or nearly the largest, in New t South Wales. They had been there for nearly one hundred years, and every bit of the reserve had to be turned over, and roots grubbed out, in order to provide a proper foundation for the structure to be erected there. These trees could not be felled because of their situation, but t , had to be cut down in sections. In the case of men of the type of the honourable member, however, anything is good enough to use in flogging the Labour Government.",45
289,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"The honourable member for North Sydney said this afternoon that the cost of removing those trees by day labour was £ 9 0 , whereas the honourable member for Calare now says that it was £ 7 2 .",46
290,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"We must take no notice of such discrepancies in the statements of honourable members opposite. Probably, we shall be told presently that the cost was £ 6 0 . It does not matter to honourable members opposite whether the statement is true or not, as long as it will help them to make out a case against the Labour party. TJnder the old contract system in New South Wales, the extras used to amount to from 30 to 40 per cent., but under the day-labour system everything necessary to complete a job is done, whether the specifications provide for it or not, and no extras are shown. In comparing the cost of carrying out works by day labour and by contract, therefore, we should always add a percentage in respect of the extras for which contractors have to be paid. It does not matter to these great authorities, who came into this House about five minutes ago to tell us what we ought to do, that the Queensland Liberal Government of today have proclaimed to the world that they have saved £1,250,000 by adopting the day-labour system for the construction, of railways in that State.",46
291,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,They are going to adopt the contract system.,46
292,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"The present SecreWimmera, tary for Railways in Queensland made that statement, and he declares that, in the opinion of the Queensland Government, the day-labour system is buildings. preferable to the contract system for construction of public works. I have velled over railways in New South built by contractors, and also over those built in more recent years by day labour, and can say that there is no comparison between them. One can tell whether a railway has been built under the day labour system by the smooth running of the train, in the first place, and by finish of the cuttings, which results the saving of enormous expense in tenance. The first cost of a work may not represent either extravagance economy. If the work is thoroughly well constructed, though ' it may cost something more, the subsequent saving in maintenance will be sufficient to cover double the interest on the money expended. I do not say that the day-labour system is everywhere perfect, because it is not always possible to get men who are sympathetic with it to control it , and it is unsympathetic control and lack of proper supervision that leads to increased cost under that system. We have been told that honourable members on this side, when they have any private work to be done, get it done by contract, but that is not so. Honourable members on this side are consistent; they do not preach one thing and practise another; and if they have any. work to be done, and they have not much, they have it done by day labour, and pay award rates for it. The honourable member has told us that day labour does not succeed because it is part of a political machine, but I may tell him that the contract system is undoubtedly a part of the old Conservative machine. The honourable member for Wimmera has suddenly blossomed as an authority upon works of all kinds. I do not know whether his sudden awakening to a knowledge of these things is due to a proposal which is in the air for the establishment of a Public Works Committee. It is possible that that proposal acts as an incentive to some honourable members to pcse as authorities upon public works.",46

He will be able to say. whether this little straw shows which way the wind blows. Thar, a man who has not knowledge and cannot have had any practical experience should discuss such questions is the height of absurdity.

316,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"Bass) [8.29] - I think we are entitled to something definite from the Prime Minister. The honourable gentleman must not forget that during the last two sessions, when he sat on this side of the House, he continually condemned the Fisher Government for what was described as the general loafing that was going on throughout the Commonwealth in connection with public works. Several honourable members on the Government side take objection to what they did in that connection. They protest against the day-labour system, and they have reason to do so because of their utterances when they occupied seats upon this side of the chamber. The Prime Minister was not very careful in the statements which he made on the hustings six months ago concerning the Fisher Government and their alleged lavish expenditure. He declared that they were throwingaway millions by their methods of administration, and that men in the Departments were not earning the money which they were receiving. Seeing that the present Government have now been in office for four or five months, I want to know what is their policy. If the day-labour system is a wrong one, are they going to alter it? Mr W . H . IRVINE - Surely it must pend upon the circumstances of each case.",48
317,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"Honourable members opposite did not say that when they were on the public platform. They condemned the administration of the Fisher Government in wholesale fashion. Seeing that the Ministry have control of the expenditure of millions of pounds, I desire to know whether they intend to confine that expenditure to some eight, ten, or, perhaps, twelve persons in each State-per sons who are large contractors. My own opinion is that the public in general snould participate in this expenditure. The Government should set an example of how our public works should be carried out. They should show private employers how they ought to treat their employees. We all know that if the opportunity presents itself many contractors will put second, and even third , class material into a job. Some contractors have practically robbed the Government in this way, and the work which they have undertaken has been passed by whom ? By interested officers. This circumstance brings vividly to my mind certain happenings in Tasmania some fifteen years ago. At that time, tenders were called for large public works involving an expenditure of £30,000, £40,000, or £50,000, and it was afterwards proved that Ministers and departmental officers were interested in those contracts. I protest against the adoption of a system whereby only four or five persons in a State are in a position to tender for large contracts by reason of the costly appliances which are required. Although the Prime Minister condemned the administration of the Fisher Government throughout Australia, he is content to remain in office, and practically to carry out the same methods of administration. He is anxious only to get into recess. TJnder the contract system, when the Government invites tenders for large public works, the only persons who will be in a position to tender will be those who contribute their £2,000 cheques to certain unions in Australia. Why do they make these contributions ? For the purpose of keeping the working man down. What right has the Commonwealth to give big contracts to these people in order that they may treat the working men as they choose? If the Government have decided to go in for the contract system, I hope that the Prime Minister will notify Parliament of the fact. Then we shall know where we are, and the public will know de- wliere they are. The latter will then be able to judge whether the Government are keeping their hustings pledges or not.",48
318,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"Brisbane) [8.38] The honourable member who has just resumed his seat appears to have overlooked a very important paragraph contained in the Ministerial statement of policy. Paragraph 11 of that document readsAn effort will be made to re-arrange and simplify the duties of the Departments of State, so as to lead to a more expeditious, effective, and economical transaction of public business. It is hoped, by the creation of a General Works Department, to obviate the conflict of authority, and to prevent the tendency to the duplication of staffs, which at present leads to delay and wastefulness in public expenditure. In carrying out public works in the future, it is the intention of the Government to resort, as far as possible, to the contract system. The Government propose to prevent duplication by increasing the staffs for carrying out our public works in every direction. There are already Sn existence certain Departments which have facilities for carrying out our public works, and the Government propose to reduce these, and to establish others in their stead. If there is one thing more than another which shows that the Government are Conservatives in disguise-that they aro merely endeavouring to look like Liberals-it is their proposal to revert to a discredited system in connection with our public works- a system which the nations of the world are doing their best to get away from . To-day every civilized country is attempting to bring about that system of co-operation which will ultimately extirpate the competitive system of which many honourable members opposite are so fond. In every direction there is an increasing tendency to enlarge the scope of State public ownership, and to limit the private ownership and control of public facilities. The Governments of Australia have hitherto managed their public affairs in the most commendable fashion. That mistakes have been committed goes without saying. That events have happened which are open to hostile criticism may be freely admitted. But there is not an honourable member opposite who is prepared to say that our railways would be better run than they are under a system of contract. Public enterprise is covering more and more every department of public life. The States and municipalities are controlling more and more by their own staffs those particular facilities which are absolutely necessary to the development of the public estate-suc h utilities as tramways, railways, light, sanitation, gas, water, &c. What reason is there why the State should not bo able to manage its own business more satisfactorily than somebody else is able to manage it 1 What individuals can do for the community, the community can do better for itself. Every one knows that the contract system is one of those old systems which have grown upon us until now the objections to it are largely the result of its widespread abuse. That system stands condemned by experience. That experience has been purchased at a large price, owing to the rapacity and inhumanity of contractors, whose business it is to get as much as is possible out of their contracts. Every contractor, in stipulating the price at which he is prepared to carry out a certain work, makes provision for incidentals, contingencies, and extras. Under that system, therefore, we are loaded at the outset with an increased cost, which is admittedly unnecessary. I refer to this matter with some limitations, because we all know that there are contractors whose integrity and honour are above suspicion. But, generally speaking, the tendency amongst them is to do the least possible work at the highest possible price, and to put into their contracts inferior workmanship if there is a chance of getting it passed by the departmental officials. The honourable member for Bass made a passing reference to the danger of bribery and corruption under the contract system. If there is any system which has laid itself open to charges of corruption, it certainly is that system. If there is one thing more than another which has rendered it easier for the members of this and other Parliaments faithfull y to discharge their public duties, it is the fact that contractors have not been able, during rgcent years, to get at them so readily as they have been in the past. It is very hard to give specific instances, but every one knows the experience of America in this respect-ho w franchises, contracts, and public works have been bought and sold by members of Parliament through the influence of contractors - and , if only for the sake of preserving the integrity of our Public Service and the purity of our public life, it is a good thing for Governments to do for themselves what contractors, for their own particular purposes, seek to do for them. What are the objections to a Government carrying out work ? Usually, we hear that the objection is the extra cost of Government work; but the Leader of the Opposition has submitted the experience of Queensland in that respect. I do not know whether the right honourable gentleman gave a very interesting quotation from page 2697 of the Queensland Hansard for 1912, where the Secretary of Railways said that a return prepared by the Chief Engineer showed that the cost of maintenance of nine lines built by day labour as against contract was in favour of day labour, thusiContract lines ... £SS per mile. Day-labour lines ... £65 per mile.",49
319,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I did not quote that.,50
320,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"Then it is just-as well that it should be known. I have also the report of the Queensland Commissioner of Railways for the year ending the 30th June, 1913.",50
321,Mr FISHER,Unknown,He is what they would consider a hostile witness.,50
322,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"It is one of their own friends giving evidence against them. Nowhere in his report is there a single suggestion of a return to the contract system. The statistics quoted furnish irrefutable proof of the utility of day labour, and throughout the report there are suggestions for its continuance and improvement. The Commissioner of Railways saysImmediately on my appointment as Commissioner, 1 went very fully into the system of controlling the expenditure on construction works by day labour, and came to the conclusion that it was very necessary that a more direct control should be held over this expenditure than had been the practice heretofore. One of the first requirements in this direction was the establishment of a plant account. Previously, practically no plant account, beyond that kept on the works, existed. I , therefore, arranged for a comprehensive plant account to be opened in the books of the Head Office (Chief Accountant's Branch), and a sub-branch of the Accountant's Branch was formed, termed the "" Construction Branch,"" which deals with all construction works carried out from loan funds, and keeps the necessary plant account, showing the disposal of plant, horses, bullocks, &C, on the various extensions. This enables a very thorough check to be obtained on these accounts; and, in order to obviate any dual control, as far as expenditure accounts on such works are concerned, I arranged to transfer the control of the construction accounts staff the same office, and thus do away with the duplication that existed, owing to certain portions of the accountancy work being performed in the Chief Engineer's Office and also in the Head Office. This important changt I submitted to the Auditor-General for his opinion, who instructed his Chief Inspector and Accountant to investigate the matter from a practical noint of view, both in this office and that of the <Ihief Engineer; and I am pleased to report that he endorsed my action in the following terms :"" That the proposed alteration should work admirably; it concentrates responsibility, obviates dual control of accounts, and should work not only more economically but with greater efficiency. I commend to the Prime Minister the suggestions contained in that report of the Queensland Commissioner of Railways. What is required is, not the abandonment of the day-labour system, but the improvement of the way in which the Government officers carry out that system. The ex-Minister of Home Affairs stated today, and every honourable member knows, that before he left office he instituted a system for the management of works throughout the Commonwealth. His system was on the right lines, and the proposal to abandon it , and give the work out to contractors is a retrograde step, to which I think, all honourable members on this side of the House must, by all means, be opposed. The objection to Government work is based on two grounds. The first is that in Government work we get the Government stroke. I have heard honourable members on the Ministerial side, during the course of this debate, refer to the Government stroke. Opposed to the Government stroke is the stroke insisted upon by contractors-the speeding-up system, the continual j>ressure exerted by contractors on men to get work through. Anything is better than that inhuman and cruel practice of contractors by which they impose on men burdens greater than they can bear. Is it true that there is such a thing as the Government stroke? I freely admit, as the Prime Minister has admitted, that there is extravagance in the Public Service; there is tremendous extravagance; but, even so, and admitting the red-tape of which the Postmaster-General spoke, I believe we get from our public servants, for the money we pay them, value quite up to that any contractor gets from the workmen he employs. There is one thing, at any rate, that can be said about Government work-the to very fact that men are employed in the service of the country develops in them a desire to do better work, and lifts them to a higher level as workmen. The second objection to Government work is that of expense. Possibly it may be more expensive i u some cases to carry out works Tiy the Government than by contractors; but 1 do not think it is actually the fact as a general rule. Contractors must make a profit-it is their business to - do so-and even if only the contractors' profit were saved, the Government would be in pocket. But I contend that by the Government ^carrying out work under f a it h f u l and efficient supervision, better work is done, compensating over and over again for any increased price paid in the first instance. I think it is to the credit of Governments in Australia that where work has been done departmentally there has been more efficient work done, it has been of a higher quality and of a better finish, and a substantial article has been turned out. What is our private experience in regard to contractors ? I suppose we have all had some little experience in this regard. honourable members will not forget what I have already said-that I speak in this matter with some limitation, because there are contractors who are absolutely sound and honest.",50
323,Mr BURNS,Unknown,How can they compete with the others ?,51
324,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"That is the difficulty- It is our experience that ' it is cheaper and better, in the long run, to .select a man and give him the work, trusting him to give us a fair price, than to get the lowest tender, to squeeze the contractors to the lowest figure, and take the job they can turn out when they think they can dodge our supervision and inspection. If we get an honest contractor, and au honest man willing to carry out - work, it is far better, every time, to trust him to do the work and give him an open hand in the matter, than to trust to the tender mercies of the ordinary contractor. May I refer to the contractors dealing with the British Government, especially during the great wars is which Great Britain has been involved ? I need not go farther back than the Boer war. member how these men, who claimed to be patriotic British citizens, robbed the British Government, even in the matter of supplying food to their own soldiers. There is no depth to which contractors will not descend. They have no conscience, no integrity, in carrying out their work. Where Governments carry out their own work, they get far more satisfaction, and they get goods much cheaper, than where they have to trust to the tender mercies of a contractor. May I quote from one authority on this matter? This authority saysWell, if the nation can manage a State University, it can run a packing-house. If it can feed an army, it can run an hotel. If it can build bridges, it can build factories. If it can irrigate land, it can sell groceries. If it can sell postage stamps, it can sell coal. If ft can manage a Navy, it can run telegraphs, telephones, express companies, and railroads. If it can make cannon, it can make stoves. If it can manage experimental farms and agricultural colleges, it can manage farming. If it can pave the streets, it can make the material with which to pave the streets. If the people can run the public schools, they can run factories, or any other public utility.",51
325,Mr FLEMING,Unknown,They cannot make farming pay. I hope,51
326,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"The standard of efficiency is not whether a work pays. If that is the standard the honourable member applies to most matters, they would be dismal failures so far as the nation is concerned. One of the greatest institutions we run is the Post Office. Does it pay? No. Does the Education Department pay? No. The most useful institutions we have-thos e that bind us together and make us really what we ought to be, a nation of individuals interested in each other's welfare-ar e the very ones we expect to pay least so long as we get satisfactory returns from them.",51
327,Mr FLEMING,Unknown,But something must Pay,51
328,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"That is not the standard we fix. It does not matter whether they pay or not. The question is whether the public are being better served. The contract versus day-labour question is simply another development of competition versus co-operation, that, in a few years, will alter not only the government of this country, but also that of every civilized community. Is not the contract system based entirely on the We re- principle of competition? Is not the calling for tenders just one development of the spirit of competition, its object being to try to make one man beat down another? The worse of it is that the tenderers, in competing with each other, have to make their profits out of the labour they employ, or by supplying an inferior article. There is no other way to do it . But contractors are getting cunning; they are discovering that they are being found out; and now they are beginning to see that it is to their advantage to understand one another. There is scarcely an item in the Public Service today which is open to tendering on which there is not an understanding between the tenderers as to who shall get the work. They share the work; they sublet ib; they with each other that one shall and that they shall each get a certain share of the work bo be done. Take printing. Every State ment has its own printing there is not an honourable member in this House, or in a State House, who would propose to abandon the Government tem of carrying out printing and go back to tendering for the work. Why? because the oubside printers are unable to supply good work; but because the Government find they can manage their own affairs better, and with more to themselves, and with considerably ter results to their workmen, than when depending on the system of tendering by public competition. Have we in Australia been so indifferent to the movements of the times as bo be unaware of the tendency among the Governmenbs of civilized counbries bo geb rid of that form of competition, and develop the spirib of co-operation and mutual Honourable members on the side may affect to believe that efficiency is to be gained and expense saved by going back to the contract system, but the time is surely coming, and coming very' quickly, when more and more every Sbabe will abandon that sysbem, and decide nob only bo erecb ibs public buildings, to construct its railways, and to carry out its public utilities of the most general character, but bo geb down even bo the mosb ordinary affairs of every-day life, and supply the communiby wibh bhings which are necessary to existence, under its own direct control. We are bold, of course, that that ineans an army of inexperienced men in charge of affairs. There may be some ground for believing that the ordinary public servant is not a very good manager. Unfortunately, that is not his fault, but the fault of the system under which he works. The ordinary servant has practically no opportunity of developing any' power of initiative. there is anything wrong with our Public Service at all, and if there is any excuse for the statement of the Ministry there is a want of efficiency, and therein. Finlayson. fore a necessity for some alteration, ib is due bo the facb that the Public Service does not offer sufficient opportunity for men to develop their powers and display originality. The Public Service is conducted in a groove. There are wellmarked ruts and well-defined paths. agree Along those paths, and in those rubs, pubtender, lic servants may go, bub they dare not go outside of them.",51
329,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"I ask the honorGovern- able member not to discuss the Public Seroffice, and vice generally.",52
330,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"The inexperience of public servants, if it does exist, and sys- their inability to carry out public works successfully, is due, not so much to Nob lack of ability as to lack of opportunity. If the opportunity is given, I am quite satisfied that, in the Public Service, we have men with both brains and power bo satisfaction carry on public works to the advantage of bet- the community. But we are not limited in that direction. The State can command the besb ability, and the besb organizing power, which is available. Nob only so, bub the Sbabe oughb bo be willing-and I think it is unfortunate that we are not willing-b o pay adequately for brains. Ib is brue, unforbunabely, that private enterprise will offer much higher salaries to interest? get the best men than even the GovernGovernment ment are prepared to offer. The inelasticity of the Public Service in that regard is simply appalling. I believe that if the State were will in g to pay the money required to secure the best brains, it could not only obtain the best men, but develop the best workmen, and secure the best results obtainable; aye, better than could be obtained by private enterprise. The competitive system lives by keeping down the people from whom it derives the strongest support. It is the aim of the Government to secure the highest efficiency, but thab musb be combined wibh a direct and a humane interest in the persons who carry out their work. I think that the standard of public life in Australia has made the Public Service attractive. There is now a number of persons who believe that the Public Service, of the Commonwealth at any rate, is a desirable one public to be in . If The CHAIRMAN - Order ! We are considering public works, not the Public Service. I must ask the honourable memthat ber bo keep bo the ibem before the Committee.",52
331,Mr EINLAYSOKT,Unknown,"I know that, sir, but I am leading up to the last point of my argument. The development of the best that is in our - workmen, the develop- ment of the best and the highest that is in the Public Service, must ever increasingly be the highest duty of the State. The Government of Australia owes a public duty to its servants in. the way of devolving upon them greater responsibility. We can attain that end by continually increasing the bounds of their opportunity, by giving them more and more work to do, by enlisting their ability and their sympathy in the development of all that is best and highest in the interests of the people.",53
332,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"Ballarat) [9.5] I desire to make a few remarks before this item is disposed of, and I shall *not detain the Committee very long. I remember the Prime Minister, when he. was leading the Opposition, quoting an extract from the Argus about "" the man on the job,"" about the man who took four days to dig 5 yards of drain.",53
333,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I never said such a thing.,53
334,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,The honourable member made the quotation here.,53
335,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,NO .  porters did.,53
336,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"I well remember that the Prime Minister did. It was continually urged at that time, and it was urged during the recent elections, that there was a wilful squandering of public money going on under the. day-labour system. According to the manifesto of the Government, that system is to be superseded by the contract system. I feel Very strongly on this question, as I am a strong supporter of the day-labour system. During the short time. I was a memher of it, the Victorian Parliament - a Parliament which has never been controlled by a Labour Ministry, and which for years has been controlled by an anti-Labour party-foun d it necessary, in the construction of railways, to supersede the contract system by the day-labour system. I well remember the time in this State when railways were constructed under the contract system, and the men engaged on the work were getting as low as 5s. per day. Some contractors were making huge fortunes out of the contract system. The Government saw the folly of it, and instituted the butty-gang system, under which men are getting a.t the present time 9 s. per day on railway construction. The introduction of the day-labour system has saved hundreds of thousands of pounds to the people of Victoria. We cannot ascertain the exact figures, but it is not denied by those who have charge of railway construction that the lines are built now much more cheaply, and certainly much more effectively, than they were built previously. If we allow the system of day labour to be superseded in our own Public Service, we shall not have what we have to-dayan ideal employer. I certainly think that both the Commonwealth and the State ought to set an example to private employers. They ought to offer an inducement to men to enter the Public Service, because, if bad conditions are established in the Eederal and State Services, then certainly private employers will come down to those conditions; whereas, if we improve the conditions of public servants, we shall also improve the conditions of those who work foi private employers, and get better work for our money. In America today the piece system is in operation, and in the factories there, if we can believe what we read, it is a rare thing to see men over forty years of age at work simply because of that task system. We already bave the beginning of the system in Victoria. We have a strike in which men are fighting against the introduction of the piece system. They recognise that for a short time they may earn increased wages, but they know from the experience of other countries that it must shorten the lives of the workmen. I remember the honourable member for Darling fighting this question in the Creswick district fully thirty years ago. He fought against the introduction of the contract system in mining, and the big fight which he and others put up then undoubtedly has prolonged the lives of thousands of men in this country. They were defeated on one or two aspects of the question. They had to allow contracting in connection with reef driving. I knew the men who were engaged in that work, as most of them went to school with me, and 90 per cent, of them are lying in the cemeteries in that district. The system shortened their lives by twenty or thirty years. I trust that the Government, notwithstanding their manifesto, will not carry out their declared intention to depart fro m the system which was laid down by the previous Government. wish to remind the Prime Minister that when the State Governments do let a contract they insert minimum wage clauses. They compel the private employer to pay stipulated wages, and prohibit the subletting of work to other contractors. Is it the intention of the Commonwealth Government to see that minimum wage clauses are inserted in all contracts? I understand that there is no provision in any Act compelling the Ministry to take that course, and that it is purely optional with a Minister to do so. The insertion of such conditions in the contracbs would prevent unlimited competition amongst the men. To some extent the men would be provided for, and assured at least a living wage.",53
337,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Surely the honourable member knows that in contracts we specify wages and conditions?,54
338,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"I know that that was the custom of the previous Ministry, and that is what I would expect of them.",54
339,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Before they were ever in office it was done, as the honourable meni; bev ought to know.",54
340,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,Then it was the custom of previous Ministries to insert such conditions in contracts.,54
341,Mr KELLY,Unknown,And of the present Ministry.,54
342,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,The point I want to make is that it is not compulsory on the part of the Ministers to insert these conditions in contracts. I desire to know whether it is the intention of the Ministry to do so.,54
343,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It is our intention to pay the best wages.,54
344,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,That is not the poiut at all. Do the Government in tend to pursue the policy laid down by previous Ministries?,54
345,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Yes ; there will be no alteration.,54
346,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,Do they intend to have minimum wage conditions inserted in every contract?,54
347,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,We hav© been doing that all the time.,54
348,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,The Prime Minister was definite. He said that there is to be no alteration.,54
349,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"I accept the assurance of the Prime Minister. That, to some extent, will minimize the evils of the contract system, and insure at least I a fair and living wage to the workers, but it in no way touches the question raised by the honourable member for Brisbane that, under the task system, men are worked to their uttermost during the whole of the eight hours. I do not believe that it was ever intended that men should be kept at top speed so long, nor do I think that there is any necessity for doing so in the twentieth century . We know that contractors only engage men to make a profit out of them. They will see that the men work their very hardest during the time they are employed, but we shall not get any better work done. Very often that system leads to work being slummed, and causes financial loss to the employers. I regret very much that the Ministry is departing from the day-labour system, and is proposing to employ a body of contractors who will make huge profits out of the Commonwealth. This will not mean any saving to the public. There are only a few men who are in a position to tender for some of the big works that are to be undertaken, and to provide the big deposits that will be required. This will lead to a combine. Arrangements will be made between the tenderers, from which they will benefit, and the State will suffer. But as the Prime Minister has reminded us t h at there will be another opportunity to discuss this matter, and as I am particularly anxious to placate him, so that he may consent to an adjournment next Friday - week, to allow honourable members to attend the South-street competitions, I shall uot say anything more now.",54
350,Mr BURNS,Unknown,"Illawarra) [9.17] - I understand that this discussion was commenced by a supporter of the Government, and I regard it as a challenge to the supporters of the day-labour system, vvhich has been in operation for many years. The Prime Minister, when Postmaster-General of New South Wales, from 1894 to 1896, carried out the construction of telephone tunnels in the main streets of the city of Sydney with day labour.",54
351,Mr RILEY,Unknown,And thereby saved money to the country.,54
352,Mr BURNS,Unknown,"Yes . It was stated by the honourable member for. Calare that the miners and shearers are contractors; but that is not so. Although the miners are employed on piece-work, they are paid tonnage rates, and there is no calling for tenders.",54
353,Mr WEST,Unknown,There is no competition.,55
354,Mr BURNS,Unknown,"No . Then shearers get so much for every 100 sheep shorn, each man being on the same footing, and getting the rate laid down by an arbitration award or an agreement with the pastoralists. The New South Wales Railways Commissioners have been doing work by day labour for a number of years. They are not uuder the control of Parliament, and were employing day labour even before the present Labour Government ca.nje into power. The deviation which got r i d of the zig-zag, and the Glenbrook deviation, were carried out by day labour, and the deviation between Otford and Waterfall is being done by day labour. Commissioners have to make the railways pay, and if the contract system were cheaper or better than the day-labour system, they would adopt it ; but they know that it is not. The Sydney Water and Sewerage Board has also, during the last five or six years, done a great deal of work by day labour. The Cataract dam at the back of the B u l l i mountain, in the struction of which hundreds of men were employed, and which cost thousands of pounds; the Cordeaux dam, at the back of Mount Kembla, and big sewerage works in and around Sydney, have been carried out with day labour. Then, the large emporium of Anthony Hordern and Sons, stretching along Goulburn-street from George-street to Pitt-street, was erected by day labour, the men receiving Is. a day more than was the current rate. A f t e r the work was done, Mr Samuel Hordern declared that some thousands of pounds had been saved by employing day labour instead of letting a contract.",55
355,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The Honourable Angliss, a member of the Legislative Council of Victoria, has all his work done by day labour.",55
356,Mr BURNS,Unknown,"I understand that he had large works at Footscray carried out by day labour. A number of private employers use the day-labour system,. cording to the Sydney Morning Herald . of the 30th June last, the Marrickville Cottage Hospital, in the Lang division, was constructed by day labour. Speaking at the opening ceremony, Alderman W . T. Henson, the president of the institution, quoted figures which went to prove that a saving of over 33 per cent, had been effected by employing day labour, i nstead of letting a contract. He is not a Labour man. He saidWhen tenders were called for the additions and internal arrangements, the lowest tender received was £4,975, the Government - estimate furnished for the work being £5,000. But the Committee considered the figure too high, and decided to have it carried out by day labour. Mr Crothers, of Summer Hill , a retired builder, undertook to supervise the work, recognising the great amount of good the hospital was doing. He assured the Committee that he coulu effect a considerable saving on the lowest tender. His services were accepted, and the work was carried out by him at a cost of £3,361 5s. 3d., a direct saving to the hospital of £1,613 14s. gd. Nor was that all , for over £400 worth of work, which would have been charged for as extras if by contract, was also carried out by Mr Crothers. Therefore, on the finished building, a saving was effected of over £2,000. The Committee of the hospital The has - decided to recognise Mr Crothers' gratuitous services. Here we have an ex-contractor recommending an institution to do work by day labour instead of by contract, thus saving nearly £2,000 on the Government estimate. The honourable member for Bass referred to-night to something that took place in Tasmania a good' many con- years ago. About fourteen years ago the Tasmanian Government called for tenders for the breakwater at Macquarie Harbor. A f t e r the tenders had closed, a Select Committee was appointed by the Tasmanian House of Assembly, and it was discovered that one of the prominent members of the State Government of that day was the actual tenderer for the work, but under an assumed name. The result of this disclosure was that he lost his position. Such occurrences have not been confined to Tasmania. Politicians in New South Wales have been unseated because of their connection with , and participation in , Government contracts. A W. member of the firm of Proudfoot and Logan once represented the district of New England in the State Parliament, and was unseated because of his interest in a State contract undertaken by that firm. The contract system leaves openings for political gerrymandering, and Ac- that is an evil against which we musfc guard. It has been pointed oufc that in Queensland a Conservative Government has for years been carrying on railway construction by day labour, and the Engineer-in-Chief for Railways in that State has shownfchafcfcheadoption of that system has resulted in a saving of thousands of pounds. If a State Government-if municipal bodies, water and sewerage boards, and various other public institutions-ca n successfully carry out their works by day labour, then the Federal Parliament snould be able to do so, and in saying that it cannot, honourable members opposite are only confessing their own want of ability. I shall oppose any return from the day labour to the contract system in connection with Commonwealth works, and I enter my protest against such a proposal.  subdivision 4 we have the item "" Federal Capital at Canberra-Toward s cost of establishment, £285,000."" I wish to test the sincerity of statements made by many honourable members opposite during the recent election campaign, when they made themselves hoarse in decrying the "" dreadful extravagance "" of the Fisher Government. According to them, we had expended, not thousands, but millions, on the Capital site, and this was declared to be a shocking waste of public money. I wish to ascertain to-night whether they propose to support the continuance of this "" wasteful system."" Last year, £137,267 was expended on the Federal Capital, whereas the present Government propose an expenditure of £285,000. I move That the item "" Federal Capital at Canberra - toward s cost of establishment-, £285,000,"" reduced by £147,000. If the proposed vote be amended in this way, we shall bring it down to the "" dreadfully extravagant expenditure "" in which the Fisher Government indulged last year. I have a further reason for this amendment. I fail to see why the electorate of Grey should be treated as it is under these Estimates. It is by far the largest electorate in South Australia, yet the amount proposed to be expended on post-offices there, this year, is £562; or, including re-votes-mone y voted last year but not spent- a total of £1,370. After scanning these Estimates, one is inclined to think that, so far as the Government are concerned, it is a case of granting favours to the victors. A total of £32,000 is provided for post-offices in South Australia, and, of that amount, the electorate of Grey is to receive, including re-votes, only £1,370. Nearly all this expenditure is to take place in the electorates represented by Liberal members in that State. I fail to see why a division should be penalized merely because it is represented by a Labour man; and it seems to me that my only hope of securing a larger expenditure in my constituency is by obtaining a reduction of the proposed vote for the Federal Capital. There is no great hurry in regard to the Capital works. Mr. Griffin, the designer, whose services have been retained to supervise the work of laying out the city, is just about to leave for America, and cannot possibly be back before Christmas, so that the Government will not be able to spend the proposed vote of £285,000 during the nnancial year. Mr AUSTI N CHAPMAN - Then why not vote it?  money to provide for more urgent works in country districts.",55
357,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Did the honourable member apply for any particular works to be carried out?  erection of quite a number of post-officesj but was unsuccessful. I know that in New South Wales it was said, during the election campaign, that the expenditure on the Federal Capital was insufficient; but in South Australia, when I said that ('.he amount voted last year was £110,000, members of the Liberal party and Liberal organizers contradicted me, and declared be that the Labour Government were literally wasting millions on the "" bush Capital."" We shall now see whether these honourable members are prepared to support a proposal by the Government to increase what they then described as extravagant expenditure.",56
358,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Treasurer) [9.35] - I hope the Committee will not accept the amendment. I do not believe in pitting one place against another. Whether the electorate of Grey has been generously treated on these Estimates or not is no reason why we should, at this stage, interfere with a project which has been decided by one or two Parliaments, and has been the settled policy of the country for some time. Honourable members will notice that last year £110,000 was appropriated for this purpose, and £137,267 was expended. They will find - also that, in 1910-11, £50,000 was appropriated for the purpose, and £16,043 expended; and in 1911-12, £100,000 was appropriated, and £68,025 expended. The Minister in charge of* the Department concerned will , I am sure, give honourable members all the detailed information they require, but I have already pointed out in the Budget statement that it is proposed to spend the vote for this year of £285,000 in carrying out work which must be completed before the construction of the permanent buildings of the Capital is entered upon. This money is required for obtaining a water supply from the Cotter River, which must be brought a distance of 10 or 12 miles through pipes, the construction of reservoirs, and of a main sewer and sewerage for a portion of the Capital site. Works are in progress for providing bricks, timber, and other materials required for buildings. An electric plant is being installed, and a weir is to be erected on the Cotter River.",56
359,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,A very large weir will not be required.,57
360,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"It will eventually be a large weir, no doubt, but will not' be very big at the beginning. There aro 650 men employed on the works at present in progress. Honourable members will see from the Budget statement that the expenditure on the Federal Capital to date has been:-In 1910-11, £ 1 6 , 4 1 3 ; in 1911-12, £ 6 8 , 0 2 5; and in 1912-13, £137,267, making a total expenditure to the 30th June last of £221,705. When the amount proposed to be appropriated for the current financial year is spent, it will bring the expenditure on the capital up to £506,705.",57
361,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,Can the right honourable gentleman say what the expenditure for this year has been from the 30th June last to date?,57
362,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,"I have not that information, but it could be easily obtained. I have said that there are 650 men employed on the works at present in progress.  spending £81,000, besides this vote, at Jervis Bay.",57
363,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,"I am speaking now of the Federal Capital. H p to the 30th June, we had expended £169,845 in the purchase of land. The balance of the £600,000 voted for this purpose is available, and no doubt a considerable portion of it will be spent this year. I have not included the expenditure on the Militar y College at Canberra. It is an independent vote, and about £313,024 will have been expended in connection with it by the end of this year. The project for the building of the Federal Capital has been approved by Parliament, and is a going concern. It cannot be expected by any one that a Governmeut coming into ofiice only a few months ago would seek to reverse the confirmed policy of t'he country. The establishment of the Capital is an obligation imposed by the Constitution to begin with. When we entered into Federation, a bargain was made with New South Wales that the Federal Capital should be established in New South Wales territory. That bargain must be kept. Honourable members are aware that a great deal of difficulty was experienced in the . selection of a site, but a site was eventually selected; and if honourable members were to support the amendment, they would be going back upon all that has so far been done. We have been advancing gradually and regularly, and I hope the work of establishing the Capital will not now be interfered with. We should go forward with it , and complaint might much more justly have been directed against the Government for not having provided for a larger expenditure on this account. We have to make up our minds in this matter. We are going to build Parliament House and enter into possession of our own domain at Canberra, or we are not; and if we are, we should set about the work in earnest. That is a matter which the Government must consider; but they have not been able to do more at present than to provide for expeditiously carrying out the preliminary work, in securing a water supply, providing for sewerage and building materials, which is necessary before we enter upon the construction of Parliament House and other buildings to enable us to locate the Federal Parliament at Canberra. I do not think that the honourable member for Grey is in earnest in are moving this amendment. The honourable member - indicated that his object was to try to put some other honourable members in a difficulty. To try to put another member in a difficulty is not a thing to be very proud of.  not help the right honourable gentleman.",57
364,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The honourable member seems to think that one must not express what he desires to say. We are all here on the same footing, but if I have said anything to ruffle the honourable member's feathers, I regret it . I have no wish to do that ; I merely said that to try to put another member in a difficulty is not a thing which an honourable member should do. I hope the amendment will not be agreed to.",57
365,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"Werriwa) [9.42] - It is indeed with very great reluctance that I rise to suppoit the amendment, because I am one of those who, over eleven years ago, pointed out that the first thing which should be done was to have a referendum on the question of striking out the condition that the Eederal Capital should not be established within 100 miles of Sydney. I have not the slightest doubt that, had that proposal been agreed to, every one would have seen that it was a right and proper thing to do. We are now going on with the building of a bush Capital. I never thought that was a good thing to do, and I do not think so now; but, the country having been committed to it , I do not see how we can very well go back. I think the honourable member for Grey will have to agree with other honourable members on that point. I am sorry to say that, when I proposed the resolution to which I refer nearly twelve years ago, I got little or no support. Mr Skene, the honourable member for Grampians at that time, took the same view of the matter as I did ; but we stood so much alone that we had to give up the proposal. The matter has since drifted on, until we have already spent about £400,000 at Canberra, and there is, perhaps, another £80,000 or £100,000 of expenditure at the site for which we are liable. I suppose £500,000 has been spent there. Unless the honourable member for Grey believes that the whole of the States are prepared to support him, I do not think that he ought to press his proposal. As the Treasurer has put it , we must either knock the whole project on the head, or we must proceed with it . I am afraid that the general opinion is that we are bound to proceed with it , and, in these circumstances, the sooner this Parliament-is located there the better.",58
366,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,I thought that the orable member would support any proposal to reduce taxation ?,58
367,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"I will support any proposal tb reduce taxation, and any measure which, when taxation is imposed, will cause that taxation to pass into the Treasury instead of into the pockets of private individuals. I regret that the honourable member would not assist me to insure this in connection with the sugar bounty.",58
368,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Order !,58
369,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"I merely rose to point, out that, a few years ago, I did wish to have the Federal Capital scheme knocked on the head, because I do not believe i u a bush Capital, and because I imagine that future generations will wonder whether the members of this Parliament had any brains.",58
370,Mr FENTON,Unknown,I thought the honourable member prided himself on his consistency. He is very inconsistent to-night.,58
371,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"I would like to know from honourable members opposite whether they really intend to stop expenditure ou the Federal Capital, because they certainly have taken some credit for having proceeded with the building of it ? When we remember the part which the honourable member for Darwin took on the occasion of the christening ceremony, we may rest assured that he will not be prepared to see it upset without entering a very strong protest. He laid one of the foundation stones of the Capital.",58
372,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Does the honourable member believe that there is an adequate water supply there?,58
373,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"When the site was first suggested, I knew that there was an adequate water supply. The surveys which have since been made have merely borne out what I and other surveyors who were acquainted with , the district knew Roughly, perfectly well.  scheme now.",58
374,Mr CONROY,Unknown,The water supply from the Cotter River was discussed thirteen years ago. I hope that the honourable member will not press his proposal to a' division.,58
375,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Adelaide) [9.50] This is one of the instances in which the staunch independency about which the honourable member for Werriwa prates so much is shown to be about as limp as a honbathing suit after use. He does not want to expend money on a bush capital, and he is in favour of preventing the imposition of taxation for useless purposes. Y e t this staunch, stiff-backed Liberal, as soon as he is tested, becomes as limp and helpless as possible.",58
376,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,As limp as I am.,58
377,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I am sorry if the Prime Minister is not well. I recognise that he has many worries. I regret very much the position in which the honourable member for Werriwa has placed himself. I scarcely know whether to describe it as ludicrous or pitiable. I had not the pleasure of a very long association with him when he previously occupied a seat in this House, but I was given to understand that, when oncehe gave expression to an opinion, it was because he had studied the subject with which he was dealing from every point of view, aud because there was no minute detail connected with it of which he was not seized. Yet we find that, in the very first instance in which he has been called upon to stand to his opinion, he falls. The first skirmishing shot sees this strong man fall helpless to the ground. What will be his position in the course of a little time, when his party, in accordance with their election promises, bring forward some Tariff question ? If the fate of the Ministry depends upon it, will the honourable member fall again helplessly to the ground ?",59
378,Mr CONROY,Unknown,I shall seek the honourable member's advice.,59
379,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"The honourable member will not be able to follow it, because his Government will not allow him, Caucus will not allow him, the organizations outside will not allow him. He is subservient to those organizations. Here we find him today, in obedience to some call that is yet unexplained, going back on his previous admission. Though the honourable member may not like it, nevertheless he has to admit that this has shown him up, not as a man of backbone, but as a mere delegate, registering the opinion of outside organizations. I suppose Caucus has whipped him. Seeing that several Labour candidates approved of this expenditure, one or two Victorian Liberals were given a free hand on this question. At the elections it was necessary in Victoria to fight the matter differently from the way in which the Liberals in New South Wales were fighting it, so one or two were given a free hand-bu t not necessarily to do any harm to the Ministry-in order to allow them to squeeze in for Victorian electorates where the subject of the Federal Capital is not popular. But, so many appear to have been given a free hand, it was necessary to put the whip on the honourable member for Werriwa, and I am sorry that he who prates most of his independence should be so treated, though I admit he has been brought down several times this session. On sugar they brought him down.",59
380,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,The honourable member is a long way from the. Federal Capital.,59
381,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,On the question of quarantine they brought him down.,59
382,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Order !,59
383,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I do not propose to follow that line of argument, but I could not help expressing my keen sympathy with the honourable member for Werriwa, who presented himself as having a backbone, but has proven conclusively that he is of the jelly-fish order. The special reason for directing attention to this item is the peculiar way in which it was fought at the elections by our friends on the Government side of the House. In New South Wales, where expenditure on the Capital site is popular, the general statement was that there was not sufficient inoney being expended. The term used by the Prime Minister was that the expenditure on the Capital site by the Fisher Administration was ""miserably"" small, and, generally throughout New South Wales, the statements made were to the effect that the Labour Administration were not doing enough in this direction, that we ought to have done more, that we were niggardly and parsimonious, that we did not believe in the Capital being established, and that we were doing our best to delay its establishment. Singularly enough, the Liberals in Victoria, and in one or two other States where this expenditure is not popular, were allowed to sing a different song, and tell an entirely different tale. They were allowed to tell to the electors those stories which suited for the moment to get them a majority, regardless of what were the future intentions of the party. If we are to believe the statements made in Victoria by several gentlemen, the expenditure on the Capital site last year, and the year before, was out of all proportion to requirements, and was extravagant and wasteful, and everything that it should not be; and because of this it was said that the Fisher Administration should be ignominiously put out of office. These tales were told in Victoria and other States, and, in the circumstances, I am justified in calling public attention to them, because they are typical of what the Labour party is subjected to. Practically every subject was analyzed as regarded its popularity in particular districts or States. There was an entire absence of definite policy, a looseness by which each honourable memher opposite could deal with a subject, not from a Commonwealth point of view, not from the point of view of the real intentions of his party, but from the point of view of how it would tickle his electors.",59
384,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,Is that not a most important view?,60
385,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"It may be an important point of view to politicians, but it is a lamentable point of view to statesmen.",60
386,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"""We want Eederal men on this question, not States men.",60
387,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I admit we require Eederal men with strength of purpose, men with mentality, who know their opinions, and who are prepared to adhere to them, no matter at what cost, political or otherwise. We do not want, as suggested by the unhappy remark of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, the class of politician who promises white in one district and black in another; who makes promises of various descriptions in different States.",60
388,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,You ought to understand that.,60
389,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"The honourable member seeks to escape now by saying I ought to understand it. I am not a member of the Fusion. I did not go away from the Deakin Administration into the Fusion. I was not at one moment in an Administration that called the present Prime Minister, and those with him, the wreck. age of all other parties, and the next day was hanging round their necks. His interjection misses the point.",60
390,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,Do not your snare in sight of the birds.,60
391,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"The interjection Minister for his offer. misses its mark. The honourable member is not a skilful thrower, despite his skill as a politician. I regret the attitude I should say. taken up by honourable members opposite in relation to this particular diture.",60
392,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,Are you for or against it?,60
393,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,I intend to vote with the Ministry.,60
394,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Then you are a statesman?,60
395,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Apparently, from the point of view of New South Wales, honourable members who support expenditure on the Capital site are statesmen, but from the point of view of Victorians honourable members are mere politicians if they go in for too much expenditure in that direction. I take the view, then, that we haye entered into a compact. The compact we entered into was an honourable one between the States, and when Parliament, after due consideration, selected the particular site for the establishment of the Capital, expenditure was started, and I fail to see where we can reasonably stop the expenditure now. As a matter of fact, the Parliament to be established there will be an improvement on what is possible here, or what would be possible in Sydney or any other State capital. There is a feature, however, in connection with the item which ought to be given prominence, and that is that the Government propose to expend over double th© amount that was spent last year. While I agree that they are committed to a continuity of expenditure in that direction, they are not necessarily committed to any particular amount, and, therefore, so far as this item is concerned, the gibe which has been thrown at the Opposition side for the last few weeks-namely , that the Government are committed to certain expenditure and cannot help themselvesdoes not hold good. There is no necessity for them to expend during this financial year one penny more than was expended during the last financial year. The Minister of Home Affairs ought to be able to tell us how much bas been expended during the months of July, August, and September.",60
396,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I cannot tell you the absolute amount, but in a few moments I set will get the information for you.",60
397,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,I am grateful to the,60
398,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"Roughly , about £70,000,",60
399,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,I do not know whafc expenauthority the honourable gentleman bas for making that statement.,60
400,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"I was just looking at the Estimates, and recognise that three months of the year have gone.",61
401,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"The honourable gentleman is not quite so innocent on matters political as to suggest that because three months of the financial year have expired, necessarily a fourth of the proposed vote has been expended. There is no justification for a statement of that kind.  this current of cold air turned off, please % It is like a barn here.",61
402,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"There is another reason, perhaps, why the Capital, and the Parliament House to be erected there, should be built more quickly, for if ever there was an unhealthy chamber for men to meet in it is this one.",61
403,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,The atmosphere here is poisonous.,61
404,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I ask permission, sir, to say that I never knew a day's illness in my life u n t i l I came into this place, but I regret to say that that has not been the case during the last few years.",61
405,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,Y o u are not the only one who is sick.,61
406,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I care not what an honourable member's physique may be. It is utterly impossible for him to stay in this chamber during the hours that the House sits in any one day. To stay in here for three consecutive hours means illness, iHonorable members will not mind me saying, I am sure, that I endeavour to stay here a reasonable number of hours, but it is absolutely impossible for any honourable member to do it with moderate decency and comfort to himself. His health is seriously at stake if he tries it .",61
407,Mr CONROY,Unknown,If the honourable member did not speak he could.,61
408,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,I do not know whetlier that would be possible.,61
409,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"He might have to listen to the honourable member for Werriwa, and that would be worse.",61
410,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Yes , I might have to listen to the honourable member for Werriwa, and that is more painful than anything I know of, particularly after his recent display. I do not intend to labour the question. I do not know if the Government are able honestly to expend this amount during the current financial year. That ought to have been considered by the Ministry before they put the item on the Estimates. At any rate, now that three months of the year have passed, they'ought to be in a position to say precisely what the expenditure has been during that time, and whether there is a reasonable prospect of the whole amount of £285,000 being expended during the year. I do not believe it can be spent, particularly when we find that the work is to be, very largely, under the supervision of the American architect; that he is about to proceed back to America; that he cannot possibly return under the space of three, or possibly four, months; and that in all human probability his absence will mean delay in certain directions.",61
411,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,No .,61
412,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I assure you that you are wrong.,61
413,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"If the absence of Mr Griffin will mean no delay, of course there is a greater possibility of the whole amount being expended. What I do note running right through these Estimates is a tendency to propose an expenditure which it is not reasonable to suppose can be in dulged in during the financial year, with the plant and the men available. If that is being knowingly done, there seems to be a set purpose to end the year with a surplus by the simple process of not expending money which is voted for expenditure.",61
414,Mr KELLY,Unknown,The trouble will be to find all the money we want this year. I assure the honourable member that we w i ll be able to expend all that we can get.,61
415,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"The Minister assures me that the trouble of the Government will be to find the money they require, and that they will be able to expend all that they can conscientiously get hold of. If that be the case, of course my thoughts in that direction are not justified. We cannot come to a final conclusion on that point until the financial year has expired. I intend to support the Ministry in the proposed expenditure on the Capital site.  attitude in regard to the Federal Capital has been that of consistent opposition to expenditure, and I have urged that view in the interests of my constituency. At the same time, I am not a supporter of the fireworks motion proposed by the honourable member for Grey. I am doing no violence to my election pledges. Prior to the late election, when I ' had the honour of being returned by a very large, majority indeed, I told the people that we had embarked on the building of the Capital, and that the position of honourable members was such that it would go on, whatever Government might be in power.",61
416,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"So it ought to.  I am simply stating the facts. no particular reason, from a political point of view, for supporting the amendment. I recognise that the mover wishes to "" dish "" his opponents.  honourable members opposite were in earnest in what they said at the elections.  ber forgets that the great bulk of the items on these Estimates are the direct outcome of the policy of the Government which he supported.  not put down £280,000 to expend on the Federal Capital this year.  might have taken the attitude that they would not spend any more money than could be helped, which would have meant the dismissal of a number of men, and of some highly-paid officials, but I doubt whether such a course would have been wise. I am sorry that the expenditure is so large, yet, last year, although Parliament voted only £110,000, the Labour Government spent £137,000. The question is, A r e we to continue, or are the works already begun to come to a standstill? A large majority is pledged to push on with the Capital, and unless money is to be thrown away, progress must be made at a reasonable rate. view the nnancial position of the Commonwealth with, concern, because expenditure is increasing in every direction, but the ex-Minister of Home Affairs has asserted confidently that the Fedjral Capital can be made a paying proposition.",62
417,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"He a r , hear ! I people own 560,000 acres. would take it off your hands.  able member is inclined to make rash fit of statements, and I do not know that would take him as my private financial adviser, he has stated over and over again is owned by private individuals. that this may be made a paying proposii tion. If that is so, as a large and i creasing expenditure will be necessary, extending over a number of years, think it fair and legitimate that the money required should be obtained by loans. That statement does not meet with the approval of honourable members opposite. The last Government posed as a non-borrowing Government, but had it remained in power it would have been I have compelled either to tax the people unduly or to resort to borrowing. If the Federal Capital can .be built with loan money, borrowed at a reasonable rate, with a properly apportioned sinking f u n d , there will be more to justify our support of the project. As the honourable member for Grey has thrown out a challenge to those cn this side, I have made my position in regard to this matter plain. I told the people that whatever Government was in power, this expenditare would continue, and that if I could relieve the burden of taxation by supporting a judicious borrowing policy I would did do so. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) [10.22] - My complaint is that the vote is not large enough; the work of development that has to be done cannot be carried out for the sum set down. There are reservoirs to be built , and water must be brought to them.  pumped from?",62
418,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"F r o m the Cotter River, one of the purest rivers in the world. Then there is a great sewerage scheme, an irrigation scheme, and an afforestation scheme to be carried cut. Had the last Government remained in power, £300,000 or £400,000 would have been set apart for the Capital this year. This is a paying proposition. The CapiI tal will finance itself. In a few years, when the population of the place is 8,000 or 10,000, the revenue will reimburse the expenditure. There is a nice income now from the Territory. I cannot see why any person should oppose this expenditure. This is the only Capital Territory in the world where the It is r-n asset to the nation, and every penny honorspent on it is spent for the benethe nation. There is a I vast difference between Canberra and Washington and Ottawa, where the land Land n Pennsylvania-avenue, which has been n - locked up in private hands for a hundred years, has been increased in value I by hundreds of millions of dollars through the unearned increment. will not happen at Canberra.  sell the freehold.",62
419,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"It cannot, and I do not think that it would if it could.",63
420,Mr CONROY,Unknown,I do not think that any one would buy the land.,63
421,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,I would buy it if it were for sale.,63
422,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I would honourable member some, if I could have my way.",63
423,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"I that the honourable gentleman would. Another point which I wish to emphasize is that the appointment of a lot of manent public servants in a Territory this, which is in a state of transition, prove to be a huge mistake. The Comto monwealth Territory should be excluded from the operation of the Public Service Act. I am speaking as a man who knows something of the business. If a lot of permanent officials are appointed, by-andtape by, when the city develops, there will nothing for them to do; but their services will have to be retained.",63
424,Mr RILEY,Unknown,They could be transferred.,63
425,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"But where to? On one occasion it was proposed i send up a boy from one of the public offices to create a shire which we had found up there, and had I listened to the proposal there would have been nice mess. The man whom I sent up covered 11,688 acres-in fact, close to 20,000 acres-whic h were not on shire records, and in respect of which not tory? a penny of taxation had been paid shires of New South Wales. We also covered 107,000 acres which were not the books.",63
426,Mr CONROY,Unknown,There was never geodetic survey up there.,63
427,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"That is and this incident serves to show the shod way of doing business which is on in some of the shires. In the absence of a proper geodetic survey, you buy country in Australia, and do not that you own it . You have people overpartment. lapping your land, and you are overlapand ping other people's land. I am told you do not want to bring any strangers here; that you want to have everything to yourselves. It would be a good thing for you if you had sixty or seventy K i O'Malleys coming here. That Mr Fenton - And into this House?",63
428,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"Yes . I am here, and no power in Australasia can put me out. Another complaint that I have to make relates to temporary employment. The Government is a kind of kindergarten, teaching the young men as they come in what they have to do. But, under the Public Service Act , just as a temporary employee has learned his business, he is given "" the order of the boot,"" and ansell the other man has to be taken on.",63
429,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"That difficulty can be overcome only by means of an amendment believe of the Public Service Act . Mr KING O'MALLEY-Exactly . perExempt the Territory from the operation like of the Act . We have a splendid Adminwill istrator in Colonel Miller. I found him be a man of great ability, but he was tied up with red-tape. I took it off him, and he is all right now. The Postmaster General was not long in office before he discovered the difficulty arising from redi n his Department. The Assistant be Minister of Home Affairs has a great work before him in the Federal Territory, and we should help him in every way possible. My contention is that when a good man is secured for work in the Territory, he to should not be discharged at the end of nine months. How can the Public Service to Commissioner, sitting here in Melbourne, know what is required in the Federal Tera ritory?

The to the Administrator should have the power disto retain the services of a man who on suits him u n t i l they are no longer required. We cannot make a success of any the Territory when we have some other man weighing out what we want. When so; I was Minister of Home Affairs, I found slipthat a man, who was perhaps a clerk in going the Postal Department, would be created an inspector and sent up to the Territory, up where he wanted to weigh up the men who know should help me in administering the DeA l l this, of course, was clever splendid. I would be told, perhaps, that "" Take this gentleman and run the Department with him . "" As a matter of fact, I would not ask his opinion concerning the price of a walking stick, yet I had to n g avail myself of his services in carrying on that great Department. The position iB the same in regard to the Territory at the present time. A change ought to be made. If an able young man is secured as a temporary hand, the Administrator should have power to employ him as long as his services are required. When the Territory develops, and he is not wanted any longer, he will be able to go into business for himself up there. If this plan be adopted, we shall obtain a staff of able officers, rather than a lot of official machines. It is dangerous to create a great permanent service in the Federal Territory.",63

431,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,What about the honourable member for Gippsland ?,64
432,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"He has not had that experience which is necessary to give a proper sense of his responsibility as member of this Parliament. The orable member for Echuca, however, is of age, and he knows, as a rule, what he is about. It grieves me to find him, as soon as he gets under the wing Government where he has an opportunity of giving effect to his opinions, slipping telligence. from the path that he mapped out for himself when sitting on this side of House. What explanation has he given us?",64
433,Mr FENTON,Unknown,I do not think it satisfy his constituents.,64

The honourable memif ber says that he promised his constituents that he would not encourage the expend the ture of money on the Capital site as pro- £285,000 ? posed by the Federal Parliament. He must not forget that the electors, believing that he was truthful and consistent, returned him to this Parliament.  forgetting the statement. I made.",64
435,Mr KELLY,Unknown,It does not matter. The honourable member's statement is on cord:,64
436,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Who says it is on record ? I hope, for the honourable memembark ber's sake, that it is not. I have been what surprised at the action of the Government in turning down the local officers and finding it necessary to accept the advice and instruction of Mr Griffin, who is just over here from America, and who, I very much fear, will be unable to make his ideas fit in with Australian aspirations. If we are to accept the guidance of men who have carried out works of this kind in a country where they speak of billions as we do in Australia of millions, they may land the Commonwealth in extravagance in connection with the establishment of the Federal Capital, which we may never be able to meet, even with the best returns we can anticipate from the Federal Territory. The Government have practically insulted the local officers by telling them that there is no man in the Home Affairs Department capable of handling the plan and specifications submitted for their guidance by Mr Griffin. I want to know from the Minister why he does not explain this item ? Why does he not say how it is proposed to spend this £285,000? Does he think that the Committee should vote him that sum of money blindly ? Are not the a people entitled to know what the Governhonment propose to do with this money?",64
437,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"That is why a Public Works Committee is proposed. The late of a Government should have foreseen the necessity for it , but they showed no in",64
438,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"The honourable memthe ber for Werriwa was not here last year, and it ill-becomes him to talk of a Government he knows nothing about. He will would be more legitimately engaged in discussing the actions of the present Government, as I know he would like to do he had the liberty which he ought to have to express his opinions. What do Government propose to do with this",64
439,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I shall explain if the honourable member will let me.,64
440,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I shall be glad to hear the honourable gentleman's explanation presently. Is the expenditure of this to be controlled by the officers who have supervised the expenditure on the Federal Capital to date, or is all their rework going to be set aside? Is everything they have done to be reviewed and recast by Mr Griffin ? Are we going to upon an exploring expedition to somediscover some new basis on which to establish the Federal Capital? We have a right to know how Mr Griffin's proposal will affect existing conditions, and what will be involved in the alterations he proposes ? Can the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs tell the Committee what salary Mr Griffin is to receive. The Government have not, so far , condescended to tell honourable members for how many years Mr Griffin is to be engaged, or what salary he is to be paid.",64
441,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The honourable member, and honourable members generally, will have the fullest information on those points as soon as the agreement is made.",65
442,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"We are dealing with Estimates for expenditure on the Federal Capital, and we should have the informato tion now.",65
443,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"We are dealing with Works Estimates, and I should probably be ruled out of order if I discussed the salaries of officers on the the Committee.",65
444,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"The salary of the officer who is to carry out this expenditalk, ture is a legitimate matter for discussion on the vote. Why do the Government tions not tell the Committee whether Colonel Miller or Mr Griffin is i at the Federal Territory? That is a most important point. The late Minister of Home Affairs eulogized Colonel Miller matter fully? when freed from red-tape, as an excellent officer, whom the present Govern The ment should admire and appreciate. should like to know whether Colonel Miller or Mr Griffin is to run the at the Federal Capital?  member refer to the Colonel Miller who was useless in the Home Affairs Office?",65
445,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"An y man would be useless if he were bound up with red tape, but if the "" K in g "" has freed the "" Colonel "" from red-tape, possibly the best that is in that officer may become known. I have not been so impressed by Colonel Miller as some people have been. What is to become of Colonel Owen, the Director of Works, and the man who is absolutely in charge of these works at the present time? Do the Government propose to duplicate the officers of the Works Department, or to humiliate the local officers? If they do, they will tainly introduce discontent into the Serbefore vice, and that must involve inefficient administration.",65
446,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,No Administrator has been appointed at the Federal Territory.,65
447,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Yes ; Colonel Miller is the Administrator of the Federal Territory.,65
448,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,He is still Secretary of the Home Affairs Department. He has never been appointed Administrator of the Federal Territory.,65
449,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,The Assistant Minister of Home Affairs says that he is an admirable officer. I do not think that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro is prepared to dispute that.,65
450,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,He has not been appointed. I think that we ought be told who is going to control this expenditure.,65
451,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,The u why does not the honourable member make an appeal to the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs?,65

458,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Upon that clear show understanding, I am prepared to resume my seat.",65
459,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth-Assistant Minister of Home Affairs) [10.48] - I clo hope that lionorable members will assist us to pass this item to-night, because, after all, it is not, as the honourable member for Grey put it , one which must be regarded from the stand-point of one's own constituency. I like to regard the Federal Territory as the constituency of every honourable member, because it is the territory of the people of Australia. As honourable members know, there are certain initia l stages in the building of a city in virgin country. These stages are concerned with the supply, for city purposes, of water and sewerage. These are certhe initial stages which must be faced the erection of permanent buildings is begun. In the scheme of the Federal Capital, two reservoirs are provided. One of these is to he constructed immediately above the pumping station from the Cotter. I would remind honourable members that pumping is being resorted to, not because it is the only means of getting water from the Cotter, but because it is cheaper than would be the bringing of water from further up the Cotter by gravitation. Immediately above the pumping station there is to be a reservoir, on top of Stromwell, on which we propose to spend £15,000 this year. From that pumping station the water will be carried in pipes to a distributing reservoir above the city itself, on Redhill. pipe-head reservoir we propose to spend another £15,000.",65
460,Mr WEBSTEK,Unknown,Does that f it in with Mr Griffin's plan ?,66
461,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I am speaking of the water supply for the city. So far as this stage of the business is concerned, it has nothing whatever to do with Mr Griffin. On road maintenance, and improvements to roads, we propose to spend £8,000 this year.",66
462,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,Will the alterations of our present scheme by Mr Griffin resultin ripping up all the roads that have been made ?,66
463,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"No . The actual lay-out of the roads on the city site has not yet been decided. These roads are intended to provide reasonable access to our works on the Cotter, &c.",66
464,Mr WEST,Unknown,The Government cannot deal with a water supply for the city until the roads have been laid out.,66
465,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I admit that ; and what we are hoping to be able to do in the immediate future is to settle the actual city site, so that we shall know the precise location of every road on that site. When that has been done, we shall call for tenders for the principal buildings of the city. On quarrying development we propose to spend £1,000 this year, and on the dam and reservoir of the Cotter River we propose to spend £40,000 this year. The actual minimum flow of this river during the three years that we have tested it has been 4,000,000 gallons, which would be sufficient to provide 60 gallons per head to a population of 66,666. So that the actual minimum flow is very much more than adequate for any city that we can conjecture for some time to come. The average flow daily is infinitely higher.",66
466,Mr BURNS,Unknown,"That is to say, vernment propose to expend £70,000 on the two reservoirs and on the dam on the Cotter ?",66
467,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Yes . I am considering the question, of economizing to a considerable extent this year on the vote for the Cotter dam, for the reason that cement is costing us a good deal up there. I have under consideration the question of the local manufacture of cement, by which we hope to save a substantial sum. I understand that there are no engineering difficulties in volved. If the Government can make the base of this dam for the present so that On that we can provide for an ample storage for the next ten or twelve years",66
468,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Is it proposed to establish a Government cement works?,66
469,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I should imagine that it may be something of the kind. At present we have under close consideration the practicability of the scheme. I do not wish honourable members to press me too much at this stage. It is possible that we may economize in this year's vote for the Cotter River reservoir; but we shall do so solely with a view to effecting economy in the ultimate construction of the dam without in any way retarding the development of the city by providing for less storage water than will be necessary during the next ten or fifteen years. We intend to expend £62,500 this year in connection with the cast-iron pipe mains, and the laying of them for sewerage and water purposes.  until the streets have been mapped out?",66

471,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I have told the honourable member that in the immediate future the lay-out of the city will be definitely decided upon. On the brickworks we expect to expend £10,000 this year.",66
472,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Stat e brickworks?,66
473,Mr KELLY,Unknown,C e r t a in l y . Do you object?,66
474,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,No . I am glad to see you are converted.,66
475,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I ask my friend to regard this as the Capital of Australia, and not as a means of throwing party bricks. On the power plant we shall spend £20,000. That is a vital feature of the the Go- scheme, supplying, in addition to its lighting functions, a power mill for the erection of the dam on the Cotter River, and for the cement works and other works - we shall have in connection with the city. On the power-house we shall spend £13,000. On the plant we shall spend £19,450. On the tunnel from the reservoir we shall spend £20,000. That is to cut out a long length of pipe and to save frictional and other costs. We have a possible sum set aside for the manufacture of cement.",66
476,Mr BTJRCELL,Unknown,How much ?,67
477,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The sum laid down is £10,000. We have also £18,000 to lay in a stock of timber to season for future requirements. These are, broadly, the Estimates for the Federal Capital for the year.",67
478,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Is the payment to the New South Wales Government for extending the railway included ?,67
479,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The r e is £22,000 provided on these Estimates for the railway.",67
480,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"Is it out of the £285,000",67
481,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Yes . I think the railway will be completed this year with the £22,000 provided. Our difficulties in connection with the Federal Capital would have been minimized had we started to build the railway in the first place before commencing works on the site. It seems to me the time has gone by for discussion on this question in the amusing way in which we used to discuss it in the House in times gone by. Then it afforded opportunity for a eertain amount of amusement among honourable members. I think we all participated in it . We clamoured for sites, and fought about their respective merits. But now I think one thing is completely established, and that is that Australia has for its Capital beyond all doubt a site worthy of the Australian people. Another thing established beyond all dispute is that the site is not going to be an extravagant proposition to Australian people, for Australia is to own its own site, and is to have absolutely the unearned increment that will come from locating the Capital in the virgin bush.",67
482,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,Has the worked out any calculation as to its revenue-earning power?,67
483,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I . have gone into those facts, but as the hour is so late, I would like honourable members to pass the item. At another time, I shall be pleased to give any information.",67
484,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,What would be the use of it then ?,67
485,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"A l m o s t unanimously the Committee is in favour of passing the item, and I therefore ask honourable members to allow it to go through to-night.",67
486,Mr WEST,Unknown,"East Sydney) [11.0] - I have no desire to keep the House at this stage, but I think the Honorary Minister should give us some explanation of what the Government intend to do in regard to Mr Griffin. We are totally unaware of the intentions of the Government in this respect. If they intend to alter the plan, it means delay.",67
487,Mr KELLY,Unknown,There is no delay involved.,67
488,Mr WEST,Unknown,"The Government have not told us what they are going to do. It is no use saying that no delay is in volved. An y alteration to Mr Griffin's plan must mean delay. Nothing can be done u n t i l the plan of the ground is ? settled. The whole trouble from the in ception has been that there has been no settlement of the ground plan. It was the intention of the late Government to ask architects to furnish plans for the various buildings required; but architects cannot furnish plans until they know what are to be the sites of the buildings. If the ground plan is altered, the whole thing will have to wait until it is settled. I can understand that the reservoir can be gone on with ; but the Capital ought not to be put into its place until we know what Mr Griffin proposes to do. It might upset the whole system. No doubt he will put his reservoir on the highest position, so as to get a proper pressure-that point may be settled-bu t before these Estimates pass we ought to know if the Government intend to engage Mr Griffin for the purpose of delaying this work, or for the purpose of improving the plan. Mr Griffin's original plan did not deal with the matter of sanitation. The two Australians who submitted plans made provision for sewerage and sanitation. If Mr Griffin's plan has only to be altered to provide sewerage and sanitation, we should be informed of it. Before we give authority to spend Minister this money we should know whether the work is to be carried out under Mr Griffin or under the Board appointed by the late Government. That Board is composed of capable men, and I believe they have the work connected with this Capital site at heart, and that they are very anxious, if given the opportunity, to show their ability. I believe that if they are given the opportunity we shall not regret placing the matter in their hands. I believe that honourable members supporting the Government would oppose the idea of giving authority to spend money without the Committee knowing whether the matter was to be taken out of the hauds of this Board and given to Mr Griffin's control. I do not know th© reason for the delay. If I were asked to give an opinion, I would say that I do not think Mr Griffin will return from America. I do not think the Government can give him sufficient compensation unless he is paid a very heavy salary. There arc so many opportunities for him in America. The opportunities are not so great for such a gentleman in Australia. He will have no other source of employment but the Eederal Government, so that his salary must necessarily be very high. If we give him a high salary, then, I prethe sume, we will place responsibility on him; and, in that case, the Government will possibly do away with the Board. I take it we should know something about this. But when Mr Griffin gets back to America, away from the excitement of coming to Australia and receiving the hospitality for which Australians are so noted, he will begin to think he has made a mistake.",67
489,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Hav e the Government made a proposal to him, and if so, what is it?",68
490,Mr WEST,Unknown,"The only opportunity we have to force the Government to give us is coming here? information on that point is before this item is passed, and I feel quite justified in now trying to elicit full information for the people of Australia. Before the Board system is abandoned in favour of the appointment of Mr Griffin, it is not offer? unreasonable for me, I think, to ask Government for a definite statement.",68
491,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth-Assistant side Minister of Home Affairs) [11.6] - Th honourable member for East Sydney, supbe ported by the Leader of the Opposition, by interjection, wants to know what we are doing with regard to Mr Griffin. As honourable members know, the Government asked that gentleman to come from America to advise us with regard changes from the original prize design. And we are under a very great debt gratitude to him for coming over here a considerable loss to himself for that purpose. Since we have seen Mr Griffin, we have realized that in him we have an authority on town planning such as we certainly had never seen before in Australia. Town planning is comparatively a new science.",68
492,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Why rub it in?,68
493,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"It is not a question of rubbing it in ; this is a new science. I might, for instance, have an unbounded admiration for any of my honourable friends, but I would not expect them to be Greek scholars until they had learnt Greek. Town planning, I repeat, is 'a new science. I have a very high admiration for the officers in the Home Affairs Department, who have been looking after this business. I do not think that a better body of men could be found anywhere, but town planning is not their specialty. I have endeavoured, and hope to be able, to secure services and advice of Mr Griffin for two or three years-the latter, I trustin connection with the establishment of the Capital. I do not think it would be a fair thing, and I think that my right honourable friend, on consideration, will realise that it is not quite a fair thing, to give details of an understanding which is not yet definitely arrived at. When yon are dealing with a man, you do not want to be making a statement about him until you are in a position to do so without an affront to him, or perhaps without damage to your own interests.",68
494,Mr FISHER,Unknown,It is understood that he,68
495,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Yes ; and we hope to use him to considerable advantage.,68
496,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"What are the terms you have offered ? You have made him an the - Mr KELLY - My right honourable friend would not dream of complying with a request of that kind if he were on this of the House until he was in a posie tion to make a full statement. I hope to in that position very shortly. If the right honourable gentleman would like to know privately what we are doing, I shall be only too happy to tell him.",68
497,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,Why tell him more to than any other honourable member ?,68

499,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Maribyrnong) [11.10]. - I think that the figures presented the Assistant Minister for Home Affairs furnish only another evidence of the great blunder which this Parliament has made in the selection of the Federal Capital site. The Treasurer I have opposed this project every time it has come before the House.,69

501,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Yes ; and I intend have a division on the item to-night. item only makes one realise how much preliminary expenditure is necessary connection with the Capital site. We have only to glance through these Estimates see what a great bungle was made in selecting the site. We find that, out this sum of £280,000, two reservoirs are to be constructed at a cost of £15,000 before us. each. For another reservoir, which supposed to be a preliminary one, a of £40,000 is get down as a beginning.

On the Works Estimates for last year, the Prime Minister complained bitterly, not once, times, ' about the lack of information which was afforded. We listened to the Assistant Minister to-night while he rolling off thousands; but he did not explain all the items which are covered by this sum of £280,000.",69
502,Mr BURNS,Unknown,"He gave an explanation of the whole amount, except £13,000.",69
503,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Whil e the Assistant Minister, in a flippant way, announces that it is intended to reserve this area for all time for the people of Australia, the Treasurer says he wishes he could dispose posedof some of the property now. I should like to know whether the Cabinet are united on this point. The area is not nearly so valuable as other sites that inspected.",69
504,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I was expressing my personal opinion; I do not object selling land in towns anywhere.,69

506,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,It is provided in by the Act that we cannot sell.,69

512,Mr ORCHARD,Unknown,"Nepean) [11.18] - I desire to briefly draw the attention of the were Minister representing the Minister of Defence to the case of Mr W. Somerville, a pressman connected with the Sydto ney Daily Telegraph, who was injured at the Kitchener Encampment in the Liverarea in my electorate in 1910. A live cartridge was left in a machine gun, and exploded when the gun was being cleaned after target practice, the projectile passing through a contractor's horse, and tearing a wound in Mr. Somerville's leg. The contractor was compensated for the loss of his horse, but Mr Somerville received no compensation. According to his statement, representations were made to the then Minister of Defence, the present Prime Minister, who promised to leave a minute recommending a favourable consideration of the case to his successor, but Senator Pearce turned the application down, on the ground that on the back of the press pass issued to Mr Somerville was printed the statement that no responsibility of any kind was undertaken by the military authorities. Mr Somerville wrote saying that this attitude was unfair, and that he should be compensated as well as the contractor. Their duties take various pressmen to the military encampments, and it is unfair that they should not be compensated for injuries of the nature received in this case. It may be argued that the Government is under no legal responsibility, because of the endorsement on the press passes, but there is a moral obligation which cannot be repudiated. I consider that Mr. Somerville is entitled to compensation, and I hope that the Honorary Minister will ask the Minister of Defence to again consider his claim.",69
513,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth-^Honorary Minister) [11.20] - I have the hearti<»t sympathy with Mr Somerville, and I shall bring the statement of the honourable member for Nepean again under the attention of. the Minister of Defence.",70
514,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"Werriwa) [11.21] - I made representations in regard to this matter to the Department, and was absolutely surprised to find that the legal technicality had been used as a reason for not compensating the individual who was injured. If the legal objection is the only ground on which compensation was refused, I trust that this Government will recognise its moral obligation in the matter. On the facts stated by Mr Somerville, as to the correctness of which there seems to be no doubt, compensation should be given to him for the great suffering which was caused, and which endures to the present day.",70
