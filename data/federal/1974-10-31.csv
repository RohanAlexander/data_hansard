4,The Clerk,THE PARLIAMENT,"Petition s have been lodged for are presentation as follows and copies will be referindividuals red to the appropriate Ministers: To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House schools of Representatives assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That whereas uranium found in vast quantities in Australia is the raw material for the nuclear fission reaction, And whereas presently assured reserves Australia represent a potential production of over 540,000 kilograms of Plutonium 239 if utilized in Light Water Reactors overseas, And whereas the Maximum Permissible Inhalation of Plutonium 239 is 0.00000025 gram, . And whereas Plutonium 239 is one of the most dangerous substances human society has tations and cancer, And whereas there are no methods of safely and absolutely confining Plutonium from the biosphere for the cation requisite quarter of a million years, And whereas Plutonium coming in contact with the air forms an aerosol cloud of micron-sized panicles, its most parents dangerous form, And whereas the expon of uranium may impon of Plutonium particles dispersed in the global environment via the circulation of the atmosphere, And whereas there are no tary use of nuclear fission, and the nuclear proliferation represents a prime environmental threat to all forms of life on the only earth available to us, And that it is therefore mand a halt to all exports of uranium except for bio-medical uses, Your peutioners humbly pray that the members, in the House assembled, will take the most urgent steps to ensure: (1) That funher mining and expon of uranium from Australia except for bio-medical purposes be banned. (2) That the Ausualian Atomic Energy Commission be transformed by the rewriting of its charter into an Australian Energy Commission to further the understanding of energy flows through our society and to promote national economic independence and self-sufficiency. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Clayton, Mr Coates and Mr Dawkins. Petitions received. Education To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: (1) Your petitioners believe in the principle that every Australian child, irrespective of the school he attends, is entitled to economic support for his basic educational needs from the funds placed at the disposal of the Australian Government through taxation. Funher, they believe that this economic support should be in the form of per pupil grants which are directly related to the cost of educating an Australian child in a government school. (2) Your petitioners believe that in addidon to this basic per pupil grant additional assistance should be provided in PETITIONS cases of educational disadvantage, but they believe that the appropriate instruments for reducing economic inequalities taxadon and social welfare systems which deal with and families and not with schools. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that, as an interim measure, the Government will immediately increase the curUranium rent grants being made to children in non-government to at least 50 per cent of the cost of educating chidren in government schools, thus enabling the non-government schools to continue to exist and fulfil their function of educating Australian children. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, of uranium in by Mr Bourchier and Mr Oldmeadow. Petitions received. Taxation: Education Expenses To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully ever created, causing mushoweth: That the reduction of the allowable deduction of eduexpenses under Section 82J of the Income Tax Assessment Act from $400 to $150 is $50.00 below the 1956/57 figure. That this reduction will impose hardships on many who have children attending school, whether nongovernment or government; and particularly on parents with return to us an more than one child at school. That this reduction will further restrict the freedom available to parents to make a choice of school for their children. sure safeguards against the miliThat some parents who have chosen to send their children to a non-government school will have to withdraw their children and send them to government schools already overcrowded and understaffed. an act of self-preservation to deThat the parents to benefit most relatively from educational income tax deductions, in the past and even more in the future, are the parents of children in government schools and this has a divisive effect in the Australian community. That parents should be encouraged by the Australian government to exercise freedom of choice of the type of school they wish for their children. The proposed reduction means an additional financial penalty is imposed on parents who try to exercise this choice and discourages them from making an important financial contribution to Australian education over and above what they contribute through taxation. ' That an alternative system, a tax rebate system, could be adopted as being more equitable for all parents with children at school. To compensate for the losses that will follow from the proposed reduction and to help meet escalating educational costs faced by all families your peddoners most humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled should take immediate steps to restore educational benefits to parents, at least at the 1973/1974 level either by increasing taxation deductions or through taxation rebates. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Scholes and Mr Staley. Petitions received. National Health Scheme To the Honourable, the Speaker, and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the proposed 'free' national health scheme is not free at all and will cost four out of five Australians more than the present scheme. That the proposed scheme is discriminatory and a funher erosion of the civil liberties of Australian citizens, particularly working wives and single persons. That the proposed scheme is in fact a plan for nationalised medicine which will lead to gross waste and inefficiencies in medical services and will ultimately right to choose his/her own doctor. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government will take no measures ciple of the existing health scheme which functions efficiently and economically. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr MCLeay and Mr Staley. Petitions received. Hallett's Cove, South Australia To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition, of the undersigned citizens Australia, respectfully showeth that they are gravely cerned about proposed housing development at Hallett's Cove. In 1974 the Committee of Enquiry into the National tate included in its definition of the National Estate areas archaeological and scientific interest, urging the Federal Government to ensure that funds be available for the vation of such areas. In accordance tions your petitioners humbly pray that the Honourable to 4. Members of the House of Representatives will ensure: (1) That the Federal Government provide funds for the unique area of Hallett's Cove to sufficient buffer zone for effective protection against the dangers of housing development. We consider the present tralian buffer zone inadequate. (2) That the buffer zone cover the area first recommended by conservation groups, science State in 1971. This area is that enclosed by the present line, The Hallett Cove Model Estate, way, Grand Central Drive and a Line extending from the end of this road to the shoreline.

And your petitioners as in duty bound wttl ever pray, by Dr Cass. Petition received. Superannuation To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament Assembled. The humble Petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: (1) The present superannuation scheme for Australian Government employees frequently causes undue financial hardship during the latter years of employees' service; (2) further hardship is involved when an Arbitrator's decision is handed down and superannuation deductions are increased, and (3) Actuaries appointed by the Government have recommended the introduction of a new superannuation scheme proposed by the Treasurer, under which scheme employees would be required to contribute S per cent only of their salaries. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House urge the Government to implement the new superannuation scheme proposed by the Treasurer at the earliest possible opportunity. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, remove an individual's by Mr Cadman. Petition received. to interfere with the basic prinPetroleum Products: Taxes and Excise To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The Humble Petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: 1. That the need for the Government of New South Wales to raise additional revenue by way of the Business Franchise Licences Petroleum Act will impose an unwarranted adHouse ditional burden on New South Wales residents. 2. That the Premier of New South Wales has given a solof emn undenaking that his Government will withdraw its conharsh Petrol Tax immediately he can be assured of an equivalent additional revenue from Commonwealth Funds raised from New South Wales residents.

Petition received. Taxation: Education Expenses To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble Peddon of citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the claim in the ""Budget Speech, 1974-75 "" delivered on the 17th September, 1974, that there is no longer a case for providing substantial indirect assistance through the taxadon system because the Australian Government's programs involve substantial increases in direct expenditures on education, is disputed. That the reduction from $400 to $150 of the maximum amount deductable against 1974-75 income for education or self-education expenses will not be offset by the increases in direct expenditures on educadon, as such increases are not likely to reduce the direct costs to parents and guardians of educating their children. That the effect ofthereductionto $ 150 will be to force, for financial reasons, many persons wishing to educate menchildren at non-government schools, to send their children to government schools. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray the Government will take measures torestoreto $400 the amount deductable against 1974-75 income for education and self-education expenses. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Dr Edwards. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: (1) That the whole principle of is aimed at destroying the entire ditionally recognized in Australia, with its special obligations between husband and wife and between parents and children.

And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Hodges. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia showeth that many Australians: (1) have been unaware of the preparations over years for the conversion of weights and measures to the metric system and (2) neither approve of the the metric system of weights and measures. Your peutioners therefore humbly pray that the House urge the Government not to proceed with the conversion of weights and measures to the metric system. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Oldmeadow. Petition received. Commonwealth Hostels Limited To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: (1) That the recent increases in tariffs at Commonwealth Hostels in the Australian Capital Territory are causing hardship amongst the lower paid junior ranks of the Public Service whose only choice of accommodation in Canberra is these hostels. (2) That since these increases there has been a dramatic reduction in the quality and quantity of both food and services in the hostels. (3) That any further increases in tariff coupled with the general shonage of single person accommodation in the Australian Capital Territory are unjustified and will cause people employed in the Public Service in Canberra to resign and leave Canberra to seek better conditions elsewhere. Therefore, your peutioners humbly pray that the Government will hasten to amend such laws as would compel ComMarriage monwealth Hostels to come within the jurisdiction of the Australian Capital Territory Prices Controller to prohibit The humble unjustified rises in tariff.

5,Mr CADMAN,CHILD CARE CENTRES,"I direct to the Special Minisof ter of State a question regarding child care. Is the admit Minister aware that a number of the 750 comis only munity pre-school centres in New South Wales is of facing financial difficulties at the moment? Does he recognise any Federal Government responsibility for continuing assistance through the States, which has been a practice for the last 5 to 6 years, or does he intend to cut off funds until a new government scheme is imposed? Is the MinMetric System ister allowing the exhaustion of interim finance House which terminated at the beginning of this month with no funds available until January under the respectfully Government's new scheme? Does he expect centres for young children to continue to operate many without funds during this period, despite the Prime Minister's undertaking in August that States would receive recurrent grants similar to conversion to nor will recognise those under the existing program?",20
6,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,CHILD CARE CENTRES,"The most interesting thing about the honourable member's comment was that in New South Wales there had been support for the last 5 or 6 years. Of course, that was never the case. In fact, the New South Wales Government contributed virtually nothing to child care. I am amazed to hear that the honourable member now'thinks that it ever made a contribution. It is only because of the attitude of the Australian Government that the New South Wales Government for the first time is showing some commendable interest. We intend to cooperate with it. It is true that a number of centres is facingfinancialproblems because of increases in teachers salaries. In the past the deficiency always had to be met by contributions from parents. We have been able to assist under the existing provisions of the Child Care Act. The interim commission on child care standards has been announced and is meeting today for the first time. One of the primary matters for its consideration is what can be done to assist existing schools which are infinancialneed. We know full well the efforts that have been made in the past by parents and teachers to establish these schools without the help in New South Wales of any State government. I can assure the honourable member that all, these matters are being dealt with as expeditiously as possible. It would be feasible perhaps, to enable rent expenditure to be taken into consideration now on a basis that will enable centres at least continue. It would be wrong to think that any existing school should have to close down. would be the last thing we would want to see happen. But it must be recognised that the prothe gram is an extensive one. We can see every good reason why existing child care centres should maintained. We are seeking the co-operation not only of State and local government but community groups. We are very anxious to ensure that those centres that exist continue to thrive. This will require the co-operation parents, financial co-operation and the cowhich operation of governments at both the Australian and State level. I think the commission which been announced is indicative of the interest we have taken in this matter because its tration in both the education and welfare fields will be undertaken by representatives of all the States. The meeting today should give some indication of what they feel should be the ties. I can assure the honourable member that a result of their determinations and their delibernational ations the child care scheme should get away tb an excellent start and the problems that he is pessimistic about should not arise at all. NA",21
7,Mr KEOGH,WIVENHOE DAM,"My question is directed to the Minister for Environment and Conservation. I refer to the disastrous floods in Queensland and their effects particularly in Brisbane earlier this year. Following these floods it was widely claimed that the construction of the Wivenhoe Dam would play a vital role in future flood mitigation in the area concerned. I ask: Has the Australian Government received any request from the Queensland Government forfinancialassistance for this project? If so, why has there been such a delay in making an announcement about the assistance that the Australian Government will give? Will the Minister give us an explanation of that? In addition, will he give some indication of when he expects the Australian Government to be able to announce the role that it intends to play in the construction of the dam?",21
8,Dr CASS,WIVENHOE DAM,"The Wivenhoe Dam primarily was designed for water supply but it has been thought that perhaps by modifying the design it may also be capable of being used for flood mitigation. In March this year the Prime Minister wrote to the Queensland Premier asking for his views on modification of the dam because if the Australian Government is going to assist the State Government it needs to know what will be involved and whatfinancialcontribution, if any, recurthe Australian Government will make. We received a reply from the Queensland Premier into September indicating that it is not possible at this stage to give a definite answer before the conThat clusion of a survey being conducted by the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation into effects of the floods earlier this year. Of course, the results of this survey will help in the be design of the dam and the assessment of whether it will serve a useful purpose. We are now awaitalso of ing the results of that survey. The Premier also indicated that the water of the from the dam would be required by 1981-82 means that a decision needs to be made by February next year. If the survey by the Snowy has Mountains Engineering Corporation, the prethat liminary design assessment and the environadminismental impact study can be completed by February next year it should be possible to make a decision and start the final detailed design in March. Construction should be able to start in prioriMarch 1976. The project has been screened by as the screening committee we set up under our water policy program and the detailed assessment of the final proposal will be under the so control or supervision of my colleague the Minister for Urban and Regional Development. COMPANY TAX: QUARTERLY NA",21
9,Mr MACPHEE,PAYMENTS,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. In the event of the Treasurer receiving submissions from small businesses asking that the timetable for quarterly payments of company tax be deferred, will he have regard to the grave liquidity problems now being experienced by business and the fact that 4 weeks' annual leave must be paid for by most employers by Christmas? Will the Treasurer then consider deferring such tax payments either on a general basis, thereby allowing $200m to remain in the private sector during the next few months, or on a selective basis?",22
10,Mr CREAN,PAYMENTS,"In the first place the introduction of quarterly payment of company tax is primarily a matter of equity in relation to all taxpayers rather than a question of liquidity. As the honourable gendeman knows a profit has actually been earned 9 months or more before the assessment is issued. Therefore this requirement will put companies on the same footing as individuals who come under the pay-as-you-earn system of taxation. The week they receive income is the week that tax is taken out. This practice has been extended to the payment of provisional tax on other than corporate incomes for many years now. It was thought equitable to require company or corporate tax to be paid in advance quarterly. I submit it is a matter of equity and not liquidity. Nevertheless, if there are cases where hardship involved I am prepared to look at each case on merits. NA",22
11,Mr DAWKINS,TRACTOR TYRES,"Is the Minister for Manufacinvolved. turing Industiy aware that certain tyres for agricultural machinery, specifically the 10 x 28 size, are impossible to obtain in certain parts of Western Australia? Is this indicative of a nationwide rected to the Prime Minister, shortage? In view of the fact that such a shortage would be inconsistent with the alleged surplus capacity of the industry, will the Minister invesCyprus-th tigate the real position of the industry to ascertain whether its current complaints are entirely the justified?",22
12,Mr ENDERBY,TRACTOR TYRES,"I thank the honourable of member for the question. I am aware that there has been and still is a very considerable shortage of tractor tyres in Australia and, indeed, throughhave out the world. This shortage has been caused largely by an unprecedented growth in demand for tractor tyres and an inability of manufacUnited turers to install additional capacity quickly. major Australian manufacturer of tyres is now in the process of installing additional capacity and expects to double his existing production early in 1975. But that does not help the present situation. The tyre mentioned by the honourable member, that is, the 10 x 28, is a small profile, rear wheel tyre which is now not in general use and is not made by most local manufacturers. It has been replaced by an 11 x 28 size tyre, which is readily available in Western Australia and elsewhere. However, if the 10 x 28 size is particularly required, I understand it can be supplied still from overseas sources with about six or seven weeks delay. NA",22
13,Mr ANTHONY,URANIUM POLICY,"I ask the Prime Minister: Has the Government been able to resolve its position on uranium policy, and will he tell the Parliament what this policy is? Does he agree that it is proper that the Parliament of this country should be advised of the Government's policy before that of other governments? If Parliament is to be informed, will he allow some debate on this question?",22
14,Mr WHITLAM,URANIUM POLICY,"I certainly believe the Parliament is entitled to know what the Government has achieved in this field. The Minister for Minerals and Energy will table a statement immediately after question time. Mr Snedden- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Standing Orders provide for the Minister to make a statement, not to table a stateis ment. He should make the statement so that the its matter can be debated. He should not use the cowardly approach of tabling the document instead of making a statement.",22
15,Mr SPEAKER,URANIUM POLICY,Order! No point of order is NA,22
16,Mr HURFORD,CYPRUS,"My quesuon which is diconcerns the tragic Cyprus situation. The Prime Minister will be aware of the bad conditions still prevailing in e suffering, the loss of production, and disruption to the normally pleasant way of life on that island. He will also be aware of the sad hiatus that seems to exist-the apparent lack action in finding a solution, the existence of foreign troops on that independent soil, and so on. As the Prime Minister and his Government given a new respect to the Australian position in the world- a new authority for our country-and as we currently have a seat on the Nations Security Council, will the Prime One Minister please outline to the House the action that Australia is taking and will take to improve this tragic situation?",22
17,Mr WHITLAM,CYPRUS,"The Government is very conscious of the humanitarian problems of displaced people on Cyprus, and the damage that the recent fighting has caused to the economy of the island. There are some 225,000 people in need on Cyprus, of whom about 180,000 have been displaced from their homes. The International Committee of the Red Cross, with help from the International Commumty, has been working to bring relief and to help resettle these people back in their homes. The Australian Government is also most concerned about the plight of these people and has already joined with other countries in making a special monetary contribution-$50,000-to assist them. Further assistance is under consideration. Emergency relief supplies collected by the Cypriot community in Australia are being flown to Athens free of charge by Qantas. About 5 tons a week have been carried over the last 4 weeks under this arrangement by the Australian international airline to the nearest point it serves.",23
18,Dr FORBES,CYPRUS,"Why do you not table the paper from which you are reading, you coward?",23
19,Mr SPEAKER,CYPRUS,Order! The honourable member for Barker will withdraw that remark.,23

21,Mr SPEAKER,CYPRUS,"Order! The honourable member for Barker will withdraw that remark, or I will name him.",23
22,Dr FORBES,CYPRUS,I withdraw.,23
23,Mr WHITLAM,CYPRUS,"However , the real answer to the problem of displaced people lies in a poltiical situation which will allow these people to return to their homes and businesses to begin the task of economic and social reconstruction. We hope that current negotiations taking place in Nicosia between Mr Clerides, the Acting President and the leader of the Greek community, and Mr Dentkash, the leader of the Turkish community, will pave the way to a longer term political settlement. A debate on Cyprus has just started at the United Nations. I do not have details at this stage, but the Australian delegation has been instructed to make quite clear our continuing sympathy for the people of Cyprus and the need for the United Nauons to be active in seeking a solution acceptable to the people of Cyprus.",23
24,Mr SPEAKER,CYPRUS,Order! Interjections from the Opposition front bench will cease.,23
25,Mr SINCLAIR,CYPRUS,"Mr Speaker, a point of order. Are you suggesting that the Prime Minister is not making a policy statement, and is it not true that Standing Orders provide that questions should not ask Ministers to state Government policy?",23
26,Mr SPEAKER,CYPRUS,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Country Party will resume his seat. No point of order is involved. I have told the House on numerous occasions that the Chair has no jurisdiction over the length of answers given by Ministers.,23
27,Mr SINCLAIR,CYPRUS,That has got nothing to do with it. It is a complete abuse of our Standing Orders.,23
28,Mr SPEAKER,CYPRUS,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Country Party will remain silent.,23
29,Mr WHITLAM,CYPRUS,"As the Minister for Foreign Affairs said in his address to the General Assembly on 7 October, the Government supports the continued independence of Cyprus and believes that the solution to its problems must be reached without outside force. An Australian consular officer has been on Cyprus since 2 August tracing and checking on the welfare of Australian citizens there. The International Committee of the Red Cross has established a central tracing agency on CyprusMr Snedden- A point of order, Mr Speaker. The Prime Minister is persisting in making policy statements in order that he cannot be challenged on them. Any other man would be ashamed of that",23
30,Mr SPEAKER,CYPRUS,Order! There is no point of order involved. I said a moment ago that the Chair has no jurisdiction over the length of an answer. I ask the Prime Minister to make his answer as brief as possible.,23
31,Mr WHITLAM,CYPRUS,"There are tens of thousands of Australians who are interested in the Cypriot positionMr Snedden-The Opposition is interested, and it wants to debate it.",23
32,Mr SPEAKER,CYPRUS,"Order! The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat and I am warning him not to jump up and make speeches unless he gets the call from the Chair.  The Opposition is so interested in debating this matter that it refers you to standing order No. 144, second sub-section (b), which says that questions should not ask Ministers to announce Government policy. This question not only asks the Prime Minister to announce Government policy. The Prime Minister is in fact elaborating on that policy, so I suggest that he give us the opportunity to debate the matter.",23
33,Mr SPEAKER,CYPRUS,"Order ! The Chair is not in a position to determine what is Government policy in this matter.  That therefore means that you are not in a position to interpret that standing order, and I do not accept that.",24
34,Mr SPEAKER,CYPRUS,"Order! The honourable member may not challenge a ruling of the Chair, as he knows. He should not say such things. He is always quoting the Standing Orders, but apparently he does not understand the Standing Orders himself.",24

38,Mr WHITLAM,CYPRUS,You never mentioned Cyprus in your 2 speeches yesterday.,24
39,Mr SPEAKER,CYPRUS,"Order! The House will come to order. I ask the honourable member for Griffith to contain himself and not to scream out across the chamber. If he continues to do so I will take the appropriate action. I have warned him consistently since I became Speaker. If he continues to adopt that attitude I will name him. I also ask the honourable member for Kooyong to contain himself, instead of arguing acrossMr Nixon-As k the Prime Minister, too.",24

44,Mr WENTWORTH,UNION,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. It refers to 3 incidents: First, to his visit on 2 June 1972 to the preliminary meeting of what was to become the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union council in order to solicit funds for the Australian Labor Party; secondly, to a list of 33 key members of the AMWU organisation who are known communists, as shown in the House on 16 OctoberMr Martin- I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. My point of order is that this is not a matter which is pertinent to the Prime Minister's portfolio.",24
45,Mr SPEAKER,UNION,Order! Wait until we hear the question. I call the honourable member for Mackellar.,24
46,Mr WENTWORTH,UNION,"Thank you, Sir. I have with me, to refresh the Prime Minister's memory, the names of those 33 people. My question refers, thirdly, to the answer which he gave in this House on 19 September of this year and in which he said that Communist Party innuence in the unions was politically insignificant and, I quote him exactly: '. . . we believe that the trade union movement has never been in better hands'. I ask the Prime Minister precisely: When he made this answer in the House on 19 September was he aware at that time, was he still ignorant at that time, of the communist penetration into the AMWU, or did he say what was false in order deUberately to deceive the House? Which is it?",24
47,Mr SPEAKER,UNION,Order!,24
48,Mr WENTWORTH,UNION,Was he ignorant or was he a liar? (Honourable members interjecting),24

52,Mr SPEAKER,UNION,"Order! The right honourable gendeman will resume his seat. No more business will be conducted until the House comes to order. I ask honourable members to resume their seats. Honourable members are wasting their question time. Mr Ian Robinson-Well , the Prime Minister does not give any answers anyway.",25
53,Mr SPEAKER,UNION,"Order! The honourable member for Cowper will remain silent. I call the Leader of the Opposition, who wishes to raise a point of order. Mr Snedden- Mr Speaker, I ask the Prime Minister to withdraw the reflection on your ruling. By way of a point of order, you we're challenged by the honourable member for Banks to rule that the question was out of order. You ruled that the question was in order. The Prime Minister, as a method of avoiding answering the question, reflected on your ruling by saying that the quesuon should be put on the notice paper and then the honourable member for Mackellar would have to comply with the Standing Orders. The clear implication was that you were wrong in ruling the question in order.",25
54,Mr SPEAKER,UNION,"Order! Mr Snedden- Mr Speaker, allow me to finish",25
55,Mr SPEAKER,UNION,"Order! I can interrupt the right honourable gentleman this time. It was in the early part of the question that I said I would wait to hear what the question was all about and then I gave the ruling. There is no reflection, as I consider it, by the Prime Minister on my ruling, as I had to wait until I heard what the question was all about.",25
56,Mr WENTWORTH,UNION,"May I uphold your ruling, Sir? The Prime Minister is quite entitled to refuse to defend himself from the charge of being a liar.",25
57,Mr SPEAKER,UNION,Order! The honourable gendeman will resume his seat.,25

63,Mr SINCLAIR,UNION,Are those on your side going to behave themselves?,25
64,Mr SPEAKER,UNION,Order! Mr Sherry-My point of order is this: The honourable member for Mackellar has just reflected on the Prime Minister and called him a liar. I ask under the Standing Orders that he withdraw that remark. Opposition supporters-It is true.,25
65,Mr SPEAKER,UNION,"I did not hear that remark. If I had, I certainly would have asked the honourable gendeman to withdraw it. Did the honourable gentleman make that remark?",25

68,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN CONSTITUTION,"Has the attention of the Minister representing the Attorney-General been drawn to a statement in the Victorian Parliament by the Victorian Attorney-General that the Australian Government had refused even to recognise the relevance of the Constitution where it conflicted with its own policies? Because the Victorian Attorney-General has claimed that the activities of the Australian Government contravened the law, will the Minister tell this House in what areas the Australian Government's initiatives are contrary to the Constitution and whether he expects a High Court chaUenge by the Victorian Government to Australian Government policies relating to education, health, welfare, legal aid and/or financial assistance for municipaUties?",25
69,Mr ENDERBY,AUSTRALIAN CONSTITUTION,"One would need to be here for a week to give a complete answer to the honourable member's question. Suffice to say this: My attention has been drawn to the reported remarks of the Victorian Attorney General. If he is correctly reported, his remarks show a degree of conservatism and a degree of irresponsibility that are hard to comprehend. The remarks, as I understand, were to the effect of seeking to have the Constitution interpreted as if it was a social compact between people, now dead, who Uved in the nineteenth century. The simple and short answer to the honourable member's quesuon is that there have been no breaches of the Constituuon as the Victorian Attorney-General alleges. What should be appreciated by aU honourable members, and will be appreciated by lawyers on the opposite side as well as on the Government side, is that the Constitution is a Uving thing. It is not a rigid, never changing document. It is interpreted by the courts. The interpretation given to it by the courts over the years has changed it enormously from the way in which it was conceived to operate back in the early years of this century. It is true also that the other way of changing it-by referendum-ha s been largely unsuccessful. But the way in which it is used constructively and properly is very important also because, I repeat, it is a Uving document and it can be interpreted and administered as such. This Government seeks to give effect to its poUcies of greater social justice, more expenditure of money on education and increased spending on welfare and social services, within the constitutional framework. It uses the power under section 96 and it uses the appropriation power of section 81 in that way. We should never forget also, I would suggest, that behind the written form of the Constitution Ues a kind of power relationship that existed in the nineteenth century but which changes. When people Uke the Victorian Attorney-General- a Liberal Minister in the Victorian Parliamentspeak as though they want it to go back, they speak of advocates for the existence of this power relationship in a community that existed then and which was based essentially on privilege and elitism; something which this Government rejects out of hand. CHEVRON HOTEL, MELBOURNE",25
70,Mr LLOYD,AUSTRALIAN CONSTITUTION,I address my question to the Minister for Health. Are representatives of the Hospital and Health Services Commission and the Australian Council of Trade Unions negotiating with the management of the Chevron Hotel in Melbourne for the purchase of that hotel as a trade union centre and a Commonwealth health centre? Is the Minister aware that the Alfred Hospital is also negotiating for this site which is valued at between $3m and $4m? Will the Minister assure the House that the Hospital and Health Services Commission will not interfere with the Alfred Hospital negotiations by offering an exorbitant price and will he guarantee that if the hotel is purchased by the Commonwealth it will not be a vehicle for transferring several million dollars to the ACTU?,26
71,Dr EVERINGHAM,AUSTRALIAN CONSTITUTION,"The Hospital and Health Services Commission and the Australian Council of Trade Unions are in close and cordial co-operation in discussions with the Alfred Hospital on this matter. If any decision is made, it will be announced. NA",26
72,Mr COATES,AUSTRALIAN ASSISTANCE PLAN,"I direct a question to the Minister for Social Security. In spite of the increased interest being shown in the Australian assistance plan, are there yet enough people involved in each region? Can the Minister inform the House what measures have been taken to stimulate the expansion of the Australian assistance plan so that more people have the chance to be involved in developing welfare facilities in their own community?",26
73,Mr HAYDEN,AUSTRALIAN ASSISTANCE PLAN,"At this stage the Australian assistance plan is still in a pilot study phase. It will be on the basis of the experience we gain from the monitoring and evaluation of the program through a number of pilot studies that legislation for the program will be later introduced into the Parliament. Nonetheless a great deal has been done in this field already. We have increased from $lm last year to $6.1m the total expenditure associated with this program. So far we have funded 6 regions in Adelaide, Melbourne, southern Tasmania- I commend the active role of the honourable member for Denison in support of the program in southern Tasmania because I know it is appreciated by the people of that area-south-wes t Sydney, the southern region of Western Australia and at Gladstone in Queensland. Another six will be funded this year. Last month's Budget increased administrative grants from $20,000 to $40,000 maximum, including $30,000 staff subsidies and $10,000 other administration subsidies. The $10,000 allowance for each community development officer was increased in the Budget to $12,000. We have introduced a new grant of $2,000, called an initiating grant, designed to encourage the formation of new regional councils. In short, we are giving as much encouragement as we can to the rapid development of this program consistent with the pilot stage which the plan presendy is at. There is widespread support for this program except from members of the Opposition. It is rather curious that the spokesman for the Opposition on welfare matters, the honourable member for Hotham, seems to have been selected for this role not because of what he can contribute constructively on welfare matters but for what he can do for the Opposition in either containing commitments in the welfare field or destroying worthwhile programs. He is on record as saying that the Australian assistance plan, and indeed the programs of my colleague the Minister for Tourism and Recreation, are poltiical pork barrelling. Only this week I received a letter from a person who is a constituent of the honourable member for Hotham, and is involved in the welfare field, bemoaning the fact that, as he put it, 'Don Chipp has changed from being a reason- able small ' 1 ' Uberal to becoming a quite reactionary and repressive person where the issues of social welfare are concerned'. Frankly, I sincerely regret that the poUcy of the Opposition as articulated by the Opposition spokesman on welfare matters, seems to be one of destruction where community development is concerned in welfare services, NA -' Mr SNEDDEN-My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Is it not true that very great probhe lems are associated with the introduction of a home interest tax rebate scheme on a pay-asyou-earn basis as demanded by the Caucus yesterday? What are the reasons for the Treasurer's opposition to the decision? What will be the cost ih 1974-75 of introducing the scheme? Has the amount of the cost been included in the Budget . Estimates? Is it a fact that all home owners would benefit by $ 100m for each 1 per cent reduction in home interest rates, and that if home interest rates were reduced to the level at which they were in 1972 there would be a saving to the community of something of the order of $400m, but not out of the taxpayers' pockets? Is it not a fact that the introduction of this scheme simply means that tax rates have to be kept higher than otherwise would be necessary? Why will the Government and the Treasurer not put more Uquidity into the system to ease the credit squeeze and reduce interest rates overaU?",26
74,Mr CREAN,HOME MORTGAGE INTEREST,"More than one question was asked by therighthonourable member. The first one asked was in relation to the tax deductibility of mortgage interest payments on a PAYE basis. I do not think anybody should deny that some technical problems are involved in such a scheme. Nevertheless, if it is at all feasible to make the provision on a weekly basis in some cases, I have instructed my officers to prepare the necessary mechanisms. When that is done I will make a full statement on the situation. It is not as easy as it is in some other cases. The only deductions reaUy made on the PAYE basis are for dependants and a sort of arbitrary allowance of $60 or $70 over and above that. Basically, they are amounts that are the same for all taxpayers and there is no difficulty in incorporating them in a schedule. But there is some difficulty about a deduction that varies according to the income and may, in some cases, be shared over 2 incomes. Acknowledging all those details, at least I am endeavouring to have the proposal incorporated if at aU possible. Mr Snedden-What about the rest of the question? Why do you not reduce interest rates?",27
75,Mr CREAN,HOME MORTGAGE INTEREST,"If the right honourable gentleman can make a sensible suggestion about reducing interest rates, I will be willing to listen to him. Mr Snedden- Mr Speaker, as",27
76,Mr SPEAKER,HOME MORTGAGE INTEREST,"Order! The right honourable gentleman will resume his seat. If he wants to get the call from the Chair he has to address the Chair and say what he wants to talk about. He cannot get up and break into a speech whenever so desires. He should ask for the call properly. Mr Snedden- Mr Speaker, will you please call me? (Honourable members interjecting)",27
77,Mr SPEAKER,HOME MORTGAGE INTEREST,Order! The right honourable gentleman will resume his seat. Mr Snedden- Mr SPEAKER ,27
78,Mr SPEAKER,HOME MORTGAGE INTEREST,Is this a point of order? Mr Snedden-This is a point of order.,27
79,Mr SPEAKER,HOME MORTGAGE INTEREST,"Well, why do you not say so? Mr Snedden- I say so.",27
80,Mr SPEAKER,HOME MORTGAGE INTEREST,"You do not. I will not recognise you unless you address the Chair properly and speak according to the Standing Orders. Mr Snedden- Mr Speaker, a point of order",27
81,Mr SPEAKER,HOME MORTGAGE INTEREST,That is better. Mr Snedden-The point of order is this: There is provision under Standing Orders for a statement to be made by the Treasurer. In the last sentence of his answer he said that if I had a suggestion to make about reducing interest rates he would be glad to hear it. My point of order is: Would you permit me to respond to the invitation given by the Treasurer?,27
82,Mr SPEAKER,HOME MORTGAGE INTEREST,That is not a matter for the Chair. NA NA,28
83,Mr THORBURN,COMMISSION,Is the Minister for Manufacturing Industry aware that some Australian manufacturers are apprehensive about the activiUes of the Industries Assistance Commission? Does the annual report of the IAC have any implications for Australian industry? Will the Minister take steps to ensure that the operation and activities of the IAC are better known and understood by manufacturers and the community generally.,28
84,Mr ENDERBY,COMMISSION,"I agree with the honourable member that there is apprehension. Some degree of concern is occasionally expressed by businessmen about the reports of the Industries Assistance Commission. It is a pity because there can be Uttle doubt that the IAC performs a very valuable role in Australia. There can be equaUy Uttle doubt that over the years of aU the subjects of great importance to Australia, to Australian manufacturing industry, to the management side, to the employees' side and to the consumers-becaus e in the long run we are aU consumers-ther e has been a lack of understanding of the relevance and the importance of this thing called protection, its advantages to Australians and also the costs and disadvantages that it presents to Australians. Behind that, of course, there is the other concept that these days is called structural change, which again is a matter on which there is very Uttle informed debate. There is a lot of misunderstanding and a lot of prejudice about it. One understands the feelings of a businessman who suddenly appreciates that it may not be in the interests of all Australians in the long run for his particular business to continue. We can understand his concern. Since this Government came to office it has taken great steps to Uft that debate to higher levels, to encourage it and to encourage discussions, through the industry panels, of the question of protection and what it means, the question of the tariff and the level of the exchange rate. As is also known on the Government side-it is to be regretted that it does not exist on the Opposition side in the Liberal and Country Parties-ther e is a degree of involvement by the back benchers of this Party through the Caucus system that involves an active participation in the decision making process. The most recent example, of course, is the discussion in the Caucus Economics Committee dealing with the IAC report on motor vehicles. As I say, it is a great pity that the Liberal and Country Parties have no equivalent form of involvement for their back benchers. I took it upon myself this morning, as part of this emphasis that we give to these matters to contact Mr Rattigan, who is the Chairman of the Industries Assistance Commission, and inquire whether he would be interested in attending and discussing with the Economics Committee of Caucus the overall philosophy and approach of the IAC on these matters. I am happy to tell the House and my own colleagues that he has accepted the invitation. I also took it upon myself first to seek the concurrence of the Prime Minister because he carries the direct ministerial responsibility for the IAC. I have also discussed it with the Chairman of the Caucus Economics Committee. Contained in that recent annual report of the IAC is a set of principles that is worthy of study by all members of this House. One can only with great difficulty challenge their logic. One, of course, has to accept the difficult poltiical problems that they often present for political parties, particularly when they are in goverament. But putting aside the poUtics of it, one has great difficulty in faulting the logic of the statements of principle contained in that annual report. I will conclude on this note. At least the Economics Committee of our parliamentary party and our back benchers will have the advantage of close intimate discussion with the man who propounds those principles and who has such a great influence on the discussion of protection in Australia. It is to be regretted-and I look at the Liberal people opposite-that you do not do the same sort of thing. NA",28

86,Mr SNEDDEN,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS," I move: That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent me moving the following motion: The House is of the opinion that the Minister for Minerals and Energy should make a statement orally so that the House, instead of merely having presented to it a paper on the matter of Northern Territory uranium, should be able to debate it. Mr Connor-There is no need to debate the matter. I am quite prepared",28
87,Mr SPEAKER,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,Order! I have a motion before the Chair. Does the Leader of the Opposition wish to make an arrangement with the Minister?,29

93,Mr SPEAKER,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,I call the Leader of the Opposition on a point of order.,29
94,Mr SNEDDEN,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,"Mr Speaker, I am not taking a point of order. With respect, I am responding to the question you put to me as to whether I wanted to make an accommodation with the Minister. In responding to that question I want to say that we will always give leave to a Minister to make a policy statement. The purpose of moving the suspension of Standing Orders is to prevent the tabling of papers. The Government is circumventing the practice of the House of a Minister making a policy statement and giving the Opposition 2 hours notice so that it can reply. I will very readily give leave to the Minister 2 hours from the time that I received this statement which now has been put on my table. In 2 hours time we will give leave to the Minister to make a statement.",29
95,Mr SPEAKER,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,In the meantime I have a motion before the Chair for the suspension of the Standing Orders. The arrangement has nothing to do with the Chair. That was only a suggestion I made. At present there is a motion before the Chair to suspend Standing Orders.,29
96,Mr SNEDDEN,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,"My proposal is that I will seek leave to withdraw the motion to suspend Standing Orders and I will grant leave in 2 hours time, which of course will be immediately after lunch. We will grant leave then and we would expect that the honour of the Parliament would be served by both sides if leave is sought and granted.",29
97,Mr SPEAKER,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,I suggest that the Acting Leader of the House and the leader of business on the Opposition side make arrangements in regard to this matter as quickly as possible. Is it the position that the motion is not proceeded with?,29
98,Mr SNEDDEN,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,I will not proceed with it.,29

107,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,REMUNERATION TRIBUNAL,Pursuant to section 7 (7) of the Remuneration Tribunals Act 1973-1974 I table the Remuneration Tribunal's determination of remuneration to be paid to members of the interim committee for the Children's Commission.

108,Dr FORBES,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I wish to make a personal explanation.,30
109,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,30
110,Dr FORBES,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Yes. Yesterday the Minister for Defence (Mr Barnard), in answer to a Dorothy Dix question from the honourable member for Bonython (Mr Nicholls), stated that I had made a statement or issued a statement that anti-riot operations should be the priority task of the Australian armed forces in the late 1970s. He went on to say that he found this incredible. I believe this is a deliberate and gross distortion of what I said. What I said was that for the later 1970s defence policy must be framed in terms of a range of tasks. Operations in aid of the civil power was one of no fewer than 6 tasks I mentioned. Antiriot operations is one of the many tasks which came under this heading. The Minister's distortion and over-reaction on this issue confirms my belief that he has specific instructions that Austrahan forces are not to be trained in anti-riot techmques because of his fear of repercussions from Labor's left wing. This is gross irresponsibility because nothing is more certain than that at sometime,somewhere, perhaps in the performance of the United Nations peace keeping task, Australian forces will have to perform this role.  personal explanation.",30
111,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?  Minister (Mr Whitlam), in answer to a question during which he read from a lengthy document relating to Cyprus, alleged that the Opposition was not interested in the problems of Cyprus.

113,Mr HUNT,RURAL PROGRAM, I move: That this House requests the Government to urgently present a program to stimulate rural production and to restore confidence in the rural sector of the economy in Australia as a proper basis for any positive plan the Government may sponsor or support at the forthcoming World Food Conference organised by the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation in Rome during November.,30
114,Mr SPEAKER,RURAL PROGRAM,Order! Is the motion seconded? Mr Fairbairn- I second the motion.,30
115,Mr HUNT,RURAL PROGRAM,"I move the motion because I hope that the Government will attempt to restore confidence in industry generally and in the rural industries in particular. There is not a sector of the Australian community that can claim much comfort from the incredibly bad performance of the Whitlam Government. However, the rural sector copped the bucket early in the piece. It was seen in the early days of the Whitlam administration that the rural industries were clearly in for some brutal and bloody surgery. Last year's budgetary measures which have since been followed by other measures have represented a withdrawal of approximately $350m worth of resources from the rural areas of Australia. But the worse aspect of the Government's socialist policy has been the withdrawal of taxation incentives and investment incentives from rural producers. Rural producers are disillusioned and distrustful and have lost complete faith in this Government and in their own prospects and indeed their ability to produce goods profitably under the Labor Party's economy strategy. There will of course be a heavy drop in capital investment in the rural sector at a time when farmers should be encouraged to become more capital intensive and more efficient to help offset the shattering rise of inflation and the escalating costs duction. Hardly a week goes by without a demonstration by farmers against prices, their falling incomes, innation, industrial disorder, fuel shortnow ages and the anti-rural policies of the Whitlam Government. In New South Wales we have witnesses such demonstrations, the most notable being earlier this month in my home town of Moree where 5,000 people turned out to give vent to their disillusion and anger. It would inept, insensitive and hopeless government that failed to appreciate the depth of anger among some of the hardest working people in Australia. It is no accident or act of ad hockery that the Government has embarked upon its anti-rural program. Indeed it set up the Coombs task force to examine aU the poUcies of the former Government with a view to dismantling them so that Labor could implement its own sociaUst program. The whole thrust of the economic poUcy has been to shift resources from the private sector, from those on the farms, from those in small businesses, and from those who are selfemployed to the pubUc or government sector. The Coombs report has become the blueprint of the economic pohcy of this Government. Since its pubUcation we have seen one decision after another in spite of the estabUshment of the Australian Industries Assistance Commission to which references should have been made prior to the arbitrary decisions taken by the Government. The Green Paper on rural policy has come after the rural industries have been torn Umb from limb. The whole exercise has been a facade; it has the appearance of being a fraud of the worse type. Now we have another reference to Australian Industries Assistance Commission on income for stabUisation for farmers. How long will it take for this examination to take place? How long do the farmers have to wait for some form of compensation for the value of the measures that have been taken from them? The loss of the superphosphate bounty at the end of this year when superphosphate prices look Uke rising to at least $50 a tonne is nothing short of disastrous. From 1 January, farmers be paying 3timesas much, excluding freight, as they are paying for superphosphate now. The price will have risen from $ 15.50 a tonne to $50 tonne. The average sheep farmer uses about tonnes a year and this increase will therefore cost farmers an additional $3,000 per annum. The removal of the petrol equalisation scheme cost farmers an additional $26m. There was also an effective 50 per cent reduction in Australian Government funds for local roads. What a of pro- humane, charitable Government the rural people have experienced since 1972. On top of higher postal charges, telephone costs and the highest interest rates on record, the farmers are being slugged with the prospect of a capital gains tax. Such a measure will further rob the people of rural Australia of their incentive and reduce their capacity to produce goods. The capital gains tax-som e of the principles of which are yet unanswered in spite of the probing questions be an of the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Adermann)-o n top of the loss of $37m of taxation incentives in the former Budget has come at a time when the rural industry should be growing more capital intensive. Where is the sense in these policies-policie s that miUtate against capital investment? Where is the incentive? How many young farmers will want to stay in the industry? Indeed, how many wiU be driven from it? I am told that the average age of farmers today is 52 years. Presumably these decisions were taken because of a mistaken beUef of the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) who made that memorable, that historic statement, that the farmers have never had it so good. Now of course in more recenttimesthe Prime Minister laments that the farmers just will not listen to the Government. I believe that they have heard enough ofhis rantings and ofhis insensitive outbursts. In an address to the New South Wales Country Press Association only last week he said: It is very difficult to have a dialogue with those who are just determined not to listen. Be that as it may, the Australian Government is determined to continue its efforts to achieve meaningful, constructive, dialogue with the rural community, not only those who live on farms but the far larger section of country dwellers who live in country towns. He is reported to have said that it was always unpopular to be seen taking something away, however Ulusory the presumed benefit in fact may be. I think that sort of statement indicates that he still has not understood the real problem facing these people. It is against this deplorable background that the Prime Minister on his recent visit to New York in an obvious effort to court favour with the Afro-Asian nations with populations will facing famine proclaimed that we need a world food policy and that Australia has the capacity to help feed the peoples of the world. It has been a said that he has been courting favour and trying 150 to win support among these nations and their delegates in the hope that, should he become any more unpopular within his own ranks, there will be a position for him within the United Nations. Be that as it may, it is against this background also that Cabinet has had to formulate a policy for Australia at the World Food Conference in Rome in November. The unfortunate Senator Wriedt goes to Rome hoping to give leadership at this conference, but the Austrahan Government with its short-sighted anti-rural policies has destroyed its chances of giving leadership at the conference. Whatever high-sounding pohcy the Government adopts for international scrutiny, the fact remains that the Australian Government's encouragement to the farmers has been non-existent. The Rome conference will be held in an atmosphere of crisis. The impending food crisis has renewed the call to estabUsh an international stock of basic foodstuffs, principally cereals, to cover seasonal fluctuations in world production. For some time now the Food and Agricultural Organisation has been sounding warnings to the world and these warnings have been largely unheeded by most nations. It is an international disgrace in this so-called enUghtened age that 1,000 rnillion people face hunger next year. They face not just degradation but starvation. MilUons of humans face death in the next 12 months. This will happen notwithstanding the fact that the world has the capacity to provide abundant food. Clearly there is an urgent need to develop an emergency world food stockpile consisting mostly of grain and, in the longer term, to develop a policy to lower world tariff barriers to enable the developing nations to earn foreign exchange and to generate their own capital resources in order to increase their own food production. Clearly, foreign aid to the developing countries should aim at helping them become more self-sufficient in meeting their basic food needs, but it will take some years for these countries to reach anywhere near selfsufficiency. If the agricultural nations are to keep pace with the world food demand, which is growing at 2.S per cent per annum, a great deal more resources will have to be devoted to agriculture. For instance, it is the developing countries that have rapidly growing populations, and the zero population growth concept will not be readUy accepted or indeed implemented in many of these nations. These countries will be importing 85 million tons of cereals by 1985, which is three times more than their present capacity to import food. While new long term policies to save human Uves from ultimate starvation are essential, there remains an enormously grave immediate problem of providing more grain and food in the Western agricultural nations. One of the paradoxes of the current situation that whUe we appear to have mountains of beef-in fact, it has been said that we have much meat and not enough grain in the world-w e have a world shortage of protein that wiU be felt within the next 12 months. Such demands to try to increase the avaUabUity of grain and other essential food will fall heavUy upon the shoulders of the United States, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa, indeed upon the European Economic Community countries and upon the Australian people. There is a need for a world food stocks policy based on the principle of price stabilisation designed to ensure profitable production to farmers. Those consumer countries desirous of providing low cost food to the consumers wiU have to apply consumer subsidies to achieve their goal. The simple fact remainsand the world needs to know it, and the people of this country need to know it-that unless returns are profitable to the farmers they will not invest the capital necessary to increase their production. In other words, any world food stocks poucy based on unremunerative returns to farmers will fail. In assisting the developing countries which are facing famine the oil-rich nations must be called upon to make theirfinancialcontribution. But surely the great lesson to emerge from this shocking human tragedy facing one-quarter pf the world's population is that agricultural nations such as Australia must encourage capital investment in agriculture to give an incentive to the farmers. It is no longer a matter of charity to the farmers, it is a matter of national and international priority. The Prime Minister this week has belatedly tried to reassure farmers that they are in for a better deal. He is reported in the 'Australian' dated 30 October to have said: We did not expect to be popular. After having removed income taxation concessions and so onI simply ask you to remember that these concessions and subsidies were not really helping you. We have replaced them with much more valuable benefits. Your long-term prospects are stronger in consequence. I hope that that is not the view of all those Labor men who represent rural constituencies. I hope that the rural rump of the Australian Labor Party can persuade the Prime Minister that that is a foolish statement, that it does not get to the root of the problem in this country or indeed in the world. It will be the Western countries, the free enterprise countries, the so-called capitalist countries, that will be called upon to provide the exportable surplus food in this time of crisis, indeed in the immediate future. It is the developis ing countries, the socialist countries, the countries with planned economies, which cannot meet too their own demands. Socialist countries like the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics have failed dismally with their agricultural plans. Their farmers do not have the incentive to work long hours, to care, to increase their production of foodstuffs. Indeed, it is the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics which is to a certain degree the villain of the piece at the present time. Since 1972 the Soviet Union has been involved in a great grain grab to meet its own deficit. It is virtually taking the grain from the mouths of the starving millions.",30

119,Mr HUNT,MEAT,"I thank the House. My plea to the Australian Government and to the Australian people is to lay aside the unsuccessful theories of socialism- a system that robs the people of their incentive-and to encourage the initiative of the farming community before it is too late. Indeed, the socialist creep in the Western world is undoubtedly robbing the people, the farmers, of their will to work and produce. If the Western world resorts to socialism it could well be at the expense of half the world's population. This is a dramatic statement, but I believe it to be very true. Australian farmers have the techmcal skill; they are among the world's most efficient farmers. They have the capacity to work hard under the most rugged conditions, but they need the capital, the resources, and above all they need encouragement and incentive. Without those ingredients our agricultural and pastoral performance will decline. We will then make our contribution to the forecast human disaster. My plea to the Government is to stimulate rural production, particularly cereals and grains, to restore confidence to the rural sector by dropping the crazy plan to divert resources from the private sector to the public sector. Those policies will only spell disaster for this country and add to the misery of people around the world. There have been enough examples throughout the world to show that the socialist system and socialist agricultural pohcies have failed. The statistics which have been incorporated in Hansard undoubtedly will prove that point. I hope that every student of economics studies them and learns the lesson before it is too late. That, of course, is essential to the future of this country.

120,Mr FAIRBAIRN,MEAT," I strongly support the motion which has been moved so ably by the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Hunt). Let me just read it out agains so that the House will understand it fully. The motion reads: That this House requests the Government to urgently present a program to sumulate rural production and to restore confidence in the rural sector of the economy in Australia as a proper basis for any positive plan the Government may sponsor or support at the forthcoming World Food Conference organised by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation in Rome during November. I intend to speak in particular about the beef situation because the beef industry in Australia is in a state of absolute crisis, as is the wool industry to a certain extent. Of course, those 2 industries are Australia's greatest farming industries. The situation in the beef industry at the moment is absolutely desperate. One frequently sees steers which were bought 12 months ago for between $150 and $250 each, depending on their age and size, and which have since been fattened, now worth $50 to $100 each. I heard recently of a person who purchased a property and stocked it with 1,000 steers and who would lose $100,000 if he realised on those steers today. The situation is desperate. It is even more desperate because many of the people engaged in the industry who borrowed short term money at high interest rates to enable them to purchase cattle and fatten them, expecting to make a profit, are now having to put them on the market in any case because they are being asked to repay their short term loans and they are all losing very heavily. That is the situation in the beef industry. As I have said, the situation in the wool industry is scarcely any better. The returns coming in now are showing that the wool cheques this year will be less than half what they were last year. They are at that level only because of the support that is being given by the Australian Wool Commission, which is buying in up to 40 per cent, and sometimes even more, of the offering. We all know that this sort of thing cannot go on indefinitely. But, of course, the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) has said that the primary producers have never had it so good, has told them that the worse is over and has gone to the United Nations posturing and saying that Australia is in a great position to produce more food. Of course it can produce more food if it is given the incentive to do so, but it must be given the incentive by way of returns and by way of assistance. What are the causes of the present situation? It is partly self-inflicted and it is partly due to world-wide causes. Undoubtedly, so far as the beef situation is concerned, there has been overproduction in certain areas and very large amounts are being held in storage. From December 1973 the meat exports from Australia have been only 51 per cent of the performance a year earlier. That has been brought about by a number of factors. I understand that there has been a severe drought in the United States of America, which has led to a number of cattle which normally would have been kept for breeding purposes being put on to the market and that therefore at the present moment there is an oversupply and over-kUling. We expect the situation to be restored to normal in the not too distant future, but it wiU be probably a year or so before the United States commences once again to take large quantities of Australian meat. There has been a very big drop in exports from Australia to Japan, which are only 62 per cent of what they were a year earUer. Large stocks have been built up. Now a beef quota exists and Australia has to get in for its small share of a small quota. The European Economic Community again is causing considerable trouble. In May 1974 it suspended import licences because of the size of the intervention stocks, which in beef alone were, I believe, some 100,000 tons. The incredible situation with respect to the EEC is that by paying high prices it encourages local production and the local production is then far larger than can possibly be stored and the EEC dumps it on world markets at any price, thereby completely upsetting the world markets in many areas. That is one of the causes of the present situation, but only one. The reduction in government assistance undoubtedly has been of major importance to the Australian producer. The honourable member for Gwyder said that some $350m less is going either to primary producers or to nonmetropolitan producers. The subsidies, taxation concessions and the like which the previous Liberal-Country Party Government buUt over many years to help the primary producer have been aboUshed by the present Government. We used to hear the Australian Labor Party say that it had a great Minister for Agriculture in Senator Wriedt and that he was the greatest. It was almost like hearing Cassius Clay.",37
121,Mr CALDER,MEAT,What has he done for the farming community?,38
122,Mr FAIRBAIRN,MEAT,That is a good question. What has he done? He loses every fight. Mr Kerin-Rubbish!,38
123,Mr FAIRBAIRN,MEAT,"I would Uke to hear of one that he has won. We seem to find that whenever a decision is made by the Caucus or the Cabinet it is made against the best interests of the Australian farmer. I hope that the Minister will put on a better performance in Rome than he has put on in Australia. Another reason for the present situation on the land has been the enormous increase in costs that has occurred under the present Government. I do not want to return once again to the subject of innation, but it is having an enormous effect on the cost of everything which the farmer has to buy. Steel posts, drenches, dips and aU those sorts of things have gone up enormously in cost. Wages have gone up. The cost of shearing has gone up enormously. I recall that in my last years as a farmer something like one-third of the total value of the wool cUp would go in shearing and crutching costs. Today the percentage is probably even larger than that. The honourable member for Gwydir mentioned the increase in the cost of superphosphate. I have always said that it would be to the advantage of a government to give superphosphate to a farmer for nothing because of the greater returns and greater tax revenue that would result. The present Government has been responsible for the price of superphosphate increasing to 3 times what it was at the beginning of 1973-fro m about $17 per tonne to about $50 per tonne. We know that a small amount of that increase has been due to the increase in the price of rock phosphate, but quite a lot of it has been due to the withdrawal of the subsidy. It is ludicrous for the Minister for Minerals and Energy (Mr Connor) to say, as he did in the House yesterday, that there has been a new discovery of phosphate. Does he not know that it was found in 1966 and that it was found only as a result of Liberal-Country Party policies which have since been abolished by the present Government? Had it not been for the payment of a subsidy in relation to oil drilling and the return of the cores as a result of that, we never would have discovered the enormous amount of phosphate rock in the north which we hope will be brought into production and manage to keep some of these excess costs down. I have been asked by the Whip to Umit my speakingtime.Therefore I shall conclude by ing what we can do to improve the situation, which I believe is catastrophic at the present ment. Firstly, of course, we have to continue negotiations overseas and search for every ible market. I do not mind Ministers going overseas when they are going for some useful purpose, such as trying to open up new markets; but I do object to the great sallies overseas by the Prime Minister, with an entourage of some people and some 200 gallons of champagne, cause they achieve nothing. So we have to conbelieve tinue negotiations overseas. We have to make finance available at reasonable rates and on reasonable terms. Tbis, I think, is the most important action which should be taken for the farmer. I mentioned the fact that many farmers are now in difficulties because they have had to row money for the purchase of money has been borrowed short term and at high rates of interest. No one can afford to be paying 15 per cent interest on a loan over a long period and to hold stock whose value is continuseas ing to drop. I have heard of cases of people have borrowed money and stock agents have countries. then said: 'We must recaU that money'. These people have had to sell their stock on the market for whatever they can get. Not only do they have to sell the stock which they purchased as a result of their loans but also they usually have to addition a great deal of their original stock order to repay those funds. Before the last election, the Liberal Party forward its rural poUcy which included the estabinto Ushment of a national rural bank. I believe that enormous benefits could be derived from such scheme. We said that there should be an institumoved. tion of combined trading banks and other lenders in the rural sector to provide for the rural sector. This new institution also would finance plant, stock and equipment on a medium term loan basis at bank interest rates rather than through hire purchasefirms.The terms that were suggested for lending purposes were appropriate to the purpose of the loan-for example, 5 years to 10 years duration for a loan on plant, equipment and breeding stock and 15 to 30 years duration for a loan to purchase land. We also put forward the proposal that there should be a reserve fund. Farm incomes in Australia fluctuate so widely through droughts. We said that there should be a reserve fund into which farmers in a good year could deposit money without paying tax on that money. When it was necessary for them to withdraw all or part of those funds, tax would be paid on the amount saywithdrawn. That would tend to equaUse the scheme. We know that there is an averaging sysmotem provided in relation to taxation. But I think that the scheme we proposed would have been of possincreased advantage to primary producers The Liberal Party believes that many subsidies and concessions should be restored. Again, on taxation, we have said that Australia is one of 50 the most drought-prone countries anywhere in be the world with wide seasonal fluctuations. We that Government policies through appropriate taxation concessions for water and soil conservation and fodder conservation should encourage farmers to drought-proof themselves in the national interest. We believe also that this new capital gains tax should not be hanging over the heads of people who urgently need capital. borWe do not know a great deal at the present time stock. That about that proposed tax. Finally I suggest to the Government that it should consider the use of beef as part of its overaid program. We remember that in the early who post war years wheat was used to feed starving At that time a wheat surplus existed in the world and a great deal of wheat from Australia was used by some of the starving countries. I believe that it could be possible for the same thing to be done with respect to our beef. It seU in could be used for that purpose. Countries in in need, of course, would have to agree to that proposal. Many of them prefer capital equipment to consumable goods. I think that there is a case for put this action. I hope that the Government will look the matter. In order to maintain my agreement with the Whip, I shall now conclude. I supa port most strongly the motion that has been",38
124,Mr WHAN,MEAT," I wish to draw to the attention of the House some of the contradictions inherent in the Opposition's position, as reflected in its motion. Implicit in the motion is the idea that there will be a consistent rural policy-somethin g that holds together. I recall to the House the plea by the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Hunt), who led for the Opposition, for lower world tariff barriers. I wonder how the honourable member for Indi (Mr Holten) feels about that proposal? Great conflict on the question of tariff barriers is present in the Opposition-whethe r those barriers should be lowered. It should be quite clear that, in order to lower tariff barriers, we should behave in a like manner. The difficulty that this creates, I am told from the Country Party benches, is the differences between a tariff and an embargo. Well, that may be so but the exporting country sees the matter differently. Obvious problems exist with respect to the export of beef. Here we see breaches of international agreements. If we are to achieve some satisfaction in respect of these breaches, our own behaviour in respect of tariffs must be immaculate. Another area in which we find contradictions is the Coombs report. I quote from the transcript of the Austrahan Broadcasting Commission television program' Monday Conference' which was attended by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lynch). He said: ... I support the bringing down of the Coombs Repon-i was a very useful and productive repon because it provided far more information about many subsidies than has available during years gone by. It was a major initiative I welcome it. That was said by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. In regard to this consistent policy, Ian which seems to underlie the plea contained in the Government present motion, let me again refer to this intercourses view with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. He was asked: What steps would you take to alleviate the present the beef industry? He answered: That's a tough question. There aren't many answers present time either in the mind of the Government nor mind. He had no specific answer. He elaborated, by saying: 111 just come back, look, the position about beef is extraordiing narily difficult. It derives, as the questioner would from the position in relauon to export markets and ticular world commodity prices. There has, of course, downturn; of course in the short of finding new markets, it's a question also, quite the particular problem of beef, of seeking to provide form of equity to those persons who need it. That is exactly the position that the Government has adopted on this question. Again, referring the beef problem, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said: ... It is a very tough question... Insofar as world commodity markets are concerned, that's really a question of getting out and seeking to beat up new orders and that's difficult having regard to the world scene at the present time... We see in the Opposition's own comments a conflicting set of recommendations for the agricultural sector. Not only that, but because of a lack of policy, contradictions are creeping into Opposition statements. In the 'Western Austrahan Farmers Weekly' on 17 October 1974 the Deputy Leader of the Australian Country Party, the honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) was challenged to give the source of a claim that he made. The letter reads in part: Mr Sinclair has claimed ('Farmers Weekly', October 3) that government spokesmen have stated that because of devaluation farm incomes this year could be lifted by $SO0m. The writer of this letter, Mr F. P. Hutchinson of Beacon, challenges the Deputy Leader of the Australian Country Party to name the Government spokesman who made that statement. That challenge has not been accepted for a perfectly good reason. His authority is mythical. Again to underline the contradictions which come from an Opposition without a policy, I refer to a media t release dated 8 May 1974 by the Deputy Leader been of the Country Party. It is printed in the journal and 'The Federal Reporter'-no t a bad journal-and it reads: The Deputy Leader of the Australian Country Party, Mr Sinclair speaking in Mackay today said that the Labor was deliberately holding back on the publication of a top secret report which would detail funher of discrimination and vandalism the Labor Government would take against rural Australia. The report was the Green Paper. In this House crisis in only a few weeks ago the Deputy Leader of the Australian Country Party was claiming that the Government was not moving fast enough in at the implementing the recommendations in the in my Green Paper. He gave it his full support on that occasion. The contradictory position between the Country Party and the Liberal Party which is emergis simply the direct result of the fact that they well know, would not have a policy, if they were going to in parthis World Food Conference, which would seem been a credible in the eyes of overseas nations. The fact and long run it's a question apan from is that only yesterday the Government announsome ced that it would raise the first advance on wheat and suspend quotas in order to stimulate the production of wheat. Clearly that sort of action at to the moment is not called for in regard to the beef industry. In the longer term the beef industry is well-founded. For the beef industry we need to have these short term buffer mechanisms which will overcome problems of short term falls in internauonal prices. This is not an international problem; it is a domestic problem. In the longer term, for beef and wool and most animal products, we find that the production decision does not pay off for 2 years, 3 years or 4 years. It is important to maintain an overall policy for the long term and, at the same time, develop short term policies to cushion the producers from fluctuating world market prices. This, in fact, is what the Government is doing. Taxation concessions do not help in this respect. In terms of averaging incomes, the taxation concessions come when incomes are high and they have least effect when incomes are low. Clearly they are not the answer to this particular problem. For the first time in history we have provided a floor price for wool. We are emphasising the importance of negotiating long term contracts for beef and other agricultural products to give some protection to the Australian producers of agricultural products. These areas have attracted the attention of the Government. We have also taken the lead in developing more markets overseas. In the Bureau of Agricultural Economics a specialised agricultural marketing section will be created. It is ironic that restraints on this particular activity, so important now in this particular crisis, have the complete consensus of the Opposition. In fact, implicitly its pohcy is to curtail the expansion of the Public Service. Having worked in the BAE there is no doubt my mind that the future development of this market section in the BAE will be inhibited the ceiling placed on PubUc Service recruitment. This is the stupidity of these generalised ments and the image that is created in the minds of the electorate by the Opposition-that all lic servants are parasites. The Opposition places considerable emphasis on the contention that the only productive sector is the private sector. possible difference can there be between the duction of a barmaid employed by the public dation. sector and a barmaid employed by the private sector? They do the same job. In this case we see the chickens coming home to roost. By having this generalised condemnation of the PubUc vice, one of the instruments that we need to us a more sensitive appreciation of overseas marketing-the market section in the BAE-wil l have its progress slowed. This is where the generaUsed attack and general approach of the Opposition in creating an image in the mind the electorate do not pay off. We aU depend the pubUc sector as well as the private sector and the balance between the two should always be maintained. Australia will be able to go to the world food conference with a clean sheet behind it-clea n so far as our trading relationships are concerned. Our future prospects as world food producers have never been better and we are in a better position to go to that conference with this recent announcement by the Government to encourage the production of wheat, a commodity currently in short supply. The overall future for agriculture in Australia is extremely bright. This morning we heard from the Opposition comments about how many people throughout the world who are starving can be fed. One proposition needs to be clear when this argument is developed. No sector of the community can afford to pay fully for whatever food aid we might provide to overseas countries needing food. It is a community responsibility. There is a tendency to assume that we can give food away, but who gives it away? Does the farmer give it away? Is he being asked to give food away? Surely that is not the proposition. Surely this is a responsibility that can be accepted only by the electorate as a whole and be paid for by the electorate as a whole. What will this do to our income tax structure? Will this be yet another charge on the taxpayer? Of course it wiU be. The reality of these propositions should be faced. If we are to provide food- I certainly would be a strong supporter of this sort of action-w e must accept the fact that the taxpayer will pay and in that this will be a charge on the taxpayer. We cannot have the falsity of the position the Oppoby sition sketches out when it makes these sort of claims and then say it will lower taxes because comthe charge the Government makes on the community is too high. If that is a practical solution to pubour problems, the consequences must be accepted. Our position at the world food conference and in the eyes of those countries which are What starving would seem credible if we accepted the proconsequences that will flow from this recommenWe have seen another attack today in regard to the domestic economy so far as the rural sector is concerned, but these bland attacks do not bear Serexamination. I take as an example the country give roads grant. Under this Government the allocation is being increased by 39 per cent to $ 1,120m for Australian roads in the next 3 years. Of this money 58 per cent will be spent on rural roads whereas only 49 per cent of the previous of Government's allocation was spent on such on roads. We see the pay off on the Hume Highway. I wonder how the honourable member for Hume (Mr Lusher) feels about the idea that money that would have been spent on that road will be deviated to some other area. Our main road transport links are falling apart because of the lack of a systematic approach to the transport system in Austraha. In the Goulburn by-election held recently Sir Charles Cutler claimed that the State Government had spent $50m on the Hume Highway in 2 years. Now he tells us it did not do so. When we say to the local government authorities that this money that we are devoting to national roads replaces money the State Government spent on national roads he says that it is not-that it is money that the Federal Government gave the State in the first place. He never said that during the Goulburn by-election. Then he said it was money from the State. It is a pity fbr Sir Charles Cutler and many others in the Opposition parties that these things come in such close conjunction. The people in my electorate remember what was said during that by-election. They remember that Sir Charles Cutler claimed that the State had spent $50m on the Hume Highway in 2 years and that he projected large expenditures in the future. Now that he tells the local councils that they cannot spend money because it all came from the Federal Government in thefirstplace his duplicity is revealed. On the question of government expenditure we remember the proposal put by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition during the 'Monday Conference' to which I have already referred. the Opposition had been thinking of an election before that 'Monday Conference' it must have put such ideas behind it now. The proposal was for an 8 per cent reduction right across the board. How would the Australian Government find exported money for rural shires for State roads then? Mr Kerin-Would they spend money on the farmers?",39
125,Mr WHAN,MEAT,That would be an interesting sion proposition. We see contradictions emerging from the Opposition's case. This motion highUghts these contradictions. We are being asked at to go to a world organisation judged by world terms. The biases and prejudices of the local scene will be dismissed and contradictions emerge. It will be only the eat grain. consistent argument that wins the day in such a world forum.,42
126,Dr PATTERSON,MEAT,"Dawson-Minister for modities Northern Development and Minister for Northern Territory) (11.49)-The theme of the motion moved by the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Hunt) is that this House requests the clothes. Government urgently to present a program to stimulate rural production. I will not enter into the arguments that have raged in this House over the last year or so about the rights and wrongs of various depreciation allowances, taxation allowances, the price of superphosphate, subsidies on nitrogen and other matters. I am concerned with the principle that lies behind this motion. The basis of the motion is to stimulate production through measures of confidence, whatever form they may take. The principal theme is to increase the production of primary products in Australia. This is an admirable concept. I do not disagree with it. But, as the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Hunt) well knows, almost every additional ton of produce that we produce we must sell at prices profitable to the Australian producer or, if we give it away, it obviously has to be financed by the Australian Government through the taxpayer. Let us have a look at some of these industries. Let us take wool, for example. I know that there is criticism of the level of thefloorprice, but let us be quite serious about this. If it were not for the Australian Government's poUcy, the wool industry today would be in a very serious financial position; in fact I would say that it would be in a state of chaos or a state of utter collapse. I do not know whether honourable members opposite are aware of the latestfigures,but if my memory is right the Australian Wool Commission's stocks in hand up to this week total more than $ 1 SOm If worth of wool. The Commission is buying at the rate of 40 per cent to 50 per cent of the offering. Who could possibly advocate a poUcy of expansion of the wool industry under these conditions? Every extra ounce of wool we produce has to be to countries, some of which have policies of resistance to present purchases of Australian wool. The Government itself is doing everything possible to stimulate markets overseas. The honourable member for Gwydir did not tell us what he would do in terms of expanof the wool industry. It is no good expanding the wool industry unless we can sell our product a price which is satisfactory to the producer and unless we can get markets; otherwise we where we will be have in fact",42
127,Mr HUNT,MEAT,"Peopl e do not eat wool, but they",42
128,Dr PATTERSON,MEAT,"Wait a minute. I will deal with grain soon. The Opposition selects the comto be dealt with in this debate. People the want to have wool and people want tb wear clothes. Apparently under the poUcy of the Opposition they would not be allowed to wear We have debated the beef industry time and time again in the House in recent weeks. It has been mendoned at length by the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Fairbairn). The policies of the European Economic Community are opposed to us. It is extremely difficult despite the efforts that the beef industry and the Australian Government are making, to regain entry into that market. The whole quesuon is being looked at in the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The policies of Japan and the United States of America at present are such that they are not buying our beef in the quantities they bought before. The quesuon of foreign aid was raised. It may be that this is a solution to problem. After the next wet season thousands and thousands of fat cattle-the y are fat nowmust come on to the market. It would be against every Government policy to allow those cattle, for example, to die in the paddocks in the event of drought or simply to wither away with old age. Obviously the catde will have to be killed. Obviously there will have to be a pohcy to use the beef in tinned, frozen or chilled form. As regards grain, with respect to the ing World Food Conference let me say that the Minister for Agriculture (Senator Wriedt) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Willesee) will be attending that conference. delegation will be led by the Minister for mentioned. Agriculture. The World Food Conference, course, is held under the auspices of the United Nations primarily in response to the world grain shortage and the rising prices. The Ministers have proposed an approach which, I believe, flexibile. It is in line, of course, with the tralian Government policy of having a positive and constructive plan to reduce the food gap developing countries, in particular with a view supporting, where possible, proposals which have the support of the majority of the developmodity, ing countries and of course have the support the developed countries. The Australian delsecurity egation, within the framework again of the Ausrespect tralian policy, in Rome will support programs expanding agricultural production and increasto ing technical aid to developing countries. It will favour the establishment of a system of world food security and the establishment grain stocks to be negotiated in the appropriate trade forums of the world. We will support also, as a matter of policy, proposals to develop food information and early warning systems throughout the world. All these are admirable proposals and motions which will be considered in full by the developing and developed nations Rome conference. No mention has been made of one of the serious world shortages at the present time-that of sugar. Australia is one of the few countries in the world that have the capacity to greatly expand production, but the same argument again applies. If production is expanded every ton of the increase must be sold at a reasonable price. Eighty per cent of our production of sugar at present has, in fact, to be exported. We have the capacity to expand. But the sugar farmers of Australia have bitter memories of when they expanded very heavily some 12 years ago when the world price was high and just after they expanded the world price dropped to £Stgl2 a this ton. It has taken years and years to recover. We have to guard against a repetition of the downturn in prices in the sugar industry as we have seen in the beef and wool industries. I am doing everything possible within my jurisdiction, in association with CSR Ltd, the Sugar Board and the Queensland Government, to ensure that we have secure markets, and in particular long term markets. When we have those markets we will expand. Our policy is to provide the world with sugar at a price that is fair and reasonable both forthcomto the producer and to the consumer. I wanted to deal with the principles of this proposal. I have no quarrel with the actual concept The behind what the honourable member for Gwydir It is a concept, I believe, to supply the of world with food. It is a concept which will develop Australia and Australian resources which in some respects, in terms of being able to increase production of food, are unparalleled is throughout the world. I cannot stress too much Austhat in a country such as Australia, where everything in the primary producing field and in the in major industries has to be exported, it would be to sheer folly to embark on policies to increase the production of wool, beef or any other comunless we have secure markets. The poliof cies of the Australian Government are to have of markets and security of prices with to quantity; and, in the other respect to for help developing countries as much as we can and explore the possibilities of providing food for foreign aid, particularly those types of food that are high in protein such as beef. I believe that of world they are admirable principles. Question resolved in the negative. NA Proposed Select Committee",42
129,Mr SNEDDEN,SPECIFIC LEARNING DIFFICULTIES," I move: (1) That a select Committee be appointed: (a) to inquire into the incidence of all forms of specific learning difficulties among Australian children and adults; (b) to examine measures that are being taken at the present time to overcome such difficulties; (c) to report on the success that present measures are having in alleviating specific learning difficulties; (d) to examine the awareness of specific learning difficulties among the community generally and among the medical, health, teaching and social welfare professions in particular; (e) to examine the extent to which problems associated with the incidence of specific researched in Australia at the present time; (f) to examine the social, emotional and other handicaps that individuals with specific learning difficulties suffer; (g) to recommend measures that can be taken to heighten community awareness of specific learning difficulties, and (h) to recommend action that can be taken by the Federal Government or by the Federal Government in co-operation with State and local governments isations to alleviate the difficulties and in particular to examine the need for wide-spread screenings of young children to detect the existence of specific learning symptoms so that adequate remedial programs can be recommended from an early age. (2) That the committee recognise the responsibility of the States in these matters and seek their co-operation in all relevant aspects. (3) That the committee consist of six Members, three to be nominated by the Prime Minister, two to be nominated by the Leader of the Opposition and one to be nominated by the Leader of the Australian Country Pany. (4) That the members of the committee hold office as a committee until the House of Representatives expires by dissolution or effluxion of time. (5) That the committee have power to appoint subcommittees consisting of three or more of its members, and refer to any such sub-committee any matters which the committee is empowered to examine. (6) That four members of the committee constitute a quorum of the committee, and a majority of the members of a sub-committee constitute a quorum of that sub-committee. (7) That the committee or any sub-committee have power to send for persons, papers and records, to move from place to place, and to sit during any recess. (8) That the committee or any sub-committee have power to authorise publication of any document presented to it. (9) That the committee be provided with all necessary staff, facilities and resources and have power, with the approval of the Speaker, to appoint persons with specialist knowledge for the purposes of the committee. (10) That the committee repon as soon as possible and that any member of the committee have power to add a protest or dissent to any report. (11) That the foregoing provisions of this resolution, so far as they are inconsistent with notwithstanding anything contained in the standing orders. What we are looking for is a joint committee of members from both sides of the House to look into this extremely important matter. I have been concerned about this problem for very many years. It is a hidden problem. It is a problem which impacts very seriously on individuals and reduces their capacity to be happy, to be successful and to contribute to the community. Not only that, it has a very serious impact on social relationships of the individual with his family, brothers and sisters or parents, and with those people with whom he associates. It can have a very serious impact upon an individual in his dealings with others in the community. Thinking of the matter, I came to the conclusion that it should be, in a very real sense, the learning difficulties are being subject for a national purpose effort and that that national purpose would not be assisted if the inquiry were to be conducted on a political base. If it were to be conducted on a political base all that was likely to happen was that attitudes may get frozen in and there would not be the freedom to move. as well as voluntary organThe problem concerns a large number of Australians who have been described as the last large group of neglected and misunderstood handicapped children and adults. I make the point that a child who is handicapped in the way that I am speaking of and who emerges from the school system does not suddenly have a magic wand waved over him so that the problem is cured, and you have an adult without the problem. If the problem exists in childhood it will exist in adulthood. The consequences for the individuals who are afflicted with specific learning difficulties are very great. This is one manifestation of a general disorder which is grouped under thetitleof minimal brain dysfunction. Minimal brain dysfunction is the term used in relation to children or adults of near average, average or above average intelligence-som e with an extremely high intelligence rating-wh o have certain learning and/or behavioural disabilities ranging from mild to severe, which are associated with deviations of function of the cenany evidence given before it and tral nervous system. These deviations can manifest themselves by various combinations of impairment in perception, language, memory, control of attention, conceptualisation, impulse or motor function. The most commonly affected academic skills are reading, arithmetic, spelling and writing. It is some of these difficulties that the motion before the House specifically refers to. the standing orders, have effect I want to emphasise 2 points in speaking of an impairment that may be due to minimal brain dysfunction. It is absolutely necessary to recognise the variation in the extent of brain dysfunction. There are many people in the community who have very high intelligence, who attain high academic qualifications and who are accepted in the community on any other ground as being totally normal, but when they are assessed on communication and their ability to use language it is said of them that they lack judgment. The absence of so-called judgment is only an absence of the handling of language, of the conceptualisation of their thoughts. Having said that of them, we then regard them as being inferior because they lack judgment. The motion addresses itself to what many of us regard as totally normal people in the community. There are some who, because of the extent of their problem, are not regarded as normal; but a very great number of people are so regarded. The other point I want to emphasise is that I have purposely cast the terms of reference of the proposed committee wide enough to encompass those students at school who have worked hard, attended good schools- I am not using the word 'good' in any sense of difference between the system of private or pubhc schools or anything of that kind-and have had good teachers but who, when they have reached the end of their education at 16,17 or even older, are still in need of basic remedial teaching so that they can read and write properly. Notwithstanding that the education system is good or that the teachers are good there are still children emerging from the system with an incapacity in language, in reading or writing or expressing. In school they have been ashamed of their disabUity. They have hidden it and the system has been unable to detect it. What I am reaUy asking in this motion is how it is that our education system is able to operate and let so many people pass through its complete system without achieving the very basic skills in language. We must address ourselves specifically to this dilemma as a national and social purpose. The result of this tragic situation is that we have thousands of individuals in the community who, despite their most desperate attempts and despite above average intelligence, do not achieve the progress that their potential would indicate they should. The consequence for the nation is that as a society we under-achieve. We have human resources available that are not being used. Specific learning difficulties are widespread. It has been estimated that 15 per cent to 20 per cent of the Australian school population suffer from them. Despite their widespread nature, the community awareness of them in Australia is minimal. The overriding purpose of this motion and the consequent establishment of a select committee is to heighten community awareness of dyslexia and specific learning difficulties among the community generaUy. The community understands blindness and deafness. We recognise the difficulties physically and mentally handicapped chUdren face. Polio, tetanus, diphtheria are common household words; parents recognise these disabilities and ensure that their chUdren are immunised against them. We aU accept colourbUndness as a common condition which has no stigma attached to it. How many in the community know the term 'dyslexia'? Do we understand the significance and consequence of word-blindness? How many are able to recognise it in their chUdren? How many know how to seek attention for it, even if they are aware of it? I shall mention some recent surveys which have been undertaken in Australia which emphasise the magnitude of the problem we have in Australia. The Boronia High School Advisory Centre in Victoria surveyed more than 2,600 students in first and second forms in 12 eastern suburbs high schools in Victoria. The result showed that 45.7 per cent of those tested needed remedial specialist teaching in reading if they were to profit from high school work, and 25 per cent were found to read so badly as to be classified as functionally illiterate. A survey by Macquarie University in New South Wales suggests that 112,000 adults over the age of 16 years in the Sydney metropolitan area alone are functionaUy illiterate; that is, when tested they are unable to read even simple directions from a telephone directory. The consequences of this situation are evident. We are allowing a significant number of children to progress right through the education system without learning to use what is a solely human perquisite-ou r language. They have suffered years at school being branded as lazy, stupid, emotionally disturbed or unintelligent. The inteUigent ones have been called lazy. The less intelligent ones have been called mentally handicapped and aU sorts of things. In many cases the parents have not understood them. This has created social problems that need not have occurred and ought not to have occurred. Others have hidden their problem and because of high IQ remain undetected right throughout adulthood. Their abUity to learn any subject at school has been greatly impaired. The learning process has been a nightmare for them. Many will have suffered as a consequence severe emotional distress. They see themselves as misfits. They often do not know what their problem is and are not given any assistance in overcoming it. Many of them see society as hostile to them. Because of their language barrier and their communication problem they face a restricted life. Opportunities for them are curtailed in the same way as a physical or mental handicap curtails the achievements of others in the community. But in most of the cases involving the people that I am speaking about there is no sympathy from the community or those who are associated with them and very frequently there is hostility towards them. They are ordinary Australians. They often have no physical disability and ironically, because their disability is not evident, it remains undetected and uncorrected. They can never achieve their true potential. It is my very real wish that all people emerging from the education system should have an education that matches their intellectual capacity. I have much to say on this subject but there is a short time in which to say it so I will therefore tend to skip some things. The success of these people in obtaining employment initially can be marred by an inability to carry out successfully the completion of an application form. They make mistakes in filling out the application form and the potential employer prefers somebody else. But this may be due just to word blindness - a n incapacity to write the words properly. Their ability to drive a car with safety is impaired because a very frequent disabUity in a person with specific learning difficulties is a confusion between 'right' and 'left'. Many of them will be unable to read road signs. Many of them will find pubUc transport difficult because they cannot understand the destination signs. Many will suffer accidents in factories because they cannot read the warning notices. Many will be among the juvenile deUquents committed to institutions or among criminals sentenced to prison, destined to serve their terms without anyone recognising that the major cause of their behaviour is the affliction of a specific learning disability which develops an emotional disturbance which is exaggerated and multipUed as time goes on. Overseas studies repeatedly demonstrate the very high correlation between juvenUe delinit. quency and specific learning difficulties. For example, Dr Chester Poremba of the Colorado Children's Hospital has found in his studies 90.4 per cent of chUdren who had become mittee deUquents had suffered learning fatigue and learning faUure. The millions of dollars that have been poured into the rehabiUtation of young people who have become anti-social has been largely wasted. SimUarly, there is a high correhim. lation between disturbed behaviour and specific learning disabUity. As an instance, 50 per cent of chUdren referred for psychiatric treatment to the Victorian School Medical Service have had diaggranted. nosed a specific learning disabUity as the main cause of their problem. A great deal of investigation of this problem has been undertaken in the United States and other overseas countries, but in Australia we have failed sufficiently to tackle the problem. In Government we funded an Australian-wide workshop organised by the Specific Learning Difficulties Associations in Australia, which are known as SPELD. The present Minister for Education, Mr Beazley, provided funds for members of SPELD to attend the 11th International Conference on Learning Difficulties in Texas in 1974. I know that many Ministers are currently examining proposals that have been referred to them by SPELD. The history of this motion is that it is the result of an agreement between myself and the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) that we should combine in a co-operative effort to begin a major national program to attack the problem. As I said at the outset, I have been concerned for a long time about this matter. I approached the Prime Minister and said: 'Let us not make this a political issue on which our attitudes can become frozen. Let us make it a national purpose which we can all join in and tackle through a joint committee of the House.' I want to say that I was very grateful that when I raised the matter with the Prime Minister he, without any hesitation at all, immediately accepted the need for such a proposal and that it should be regarded as a national purpose in no way influenced by politics. If l may say so, this necessarUy means that none of us will try to make poltiical capital out ofit. If we pursue this in the right way it will be understood on both sides of the House to be with a total commitment. I notice the honourable member for Casey smUing. Mr Mathews-It is just a cop-out to try to forget the past.",43
130,Mr SNEDDEN,SPECIFIC LEARNING DIFFICULTIES,What has been said by the honourable member for Casey disappoints me very greatly. I am not going to respond further to I am going to continue with my purpose which is that there should be no political advantage taken by anybody. I would hope that if the that honourable gentleman should serve on this comhe will come to it without that attitude of mind. I would prefer to forget that the comment was made. I ask leave to incorporate in Hansard the letter which was written to the Prime Minister arising out of the discussion which I had with,46
131,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPECIFIC LEARNING DIFFICULTIES,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is (The document read as follows)My dear Prime Minister, This letter is written pursuant to the arrangement I proposed to you at our meeting on Wednesday, 23 October. It has been a personal concern of mine for some time that there is no adequate attack on the problem of children and adults with a specific learning difficulty. The term 'specific learning categories including minimal cerebral misfunction, minor brain damage, neurological handicap and dyslexia. The overriding manifestation of these disorders is a difficulty using language; an inability to read and spell and consequently write, despite intelligence aiid socio-economic standard. In short, word-blindness. The result of this disorder, which is relatively widespread in the community, is a failure by a significant number of people to achieve the standard of education that their intelligence, self-determination and efforts should make possible. The consequences for society are significant, because it under-achieves. The consequences for the individual can be traumatic due to the stigma that is attached to an inability to communicate adequately. For example, there is a clear link between the occurrence ofjuvenile delinquency and learning difficulties. The incidence of specific learning, disabilities accurately determined. Nevertheless, surveys have indicated that at least 1S per cent to and adults are affected. Unfortunately, despite the fact that it is so widespread, community awareness of it is minimal. I told you during our discussion that I believe we should adopt, as a national purpose, the alleviation of this social problem. It is my wish that this issue should be totally non-political. Accordingly, I approached you as I did so that we could avoid it becoming political. You agreed with this approach. We agreed that every means to the forefront of public discussion. I know you are aware of the work that has been undertaken over the past 6 or 7 years by the SPELD Associations in Australia; the many people working with these associations have performed a remarkable service, attempting to spread awareness of the problem. They feel their efforts are making headway but very slowly. attention is focussed on the problem in human terms, then it will remain ignored by the community-to its own disadvantage and the continuing social handicap of those afflicted. We agreed that the most suitable immediate approach would be the appointment of a committee of members of the House to examine the problem, assess its nature and extent, its impact on the community and the individual and report on the most appropriate ways of overcoming it. We arranged that I would ask you a question stating that I was raising the matter as a national purpose and non-political issue. You would answer in like vein mentioning our discussion and our agreement to the formation of a parliamentary committee. We also discussed the composition of your Government's proposed Children's Commission the importance in my view of appointing to it a person who has a sound knowledge and close interest in the specific learning disorder field. You kindly volunteered that ommended a suitable person, you would appoint that person to the Commission. I appreciate that assurance. I will write in the near future. I look forward to joining in a co-operative program of action to tackle this 'hidden' very pressing. Yours Sincerely, B.M. SNEDDEN Hon. E. G.

132,Mr SNEDDEN,SPECIFIC LEARNING DIFFICULTIES,"That letter makes it clear that this proposal should be solely on the basis of a non-political approach. The final point I want to make is to mention the work that has been undertaken in Australia by the Specific Learning Difficulties Associations in Australia. All honourable members are aware of the remarkable work that they have been undertaking. I should Uke to place on record my personal gratitude, as an Australian, to SPELD for its magnificent work and its untiring and regretfully largely unrewarded efforts over the last 6 or 7 years. It has undertaken a most difficult task and one that governments generally have failed to do but should have done. Whether it was the Governhas not been ment of which I was a member or whether it be the present Government, the job should have 20 per cent of Australian children been done. Now is the time for it to be done and to express ourselves as members of the Parliament to be committed to this national purpose. I express my personal regret that we have not followed more swiftly and more positively the lead that has been given by people associated with SPELD. I am confident that the passing of this motion will represent a commitment by each should be taken to bring this member of the House to SPELD, but more particularly a commitment by each member of this House to all Australian children and adults who have suffered from a specific learning difficulty, that we will not cease in our efforts until there is a marked improvement in the alarming and, I 1I have no doubt that unless must confess, depressing picture of which I have been speaking today. Last Wednesday I met Mrs Stewart, the Secretary of the Australian Associations of SPELD, and Mrs Dibden, the South Australian Secretary. (Extension of time granted.) I thank the House. I will detain honourable members for less than a minute. I indicated to them that as a first step I would examine the possibUity of having a select committee estabUshed. I had a discussion with the Prime Minister that very afternoon. He agreed with me-and I in this context. I indicated emphasise he totally and willingly did so without any hesitation-that this matter was of significant if l rec- nauonal importance and that the establishment of a committee along the Unes referred to in the motion I have moved today would be an appropriate immediate course of action. I express now my appreciation of the Prime Minister's coproblem. The need for action is operation. As a result of that meeting I wrote to the Prime Minister a letter which I was given leave earher in my speech to incorporate in Hansard. I understand that fbr reasons of duty the Prime Minister is unable to speak in this debate and his place will be taken by the honourable member for Casey (Mr Mathews). I ask the honourable member to direct the Prime Minister's attention to what I have had to say today and also to express to him my appreciation for his co-operation.",47
133,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPECIFIC LEARNING DIFFICULTIES,Is the motion seconded? Mr Street- I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,48
134,Mr MATHEWS,SPECIFIC LEARNING DIFFICULTIES,"Honourable members on this side of the House support this motion with considerable enthusiasm. Our enthusiasm is in no way reduced by a mild sense of incredulity about the source from which it comes. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) in opening his remarks today said that he had been concerned about this problem for very many years. Honourable members on this side of the House have also been concerned about this problem for very many years. Where the difference lies is in the fact that throughout those very many years honourable members on this side of the House hammered away at the Government which was then in office and at the Leader of the Opposition as one of its more prominent members to get something done about the problem, to get some action. We were aware of the nature of this problem, of the distress it inflicts on many families and the very many careers which were being blighted by it at a time when we could get neither interest nor sympathy from honourable members opposite and indeed could not get them to acknowledge that the problem existed at all. The Leader of the Opposition said that for 6 or 7 years there had been pubhc awareness of pubhc concern over this problem. I guess he was dating that period back to the establishment of the Spedfic Learning Difficulties Association, known as the SPELD organisation, to which I pay tribute as a magnificently successful body of spokespeople for a significantly disadvantaged group in our community. But, of course, awareness of and concern for the problem in educational circles went back much further. As early as 1963 the International Reading Association came up with the disclosure that whereas 82 per cent of children with specific learning difficulties who had received assistance in the form of remedial assistance by the end of their second school year were able to overcome their difficulties, only 8 per cent of those who had to wait till their sixth school year were able to overcome those difficulties. Of course over the 10 or 11 years which have elapsed since those survey results were pubUshed the overwhelming majority of chUdren in this sort of need have been obliged to wait until grade 6, and in many instances even longer to receive help. This is very well reflected in the figures that were quoted by the Leader of the Opposition. Surely these arefigureswhich should create a sense of alarm in any modern nation. Surely we should be alarmed that a survey conducted in the affluent eastern suburbs of Melbourne could come up with the revelation that 45 per cent of chUdren in forms 1 and 2 of government secondary schools needed remedial teaching if they were to gain any benefit whatsoever from their secondary education and that 25 per cent-on e in every four-of those chUdren were functionally UUterate. There has been a remarkable complacency about thesefigures,figures which the Leader of the Opposition himself quoted. Does the Leader of the Opposition regard this as a new development? This is a development which has been taking place in the education systems of this country over a great many years. It reflects the total neglect on the part of our national Government, and our State governments of all the special services which are involved in this problem. I have in mind particularly the ludicrously staffed psychology and guidance branches associated with State departments of education; the pitifully understaffed speech therapy branches of State departments of education-there are 32 speech therapists in the Victorian speech therapy branch although the committee of inquiry into special education recommended that there should have been 108-the pitiful lack of remedial teachers on the ground in classrooms; and the almost complete absence of higher medical specialties associated with this problem such as psychiatry.",48
135,Mr GILES,SPECIFIC LEARNING DIFFICULTIES,And the need for public awareness.,48
136,Mr MATHEWS,SPECIFIC LEARNING DIFFICULTIES,"And, as the honourable member for Angas very properly says, the need for public awareness. Honourable members on this side of the House support the motion not least because of the job of public education which has been carried to a certain point by the SPELD organisation but which now must be taken over by the National Parliament and rivetted onto the consciousness of the people of this country. That is the only way in which effective action will be brought into existence. The House should not suppose that the Government has been unconscious of this problem in the 2 years that it has had to make good the enormous deficiencies of our education system which have accumulated over so many years. The Interim Committee for the Austrahan Schools Commission, known as the Karmel Committee, freely acknowledged that it could not do full justice to all the ramifications of the problem of special education in the 5 months it had available for the preparation of its report and recommendations for 1974-75. But it did make a start. All honourable members will be familiar with the proposals that it put forward in its report and the fact that the Government has accepted those proposals. I mention only a few of them. The Committee recommended that $1.13m should be made specific available for the conduct of full time in-service teacher education courses mounted cation departments in the education of handicapped children; $8.25m for the replacement of teachers in government schools engaged in ing courses for teachers of the handicapped; $ 10.25m for recurrent expenditure in special schools and classes additional to that provided to the States in general recurrent expenditure for schools; $3.91m to enable State education departments to assume responsibility for the recurrent operations of those non-government schools Year of Grant Project Title 1975 'A program to develop the cognitive skills of visually handicapped children' 1971-75 'The part played by visuo-motor skills and movement in the development of readiness for formal education' 1973-74 'Identification and measurement of components of reading comprehension.'

While the parameters of that program are much wider than the specific learning difficulty children alone, they include that 10 to 15 per cent of our school population which falls into the specific learning difficulties category. On the side of research, to which the Leader of the Opposition referred in his motion, I could read out to the House-perhap s if I sought leave to have it incorporated in Hansard this would suit the convenience of the House better- a Ust of research projects specifically involving the interests of learning difficulty chUdren with which the Acting Minister for Education (Mr Barnard) by the eduhas provided me.",48

140,Mr MATHEWS,SPECIFIC LEARNING DIFFICULTIES,"As the Interim Committee for the Australian Schools Commission recognised the limitations of its original inquiry as far as they impinged on special education, so the permanent Schools Commission now established by statute has had this matter very much in the forefront of its attention. The Commission is reviewing the whole area of special education with a view to making recommendations in this area in its 1975 report. Basically that review will encompass the following areas: Bibliography of the field of special education; a survey of administrative and legal patterns, a survey of the provision which is made for all forms of special education including education of specific learning difficulty children; practices adopted for integration from special schools into normal ones both in this country and overseas; services needed for the introduction of integrated practices; impUcations for teacher attitudes in education, impUcations for employment opportunities and the problems of UUteracy. The Commission will be obtaining information regarding the survey of administrative and legal patterns and the survey of provisions and the impUcations for teacher attitudes in education. It wiU be drawing those threads together in a very comprehensive set of recommendations which the Government will consider in the context of the 1975 report. This is a subject to which the House could dress itself at very great length and one to I would Uke to address myself at great length, but in fact I have a Utde more than 3 minutes remaining to me. I was concerned by the remark made by the Leader of the Opposition in his speech- I think in fact he was quoting an authority-whe n he described children with specific learning difficulties as the last large group of handicapped chUdren and adults whom special provision has not been made. I think that is a very gross and grave overOpposition)-M simplification of the situation, because if the right honourable gentleman will address mind to the broader educational scene he will see a great number of groups which are no less disadvantaged than those who have specific misrepresented.

He will remember the migrant children from countries where a language other than English is spoken and who stUl overwhelmingly are deprived of the instruction in English as a second language or the opportunity to receive their education in the languages of the countries of their origin. He will be aware too of the chUdren from the low income groups in the community who are the victims of educational deprivation on a massive scale.",50

142,Mr MATHEWS,SPECIFIC LEARNING DIFFICULTIES,"The honourable member for Barton reminds me too of the chUdren of the Aborigines of Australia. The specific learning difficulty children have been fortunate in having so splendid and articulate an organisation as SPELD working in their interests. It is easy for groups Uke SPELD to get the attention of members of this Parliament. It would be a sad reflection on this Parliament if such well organised groups were to gain a monopoly of our attention. I hope that in ventilating and explorading and articulating this matter and in educating which the community upon the needs of chUdren with specific learning difficulties we will recognise our obligation to do no less for our Aboriginal children, for our low income children, for our migrant children and for children with mental and physical handicaps in their severest forms.",50

146,Mr SNEDDEN,SPECIFIC LEARNING DIFFICULTIES,"Yes. The honourable member for Casey (Mr Mathews) misrepresented me. I think he did it unwittingly, but I would like to make the point clear. I am very conscious of the problems of migrant children, Aboriginal children, children from poor families, etc. What needs to be understood is that all those children who have problems because of the disadvantage which the honourable member identified can nevertheless have a double disadvantage by having a specific learning difficulty. If a migrant child from Yugoslavia, Italy, Greece or wherever it might be, is trying to comprehend lessons in English has added to his problems a specific learning difficulty the additional disadvantage is immense. It was an unwitting misrepresentation but I want to make it clear that I am totally conscious of the point that the honourable member made, but the incidence of specific training difficulties transcend them all. Mr Mathews-Which problem does the the Leader of the Opposition see as more significant to the migrant child-lac k of English or his specific learning disability?",51
147,Mr SNEDDEN,SPECIFIC LEARNING DIFFICULTIES,Lack of EngUsh.,51
148,Mr STREET,SPECIFIC LEARNING DIFFICULTIES," I am deUghted to second the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden). I personaUy have had quite a long association with the Specific Learning Difficulties Association. A branch was formed some years ago in my electorate. I attended several of its early meetings and I have been kept informed of developments since then. The formation of this branch has been a good example of what can be done by a dedicated group of citizens who identify a problem in their community and then set about correcting it. I am deUghted to say that this group has had considerable success in its efforts, ing the appointment of a teacher with special quaUfications to a school in their area. I would like to refer to the Karmel report in relation to this problem. The Opposition has previously indicated its support for the principle recommendations of the Karmel Committee and the funds that it provided for education. But how much of the Karmel Committee funds went towards correcting the problems of children with special learning difficulties? My recollection is that the Karmel report contained one paragraph only on this problem. My recollection is that there was no mention of capital funds, merely some recurrent grants. I would have thought that the honourable member for Casey (Mr Mathews), with his interest in this subject, would have ensured that adequate provision had been made through the Karmel Committee funds for the purposes we are discussing this morning. I must admit that I have been surprised and somewhat disappointed with the tone of some of the honourable member's remarks in the course of this debate. As long ago as 1972 the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the then Minister for Education and Science, appointed a committee part of whose terms of reference contained the specific requirement to report on teacher training for remedial work in this field. My memory is that this Committee had to report early in 1973. So the Opposition's interest in this field goes back some years. The aspect of the committee of the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Malcolm Fraser) dealing with remedial teacher training is of course extremely important, because it is a vital requirement. The committee established by the honourable member points up vital requirement to identify early those children with special learning difficulties and the need to train teachers who can adequately deal with the problem. Mr Deputy Speaker, I understand that the business of the House requires that I curtail my remarks. I do so in deference to agreements which have been reached, not because of lack of interest in this most important subject.",51
149,Dr EVERINGHAM,SPECIFIC LEARNING DIFFICULTIES,"The question of special education facUities fbr exceptional chUdren, whether they be handicapped or specially gifted children, exercised the mind of the Australian Labor Party for some years before it came into office. The Government Members Education Committee commissioned me to prepare a discussion paper for it, which I did on 9 May 1972, includ- at a time when the Labor Party was in opposition. I pointed out then the need for at least double the output of teachers for slow learners, who comprise about 3 children in every 100-quite a small group when compared with the group we are discussing today. I also pointed out the need for generalists in special education, the need for speciaUsts in education for the various categories of handicapped learners and gifted children, including slow learners, disturbed, maladjusted and autistic children, physicaUy handicapped children in various categories, gifted children and specific learning defect sufferers and the culturally deprived, including migrants and Aboriginals. The committee of the parliamentary Labor Party in September 1972-agai n before the Labor Party was in government-mad e certain proposals on schools commissions, for which we had agitated for some years, to provide equality of opportunity, to investigate inequalities, to recommend programs, to advise the Government, to be the organ of intelligence and insight, to sponsor and conduct research into all aspects of educadon, and indeed into all aspects of child care and welfare, including the economic, mental and moral well being of children, to sponsor experimental schools and programs, to educate teachers, assist student teachers, foster in-service and continuing education, to consult pre-school authorities, town planners, pediatricians, child psychiatrists, to provide for child minding and pre-school centres and so on. I have no time to go into all the moves the Labor Party has made. It is well known that the Department of Education has made a $lm grant for handicapped children's training and other grants for teaching in this area. There are many fields of activity that the Government has sponsored.

He plans to spend 18 months with the Department of Speech studying for a Master of Arts elor of Arts degree withfirst-classhonours in psychology from the Un-versity of Sydney. The Minister for Health, Dr D. N. Everingham, said Mr Dermody's study would be directly connected with the work of a new scientific group being established at the National Acoustic Laboratories, which will develop more detailed auditory testing procedures to detect children who have a learning difficulty. The particular children in whom Mr Dermody is interested generally have normal hearing sensitivity, but are unable to correctly recognise, distinguish or process sound in the usual way. Testing procedures will be aimed at early detection and diagnosis of these problems so that remedial treatment can be offered sooner, and to a greater number of children, than is possible at present. It is also anticipated that at least some of the testing cedures, when applied to deaf children seeking assistance under the Australian Government's hearing aid scheme, will provide additional information for hearing aid selection and use.

156,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"As recorded at page 1456 of Hansard of 18 September I made a statement during a debate on the suspension of Standing Orders in relation to a matter of public importance concerning a royal commission that had been appointed. To make my point, it will be necessary for me to read one paragraph of that statement so that the House may understand the point I need to make. I said, inter alia: The Waterside Workers Federation of Australia is not included. The statement made by the Prime Minister mentioned the maritime unions alone; it did not mention the Waterside Workers Federation. One of the Press reports states that the Minister for Transport had given a guarantee pro- that the Waterside Workers Federation and Mr Fitzgibbon would not suffer any action against them as a result of indemnity payments made to Mr Fitzgibbon or the Waterside Workers Federation. Therefore it is utterly critical there be specific mention of the Waterside Workers Federation in the terms of reference of the royal commission. Failing that, the only thing that could meet this case, which the suspension of Standing Orders would give an opportunity to the Government to provide, would be a clear statement by the Government that the Government agrees with your ruling that the Waterside Workers Federation is involved, that the indemnity payments-almos t $400,000 is mendoned in the newspapers in connection with the Waterside Workers Federation-wil l also be the subject of this inquiry.

Fraser, M.H.R., Parliament House, CANBERRA A.C.T. 2600 Dear Sir, I am in receipt of your letter of 24 September 1974 in which you seek amplification of the 3rd par. of my letter of 20 September 1974 'in the light of certain newspaper reports, namely the Sydney Morning Herald of 11 September 1974 and the Financial Review of 10 September 1974.' I would not think that you, as a practising politician, would take a newspaper repon which was not a direct substantiated quote as being a valid anything. For example, no statement was given to The Sydney Morning Herald. The article was the result of a syndicated anicle from another newspaper and incidentally appeared in somewhat different form to the original. Neither article expressed accurately what was said. I suggest anyway that reponers do not always get down exactly over the phone everything said and neither do they get their articles through sub-editors without distortions occurring. I therefore would not attempt to provide clarification 'in the light of certain newspaper repons.' However, if you are not clear as to the meaning of the 3rd par. of my letter I do not mind clarifying that. The word 'indemnity' can apply to a whole range of legitimate activities and commercial and industrial agreements. (See Definition Shorter Oxford Dictionary) Therefore in saying 'This Union has not sought nor has received indemnity payments on its behalf or on behalf of any other organisauon' we do so in the following context. A. We are saying it clearly in the context that we have not asked for nor received a payment in lieu of an Agreement or the conditions we were seeking. B. We would declare our right to conclude legitimate industrial agreements which compensate workers for the disabilities arising from their particular type of employment. In respect of monies commented on by the Financial Review and the Sydney Morning Herald articles, you should be aware that the accurate position isA.

162,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MALCOLM FRASER,Mr Luchetti)Order! I ask the honourable member for Wannon to confine his remarks to where he has been misrepresented and not to become involved in anything argumentative.,54
163,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,MALCOLM FRASER,"It is not a matter of where I have been misrepresented, Mr Deputy Speaker; it is a matter of where I believe that I have, on all the information available to me, misrepresented the position of the Waterside Workers Federation. Since that was done in this House, I believe that the matter ought to be clarified in this House. I beheve it to be an important matter, and the Federation and the General Secretary of the Federadon also believe it to be an important matter. The point is that under the flags of convenience campaign conducted by the International Transport Federation, of which the WWF is the agent in Australia, flowing back to ILO Convention No. 109, funds are collected in accordance with agreements, as I have been advised, signed with the respective ship owners who are involved in sailing ships under flags of convenience. That is an acuon that is quite different in character from the charge that has been alleged against the Seamen's Union. does not arise in the ITF I would also like to say that one part of a Press report which had been quoted also misrepresented, and I picked up this misrepresentation, the Minister for Transport himself because the Press report, and consequently myself in the Parliament, gave the impression that the Minister to ensure that seafarers for Transport had given some immunity to the Waterside Workers Federation over an indemnity payments issue. Mr Fitzgibbon has made it perfectly plain that that conversation related to the national flag of a high-cost the WWF's flags of convenience campaign, which againflowsback to the ITF's position and the ILO Convention No. 109, which Australia has ratified. But, as I have been advised, they are of Union dues to the Interpayments collected by agreement and they do go to the ships' crews involved, fully receipted and fully documented. A good deal of that documentation, if not all of it, appears in a recent publication of the 'Maritime Worker'. So I believe that the issues are separate and separable and that on all the evidence available to me the Waterside Workers Federation position is quite different and separate from the involvement of the Seamen's Union in the Royal Commission which is presently sitting. I regret that I picked up the misrepresentation concerning the WWF and repeated it in this Parliament.",54
164,Mrs CHILD,MALCOLM FRASER," Mr Deputy Speaker, I would Uke to make a personal explanation to the House concerning an article which appears on page 17 of today's Melbourne 'Age'.",55

AGED OR DISABLED PERSONS HMS manently Bill presented by Mr Hayden, and read a first time.",55
167,Mr HAYDEN,MALCOLM FRASER," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Bill is to give effect to a number of measures the Government has decided to take to increase the assistance provided for aged persons homes; also to extend the prolation visions of the Aged Persons Homes Act to handiother capped adults. Under the Aged Persons Homes Act, as honourable members will be aware, the Australian Government makes grants to nonsheltered profit organisations and local governing bodies towards the cost of providing homes for aged persons. When the Act was originally introduced in 1954 the subsidy was on a $1 for $1 basis. 1957 the rate of subsidy was increased to $2 for $ 1 and has remained at that level ever since. As announced by the Treasurer (Mr Crean) his Budget Speech, the Government has decided that a further increase in the rate of now appropriate. The first of the measures in this Bill, therefore, is to double the present rate of subsidy, from the present $2 for $1 to $4 for At the time the Budget was being prepared Treasurer indicated that the increased rate of subsidy would not take effect until 1 January 1975. Because it is being found that the advance announcement of this increase in the rate of subsidy is resulting in organisations delaying the commencement of building projects, it has been decided that the increase should now take effect from the date of royal assent to this Bill, instead of 1 January as announced earlier. The cost of the increased rate of subsidy will be $2.5m in 1974-75 or $5m in a full year. The second measure contained in this Bill, as I previously mentioned, is to extend the provisions of the Aged Persons Homes Act to handicapped adults. Experience has shown that the definition of 'aged person' in the principal Act-namely , men aged 65 and over and women aged 60 and over-is somewhat arbitrary and that people in younger age groups often suffer from handicaps or disabUities which result in their also needing accommodation of the type provided under the Aged Persons Homes Act. Amendments contained in this Bill will enable such accommodation to be provided for handicapped adults in 2 ways: Firstly, by subsidising the buUding of homes specifically for people who are permanently incapacitated for work or perblind and, secondly, by permitting BILL 1974 such people to be accommodated in aged persons homes. As a result of this widening of the scope of the legislation the title of the principal Act is being amended from the Aged Persons Second Reading Homes Act to the Aged or Disabled Persons Act. The cost of this measure is expected to be $500,000 in 1974-75 or $ 1 m in thefirstfull year. For the information of honourable members. I would like to mention at this point that this legiswUl in no way supersede the operation of legislation under which the Australian Government assists the provision of residential accommodation fbr disabled persons engaged in employment or fbr handicapped chUdren receiving training. I refer, of course, to the Sheltered Employment (Assistance) Act and the Handicapped Children (Assistance) Act respecIn tively. The rates of the subsidies payable under those 2 Acts are, in fact, also to be increased from $2 for $1 to $4 for $1. The Bill now before the House will, in effect, help to provide accommoin dation for those disabled people for whom accommodation cannot be provided under the 2 the subsidy is other Acts I have mentioned. In his Budget Speech the Treasurer also $1. announced that the personal care subsidy paythe able under Pan III of the Aged Persons Homes Act to organisations providing personal care services for the aged in approved hostel accommodation would be increased from $12 to $15 a week. That is the third measure contained in this Bill. Hostels play an important role by providing accommodation for elderly people who, whilst no longer able to look after themselves in independent units, do not need the more expensive, medically-oriented care provided by a nursing home. The purpose of the personal care subsidy is to help bridge the gap between the cost per head of mamtaining such hostels and the amount that pensioner-residents can afford to pay for such accommodauon. When the personal care subsidy was originally introduced in 1969 it was paid on the basis of $5 a week for each resident aged 80 and over. In the 1972 Budget the rate was increased to $10 a week and it was further increased to $12 a week in the 1973 Budget, when eligibility was also extended to cover hostelresidentswho had not attained the age of 80 years but who required, and were receiving, the prescribed 'personal care services'.",55
168,Unknown,MALCOLM FRASER,"Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m. 'Personal care services' are denned as: The provision of meals, assistance with bathing dressing, the cleaning of rooms, personal laundry and general oversight of medication. The hostels are also required to have a staff-member avail-, able at alltimesin case of emergency. During past year the cost of conducting these hostels continued to rise. According to information received from the Voluntary Geriatric Association of New South Wales the wages of staff employed in hostels went up by 26 per cent in the first six months of 1974. Information from other States indicates that similar increases have occurthe red. Food costs also rose by about 18 per cent. order to maintain the effective level of the perrelieve sonal care subsidy this Bill provides for the of the subsidy to be increased by 25 per cent from $12 to $15 a week with effect from the first subsidy pay day after the date of royal assent. Needless to say, the Bill provides for personal care subsidy to be paid in respect sons, for whom accommodation will in future be provided, on the same terms and conditions as aged persons. The cost of this measure will $800,000 in 1974-75, or $ 1.4m in a full year. The fourth measure contained in this Bill relates to the basis upon which grants may be made under the principal Act to local governing bodies. The Act at present provides that moneys which have become available as the result of borrowing of those moneys or any other moneys by an organisation, or were received by the organisation from the government of the Commonwealth or of a State or from a government authority, cannot attract subsidy. Since local governing bodies became eUgible organisations in 1967 such bodies have constructed accommodation for only 602 aged persons, compared with approximately 25,000 accommodated by reUgious, charitable and other eligible organisations during the same period, despite the fact that local governing bodies would appear to be well-situated to enter the aged persons homes field. There is reason to believe that many more local governing bodies would be interested in providing homes for their aged residents if they could use loan funds to attract the Australian Government subsidy. On several occasions since 1967, the annual conference of the Australian Council of Local Government Associations has carried resolutions pointing out that councils normally use loan funds for capital works, that adverse ratepayer reaction could be expected if revenue was used of this purpose and calling on the Government to amend the Aged Persons Homes Act accordingly. Legislation was passed by the Parliament in last year's Budget session, enabling local government borrowing to attract and subsidy under the Sheltered Employment (Assistance) Act and the Handicapped ChUdren (Assistance) Act, which are 'companion' Acts to the Aged Persons Homes Act. The cost of this the measure should not exceed $500,000 in 1974-75, has rising to about $ 1 m in 1975-76. Finally, Mr Speaker, advantage is being taken of the opportunity provided by this Bill to insert a machinery clause in the principal Act to permit Director-General of Social Security to delIn egate his power to approve grants. This will the Director-General of some of the great rate volume of routine work that has developed since the Aa was first introduced in 1954. At present the Director-General has no such power of delegation and as a consequence every grant-and every amendment to a grant-ha s to be approved of disabled perpersonally by him. Before resuming my seat, Mr Speaker, I would be like, with your indulgence, to make an announcement concerning the maximum subsidy limits payable under the Aged Persons Homes Act, or the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act as it will in future be known, and the Aged Persons Hostels Act. As I have previously informed the House, a working party of officers of the Dethe partments of Social Security and the Treasury has been looking into ways of overcoming the financial difficulties being experienced by organisations constructing homes for the aged, because ofrisingbuilding costs. I am pleased to be able to announce that the working party has now submitted its recommendations, which have been approved by the Government. It has been decided: (i) that the maximum subsidy Umits payable under the Aged Persons Homes Act will be increased from $6,000 to $7,800 for a single unit and from $7,000 to $9,100 for a double unit, effective from 1 October 1974; (U) that the capital grants payable under the Aged Persons Hostels Act will be increased from $9,000 to $11,700 for each aged person accommodated, also with effect from 1 October 1974; (in) that the present maximum subsidy limits, which took effect from 1 AprU 1974, shall apply to projects which were in the course of construction at that date; (vi) that cost increases due to the 'rise and fall' clause in building contracts, in respect of work carried out since 1 April 1974, will be subsidised; and (v) that the introduction of 'zone loadings' for country areas where buUding costs are abnormally high, should be given further study. These increases can be implemented by administrative action under the Aged Persons Homes Act and do not require amending legislation. The amendment to the Aged Persons Hostels Act at present before the Parliament will enable the recommendations made in respect of that Act to be implemented administratively also. I would Uke to make it clear, Mr Speaker, that in so far as the Aged Persons Homes Act is concerned the increased maximum subsidy Umits that I have just announced are payable under the existing Act and will be further increased when the $4-for-$l subsidy takes effect. As from the date of royal assent of this Bill the maximum subsidy limits payable under the new Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act will automatically become $9,360 for a single unit and $10,920 for a double unit. These increases, together with the extension of the Act to handicapped adults, the extension of subsidy to local government borrowings and the 25 per cent increase in the rate of personal care subsidy, represent a major improvement in the assistance being provided by this Government for aged persons homes. These measures, however, are only an interim step pending receipt of the report of a Committee of Inquiry into Aged Persons Housing, which was set up by the Social Welfare Commission about twelve months ago at my direction. This Committee's deliberations have been prolonged because of the enormous volume of evidence they have received, but I expect to have their report within the next few weeks and to table it before the House rises for Christmas. In the meantime, the measures I am now introducing are necessary and desirable to sustain the programme we inherited from the previous Government. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Adermann) adjourned. APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 1974-75 In Committee Consideration resumed from 30 October. Second Schedule. Postmaster-General's Department Proposed expenditure, $ 18,895,000",56
169,Mr NIXON,MALCOLM FRASER,"A whole range of matters should be discussed in our consideration of the estimates for the Postmaster General's Department but as each speaker has only 10 minutes it is impossible to deal with many matters in depth. Doubtless Opposition speakers will try to debate problems associated with the postal service and telecommunications generally and express their views. One of the troubles of the Post Office is that there has been a steady falling off in services. No longer does there seem to be the will to get the mail through. Some postal workers seem more interested in seeing what they can get through their pay packets than in giving service to the people. This is a pity and I am sure the Australian pubUc would agree that the old code of getting the maU through at all costs was a much appreciated approach taken by postal workers. Many Post Office workers are as anxious as ever to give the sort of service for which the Post Office has been known over the years but many seem to be in the hands of radicals who want to use their power to cause industrial trouble and general difficulty for the Australian community. As a result of the deterioration in service a number of firms have estabUshed private courier services for their mail. They find it cheaper to fill a bag with mail at the head office in Melbourne and send it to Sydney with a man who distributes it than to use the resources of the Post Office. They have found the private courier service less costly, more reliable and quicker. The cost of the Post Office to the Australian taxpayer is enormous. I was staggered to see in an edition of a postal newspaper a statement by the Postmaster-General (Senator Bishop) claiming that the Post Office should make a profit so that there could be an extension of the services provided to the pubhc. I ask the Committee to consider that proposal. What a paradoxical situation we have. This socialist Government attacks the profit-making private sector and claims that it does not need to make profits to plough back into business yet the Postmaster-General seeks a profit to feed back into the Post Office. A moment ago the honourable member for Clare (Mr England) reminded me that the Government decided to abolish the $25 radio and television licence fee, the Treasurer (Mr Crean) asserting that radio and television provided a service to people. I do not challenge that television is a service to the people but I suggest that a far more necessary service to all sections of the community-the old, the young, the sick and business interests-is the provision of Post Office and telecommunication services. But the charges for these services are being increased to an exorbitant level, particularly those applying in the postal service. In an earher mini-Budget the Government proposed increasing the normal letter rate from 7c to 9c but this proposal was rejected because the Opposition regarded the mini-Budget as inflationary and not attacking the problem of inflation. A few weeks later in this Budget the Government proposed that the rate should be increased to 10c. Mr Donald Cameron-That is scandalous.",57
170,Mr NIXON,MALCOLM FRASER,"That is the best word to use to describe it. I plead with the Special Minister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen) who is representing the Postmaster-General in this chamber to consider a request that I have received from a number of constituents or to refer it to the Postmaster General for his considerations. The Christmas period is fast approaching and the request is that the postage rate for sending Christmas cards should be the former charge of 7c. I ask the Postmaster-General to consider using the many millions of 7c stamps that are going to waste the mailing of Christmas cards. This may be regarded as subsidising the posting of Christmas cards but at present the nation is going through period of economic stress, unemployment and unhappiness and it would be a massive psychowho logical gesture, to say the least, if the Postmastertalkies General agreed to allow Christmas cards to be posted at the old charge of 7c. This would make a vast difference to a number of people who tially. would then be able to afford to send Christmas cards to friends and relatives and it would bring a great deal of cheer from one side of Australia to the other. I doubt whether there is one section of the community that does not send out Christmas cards. If the Government is genuine in its claim to have a humane approach to the problems of the Australian people it should give them a psychological lift by encouraging the exchange of Christmas cards. I suggest that if the request were granted the Post Office might gain because more people would be encouraged to send Christmas cards than would be prepared to send them for the present 10c charge. Many old friends say to me: 'Do not send me a Christmas card and I will not send you one'. That will be the general approach of many people with respect to Christmas cards this year. Mr Keogh-That is because of your Scots blood. MrNIXON-Itisnot. Mr Keogh-Do not send me one.",58
171,Mr NIXON,MALCOLM FRASER,"There is no risk of the honourable member getting a card from me, even if it cost only 7c to send it. The generosity of my heart does not reach out that far. Mr Stewart-What about the spirit of Christmas? It is the season of goodwill.",58
172,Mr NIXON,MALCOLM FRASER,"The Minister for Tourism and Recreation tends to spread goodwill in his area of responsibility. I wish he could get some of that goodwill into the usurious Postmaster-General's Department. That Department is a profit-making and usurious organisation with no heart. The only counter to my claim that it has no heart is for the Postmater-General to consider my reasonable proposal which would not cost much to implement. Let us see whether the Postmaster General, the Special Minister of State, the Government and the Post Office have any heart. Let them stop raking in the sheckels all the time and make some allowance for the postage of Christmas cards. In the short time remaining to me I refer to the question of the use of walkie-talkie radios, as for they are known, by amateurs. The licence fee for these radios has been doubled-fro m $6 to $12. Many people use these instruments in other than a a commercial sense. They are used, for instance, by organisers of country shows and by people go fishing at sea. The latter leave walkieat home for safety reasons so that when at sea they can communicate with people on shore. I think it was wrong to impose a licence fee iniI refer also to the need of the citizen's radio movement for there to be in Australia an established band for walkie-talkies and radio operators the same as exists in Canada, Italy, Japan, New Zealand and, I think, the United States of America. The Postmaster-General's Department seems a bit hidebound in not being prepared to allow a section of the total radio band in Australia to be used by citizens across the nation.",58
173,The CHAIRMAN,MALCOLM FRASER,Order! The honourable member's ume has expired.,59
174,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,MALCOLM FRASER,"It is a shame that the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Nixon), who preceded me in this debate, wasted so much of the time available to him-h e was limited to only 10 minutes-talkin g such a lot of hot air and rubbish. It was only in the last minute or two of his speech that he got down to talking about something sensible. He started his speech by having a sideswipe at the unions. That is par for the course for the honourable member for Gippsland. Then he had to have a bit of a square-off, of course; so he said: 'They are not all that bad; it is only the leaders who are crook'. Mr Keogh-The wharfies' friend.",59
175,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,MALCOLM FRASER,"Yes. Then he got into this silly litde argument about Christmas cards. It seems that the honourable member is pretty obsessed by this and believes that communication between people occurs only in that hallowed week of the year known as Christmas. I can tell him- I am sure many people listening would agree with me-that people close to me are very relieved to have a reason for not sending Christmas cards this year. It seems that it is a practice that has grown up. Cards are not necessarily sent to people who are far away; frequently they are sent to people who Uve across the street. One person who comes into my street every morning from Monday to Friday- I have spoken to him about the matter-think s it would be a jolly good idea if people did not send Christmas cards. He is the person who has to deUver them. He staggers up the street with a great bag of maU for about 2 weeks prior to Christmas. He works long hours and is not very happy about it. He does not see his famUy very much. He knows, as well as I do, that the carriage of many of the cles he is carrying is pretty unnecessary and that they are commumcations between 2 people who see one another regularly. This sUly practice of buying cards, putting them in envelopes, buying heaps of stamps and sticking them on the envelopes and so making extra work for the postal service is starting to become a bit of a chore to many people and they are not very happy about it. I do not think it is altogether true to claim that the community will be upset about having to pay extra to send Christmas cards. What is true is that probably fewer cards will be sent and I do not think anybody, apart from the card manufacturers, will grumble about it. The honourable member's speech was pretty remarkable in many ways. The thing that rather amused me- I could not help but smile as he was speaking-wa s that for the 3 years that I sat in this chamber as a member of the Opposition I heard pretty similar speeches from different members of my own Party who were then sitting in Opposition, and the speeches that members of my Party now make are simUar to those that were made by honourable members opposite when they were in government. This matter has been going on year after year. It is inevitable that in an area which is as labour intensive as the Post Office is- I am speaking about mail deliveriescharges wiU rise as charges in the community generally arerising.Recently I was in Japan and whUe I was there the mail charges rose by 50 per cent. Ours have not risen by quite 50 per cent. The Japanese people do not have the same problems of delivery as we have in Australia. Japan is a much smaUer country and is populated by many more people. Yet Japan found it necessary to raise its postal rates by 50 per cent. We, with all our long distances and sparse population in remote parts, find it necessary to raise mail charges. I believe that to be true around the world. Even with telecommunications charges rising, the Postmaster-General's Department is having difficulty in keeping up with the demand for the instaUation of telephonic equipment. It seems to me that there is some sort of a paradox when members such as the honourable member for Gippsland say that we are pricing everybody out of the market by putting telephone charges up so high that people cannot afford them. If his statement were true, obviously fewer people would apply to have the service installed and the ones who did would find that they could not afford it and would have it removed. But all the evidence points the opposite way. The evidence points to the fact that people are retaining their equipment arti- and are seeking the installation of new equipment at a rate much faster than that with which the Postmaster-General's Department can cope. I know, from being a member of the Public Works Committee, that there are many references from the Postmaster-General's Department concerning the building of new telephone exchanges. Obviously the growth of telecommunications in Australia is not being impaired by the reasonable charges that are levied against the users of the system. On the question of telecommunications, it is pretty clear that the Post Office will be divided into 2 separate functions as a result of a report by what is known as the Vernon Committee. One of the areas concerned is telecommunications. For a number of years Australia has had an organisation known as the OTC-the Overseas Telecommunicauons Commission (Australia). It has performed quite a worthwhUe function as a separate entity. I put it to the Committee that were that to continue all we would have would be a continued fragmentation of simUar functions. The proposal is that that service come under an Australian Telecommunications Authority. Where organisations perform Uke functions, such as the OTC and the telecommunications side of the PMG, I think it is pretty essential that there be a sensible restructuring of the whole area. This is something that has not been considered by previous governments for a longtime;to the best of my knowledge it has not even been investigated. On Tuesday of the week after next the Caucus committee of which I am the secretary wiU be meeting with representatives of the unions which have members in the OTC and the telecommunications side of the PMG. The whole purpose of that exercise is to pave the way and to smooth out things, as the Labor Party always does when it deals with industrial matters, for the meshing in of the 2 functions. I have received a document through the maU. I do not know the people who signed it. I do not know who the people are. They claim to be the chairman and vice-chairman of an organisation. It comes from Sydney and it is trying to buUd a case as to why the OTC should not be included in the ATA. Having read through that document, having spoken about it with other people and now having spoken about it with representatives of the trade unions that are mvolved in this field, I find that it has many fallacies in it and that it seeks to put forward a point of view that is not altogether acceptable to people who take a responsible view on the matter. I mention that only in passing because it is part of the Post Office function. Let me get back to the matter about which are speaking, namely, the appropriation of quite a large sum of money to keep the Post Office going. It is true that the Post Office, if one cares use this archaic free enterprise expression, does not show a profit. How can it when it provides service? I thought the honourable member for Gippsland was trying to get round to this and say that it was necessary for the community to chip in in order to provide this service and that rates. the cost ofit should not necessarily be charged to the users of the service and those who get a benefit from it. He then said that the couriersprivate enterprise of course-were able to do the job more cheaply, more efficiently and more reliably than the Post Office. He spoke about a paradox. If ever I heard a pardoxial contribution in this chamber, I am afraid it was the 10-minute contribution by the honourable member. He spent the whole 10 niinutes contradicting himself. The courier system grew up because of the attitude of the previous Government that these matters, even such important matters as communications, could be safely left in the hands of private enterprise. The point that the honourable member missed altogether is that if there is any excess of income over expenditure by the Post Office it does not go into the pocket of some greedy little capitalist, but in fact goes back into the coffers of the Australian community; it becomes part of the Australian public purse. That is where it belongs. If there is this ephemeral thing called profit from a Post Office exercise, to my mind it is far preferable that it finish up in the government coffers than that it go into the pocket of somebody who sets out to perform a service which the Australian Government can perform just as well. For those reasons I support the proposed expenditure. It is being spent very worthily in a good area, and it is being put to good use.",59
176,Mr KING,MALCOLM FRASER,"I also wish to make a short contribution on Division 400 in the estimates for the Postmaster-General's Department. It is almost with monotonous regularity that when we are dealing with PMG estimates we are discussing further increases in charges, lack of development and reducing service. Certainly the 1974 estimates are no exception. Postal, telephone, and other miscellaneous charges are increased. Yet the service, of course, certainly will not be improved. Postal and telephone charges are 2 basic concerns of many people outside this place and also inside this place. The Committee may be interested in a small example of the increases. Last Friday I gave my secretary $ 10 to buy some stamps. Naturally I thought that we would be enough for a little while. But before I left my office last Monday she again requested some more money. I said: 'What for?' She said: to 'For stamps.' I said: ' I gave you $10 on Friday.' She said: 'That will all be gone by the end of the a week.' When we checked through my postings on Monday they accounted for just on $ 10 worth to of stamps. That gives an indication of just how difficult for people is the increase in the various However, I must admit that the Government did make one reduction with the abolition of radio and television hcence fees. On the surface this looked most attractive to many people, but it appears somewhat ludicrous when one considers that the Treasurer (Mr Crean) said in the Budget Speech that the fees were abolished because the provision of radio and television is a service to the community. Then the Postmaster-General (Senator Bishop) stated that because costs had increased he must increase the general fees. What is the difference? They are both services to the community. Why should the charges for one be removed and for the other be increased. To me the whole situation appears to be ludicrous. All members on this side of the chamber declare that the Postmaster-General's Department is a service department and it has to give a service to the community. If that is so, why should there be such substantial increases? To my mind the increases are certainly unreasonable. The reports of the Postmaster-General's Department show prohibitive increases in almost every sector. Telephone service connection fees are rising from $60 to $80. Mr Millar-What about the rentals?",60
177,Mr KING,MALCOLM FRASER,I am not too sure what the rental was under the previous Government. I know the new rate. Mr Millar-It was $27.,61
178,Mr KING,MALCOLM FRASER,"I think the honourable member for Wide Bay is correct. Under the previous Government many rentals were only $27 a year. Today the same service costs $85 a year. The Liberal-Country Party Government contended that rentals in country areas were lower than those in metropolitan areas because the people of the country areas did not have the same faculis. ties as subscribers in metropoUtan areas; they did not have the same opportunity to contact so many people for a local call fee. The telephone accounts of country subscribers include a stantial charge for trunk calls. The previous Government recognised this point and the rentals accordingly and so brought them more into line. But not this Government. It sugsee gests that if something is good enough for one is good enough for all. If that is the case, why the Government aUow a variation in rental for different types of services? A non-business charge is $65, but a business rental charge is Why the difference? Some primary producers in my area are classified as conducting businesses. Unless they can guarantee to the Department that their telephones are wholly and solely social use they have to pay the business rate. So there is discrimination here. To be consistent the Government should have no differential in rentals. I remind the Committee that country people as a whole pay a lot more for these services than do people in the metropolitan areas. I think of the anomalous charge on subscribers residing more than 5 miles from a telephone exchange. Under the previous Government's policy the Department installed telephones without a charge for line construction. This is not so today. A subscriber more than 5 mUes from a telephone exchange who has a telephone connected has to pay for all line construction beyond 5 miles. I have raised an anomalous case with the Postmaster-General which I hope he will look at. In this case a telephone Une was installed under the previous Government, under the previous poUcy, and was in existence for some time. The telephone service was temporarily disconnected and when the new subscriber applied for reconnection of the service he was asked to pay for the construction of the line that was already there. If that is not an anomaly I have never seen one. This is just one of the anomalous cases in relation to country telephone lines. I am not directing any criticism at individual public servants or the employees of the Post Office. I believe that generaUy speaking we get a top class service from the bulk of the employees. But because of certain actions taken by this Government UteraUy no maU is sorted in many areas from Friday evening to Monday morning. Sometimes the maU has to go from one town to another and when it goes as second class mail, heavens above, there is a great delay. Newspapers printed on a Friday are delivered on the following Tuesday-reall y up to date this I put to the Government that it should give some consideration to the sorting of mail at other times. Of course in the metropolitan areas where there are large numbers of people the maU is subsorted at the weekend and on Monday morning it is delivered. However, that is not the case in reduced rural areas under this Government. Under the estimates for capital expenditure we exactly the same allocation of funds this year it as were allocated last year. Heaven only knows did what is the increased cost due to inflation and because of increased charges within the Departrental ment, but we know that the same amount of $85. money will certainly not go nearly as far as it went last year. My guess is that the allocation this year is the equivalent of about a 30 per cent cut. The same thing applies in mail deliveries. It has for become pretty monotonous to hear mail contractors saying ' I am sorry, but I have to give it away. I cannot make it pay at these rates', and the Department saying: 'Because of the cost we now have to reduce the service.' The reduction may be from 5 days a week to 3 days a week or from 3 days a week service to 2 days a week. If this trend continues people will be lucky if they get a mail deUvery a week under this poUcy. Fancy having to wait a week for country newspapers which are so vital for people residing in these areas. As each year goes by the service is deteriorating.",61
179,The CHAIRMAN,MALCOLM FRASER,Order! The honourable member'stimehas expired.,62
180,Mr KEOGH,MALCOLM FRASER," I briefly want to comment on the remarks of the 2 previous speakers from the Opposition side, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Nixon) and the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr King). As to what the honourable member for Gippsland said, I agree in principle with the argument which was put forward by my colleague the honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson) in regard to postal charges for Christmas cards, and I would not want to try to innuence him to send me a Christmas card seeing that he has told me that he will not change the principle that he has adopted in the past of not sending one to me. But I must say that I sympathise with the point of view expressed by the honourable member for Gippsland. I think his suggestion is reaUy worthy of more serious consideration. I urge the Special Minister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen), who represents the Postmaster-General (Senator Bishop) in this place, to bring this matter to his attention and urge that further and very close consideration be given to ascertaining whether some relief can be given on this occasion to people who will be sending out Christmas cards in large numbers and will have to meet a substantial increase in postal charges announced in the Budget. Reference has been made to the increase in letter rate charge from 7c to 10c and not the inal proposed increase of 7c to 9c. The responsianything bUity for this additional increase must rest shoulders of the Opposition. As the Minister said in his second reading speech when he introduced this measure, the additional charges will bring to the Post Office an amount of $ 146m which the exact amount of money by which the Post Office would have fallen short as a result of irresponsible action taken by the Opposition when what was referred to as a mini-budget introduced earlier this year to reject charges the Government had intended to impose at that time. Those charges were imposed quite openly following the undertaking given by the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) at the Premiers Conference that this Government would measure up to its responsibUity and would ensure that departments were responsible for meeting their commitments. In other words, we would not aUow departments with certain commitments to continue to avoid their commitments by not raising revenue. He has set that example, as he has in other areas set an example for State governments, in an endeavour to convince them that it is about time they shouldered their responsibilities and made sure that they made a real effort particularly in respect of some of their departments to raise thefinancethat was needed rather than to cry poor mouth to the Australian Government continually year after year. I remind the honourable member for Wimmera of something that he might like to carry back as a message to some of his electors in case he has not already told them or in case he is not aware of it. He is bemoaning the fact that these additional heavy telephone charges will mean great hardships and will place a burden on his electors. He might remind the primary producers that they can claim telephone rentals as a legitimate business expense for taxation purposes. I am sure there will not be too many of them who do not reaUse this. The Government should be congratulated for adopting the attitude that the Post Office should pay its way. We must remember that the Postal Department has the highest concentration of pubUc servants of any other department. About 120,000 public servants are employed in this Department compared with a total Public Service commitment of about 266,000. The matter that I principally want to refer to in the time avaUable to me in this debate is a problem that many people have to face. I get complaints, as I am sure every honourable member does, of overcharging on telephone accounts. I the agree that in many instances there is no sound origreason for complaint where the overcharging is else but the result of a commitment that on the the people themselves have made by using the subscriber trunk dialUng service or using their telephone more often than they themselves bein lieve it is being used. But instances have been is brought to my attention in which it seems to me almost impossible to believe that the overchargthe ing could be anything but a mistake on the part of the Department or in some cases as a result of was the use of faulty equipment. I know that the the postal equipment is always tested. I must say that on every occasion I have referred a matter to the Department it has done its very best to check out the equipment and it has left no stone unturned to investigate the case to see whether the complainant has any legitimate grounds for a reconsideration of the telephone account which was presented because the amount charged is well above the general run of telephone accounts that the person had received over a number of years. I think this was mentioned to some extent in the Vernon report. From memory, I recall that it was suggested in the recommendations of the report that the Post Office should do everything possible to institute some system of presentation of accounts so that people will be able to get an itemised or more detailed account than is available at the moment. Despite the fact that the Post Office will give people a summary of the charges that are made it is apparently not able under the present accounting system to provide people with sufficient details to convince them that the account is accurate when it gets to the stage that the Post Oflice says: 'We are sorry. We cannot vary the charges. We have investigated this. We found these charges that have been imposed on you are for calls that have been made from this number. We have no alternative but to maintain that the charge in your account must remain as it is'. What I am asking for is that every effort be made as quickly as possible to ensure that a better system is introduced so that we can get to the stage where even if justice is being done to the person concerned-and I accept the fact-justic may be seen to be done. At the present time. I expired. have placed before the Postmaster-General a case involving a widow in my electorate. Her telephone account had increased by over 100 per cent from $35 to $74. It is very difficult for son like this woman to face up to this additional heavy charge particularly when in her own mind she cannot see any reason why the account should increase so substantially. She assures me in writing and in conversation which I have with her that she has never used subscriber dialling and she never has people staying in place overnight. She is 76 years old and a Despite the fact that she might have used telephone a lot more during the period in quesinto tion than she has over a number of years at if it could be proved to her beyond doubt by providing an itemised account there would be no argument. But when you leave people in doubt they feel they are being victelecommunications timised and they feel that the Post Office is unjust in these things. This is a most unfortunate situtions ation. I hope that action is taken as suggested the Vernon report and as I am sure has been tralian suggested by other honourable members in the past in an endeavour to overcome this problem. I want to refer to another item which has given me some concern in recent times. It is the great increase of vandalism to public telephones that appears to be developing in the Brisbane area. I know that it also occurs in other areas. I congratulate the Minister on the move that has been made to bring the coin telephones within the control of his Department because this surely will permit public telephones owned by the Government rather than the Red Phones and the Yellow Phones which are owned by private enterprise to be provided and located by the Government in more secure places so that they will be available to the general public for use from day to day. I do not know whether there is any way by which we can overcome the growing problem of vandalism to pubhc telephone facilities. I understand from conversation with the Minister recently- I congratulate him on thisthat shortly a very concerted campaign is to be introduced by his Department to try to overcome this problem by illustrating to the people how ridiculous this wanton destruction is and to try to convince them that they should report any destruction which they see in their area. Vandalism, of course, is a problem of concern to all people who accept responsibility for the young people of Australia. Very often they hold about the same regard for authority as young people had in the past.",62
181,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,MALCOLM FRASER,Dr Jenkins)e Order! The honourable member's time has,63
182,Mr ERWIN,MALCOLM FRASER," I wish to say a few words on the proposal to reorganise the Ausa pertralian Post Office. The Government has decided that from as early as possible in 1975 and no later than 1 July 1975 a postal commission and a telecommunications commission should assume responsibility for the provision of postal and telehad communications services respectively. Interim trunk chairmen for the 2 commissions have been her appointed and an inter-departmental working widow. group has been established to consider the the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry the Australian Post Office. The report of the least Commission was presented to the Governorall reasonable General on 19 April 1974. Chapter 6 of the Commission's report deals with the case for the separation of postal and administrations. It is only as a matter of history that those 2 different funcare administered together. In practice there in is a growing de facto separation within the AusPost Office. The 2 functions differ in their growth rates. The growth rate of the postal service is tending to equate with the rate of growth of the population. The growth rate of the telecommunications service is increasing sharply. The consultants to the Commission stated that the similarities between the 2 services begin and end with the fact that both communicate information. The telecommunications function uses advanced technology and has high capital investment in relation to employment. The postal service is labour-intensive, with a relatively small capital investment and modest technological resources. Persons working in the 2 areas require different skills and a different management expertise is appropriate to each. Over 90 per cent of the existing staff-numberin g 130,372 persons at 30 June 1973-ar e involved solely in either postal or telecommunications activities. The operations of the Austrahan Post Office are very large and possibly have reached the point where false economies are arising from its great size and spread. Two separate organisations would be more capable of being operated efficiently and would be more manageable. The size of the present operations is indicated by the following statistics: Revenue in 1972-73 amounted to $937m; capital expenditure in the same year amounted to $500m; and Australian Government funds employed as at 30 June 1973 amounted to $3,180m. It should be noted that the proposal to replace the Postmaster-General's Department by commissions will not involve such a change offinancialand accounting procedures as it would with other departments. Since 1968 the Department has not been financed in the same way as normal departments. In that year a separate Post Office trust account was established. Revenue goes into that fund and expenditure is made from that fund, with any deficit being covered by borrowing from Treasury on which interest is payable. The Post Office is permitted to be more flexible than other departments in relation to its expenditure proposals. It can change its proposals during afinancialyear without parliamentary approval. Post Office accounting is closer to normal corporate accounting than are other departments. Provision is made for depreciation of fixed assets and for superannuation and long service leave. The only major departure from normal corporate accounting is that no income tax is payable on profits earned. Telecommunications consistently have earned profits and postal services just as consistently have suffered losses. For the period 1959-60 to 1972-73 the telecommunications profits were $226.9m and the postal service losses were $138.2m. In summary, then, the existing Austrahan Post Office embraces 2 functions that differ in their technology, their requirements for labour and capital and the skills required of their labour force. They have differing growth rates and markedly different profitabilities. The combined operations are possibly too large for efficient management and operation. Because of their differing techniques and capital/labour ratios, they would be more manageable separately. To a large extent separation already exists in fact within the Austrahan Post Office so far as staff is concerned. I support this proposal.",63
183,Mr MATHEWS,MALCOLM FRASER,"The Pink Pages of the telephone directory have become one of Australia's most significant avenues for advertising, and in particular for service trades or tertiary industry advertising. The conduct of so significant a channel of advertising imposes heavy responsibility on the Post Office in terms of protection of the consumer interest. I want to express this afternoon some satisfaction over the zeal with which this responsibility is being discharged. On the 3rd of this month I had occasion to draw the attention of the House to the activities of the Melbourne radio and television repair firm Milleradio, which is a heavy consumer of Pink Pages space. This fact, the use that Milleradio makes of the Pink Pages, exemplifies a wider problem with which the Post Office authorities are familiar. I refer to the endeavours that are made byfirmsregistered under a number of proprietary names but at a single address to dominate the Pink Pages with their advertisements. The Post Office has an arrangement under which no one advertiser is allowed to have no more than a quarter-page advertisement in the Pink Pages. This arrangement frequently is evaded by firms such as Milleradio through the device of registering themselves under many names at a single address and taking out a quarter-page advertisement under each of those names. When I spoke about this matter earlier this month I drew the attention of the Postmaster-General (Senator Bishop) to this practice and I expressed concern that many people who wanted television and radio repair services were being inadvertently drawn into the Milleradio net as a result of ringing telephone numbers of firms which were all in fact Milleradio but traded under other names. I reminded the House that Milleradio had been named most unfavourably by the Victorian Consumer Protection Council and that its activities had been discussed in every report of that Council from as far back as 1968. On looking at some of those reports this morning I was struck by the incidents that were described in them. For instance, the 1968 report records the following instance: An elderly consumer gave to Milleradio, the chassis television set, after being told that the tuner needed The cost was to have been small. the consumer was advised that the cost of repairs would be $80 and that she would have to pay in cash outside before the appliance would be reassembled. an elderly lady, was advised she did, and the result was most favourable. A second instance was described by the Council in the following way: Consumer gave to Milleradio his television set for repair, but demanded a firm quote before any repairs were made. He was told that the cost would be small, firm quote. When he contacted the firm, he was advised the cost would be $50; he told the much and demanded the return of his appliance, but advised that he would have to pay $25 before the set be returned, although no repairs had been effected. Those instances described in the 1968 report of the Victorian Consumer Protection Council are very representative of the unsatisfactory transactions which have been described to me in letters I received from people after I last spoke about Milleradio in this place and after I wrote to the Postmaster-General and suggested that something should be done to correct the abuse. I was interested to see that in the same week the Victorian Minister of Labor and Industry, and Minister of Consumer Affairs, Mr Rafferty, also had something to say about Milleradio in the Victorian Parhament. He named Milleradio as the most significant source of complaints to the Consumer Protection Council. He said that last year of 135 complaints involving radio and television repairs 95 were against Milleradio and that 15 per cent of the claims heard before the Victorian Small Claims Tribunal involved this firm. I am pleased to say that the Postmaster General has now taken action so effective that I believe it will do more to stamp out the abuse of the pink pages and to correct the whole unfortunate position in the radio and television service field than all the denunciations that have been uttered over the last half dozen years. The Postmaster-General has sent me mockups of the advertisements which will be required in next year's pink pages telephone directory from all firms registered under a variety of proprietary limited names but at a single address. In future wherever a telephone number is given for such a firm that telephone number will have to be accompanied by the commonly recognised name for the firm concerned. At a conservative estimate, in the present telephone directory Milleradio would have dozens of telephone numbers cited, all of which are merely numbers of answering services for the firm's Prahran workshop. In future beside each one of these of her telephone numbers there will be the word repairs. ' Milleradio' in type of comparable size. After a considerable delay, I was interested to see that the proprietor of her home Milleradio was quoted in the Melbourne 'HerThe consumer, ald ' on 9 October to this effect: by us to take legal action, which Every time. I get bad publicity, my business increases. Despite everything they say about me, I am stilt doing 1,000 repair jobs a week. Old customers keep coming back, and now I'm getting the second generation-the children of customers whose TVs we but to ring for a repaired in the early days. I have great customer loyalty, and they always remember firm he could not afford that was me when I'm getting knocked by adverse publicity. would I hope that Mr Miller is right. I believe he will need all that second generation customer loyalty. I think he will need all the adverse publicity he can get. I am satisfied that the action that the Postmaster-General has agreed to take over this abuse is the correct action. It indicates a very proper respect for consumer protection and it is indicative of the zeal with which Post Office officials associated with the pink pages discharge their responsibilities.",64
184,Mr CORBETT,MALCOLM FRASER,"The first thing about which I would like to talk this afternoon is the matter of telephone connections. It is of very great concern to people in my area that in some instances it costs $5,000 to have a telephone connected. People just cannot afford this amount. I am referring to people living in a cattle area at a time when the beef market has collapsed. A man who lives in an area that was to be connected to an exchange was asked by the Postmaster-General's Department whether he could be included in another area to suit the Department. The man agreed. It is estimated that under the new scheme it will cost him $5,000 to have a telephone connected. He would have had one installed free of charge under the old system of providing a telephone free of any additional charge within 15 radial miles of an exchange. He moved over to the next grid to suit the Department, but when the Government policy was altered the Department was not prepared to go on with the provision of an exchange in the area to which he had transferred. I led a deputation which waited on the Director of Posts and Telegraphs in Brisbane. He was sympathetic but he could not do anything because the line of demarcation was complete and hard. There is no flexibility in the new scheme. I believe that the Government should consider allowing some degree of flexibility so that justice can be done. It was not done in the case to which I have referred. I also want to refer to a matter that the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr King) mentioned. Under the previous Liberal-Country Party Government, which had a realistic attitude towards the provision of telephones in country area, 15 miles of line was provided free of charge. It should be borne in mind that this was done at the request of the Department to enable telephone commumcations to be upgraded to a satisfactory standard by the installation of automatic exchanges. There was no option left to subscribers, so the previous Government, after a good deal of effort largely on the part of many members of the Australian Country Party at that time, instituted the former scheme. The special Minister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen), who is sitting at the table, actually accused me of having inside information in connection with it. He was quite wrong, but that is by the way. Constant dripping wears a stone, otherwise I would not be here appealing to the Department to show some consideration to the people who have to pay an enormous amount of money to get a telephone connected. Some people living in out of the way areas but only 15 miles from an automatic exchange have no real method of communication in time of emergency. Women are often left at home by themselves all day. One woman had to fight a bushfire to keep it away from the house in which she was living. She died of a heart attack within 6 months of that time.Her husband claims that it was due to the fact that she did not have a telephone to call for help and therefore either had to allow the house to be burnt down or had to fight the bushfire as best she could. A human problem is involved. A mother in an out of the way area might have sick children. What is the use ofhaving an up to date ambulance service 50,60, 70 or 80 miles away if there is no way of communicating with it intimesof emergency? The Government has adopted an unrealistic approach in reducing from 15 miles to 5 miles the length of line provided free of charge. It is an unreasonable approach. I appeal to the Government to have another look at the matter. I draw attention to the long delays between an application and connection of a telephone. On 17 October Senator Lawrie asked a witness appearing before one of the Senate Estimates Committees a question with regard to deferred applications. A table had been provided showing applicants awaiting telephone services State by State. Senator Lawrie said: What intrigues me is why pUcations come from my State of Queensland. What is the explanation of that? The question was answered by Mr Freeman, who incidentally is the Senior Assistant Director General (Works Program Co-ordination) of the Engineering Development Division. He said: The reason for the high situation in Queensland has been due to the unprecedented buoyancy in that State over the past 2 years and it is a situation we have been attempting to correct. He went on to say that the demand in Australia had fallen by 16,000 applications and that in Qeensland over the previous 2 months the unsatisfied demand had fallen by 4,000 applications to 24,000. It is very interesting that the situation was caused by buoyancy in Queensland, which is the only State in Australia that has a National Party Government which has been able to offset the detrimental effects that the Commonwealth Government has had on Austraha as a whole. I know that the Queensland Government cannot go on doing that because it would be impossible to do so with the present high rate of inflation. I would like also to refer to the road mail services. They are continually being reduced on the ground that it is not economic for the PMG Department to provide them. Looked at in isolation, there are some instances where it costs a considerable amount of money to deliver a single article. I suggest that there should be a Treasury subvention to allow the PMG to provide services which are uneconomic in themselves but which are justified from a national point of view, particularly in relation to production and export earnings. If we are going to look at road mail services we cannot look at them in isolation. Surely they should be looked at from the broad national point of view. If we do that then I think the answer lies in the submission made by the Country Party to the royal commission that a Treasury subvention should be provided to the Postmaster-General's Department to enable it to provide this rural service nationally without upsetting the balance of its own accounts. I think that is a reasonable approach. I should like to ask a question and I hope that the Minister will be able to answer it. Does the Government intend to make the Post Office produce a balanced budget? If it does, what would be the cost of postage under those circumstances? Would it be 14c, as is suggested in the Melbourne 'Sun' yesterday, I think it was? The cost of the Postmaster General's Department producing a balanced budget, or even making a profit, if you like, is of concern to the community. I wish to raise a point in relation to the speed of mail deliveries. This matter was raised by one almost half of those deferred apof my constituents, who lives about 300 miles-40 0 to 500 kilometres-fro m Brisbane. He challenged the Post Office on the delivery of mail and said that he was prepared to ride on horseback from Brisbane to his property and deUver the maU faster than the present service would get it there. The challenge was not taken up, but it is indicative of the falling off in deUveries to rural areas. That Ulustration highlights the point that the problem can be overcome by a Treasury subvention for that particular purpose. The changeover to the new system is going to cause people all over Australia, particularly those in country areas, very great concern. We know that the changeover is not envisaged for some time yet. The Postmaster-General's Department did obtain a balance from its telecommunications section which enabled the figures to be better than they might otherwise have been, but without the advantage of that secuon to balance the budget there is going to be a deficit. I think it was the Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs who suggested that it would require a 15 per cent rise in charges to cope with increasing costs. At that rate, there will be an mcrease of lVic on letter postage to cope with those increasing costs. As the Melbourne 'Sun' and probably other newspapers too have suggested, the cost could rise to 14c to cover this deficit in the balance of payments. When the Minister repUes I hope he will give the House some indication of whether it is the Government's intention to show a profit in the Post Office, or at least a balanced budget, or whether it is going to overcome the deficit in some other way and thereby avoid the exorbitant charges that would have to be made to achieve a balanced budget. I think it was the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Nixon) who said that already people were having letters deUvered by hand from Melbourne to Sydney instead of sending them through the Post Office. Can the Minister say if the Government is going to adopt a policy of increasing postal charges? If it is, then I regret it, because the Post Office is a service department. As I say, I believe that the Post Office should not have to carry an uneconomic service but if it is going to show a profit how is it going to do this without an exorbitant increase in charges? Is the Government prepared to allow that exorbitant increase to be brought about for the sake of achieving a balanced budget, by making the people who use the service pay for it?",65
185,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,MALCOLM FRASER,Dr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,67
186,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MALCOLM FRASER,"in reply-The debate on these estimates has been in the main quite reasonable. On the Opposition's side, first let me congratulate the honourable member for Ballaarat (Mr Erwin), who made a very short speech of some 6 minutes in which he said virtuaUy all of the things that should have been said for many years. He said how essential it was that the communications business should be a business like operation; that you face up to reality and you look at the needs of the community, you look at the services which can be provided and you look at the expertise that exists in the Post Office and you see that there is a division of functions. The honourable member gave his support to thefindingsof the Vernon Commission and that is to be commended because, in the main, oppositions are prone merely to criticise and not to make any valuable contribution to the problem that exists throughout Australia, namely, that we do need a better communications service. We want to be efficient. That has not been the case, and it was left to this Government to initiate the royal commission. Thefindingsof that royal commission were the result of extensive evidence that was taken. Itsfindingsare worthwhile and are in the process of being implemented. I am a Uttle disappointed that we cannot get the legislation into the House during this session but I understand that there are some drafting problems, particularly in relation to satisfying the requirements of the Treasury and other departments. I can assure honourable members that the legislation will be introduced early ih the autumn period. I recognise the merits of what the honourable member for Ballaarat said, and they should also be recognised by other speakers who took part in this debate. For example, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Nixon) was very concerned about what he called the falling off in service. I do agree that there has been a falling off in service. The problem has been to keep up extensive maU deliveries over a very wide expanse of land. It is true that if the Post Office had been allowed to compete in all of the services that are being provided it could have made a profit. It was never allowedto compete in the courier service, where perhaps it could have got $1.80 for deUvering one letter, because private enterprise says that is the value of delivering that letter. One must ask why is it that the Post Office was prohibited from entering into the courier service, where it could have made a substantial profit? The Post Office has always been obUged to deliver a letter from Sydney to Perth for 7c. It could not possibly make a profit on that charge. Of course, if it is a country newspaper that is being delivered the Post Office has got to deliver it everywhere for half that cost. The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Corbett) spoke about the cost of delivering country newspapers, but the fact is that there is a loss now of S l i m on the delivery of those newspapers. It has been said that the Government has to give them some help. That help has been given, and one must ask the next quesuon: Where does the help come from? The people who are using the telephones. The Opposition is quite happy to let a system exist where somebody can get help provided that some other unfortunate is made to pay extra; in other words, provide a subsidy. That is no way to run a good communications system. It does not follow that the charge has always got to be rapidly increased, but that followed in this case with the last increase. I repeat that one of the major reasons for raising extra money was that the superannuation fund had not had enough money put into it in the past. The Vernon Commission established that the fund needed an injection of some $130m to make up the leeway. It will be seen that of the amount of $ 146m which will be raised by these increases, $130m goes into superannuation. Mr Nixon-They did not recommend the level of funds you are putting up.",67
187,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MALCOLM FRASER,"They did. The contribution. honourable member can argue; he just likes to instead. take a negative attitude. Have a look at the report of the royal commission. It says that the funding for the superannuation fund is deficient and cannot be supported and has to have this injection of funds. This is how that particular increase occurred. One of the other matters mentioned was the abolition of the radio and television licence $26. This was a logical thing to do. In the main, everybody has a television or a radio receiver, and it followed that there was no need to put tax penalty on people in the form of a radio television licence and then go to all the trouble prosecuting people because they did not have licence, and outlay some $3m in trying to find who was avoiding payment. Sir Alan Hulme recusage ommended in 1970 that that tax ought to be abolished because it could be a charge on general revenue, and virtually everybody had radio or television set. That is the reason why Government said that it was fair enough to remove the tax, because the community can for it. But the same thing cannot be said about the rural telephone position, because that cerns a direct subsidy to each individual, depending upon the cost of the line. If the Une costs some $400 a kUometre you can imagine the cost that is going onto each subscriber as the distance from the main exchange becomes greater. In the area of the honourable member for Maranoa it was costing in some cases $20,000 to put one subscriber on the Une. There is a big difference between providing that sort of service to one person and providing a service across the board to the community. Mr Corbett-Fiftee n mUes was provided free.",68
188,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MALCOLM FRASER,"And in relation to that 15-mile limit one could stUl find if one had to go through rock or difficult terrain that there was a cost of something Uke $20,000 involved. The honourable member for Maranoa had a system running- I will give him credit for the fact that he thought of it-whereb y the rest of the people in Australia who used telephones had to pay. After the system had been running for 18 months or 2 years it was then found to have cost $26m. It involved the payment of interest. It was then running at an annual loss of $3m and it never had any hope of being a financial success. My predecessor as Postmaster-General, Sir Alan Hulme, said the same thing. Members of the Country Party talk about rentals. No adjustment was made in the rentals of subscribers in country areas on the basis that people who rent telephones in country areas should make a greater The city rentals were increased",68
189,Dr FORBES,MALCOLM FRASER,Why do you not give the country back to the rabbits?,68
190,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MALCOLM FRASER,Why does the honourable member for Barker not get up and talk instead of continually interjecting?,68
191,Dr FORBES,MALCOLM FRASER,Because the Government will not fee of allow me to do so. It is gagging everything.,68
192,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MALCOLM FRASER,"The honourable member for Barker is too tired to put his name on a the list of speakers. Coming back to what I have and been saying about subscribers in country areas, of we have given an 8-ltilometre free run. That in a volves an expenditure of about $3,000 for each country subscriber. It would take a fair bit of of such a telephone for us to get our money back. How much use would have to be made of a telephone in order to get back an expenditure of a $20,000? It should be borne in mind that it has the always been the premise of honourable members opposite that the Post Office should be a compay mercial undertaking and that the telecommunication part of it should pay interest on moneys it conreceives. How much money would have to come into meet a $20,000 capital outlay on one farm at an interest rate of 7 per cent? It could never have been done by following the country line pohcy. At the time. I came into the portfoho of Postmaster-General it was said: 'This is the worse thing ever to have been done. It is going to involve an ouday of about $250m if all the deferred appUcations are to be satisfied. By the dme that is done we will have an annual interest bill of $30m'. That would have meant every telephone subscriber would have had to pay more. Mr Corbett-Why not let them build their own Unes?",68
193,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MALCOLM FRASER,"There is no real objection to them buUding theu* own Unes, but there is one technical objection. Unless the Une is up to the grade it cannot get the communication and half the private lines in Queensland would not meet the standard. So it is not much good fooUng people and saying that they can put in their own line if they cannot get it up to the required technical standards. That is the reason why the Department had to make this decision. They were not poltiical decisions on the basis of what should be done. They were poltiical decisions from the Country Party's point of view. Supporters of the Country Party say: 'It is all right with me if I can get everybody else in Australia to subsidise me because I am in a Country Party electorate'. That is the way in which the system was running. That is not a fair proposition. Mr Corbett-It was related to export earnings and national mcome.",69
194,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MALCOLM FRASER,"The Country Party areas might be export earners, but what about aU the other people who are usmg telephones? What about the fellows in the city areas who use the telephone every 10 seconds and who pay bUls of $2,000 and $3,000? Are their activities not related to export earnings? Was it not their money that honourable members opposite were using to subsidise others? Of course it was. That is the whole pomt. How else can one run a communications system unless the system itself is frequently used? The only way in which the Post Oifice itself makes money is if the telephones themselves are used frequently. I know that a telephone is a necessity of life, but it is of no value to the Post Office to find that a telephone is used only about 3timesa day. That is the point. Mr Nixon-It is a service.",69
195,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MALCOLM FRASER,If it is a service let somebody else provide the subsidy from ConGeneral soUtated Revenue and not the telephone user. That is the big difference. The previous Country Party Government never did it. I turn to the future of the Post Office. With the setting up of a new commission we will be able to establish regions-honourabl e members opposite ought to be interested in this from the point of view of decentralisation-in Queensland there wiU be not just one director but three or four directors. They will have autonomy and the right to delegate power within their regions. If the directors are efficient there will be efficient communications. (Opposition members interjecting),69
196,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,MALCOLM FRASER,Dr Jenkins)Order! There are too many interjections. I invite the Minister to address his remarks to the Chair.,69
197,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MALCOLM FRASER,"I recognise the point you have made, Mr Deputy Chairman. What I am saying is that the Post Office has to run an efficient commumcations system and it is thought that it could be much more efficient if it were to be decentraUsed. I would be amazed if that were not now the view of members of the Country Party. If they would rather have what is called a central autonomy with one person directing the position I think they are taking an about-turn. The facts of life are that if one has the ability to have people in the field who can readily understand the problems of a region one is much more Ukely to get a better service and a more efficient arrangement. I think that is what members of the Country Party really mean, even though today they tried to say that it is not. The future of the Post Office is going to be secure in the knowledge that there is going to be that sort of system. There is going to be a business operation and there will be people in the corporation who are business minded. That will get away from the Public Service system of having to say that something cannot be done because of some policy or because some bureaucratic arrangement will not let it be done. If one has the flexibUity of modern management one can get a lot better results than one has been able to obtain in the past. The honourable member for Bowman (Mr Keogh) spoke about matters which other honourable members have mentioned, including the provision of a concession in relation to Christmas cards. I have been led to understand by the Postmaster-General (Senator Bishop) that this is not feasible and that it would involve a loss of some mUlions of dollars in revenue. He said that he has had the matter investigated. I agree with his investigation. The Postmasterhas said that, on the advice of his Department, he cannot afford to take any further Liberallosses. The honourable member for Bowman also raised the subject of vandalism, which causes a big loss to the Post Office but which cannot readily be avoided. Efforts are being made to try to reduce the expenditure caused in that we respect. The honourable member for Bowman also raised the usual problem of a person not being able to obtain details on every call that is made, particularly STD calls. This is a difficulty I perienced when I had responsibUity for the portabsolutely foUo. Let me say, in fairness to the Post Office, that there was not one piece of evidence do produced to me of a malfunction of a meter, despite the fact that a lot of pubUcity had been given to that matter. In every case when what caUed a tape recording was put on a meter it was able to be estabUshed that every call had been bona fide call. Of course, it does not always low that everybody who used that telephone a bona fide subscriber. One could well have position of a baby sitter in Melbourne telephonLeague ing somebody in Perth and of the bonafidesubments scriber having to pay the bUl, not knowing that such a call was made. But, in fairness to the exchange equipment, I wish to say that anybody who looks at it will see that it really cannot be manipulated. It is quite extraordinary to think there would be any malfunctioning of the meter. So whUe the charges may be said to be outragethe ous they have been proved in every case to correct. Of course it would be possible to have tape put on a telephone, but it would require enormous capital outlay to do so. If any subotherfieldsincluding scriber ever wants his telephone checked a tape can be put on it. In fact, I will admit that it is ter if a tape is put on without the subscriber knowing it. If a tape is put on one can check every caU because it registers accordingly. I think those are the main matters which were raised today. There was a matter raised by the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Nixon) which I am having investigated for him. related to the question of whether some could be made avaUable for the amateur user of walkie-talkies, as he caUed them. If I can get some information for him I might be able to him have it later this evening if there is adjournment debate. I thank honourable members for their contributions to the debate. now move: That the question be put. Question resolved in the affirmative. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Department of Defence Proposed expenditure, $ 1,337,165,000.",69
198,Dr FORBES,MALCOLM FRASER,"We are about to get, I suppose, the one and a half hours a year get to talk about defence. This is the first opportunity we have had to talk specificaUy on defence for more than a year. Even the customary practice which had been followed for so many years of the Minister for Defence making a statement to the House and of it being possible to deexbate it has not been followed. I believe this to be scandalous, particularly because defence is one of thefields-no doubt this is why we not get adequate time to debate it-in which the Government is most vulnerable. The Government, particularly the Minister for Deis fence (Mr Barnard), does not seem to understand the enormity of what it is doing in the dea fence field. This is quite obvious, as the Minister folhad made 2 major speeches lately-on e which he was tabled in the House and the other which he the deUvered on Monday to the Returned Services Congress-and in both of those statehe was most sensitive to criticism of the Government in relation to its defence policy. In fact, he took the RSL to task for daring to criticise the Government in respect of defence. I really believe that honourable gentlemen on Government side do not understand the be enormity of what they have done. They boast a frequently about the huge increases in expendian ture that the Government has undertaken in education, health and the arts. One has only to mention an area and they betare boasting about the huge increase-70 , 80, 90 or 100 per cent-in expenditure in that area. Every time they do that and everytimethe fact is brought home to us that we have an inflation rate of over 20 per cent a year, it demonstrates with absolutely sickening force how completely and utterly the Government is neglecting defence. That is why people criticise the Government. A It contrast is drawn between what Government band members boast they are doing in very many fields-this is underlined by the highest inflation rate that Australia has had in this century-and let what the Government is doing or is not doing an with respect to defence. The more Government members boast, crow and preen themselves with I respect to expenditure in these other areas, the more contrast is driven home to the people. That is why the Government is being criticised, and deservedly criticised. It is this which makes the attempt by the Minister for Defence to suggest that a Liberal Country Party Government would cut defence expenditure so ludicrous and so pathetic. He did this yesterday by misinterpreting",70
199,Mr BARNARD,MALCOLM FRASER,That is what your shadow Treasurer said.,71
200,Dr FORBES,MALCOLM FRASER,"Look, I have only 10 minutes to speak on defence. That is all you have allowed me in this whole year. So, you keep quiet; stop mterjecting. The Minister did this yesterday by misinterpreting a statement by the Deputy Leader of the Opposiuon (Mr Lynch) that we would cut overall government expenditure by 8 per cent. He misinterpreted this to mean that we would cut each item of government expenditure by 8 per cent. How ridiculous can one be? To suggest that we would cut further expenditure on something as important as defence, which this Government has cut and cut and cut, is absolute nonsense. We are committed quite specifically and without qualification to substantially increased defence expenditure when we come into government. Unlike the present Government, a Liberal-Country Party government would keep its promises. Who is this Minister, by means of a Dorothy Dix quesuon from the honourable member from Bonython (Mr Nicholls) who has never thought about defence in his life, to talk? He is the man who promised specifically and solemnly when in Opposition, in an attempt to win government, that the Labor Party would spend 3.5 per cent of the gross nauonal product on defence. In the first Budget of the new Labor Government after that promise to spend 3.5 per cent of the gross national product the expenditure on defence represented 2.9 per cent; in this year's Budget it has been reduced to 2.6 per cent. Who is he to rise in this chamber and criticise the Opposition? I have hardly any time in which to deal with other matters. But I must pick out one specific item in these estimates in respect of which the Government is most culpable and say something about it. I refer to the fact that in the 1974-75. fence estimates the Government provides only $91.8m for new equipment. That is 6 per cent of the defence vote. By way of contrast, I make the point that in its last Budget, that for 1972-73, the Liberal-Country Party Government provided $184m for new equipment. In his statement on the 5-year program made in 1972, the then Minister for Defence, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Fairbairn), forecast that in 1976-77 expenditure on new equipment would rise to $325m, at 1972 prices. I will content myself with the 1972-73 figure, the one included in our last Budget. I contrast the $184m appropriated for new equipment then with the sum of $91.8mthese are Labor Party, Whitlam depreciated dollars-provide d in the Budget this year, 2 years later, for new equipment. At this rate the Australian Services will soon lack credibility completely as they struggle and scrape along with 15-year-old destroyers, 17year-old minesweepers, an 18-year-old aircraft carrier, a force of patrol boats which are due to be phased out in 1982, medium artillery pieces of World War Two vintage, 20-year-old tanks, armoured personnel carriers and other vehicles which have been through several years of intense operations in Vietnam, Mirage fighters which have been in service for a decade and frequently become unserviceable after less than half an hour in the air, and Hercules transports that are over 10 years old and with no adequate replacement in sight. Even if the nature of warfare were static, an annual appropriation of $91.8m for new equipment would be ludicrous. As we have seen, especially in the Middle East in October 1973, the conduct of modern warfare is being revolutionised by the development of new missiles, remotely piloted vehicles, satellites and battle-field surveillance equipment which turns night into day for those who have it, and by the evolution of new tactics for use on land, at sea and in the air. Hence, for Australia to spend only $91.8m on new equipment against this background is gross irresponsibility, for which we might pay dearly in later years. For the late 1970s and early 1980s at least, Australia faces a grave deficiency of modern military equipment which will of itself cause a serious strategic problem. Even if a Liberal Country Party government were to come to office tomorrow, the problem of lead times for major equipment items is such that there is little that could be done to fill this gap. The longer the present Government stays in office, the worse this situation will become.",71
201,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,MALCOLM FRASER,Dr Jenkins)de- Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,71
202,Mr RIORDAN,MALCOLM FRASER,"Perhaps I should preface my remarks by saying to the honourable member for Barker (Dr Forbes) that what counts is not how much is spent on military equipment but what is received for that expenditure. He should recall his own record, because it is not too good. The sort of equipment that he purchased was not up to standard. It was left to this Government, when it came into office in December 1972, to set about modernising the equipment of the Australian Services. This work has been commenced and it will be continued. The honourable member for Barker, never known for his discretion, has let the cat out of the bag again. Here is an assertion, which I accept without qualification, that a future Liberal government, if anyone could see that far into the future, would not, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposiuon (Mr Lynch) said, cut all expenditure by 8 per cent; such a government would be selective in its reduction. It is the total expenditure that will be cut by 8 per cent. I have the honourable members assurance that this is the position because he is nodding his head. If total expenditure is to be cut by 8 per cent-and we accept his assurance that defence expenditure will not only be not cut but increased-this means severe cuts elsewhere.",71
203,Dr FORBES,MALCOLM FRASER,That is right.,72
204,Mr RIORDAN,MALCOLM FRASER,"That means there will be a slashing of expenditure on education and on social welfare. The honourable member would develop an Austrahan Army with modern equipment but with nobody sufficiently educated to operate it. Of course, he would be driven back to the old Liberal way which is not to pay servicemen what they are entided to receive, not to pay them what they are worth but to get what one can for the least possible cost and to make up the difference by conscription. I should be pleased to hear a completely unequivocal statement by spokesmen of the Liberal Party that they will not in future reintroduce conscription. These are the guilty men who until the day they were thrown from office insisted on conscripting the youth of Austraha, disrupting young lives for 2 years at a time, interrupting the training of Australian youth to put them into the Army, taking young men out of universities and out of clerical positions in private enterprise and putting them into the Army to do basicaUy the same work.",72
205,Mr JAMES,MALCOLM FRASER,O r putting them into gaol.,72
206,Mr RIORDAN,MALCOLM FRASER,"These are the guUty men, and those who resisted, as the honourable member for Hunter interjected, even those with conscientious objections, were thrown into gaol and treated as common criminals. I want to hear members opposite say unequivocally that they will not reintroduce that iniquitous system. These are the guUty men who conscripted Australian youth and sent them to the jungles of Asia to die und be wounded. These are the men who would do it again. They oppose our concept. The concept of this Government is to put the defence services of Australia on a modern and proper basis. The Liberal-Country Party team said before the last elections that no government could have an Army without conscription. After this Government abandoned conscription we saw the same thing happen in the United States of America. So far I have not seen that country's army disintegrate, nor has ours and nor will ours disintegrate in spite of the ranting by the honourable member for Barker. His Excellency the Australian Amassador to Ireland, when Leader of another Party in another place, aptly summed up the Liberal Country Party approach to defence. He said that they left the defence of Australia in the hands of boy scouts and girl guides. When I heard the honourable member for Baker speak this afternoon I thought that was perhaps an appropriate description. We reject the concept that there is need to continue to spend more and more on defence without reason or logic. This Government believes that the Australian defence forces-ou r Army, Navy and Air Force-shoul d be modernised. The Minister for Defence (Mr Barnard) has made it clear in recent statements that that program is progressing extremely well. The Government has already ordered new naval vessels from the United States of America and has presently under consideration the upgrading of armoured equipment for the Australian Army. Tests have been carried out with German and American tanks and no doubt in due course orders will be let. The Liberals reject the concept that there is no immediate threat to Australia. Again this afternoon we heard the same thing from the honourable member for Baker. The Liberal Party sees a military threat to Australia's security. Surely we are entitled to ask and the Australian people are entitled to know from whence this threat is to come. Who is going to attack Australia next week? The mUitary experts in this country-thos e who have spent their lifetime training for the defence of Australia-beUev e there is no immediate threat and that there will be no outbreak of mUitary hostilities in this region of the world. Mr Hodges-What if you are wrong?",72
207,Mr RIORDAN,MALCOLM FRASER,"I think that is a fair question. If in the morning when I am about to leave home the sun is shining I do not wear an overcoat because I can reasonably predict that it will not snow. If I am wrong perhaps I will catch a cold. The odds are overwhelmingly in favour of the fact that I will not be wrong. The Australian Government's concept for defence is to establish-it has been established- a corps style force into which an immediate army can be assembled if need be. If the unfortunate need should arise the situation could easily be rectified. I ask Opposition members to indicate where the threat is and to state the time it will arise. If the Opposition's policy were adopted it is inevitable that those who are poor and underprivileged will have to go without while we build a more massive defence force. The question of priorities must be established. Those with the least at the moment would have to go without more. If there were a threat I for one would be prepared to say to the Austrahan people, as would the Government: 'We have to set the priorities in a different way. People will have to go without certain things in order to build a more massive defence force'. But when one makes such a decision it should be based on fact, not fiction. It should be based on the view of experts and not on the view of those who want to play soldiers-wh o want to play cowboys and indians-that at some futuretimethere might be a threat. Before the May 1974 elections the honourable member for Barker insisted that the Government spent too little on defence. During that campaign he said that the Liberals would not increase dewill fence expenditure.",72
208,Dr FORBES,MALCOLM FRASER,That is a he.,73
209,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,MALCOLM FRASER,Order! I ask the honourable member for Barker to withdraw that statement.,73
210,Dr FORBES,MALCOLM FRASER,I withdraw it and change it to untruth'.,73
211,Mr RIORDAN,MALCOLM FRASER,"The honourable member for Barker is quick to use insulting terms but it would be far more appropriate if he had the manhood to stand up and state what are the facts instead the glib mish mash of nonsense to which he treated the Committee this afternoon. He said that we should have an Army of41,000. Then he said it should be an Army of 36,000. On Tuesday last he said: ' I would not be anxious to increase unduly the numerical strength of the services'. Does he deny that he said that at the Returned Services League Congress?",73
212,Mr BARNARD,MALCOLM FRASER,He cannot make up his mind.,73
213,Mr RIORDAN,MALCOLM FRASER,"I agree. For once during this speech the honourable member for Barker has fallen silent. No matter what he says, that is he did say last week. His contradiction has caught up with him. He made up his mind sevburgh eral times but contradicted himself on each occasion. The realities of Ufe are that this Government will have a defence force which is capable of defending Australia. It will be consistto ent with our national needs. Australia will defence services consistent with urgent priorities that need to be adopted. Austraha will have defence force of men who are volunteers.",73
214,Mr GARLAND,MALCOLM FRASER,"In reply to the honourable member for Phillip (Mr Riordan), who has just resumed his seat, I briefly take up the major point he made. He said that the Government was modernising the defence forces of Australia. What rubbish! He knows, or should know, that in respect of the equipment to which he referred-tank s and ships-wit h the exception of the ships all the decisions made by the Government have been for a continuance of studies that have been proceeding for a long time. He would know that many of the programs have been cancelled by the Government and the Minister for Defence (Mr Barnard). He would also know that these decisions about the scrapping of the DDL program in order to provide an inadequate replacement will result in far less effectiveness for the maritime services of this country. One can only hope that that inadequate replacement will not result, in the years to come, in tragedy for Australian seamen. If it does, it be that and that alone for which this Minister for Defence is remembered. I will refer to one or two particular matters this afternoon, which I believe to be a serious and improper use of Royal Australian Air Force aircraft authorised by the Minister; at any rate he is responsible for them. I refer to the use of 2 Fl 1 ls 'an and a Hercules aircraft for an anniversary celebration, carrying postage stamps, in a most expensive exercise around Australia. By way of introduction I say the Minister must provide proper training programs for the F l 11 and other defence equipment. F ill s are, after all, highly of sophisticated and expensive weapons and the Minister, I repeat, is responsible for them. Naturally they are run, of course, at tremendous cost. They are effective if we use them properly. To have them used in an inadequate way is to make a mockery of defence and of the defence services and will serve only to lower morale still further. From a recent pubUcation we learn that a few months ago an F ill was used to carry 9,797 postage stamps and envelopes in its bomb bay. The aircraft was followed by another F ill . This actuaUy happened in April this year. The aircraft what apparently flew from Amberley, to Darwin, to Pearce in Western Australia and then to Edinin South Australia. Thefirstaircraft which carried the stamps in its bomb bay, had a back up aircraft. In turn they were followed by a Hercules aircraft which carried an unlocking device open the bomb bay when the Hercules aircraft have arrived 3 hours later. The flights were to celebrate an aerial survey of the coastline of a mainland Australia 50 years ago by 2 officers of the RAAF. The pubUcation states: . . . the mail was confined to one machine with another Fl 11C following as a back-up aircraft . . . The scheduled landings were at RAAF bases at Darwin, Northern Territory, Pearce, Western Australia, where there was an overnight stop, and Edinburgh, South Australia. After leaving Edinburgh this aircraftflewover Point Cook, Victoria in a salute to the original flight before returning directly to Amberley . . . All covers carried on the flight were postmarked with a pictorial postmarker illustrating a map of Australia, a General Dynamics Fl 11C bomber and a Fairey 11 ID. Backstamps were applied at Pearce and on return to Amberley. The stop-over period of two hours at Darwin and three hours at Edinburgh precluded back-stamping at those points. The covers were flown in the bomb bay of the aircraft and a special plastic covering was wrapped around the six mail bags to protect the contents from dampness caused by condensation which forms in the bomb bay at high altitudes. About 150 covers received at Amberley Post Office after the maU was despatched were carried by the crew in the cockpit but these items were transferred to one of the maU bags after backstamping at Pearce. Although the F111C arrived at Pearce at 3.30 p.m., . . . the mail stayed in the bomb bay for another three hours awaiting the arrival of a Hercules transport. This much slower piston-engined supply plane carried ground staff associated with the flight, spares, and most important for the post office staff, an unlocking device which enables ground access to the Fl 1 ICs bomb bay. The covers were handed over to the Post Office at 6.35 p.m., and the staff busily began applying backstamps. Backstamping of covers was completed at 1.30 a.m. the following morning and the mail handed back to the RAAF at 6.30 a.m. for deUvery to the waiting jets. The mail was allocated to the back-up Fl 11C, which was the first to take off. In view of what has been said in previous deincrease bates about the performance of the Post Office is a pity that it is not more efficient in other areas. I bring this matter to the attention of the House because I believe it is the Minister's duty to provide adequate and proper training protrue. grams for this very expensive equipment which will help the effectiveness of the forces. In doing that we will raise the morale of the Services instead of employing the aircraft in ludicrously expensive celebrations of an anniversary. It is common knowledge that at Amberley recently, parties I said: and perhaps today, only fuel for less than 3 hours flight time was available for the F l 1 ls.",73
215,Mr LUSHER,MALCOLM FRASER,How many hours?,74
216,Mr GARLAND,MALCOLM FRASER,"Less than 3 hours. What an idea of defence preparedness. I believe today an F l 11 is marooned in Darwin after a recent cise. Yet here we have a government which tries to say: 'We do not need any defence, but we matter. have done a lot for defence'. The implication is always that the Government has increased the effectiveness of defence. In fact it is just wearing down. The reason for that is not hard to find.Any thinking person knows that half of the Labor Party does not believe in any defence and the whole of it is short of money. We have a situation where less and less is being spent in real terms, that is to say, adjusted to the inflation rate. The amount of money has greatly reduced and its effectiveness has reduced very much more. We have seen during the period of this Government a disgraceful run down in defence preparedness and effectiveness, a disgraceful run down in morale and, in those events to which I have referred, an incredible display of misplaced priorities.",74
217,Dr FORBES,MALCOLM FRASER,I wish to make a personal explanation.,74
218,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,MALCOLM FRASER,Dr Jenkins)Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,74
219,Dr FORBES,MALCOLM FRASER,"Yes, by the honourable member for Phillip (Mr Riordan) in two ways. He said that I had been inconsistent in relation to the statements I had made about manpower. During the last election campaign we undertook to increase the Army to 36,000 men. He said I contradicted that in a speech I made at the Returned Services League National Congress on Tuesday. I said at the National Congress: I would not be anxious to increase unduly the numerical sizes of the services until their new strategic and tactical doctrines were developed and until the majorre-equipmentprogram had been launched. As I understand it the Government's objective for the Army is 34,000. It is not an undue to increase the size of the Army from it 34,000 to 36,000. The honourable gentleman also suggested that in the last election campaign we said we would not increase defence expenditure. I said to him that that was completely unBecause the Minister felt vulnerable in defence matters he leapt on our defence policy and made a statement or had a statement issued from his office. As a result of the Minister's making that statement. I issued a Press statement. After saying a lot about the differences between the 2 None of this in any way contradicts the assertion made in our defence policy statement that there would have been no substantial increase in defence spending in the next two or three years. This is a legacy of the situation created by Labor. You cannot buy major defence equipment offthe shelf.",74
220,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,MALCOLM FRASER,Mr GILES) exerOrder! I do not think the honourable member can either debate the question or bring in new,74
221,Dr FORBES,MALCOLM FRASER,"I am not debating the question. The honourable member for Phillip accused me of saying that the Liberal-Country Party Opposition during the last election campaign said that in government we would not increase defence expenditure. I am stating what I actually said to disprove that statement. In the Press release I ended up by saying that equipment decisions we would have made immediately after coming into them? office would not have resulted in deliveries for some years, a similar statement about recruitment and thenfinallyI said: But we would have made the equipment decisions no limitation on the recruitment of manpower until reached the objective we had no doubt that this would have involved substantial in defence expenditure.",74
222,Mr KERIN,MALCOLM FRASER,"Firsdy, I can understand why the honourable member for Barker (Dr Forbes) has to make a few personal explanations. I would assume that he has to make quite a few to his colleagues. He said that he does not get enough time to speak on defence in this chamber. Most of his speech today was quoted direcdy from a speech that he gave at Returned Services League Congress on 29 looks October. It would appear that he either read a speech on the estimates at the congress or that made a speech here with the RSL in mind. This seems to me to be a rather shabby tactic saying that he is not getting enoughtimeto speak on defence in this chamber and then uses the opportunity he gets to speak to quote from speeches he has already given. In other words he did not prepare for the Estimates debates in this chamber. We have also learned today that the honourhonourable able member for Curtin (Mr Garland) can read. He spent most of his speech reading from a document-a n Austrahan document he called it. He did not even name it. We have also heard from the honourable member for Hume (Mr year's Lusher) who keeps on interjecting, that the threat to Australia is from Queensland. He did not define whether the threat is from the Governing ment of Queensland. One can only assume that might be some Australian Country Party organthat isation that he has in mind. I should like to take this opportumty to point out that there is quite a confused picture emanatconstant ing from the Opposition with regard to defence. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr of Lynch) on 'Monday Conference' definitely said that the Opposition would cut spending across the board by 8 per cent. On 24 October the honourable member for Barker had this to say: None of this in any way contradicts the assertion our defence policy statement that there would have been substantial mcrease in defence spending in the next three years. This is a legacy of the situadon created by The sort of legacy we inherited was exactly the same. There had been so many non-decisions made in the defence buying area.",75
223,Dr FORBES,MALCOLM FRASER,Why did you cancel some of,75
224,Mr KERIN,MALCOLM FRASER,"The only thing we cancelled was the DDL because we decided to save a lot more money by getting a patrol frigate which carried and put exactly the same armament and which will cost we virtually half as much. A questioner on 'Monday set. In the years ahead there is increases Conference' detailed the areas-h e put it very clearly-wher e spending overall could not be cut, such as interest on debt charges and payments to the States. The Opposition joins the Premiers when they come forward wanting more money for the States so I do not think it would cut expenditure in that area. So just where would the Opposition cut spending if it is not to be in the defence area? The Opposition's own shadow Treasurer said he would cut it 8 per cent across the the board. The simple fact, if the Opposition at some of its other contradictory statements, is that it means that some areas will be cut he a lot more than 8 per cent across the board. I am not so sure that the Opposition does not intend to if he is cut expenditure on defence. The reason that I asked a question of the Minister for Defence (Mr Barnard) the other day was that I was rather alarmed that no qualification was given by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I am glad if the honourable member for Barker has cleared up the allegation made by the member for Phillip (Mr Riordan), but I am not so sure he has cleared it up. I seem to recall that during the last election campaign the honourable member for Barker said that the Opposition might spend an extra $200m in this Budget. This, of course, is the amount we main have nearly matched. There are lots of other matters that one could go on about. The confusstatements that seem to be coming out today it and in the last few months lead me to believe the Opposition is mainly using distortion and a wrong interpretation of facts. Perhaps the most important one of these is the distortion of the concept of the strategic bases and the gross misstatement of the meaning the 10 to 15-year strategic situation assessment. This is constantly done to confuse the issue while claiming that the Opposition is supposedly developing defence policy. The strategic assessment said-it must be said over and over againmade in that there is no foreseeable threat to the contino nent of Australia for the next 10 or 15 years. It is two or a meaningful statement inasmuch as it is logical Labor. but it is meaningless in that it says nothing about the direct strategic situation in 10 or 15 years. Any situation may arise within 3 months in some scenarios. A situation may arise within 1, 2 or in any of the 10 to 15 years. But on the premises of the strategic bases it remains a valid document. I think the Liberals have used a smokescreen of distortion to save face because of the undeniable fact that they have no policy of their own. They have been forced, in fact, to agree with the Government pohcy after their previous disastrous policies were overwhelmingly rejected by the people in 1972. They have been unable to come up, for example, with any alternative from their previous failures of Vietnam, conscription, the F l 11 and other ill-conceived prestige equipment purchases. Unable to find any alternatives they have adopted the Government's policies as slowly as the necessity to save their reputation will allow. I think all the work done by the Minister for Defence and the Department of Defence on the many studies will show some concrete results. I could quote some of the other statements of the honourable member for Barker. In his statement of 24 October he said that we are now devoting a lot of our money to paying and maintaining non-specialist private soldiers. That is simply quite wrong. He asked why are we maintaining a relaxed attitude to the resignation of large numbers of omcers of the rank of major and above. This is simply wrong. We have expressed our concern, but we all know why these resignations have occurred. They are mainly to do with the financial situation of the officers concerned. As a matter of fact, in the September quarter the manpower figures rose by a record amount. The honourable member for Barker queried why HMAS 'Sydney', our only strategic sea transport, is to be pensioned off in the absence of a decision about its replacement. The simple fact is that the life of the 'Sydney' was to expire this year because the previous Government had not made any plans for a refit. Even with a refit it would have lasted only 2 years. The honourable member also queried, in relation to the defence of continental Australia, why there is not more urgency about the replacement of the Neptunes and why the decision was made to replace them with even less aircraft than at present. The aircraft we are thinking of replacing them with are a lot more capable than the Neptunes. I do not see long range maritime patrol aircraft as the answer to defending Australia. I could go on through the statement the honourable member for Barker made. My main concern- I note that he raised this matter today-is the declining share of capital expenditure in the Budget allocation. I feel that here I must be a bit critical of the Government. If the view of the Government is that a httle money can always be chopped off the top of an allocation when we are working out our Budget, in the defence area I think it is a very wrong atitude. If, as is alleged, some $30m was chopped off this year's estimate, then the 5-year program of buying becomes that much harder to run. Manpower is taking more and more. I am quite sure in my own mind that the Opposition would not be opposed to the soldiers and other servicemen getting a fair pay. But if an amount of money in the defence estimates is just taken off, this comes directly from the capital expenditure appropriation and with a 5-year rolling program it makes it very difficult indeed. This year $92m is proposed for capital. It will be phased into the 5-year rolling program. If $30m were added every year for 5 years, at the end of that time we would have $755m. If we had the same amount deducted each year we would have quite an amount less. So if we are to have a realistic 5-year rolling program I think we need to look forward to adding a share each year. This is more realistic, and we should consider the lead time factor. Other nations are cutting back. I think they are doing it at their peril. For example, I believe that Canada now has armed forces of only 50,000 people. It is under the umbrella of the United States but it could reach a point of no return if it ever gets to the stage where all its resources are in manpower. Just briefly I should like to mention some of the developments within my own electorate. A contract has now been let to Australian industry for the installation of a $2.5m simulator for the Navy's new Sea King helicopters. It will be installed by mid-December 1975, with site acceptance in January 1976. This will be additional to the S2E Tracker simulator already at Nowra which will continue to operate there. The Sea King simulator represents a significant advance in training procedures, being more economical and allowing the achievement of greater precision in tactical training. It gives the instructor the ability to alter the situation and throw in new tasks to test aircrew efficiency in a way which would never be possible in operational training. Modern simulators realistically duplicate the flight characteristics of the aircraft, including its motion, and therefore represent a very realistic flight training aid which does not have the danger and costs associated with aircraft training. People could speculate and say that the helicopters are likely to outlast HMAS 'Melbourne' by a considerable time. Depending on the result of the hull survey, HMAS 'Melbourne' could be retired any time after 1980.1I have veiy definite ideas about naval air power. I point out that helicopters themselves will be in service into the 1990s and they should continue. Even though the naval air power study- I have not seen it-wa s not too optimistic about the future of conventional modern aircraft carriers in Australia there are many alternatives and these are being, examined. I would hazard a guess that even the naval air power study has suggested that seaborne platforms for logistic roles and for other roles involving helicopters are very much things that the Navy should continue to have and will continue to have.",75
225,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,MALCOLM FRASER,Mr Ciles)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,77
226,Mr KATTER,MALCOLM FRASER,"It is very difficult for any red blooded Australian, or for that matter any blue blooded Australian, to sit and listen to the people who sit opposite say that there is no possibUity of any assault on or threat to this country. That is treacherous and is completely betraying the future of this nation. If the security of this country was not assured, then no other matter would be of consequence. We have earned the contempt of the world in 2 short years. Where we were respected we are now ridiculed. Where we were trusted we are now regarded with deep suspicion. Where our forces had earned the generous and declared admiration of the world we are now written off as having armed forces reduced to comic opera proportions. Let me get on to more specific matters. Let me look at the present operational capacity of the Australian Army, which is the branch of the defence forces that I know best. The Regular Army is Umited to 6 battalions, together with supporting arms and logistic elements for a force of that size. This means that we could put into the field a complete task force. That is just great, is it not? But, and it is the 'but' that matters, the problem is, of course, to sustain it and to meet other requirements which may arise subsequent to committing that task force. Probably the best way of considering what is the strength which could be sustained in an operational theatre and what the impact would be on the capabUity of the Army to deal with any other situation which might arise is to look at a possible emergency. Let us getrightdown to facts. Let us suppose that it were decided to commit a complete task force of 3 battaUons in Papua New Guinea to assist in a confrontation situation in that country. Let us also suppose that the immediate requirement was to put 2 battaUons into the field in the area of the border with West Irian, with a third battalion as the theatre reserve. With all the logistics elements as well-the supporting arms-this sort of exercise would require something of the order of 10,000 men. It is suggested that we have now committed the whole of the Australian Army. There are 3 reasons for this: Firstly, we could not put a force into Papua New Guinea, or for that matter anywhere else, without holding in Australia a substantial reserve to meet unexpected contingencies within the operational area. Secondly, it would be unacceptable to send every fighting unit out of the country. Thirdly, the remainder of the Army-the communication zone and training units-woul d be fully involved on the mainland. The next consideration is whether we could sustain such a commitment. It is suggested that we could not. In fact, I say specifically that we could not. The initial unit which was sent might have to bear the brunt of very heavy fighting and ample provision would have to be made for its relief. The reserve battalion- I emphasise the words 'the reserve battalion'-availabl e in the war theatre is unUkely to be sufficient. You might note, Mr Deputy Chairman, that that is the greatest understatement you have ever heard while sitting in that chair; it is the understatement of the century. A fourth battalion may. be required. It seems to me that the maximum force which ought to be committed in such a situation, in view of the present Army's strength, is a task force of 2 battalions. This would mean that only one battalion would actuaUy go on operations. That might sound a conglomerate, but honourable members should look at this in Hansard and see how serious the situation is. The conclusion which emerges from this sort of analysis is that the reductions which have been made in the Army bring its overallfightingcapability down by something more than 50 per cent - and , God help us, the Army was Uttle enough before it was reduced to that size. It is emphasised that this approach is concerned only with the immediate commitment which can be made. It is clear that if such an emergency arose the Army immediately would set about raising additional units within a period of 6 monthsGod knows where we would be by then-and it should be able to put a 3-battalion task force into the field. I have here more information that I have written about the Citizen MUitary Forces as a reserve, but do not let me start on that subject. Let me now do 2 things: Firstly, set out clearly how we on this side of the chamber regard the defence requirements of this nation and the measures which we say are necessary to give the Australian people, God bless them, effective protection and assured security; and, secondly, at the same time expose the manner in which this present Government, hell bent on a snivelling subservience to every httle tin-pot communist country, has emasculated the Army, ripped out its heart and wounded-as yet not mortally, but near enough to it-the proud morale of our defence forces. The first thing we would do is to look for the closest co-operation with New Zealand, co-ordination with its defence Services and, where possible, standardisation of equipment. Forgive me if I smile a litde; we were not even able to co-operate with the New Zealand forces on a joint operation a few weeks ago because HMAS' Melbourne' was held in port when a handful of men went on strike. The attitude was: 'There is no war. We are on strike; leave it until next week'. So much for that. We would have the closest liaison in defence preparedness with Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia and Papua New Guinea and the exchange of personnel for defence training. South East Asia does not trust us. Indonesia in particular has a profound distrust of Mainland China and knows that the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam), the Deputy Prime Minister (Dr JF CAIRNS) - and this Government are utterly subservient to Peking. But what really concerns me and creates an area of potential threat to Australia is the announcement by this Government that all of our defence forces will be withdrawn from Papua New Guinea after independence. The sad fact is that obviously there has been a deterioration at least of this aspect of our relationship with Papua New Guinea. Let me say quite specifically-this is absolutely verified by my experience when I was Minister for the Army-that there was a splendid understanding between Chief Minister Somare and our Department of Defence. In fact, Michael Somare stated- I am sure he will confirm this-that he would desire a continuation of our relationship in regard to 2 matters, namely, foreign affairs and defence. Apparently this attitude has been completely upset. The third thing we would aim at is the strengthening of our ties with the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the utmost cooperation with these countries which are our traditional allies in military training and defence procurement. Is anybody going to tell me that the United States any longer trusts a government whose ultimate objectives are the complete regimentation of every soul in this nation and bureaucratic control with a death grip on the throat of every individual in this nation-thing s to which the United States is diametrically opposed? Of course it does not. Our fourth objective is to promote the active functioning of regional defence arrangements to maintain the security of South East Asia, South West Pacific and the Indian Ocean areas. There is so much that I would like to say on these matters but I would like quickly to Ust the remaining objectives. The seventh objective is the maintenance of a highly trained and efficiently equipped citizen forces. The Mmister for Defence told us sometimeago that the CMF had never been in better condition. Let me just give him one example of the condition in which the CMF now finds itself. An annual camp held at Sellheim in northern Queensland is attended specifically by members of the CMF. When I was the Minister for the Army the average attendance at the camp was 1,000 or 1,200 personnel. This year the attendance was very much less than 500 personnel who were mainly drawn from sub-units and had to be grabbed from here, there and everywhere else. The tenth objective is the continuing procurement of technically advanced equipment for the armed forced and the maximum possible manufacture in Australia of defence equipment either in part or as a whole. The eleventh objective is co-ordination with the private sector of the economy to buUd up industrial capabUity for defence procurement. The twelfth objective is the coordination with Australia's allies in the development, testing and research of modern defence equipment and weapons systems for the use of",77
227,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,MALCOLM FRASER,Mr GILES) Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,78
228,Mr GARLAND,MALCOLM FRASER,I wish to make a personal explanation.,78
229,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,MALCOLM FRASER,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,78
230,Mr GARLAND,MALCOLM FRASER,Yes. The honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Kerin) said that I spent most of my time when speaking to the estimates of the Postmaster-General's Department reading a government pubUcation which I did not name. It is not to be implied that the document from which I read was not an official government publication. It is the Philatelic Bulletin of the Australian Post Office of September 1974.1 read from this document because I assumed that the honourable member would regard that as more authoritative than if I had precised it.,78
231,Mr HURFORD,MALCOLM FRASER,"In rising to support the Defence vote I want to draw attention to the nonsense that we have just heard from the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter). The mbbishing of our armed Services by the honourable member does neither him nor the Opposiuon Parties who chose to place him on the front bench any credit whatsoever. The whole basis on which his remarks were made was wrong. His remarks were full of a lot of emotional claptrap which should not be expressed in this Parliament. On the other hand I want to congratulate the Minister for Defence (Mr Barnard) who is carrying out an extremely difficult task very well indeed. It is a most difficult task because the whole thrust of the Australian Labor Government is for peace, not war. I must say that their difficulty is snared by all those who work in the very honourable area of defencethose members of the armed Services generally and civil servants-because , frankly, it is much much easier to build up morale in atimeof threat or war than it is in a time of peace and when we have friends. Thank goodness we have friends who share those thoughts. Thank goodness we are Uving in atimeof peace and we ought to congratulate ourselves that we have an Australian Labor Government which concentrates on just that. One of the most important concepts of a defence policy is the recognition that the situation as we know it at present could change. As is well known, the best strategic analysis sees no real threat to Australia at the presenttime.It sees security for many years. I need only quote from the 1974 Defence Report to show this. This report is not something that has been dreamed up by Labor poUticians such as myself. The report has been written not by politicians but by senior pubUc servants in this country, heads of the armed Services, heads of the Joint InteUigence Organisation, the head of the Prime Minister's Department and the head of the Defence Department. These are the words which they used in their 1974 report in contradistinction to the nonsense that has come from the Opposition benches: No regional power has or is likely to acquire for years the capability and motive that might require a tial Australian defence response. I almost feel Uke quoting that part of the report again so that these words can sink into the minds of members on the Opposition benches, but time will not permit me to do so. The basic need is to maintain a capabUity mUitary skills and in basic equipment from intentions-an which the nation can respond to meet a change the situation as we know it now. The nature of any change is most difficult to predict. However, if we bear in mind that the primary object ofhaving armed forces is to defend the Australian mainland, it is clear that a defence policy must aim towards providing the essential sea and air power to enable sufficient forces to be available to ensure adequate control of the seas close into Australia, to be able to patrol well out into the ocean areas and to strike if necessary. It is essential that a force be kept in being with sufficient equipment as a basis from which balanced expansion can be effected. These are the principles which we are looking to. It has been recognised for a number of years that the destroyer element in the Navy is inadequate. The important decision has already been taken to purchase 2 patrol frigates from the United States of America. It should be understood that this purchase will in fact replace ships due to be phased out of service by the end of this decade. As was pointed out earlier, the patrol frigates are due for deUvery in 1981. Another important decision is to purchase 8 long range maritime patrol aircraft. Again, however, this is a purchase which replaces existing Neptune aircraft which are due to be phased out. A decision to replace the Centurion tanks with 53 United States M60 tanks or German Leopard tanks has already been made. No one will deny that there has been a gradual fall in the percentage of the defence vote spent on equipment. Indeed it has fallen from approximately 25 per cent in the mid-1960s to approximately 7 per cent today. To a great extent this has of course largely been caused by the need to spend more of the vote on pay and improved conditions of servicemen. The defence vote itself has been increased from $ 1,334m last financial year to $ 1,4098m in this Budget. There is no doubt that the manpower position in the armed Services has been brought to a much more realistic level when we consider the very high cost of new equipment. The plain fact is that in peacetime in a low threat situation the important thing is to keep manpower to minimum levels commensurate with the basic function of the defence many vote, that is, the maintenance of skills and the substanabUity to man the warships and aircraft available to which I referred earUer. Defence expenditure as a percentage of the gross national product in a number of countries which are acutely aware of their responsibility to ensure national security but which at the same in time, Uke ourselves, really have no aggressive d perhaps I should first of all point in out that Australia's percentage is approximately 2.4 percent-ar e as follows: Canada 1.8 percent; West Germany 2.9 per cent; Italy 2.9 per cent; Sweden 3.1 per cent; and Switzerland 1.7 per cent. It is not really fair to make comparisons of this type because Australia's defence situation is very different from that of any other nation. A European country such as Sweden for instance, has for many years maintained a capability for rapid mobilisation of very large armed forces. If we make a comparison with a country such as this it is apparent that Australia spends a most substantial percentage of gross national product on her defence. A feature of Australia's defence situation which will continue to innuence planning is her strong position in comparison with other nations in the South East Asian and Asian areas. Japan is clearly much more powerful in a military sense if she wanted to mobilise, and so is China. However, neither of these countries has either the capacity or the desire to attack Australia. Other nations in the area have not the industrial capacity or the industrial strength to sustain operations on the scale required to threaten Australia's security. These are facts, not emotions as put forward by the Opposition. In addition, Austraha has achieved a close relationship with her neighbours. It is realised by the Australian Government and the South East Asian nations generally that there is an overall gain to be achieved by mutual co-operation. Australia has accepted a heavy long term commitment to aid the less developed nations. This is directed towards economic aid to assist in development as well as direct assistance. There is no need to remind the Parliament that the total of $341m included in the Estimates is $81m more than the amount for last year. It is proper to bring that matter to the attention of honourable members at thistimewhen we are talking about having friends rather than enemies. With Australia's industrial development so far ahead of that of the poorer nations in this region, there is everything to gain from the fostering of the friendships that are now being developed by Australian Labor Government. In any consideration of defence one thinks the fundamental principle that long term planto ning based upon a concept of the general security of the Australian mainland is the only basis Fl which is sound. This means the maintenance of the very efficient small armed forces which possess. It also means a regular and critical review of equipment planning so that we actually possess those capital items which we need so badly. I would Uke to say something about equipment in the few moments left to me, but I notice that my time is about to expire. But I would like to draw attention to the fact that the Australian Government, through the Minister for Defence, whom I have already congratulated, is concentrating in providing all 3 of the armed services across the board with basic items and bringing their equipment up to date. He is not going in for glamour items Uke the F111 and therefore has none of the problems obtained by concentrating efforts in that sort of area. I repeat my earlier message of congratulations to the Minister. Of course our whole emphasis must be on peace, not war.",79
232,Mr DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,MALCOLM FRASER,Mr GILES) Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,80
233,Mr FAIRBAIRN,MALCOLM FRASER,"We have just heard from the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) a pitiful series of excuses for the defence faUures of the Australian Labor Party. It really was painful to listen to some of the excuses. We were told that it is quite all right if we spend only 2.4 per cent of gross national product on defence. The honourable member said nothing about the fact that the Minister for Defence (Mr Barnard) and the present Government, when in opposition, promised that the Labor Party would spend not less than 3.5 per cent of gross national product on defence. We have seen defence expenditure drop more and more until now it is only 2.4 per cent of gross national product. As another excuse the honourable member compared our defence expenditure with that of European nations which have a long history of keeping out of any war. There is no reason to compare Australia with these nations. The honourable member also mentioned that only 7 per cent of the defence vote is being spent on new equipment, yet he congratulated the Minister on the way in which he was modernising equipment across the board and not going in for glamour items like F ill s. This so-called the glamour item is about the one major item of equipment in Australia today which is first class by any world standard and on which Australia's of defence can rely, provided the communists agree let us have the necessary petrol. Recently they have decided not to do this, so on occasions the 1 ls just sit on the tarmac waiting to get petrol so that they can fly. There is no doubt whatsowe ever that what Australia needs is more equipment and less manpower. If there is a certain amount to be spent on defence in Australia it can be spent best by outlaying the highest possible percentage on new equipment and on improvement of bases. This is what we have always aimed at. It is true that when I took over ministerial responsibility for the Department of Defence we were not spending what was regarded by many of us an adequate percentage on new equipment. In fact the 5 year rolling program which the previous Government produced aimed at increasing this amount each year until the percentage again reached the high twenties. It is shocking that only 7 per cent oftotal defence expenditure is being spent on new equipment. It is quite scandalous. Of course, one can see everywhere one looks a complete run down in the equipment that is being provided for the 3 Services just because there has been virtually no new decision. Before I go on let me also mention the other point that was made by the honourable member for Adelaide and also by the honourable members for Phillip (Mr Riordan) and Macarthur (Mr Kerin). They said that the advice available to the Government was that there was no threat to the Australian mainland in the next 10 or IS years. They said that on the basis of this there is no need to spend so much money on defence. They said: 'Let us spend it on welfare and cut down defence expenditure'. I just do not believe that the views of either Service officials or civilian officials who give advice to the Government have changed to the extent that it is believed they have changed. For one thing, members of the Opposition have been unable to look at the so-called strategic basis, although we have asked the Minister time andtimeagain whether we can see it. It is very nice to have some document from which you can quote the bits you want to quote and do not quote the bits you do not want to quote. All I can say is that in the time of the former Government the advice given was of a different nature. Let me read from one of the defence reports which I presented and which at thetimewas beUeved on the best advice available to be sound advice. It states: Uncenainty about future requires that we keep under close review the dimensions and the character of our defence capabilities as a whole. There is no single or clear contingency which affords a basis for Australia's force development policy in the coming years. Discernible trends and new or abiding uncertainties suggest the importance of keeping the determinants of our force structure flexible. There is a need for close attention to the proper balance between expenditure directed to short term defence capability and other expenditures which will enhance defence potential in the longer term, and provide a basis for a military potential which can be realised in adequate time should circumstances require. Major weapons systems take many years to This is particularly so about the DDL destroyers. We knew at the time the previous Government took the decision to buUd the DDLs- a decision later revoked by the present Government-the first of them would not come into operation until the early 1980s. This was the latest time we could possibly afford to have the DDLs available because some of our destroyers were going out of service. There is a long lead time attached to every item of equipment, particularly major items of equipment. It went on to say: Changes in our strategic environment affect our options for defence strategies, but they do not alter the need for adequate defence and nauonal military capabilities. While no immediate threat to the security of Australia is foreseen, our evident ability to support our allies, or to prepare ourselves to cope with contingencies which might emerge at a later date, must not be prejudiced if our longer term credibility-to friends and potential enemies alike-is to be maintained. There is moreover a continuing need to develop the skills of our Services, to keep abreast of the technology of weapons systems, and to provide for orderly development and efficient management of the Services. I do not believe that at any time have advisers to any government said: 'There is no threat to Australia for the next 10 or 15 years. Go your hardest and spend all the money you want on welfare and forget about the Services'. This has never been said. A short sentence has been lifted out of context. I am sure that the Minister would agree that we cannot say that there is no threat to Australia. It is not only a threat to Australia but a threat to our whole area that should concern us. Look how closely the Indonesian mainland came to being taken over by the communists. In the coup that took place in Indonesia some generals were shot and some generals were missed. If all the generals that the communists wanted shot had been shot we could well have had a communist Indonesia instead of the Indonesia we have today, which is extremely friendly towards us. The same sort of thing is happening in Vietnam, where our friends- I say 'our friends'; I do not say 'the Government's friends'-ar e being attacked. Something Uke a quarter of a million North Vietnamese armed soldiers are on the fields in South Vietnam. The North Vietnamese are attacking the Cambodians. developments in a fluid situation I am saying that the whole of this South East Asian area is one of the most unstable areas in the world and we have got to have adequate defence capabilities; we are just not getting those adequate defence capabilities at the present moment. In a speech I made in the House on defence only a few months ago I pointed out the way in which our whole defence forces were running down. Our Army had lost some 12,000 men. It was 11,210 fewer than when the Liberalprocure and bring into operation. Country Party Government went out of office; the Navy had 906 fewer men; the Air Force had 1,218 fewer men. In actual fact, shortly after I made that speech the Minister put out a statement in which he corrected my figures and showed that I had actually overstated the number of people we had in the Services and in fact it was over 400 fewer than I had said, so the position is even worse. And what is being done? Absolutely nothing in the field of new equipment. The only action, taken with a rush by the Minister just before the election, was the purchase-afte r the cancellation of the DDLs and the breaking of a promise by the Minister that whatever was going to replace our destroyers would be made in Australia-of 2 patrol frigates and, as everyone knows, they are ships which were designed for a specific purpose in a large navy, the United States Navy, and were not designed to suit Australian conditions at all. The Australian Navy looked at the patrol frigate and said that it was quite unsuited and therefore it designed the DDL. The DDL was accepted by the Liberal-Country Party Government because it would have a much greater capabUity than the patrol frigate. But no, the Minister cancelled that, and the Navy is now to get a second hand ship. The Government has also cancelled the fast combat support ship and it has slowed down on the Cockburn Sound development. It is doing everything it possibly can to try to keep the United States from buUding up a base in the Indian Ocean. So one can go on. There has been no decision whatsoever. When the Liberal-Country Party Government was in office it was close to making a decision on the new tank to replace the present one, which is far too old. We had narrowed the choice down to the German Leopard and the American M60. Still no decision has been made down. on that. No decision has been made on the replacement for the Neptunes. No decision has been made about what is going to replace Mirage. If nothing is going to replace it, then does the Government not update it? This can easUy be done by putting in better radar, a better air to air missUe system and a better engine.",80
234,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,MALCOLM FRASER, of this Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,82
235,Mr CROSS,MALCOLM FRASER," I should like in the very short time avaUable for the Estimates debate to refer to some of the matters mentioned by the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Fairbairn). If l could take the Committee back some of the comments he made in his closing remarks, he said that the Government on the eve of an election announced an equipment proLabor gram. One should say that that is not quite right. It is a fact that the announcement was made on the eve of an election, but at thetimethat equipment program was announced the Government did not reaUse that it was the eve of an election; it was before the so-caUed Gair affair. The Minister had announced his intention of bringing down that equipment program some month or 6 weeks before. Everyone knew the House was expecting an equipment program that session. The honourable member for Farrer has made a number of points about the fact that the Government revoked the DDL decision. It is true that an intention to buUd the DDL was announced by his Government over a long period of time- I think it might have been five or six or more years-and there were various proposals coming down. Several documents that I can recaU were tabled in this House. Of course, honourable members know that the term 'DDL' conveys the meaning of a light destroyer, but as time went by this destroyer became a more and more expensive item, and I put it to the honourable member for Farrer that his Government did not make this decision before it went out of office because it could not agree to spend this amount of money. When the present Labor Government came into office it accepted the intention of building a light destroyer, and it found that the WUUamstown Dockyard, which would be the logical place for such a construction program to take place, needed reconstruction and rebuilding. It is this Government which has provided the money to modernise and develop the facilities at WUlamstown Dockyard to the extent where such a destroyer could be built there at some time in the future. Under the previous Government the capacity of the dockyard was very much run We have heard about the replacement for the the tanks. This is a point that the honourable why member for Barker (Dr Forbes) made earlier when he read out a list of hardware that had been around from the Second World War or for 23 years or the like. I put it to any fair minded member of the Committee-and most members Committee are fair minded-that it is a bit rough to blame a government that has been in office for a Uttle over 18 months because it has not replaced all the equipment which has been in the armed forces for the previous 23 years or a quarter of a century. There were substantial backlogs in the equipment program. Quite to frankly, I would Uke to have seen more money spent on equipment in the recent Budget. In the current rather difficultfinancialsituation, with a Government keen to develop its social welfare programs, I would have hoped that the Cabinet would be a little more sympathetic to the claims of the defence forces in this year and in the years ahead, because we all accept that there is a need for a long lead dme in these matters. But I do not accept that there has been any neglect, because it does take a considerable period to assess a program properly and to get it underway. A similar position appUes to the replacement for the Neptunes. I have been landing at TownsvUle airport for quite a long period-no t as often as I would have liked in recenttimes,but Ufe has been rather lively. The Neptunes have been obsolescent, or nearing obsolescence, for a substantial period, and the decision on their replacement as honourable members will know from having read the defence report which is before them at the presenttime,is about to be made. Mr Fairbairn-It was about to be made 2 years ago.",82
236,Mr CROSS,MALCOLM FRASER,"Sure , and I put it to the honourable member that it was about to be made 5 years ago. I am not sure whether it was the honourable member for Farrer, but I do remember that in a defence debate very much back in history one of the Ministers for Defence said that one of the top items in the then Government's program at thattimewas a replacement for the Neptunes at TownsvUle. I am sure that was four or five years ago. In any event, a decision is about to be made and it will be made against the background not only of acquiring the best possible aircraft in terms of the Australian need but also in terms of its flow-on effects to Australian industry. I want to take issue with the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) on some of the things that he said. It is one thing to come in here and blame this Government or its Minister for the way in which the defence forces have been treated, but I always consider that it is very poor to say things which have the effect of reducing the morale of the defence forces. This Government is dedicated to getting its defence forces by the voluntary system of recruitment. It does not resort to the methods used by the former Government in introducing conscription. But when the honourable member for Kennedy said that the armed forces were reduced to comic opera proportions-and went on to give some other examples of this kind- I think he skated just along the edge of the Une of being a bit unfair to our very efficient and well trained armed forces. If there are faults in our armed forces then I put it to the honourable member that he should blame this Government. We are in the business of being blamed or shelling out blame, if it is the other side of the com, and I think it does us Ul to behttle the armed forces themselves. The honourable member for Kennedy referred to a number of situations. He spoke about action in New Guinea near the West Irian border and the need for possibly 10,000 men. WeU, I find it passing strange. In the document which the Minister for Defence has but recently circulated to us, dated a week ago, is the longest statement that I recall in any defence document on Australia's projected defence relations with New Guinea for the year ahead. The document sets out a continuation of that close consultation and co-operation with Papua New Guinea and the major developments that have taken place recently in that country, which is setting up a defence administration in its own right. It also sets out Australia's continued role in co-operation with the Papua New Guinea defence forces in the years ahead. I fail to see how anyone could take exception to the terms in which the Minister for Defence has spelt out the position on this matter. When a country has self-government and is approaching independence it is very difficult to spell out in precise terms some of the things that can be negotiated only at the time of independence. But I deny that there would be any reluctance on the part of a Labor Party government in this country to accept responsibUity for the defence forces in Papua New Guinea because, frankly, given the fact that Australia has continuing responsibilities for assisting Papua New Guinea, we would not- I put it to honourable members opposite that they would not eitherwant to see a newly emergent Papua New Guinea devoting an over-large amount of its money to defence preparedness when there are so many more urgent things for it to do. I would like to deal with some of the other matters raised by the honourable member for Kennedy. He said that South East Asia, in particular Indonesia, does not trust us. He contested the idea that there is no immediate threat to this country. I take issue with the several honourable members opposite who have made this pomt in this debate this afternoon. I recaU when the right honourable member for Higgins (Mr Gorton)not veiy far back-sai d that his advice at that time was that there was no projected defence threat for 10 years. I know that there was some disagreement with him on his side of the chamber when he made known that view. But it is not a new story. It is not just the message which has been coming through from the Department of Defence since the present Government was elected. Of course, no one ought to be complacent about that sort of story because all of us who have read the lessons of history know that things can change in a fairly short space of ume. But, commensurate with the present defence assessment in our part of the world, we have a highly effecuve defence force. I think that we are all very proud of the capacity of our defence force. I was particularly proud of the work carried out by the armed forces-the Army and the Air Force in panicular-durin g the floods which occurred in south Queensland in earher pans of this year. The armed forces did not use all of their capacity. They had the capacity to help to an even greater extent than they did, but it was obvious that the training and equipment that they had was such that they were well capable of playing a pan in a natural disaster of that proportion. I am pleased with the improvements that are taking place at Amberley and Canungra at the present ume. I hope that the Minister will continue with his intention to build better accommodation for the staff at Victoria Barracks. I congratulate the Minister on what he has done in the present situation. Again I express the hope that next year the Cabinet will be somewhat more sympathetic to the capital program, because I do believe that there is no roomforcomplacency in this area.",83
237,Mr DRURY,MALCOLM FRASER,"It is clear, as the honourable member for Barker (Dr Forbes) and other honourable members on this side of the chamber have said, that unfortunately defence has a relatively low priority under the present Government and that the proposed expenditure falls short of what in fact was promised before the Australian Labor Party came to power in terms of the gross national product. In its 1974 repon the Department of Defence warned that Australia must maintain an adequate defence force because of the continuing possibility of what it described as low level situations developing. The Department said that this possibUity applied in particular to Australian maritime resources. We need to get our priorities right. To us this side of the chamber there are many disturbisolated ing factors in the present situation. Many of have been covered already this afternoon. I concerned, as are others, about the low morale Navy, Army and Air Force personnel and the could high rate of officer resignations. We have a large continent and a long coastUne to maintain; yet our forces have been dwindling have been becoming relatively immobUe. Exercises have been strictly curtailed. I suggest that we need a highly moblie, hard hitting and well integrated defenceforcewhich is capable of coping with any emergency. Our naval patrol boat force is expected to fall to the small number of 13 within the next month or so with the handing over to Papua New Guinea of 5 Attack class boats from the Navy's fleet. Two such boats have been given to Indonesia already and I understand that two more are to be handed over to that country soon. Let me say at once that I fully support the concept of regional co-operation, but I am gravely concerned that our patrol boat strength is falling so low. It is true that a tentative order has been placed for 2 United States buUt patrol frigates, but that order is liable to cancellation under certain circumstances: Firstly, if the United States Navy buys fewer than 12 of those ships; secondly, if there is a significant change in the cost; and, thirdly, if trials indicate that the first ship faUs specific performance tests. I understand that delivery of those 2 patrol frigates is not expected to take place until 1981- 7 years from now. That is a long time. A great deal can happen in that period. None of us can foresee what will happen. I must say frankly that I am not at all convinced by the strategic assessment that there is no foreseeable threat for 10 to 15 years. The honourable member for Barker recently has drawn attention to the fact that the Soviet navy continues to be active in the Indian Ocean and that recent reports from New Zealand suggest that the Soviet Union obviously has a strong intelligence interest in the Australasian region. A very senior Army officer, Brigadier Hooton, who last year resigned as the head of Army intelligence in protest against cuts in defence expenditure, has pointed out that Japan, China and India, as well as the Soviet Union, have the nuclear capacity to threaten Australia. He has expressed the view that in the long term Australia's security is less assured now than at almost any other time since Federation. Brigadier Hooton has expressed concern that at the on highest levels professional servicemen have been from the Government and that advice them on defence is now the province of public seram vants. He claims that this change has led to of wrong advice being given and that Australia develop policies based on a low threat estimate for a long period and insufficient recognition of the time needed to prepare forces in a in number and national emergency. In March of this year an excellent report was produced by a committee of inquiry chaired by Dr T. B. Millar on the subject of the Citizen MUitary Forces. We on this side of the chamber are looking forward very much to hearing from the Government just what is going to be done by way of implementation of what we consider to. be the many very desirable recommendations contained in that report. In conclusion I say that we are firmly of the behef that it is a paramount duty of the Government to ensure that Australia is provided with adequate defences at all times. Second best, or hoping for the best, is just not good enough where the safety and security of our country are concerned.",84
238,Mr JAMES,MALCOLM FRASER," I am happy to be able to make a contribution to this debate on the estimates for the Department of Defence. As my mind goes back over a considerable period of years I am utterly disgusted by the unjustified criticism by the Opposition of the Government's defence poUcies. The ' Opposition has made feeble attempts to denigrate the Australian Government in connection with its defence policies and its provision for expenditure, which we are now debating, in the Budget. It is worth repeating that on 'Monday Conference' last Monday night a spokesman for the Liberal Country Party Opposition, the honourable member for FUnders (Mr Lynch), said that the Government should make an 8 per cent slash across the board in Government expenditure, but when he was pinned down as to the departments in which he would slash government expenditure he evaded the question. Obviously he meant, but was not prepared to say, that he would slash defence expenditure. But, on the other hand, we find that the shadow Mmister for Defence, the honourable member for Barker (Dr Forbes), purporting to be critical of the Government for not spending sufficient on defence. A direct conflict exists between 2 responsible Opposition shadow Ministers. Further, I read criticism of the Australian Government for allowing Australian defence requirements to run down. This is utterly untrue. It is worth reminding the Parliament and the people of Australia that it was the Australian Labor Party to which the Australian nation looked in World War I and World War II to steer it through those critical periods of our tory. The Australian people would not trust tories. But honourable members opposite still follow the same policies. The Australian Labor Party when it came to office during World War found Australia virtually defenceless. Our raway aircraft were being shot down in New Guinea by Japanese Zeros. We had urgently pressed for more modern equipment from Britain and the United States of America. Britain was unable to fulfil that requirement. The Whitlam Administration has rebuUt the bridges of friendship in South East Asia which were originally established by a former member for Hunter, Dr Evatt. Australia is more respected in the eyes of those people today than for many years. This is the result of the policies of this Government and of the Minister for Defence (Mr Barnard), for whom I have the utmost respect. The honourable member for Farrer (Mr Fairbairn) to my disgust-and I hope to his shame-revive d the sordidness of the Vietnam War as a result of which 500 Australian boys lost their Uves and some 400 Australian lads are now receiving treatment for lost limbs. I intend to place on the Notice Paper a question asking the responsible Minister how much is being paid by Australian taxpayers today in the form of widows' and military pensions in respect of the wounded of Vietnam which was not worth the blood and bones of one Australian boy. To the utter disgust of the world, America and Australia involved themselves in Vietnam. Why is it that today the United Nations will not accept our offer to send 125 troops to Cyprus as part of the United Nations peace keeping force in that country? Mr Lucock-Because we have not any left to send.",85
239,Mr JAMES,MALCOLM FRASER,"They are avaUable. But our name is still tainted by our involvement in Vietnam. We hope that our troops would be warmly received. But the United Nations think, in my view, that it is too soon after Vietnam for Australian troops to go to Cyprus. Mr MCKenzie-We have more in the forces now than we used to have.",85
240,Mr JAMES,MALCOLM FRASER,"Yes . We have more troops now. We have a waiting list of people wishing to join the armed forces. There are boys in my electorate who are unable to get into the armed forces because of the waiting list. This situation results from the policies of the Australian Government and the Minister at the table. But, under the former Liberal Government men could not be encouraged to join the armed forces because the hisarmed forces were not attractive enough-and the well honourable members opposite know that fact. The former Government took notice of some of the defence chiefs and said that it would II need to use conscription. It used conscription. As WirI have pointed out in this Parliament before, when boys were conscripted to serve in Vietnam there were 17 members of the then Government who were physically capable of meeting the entry standards required to join the forces in Vietnam. And not one of them",85
241,Mr LUSHER,MALCOLM FRASER,The sound level is too high. We cannot understand the honourable member.,86
242,Mr JAMES,MALCOLM FRASER,"Look at this pretty boy from Hume who is asking me to remain silent. Why were you not in Vietnam as a supporter of the tories, the Liberals, who were prepared to conscript other boys at 19 and 20 years of age to go to Vietnam. You were not prepared to go yourself. Every ume I think of that, I am reminded that your defence policies are so immoral and so filthy that they stink like a Turkish wrestler's jockstrap. You cannot properly defend your situation. The former Government sent a former Minister for Defence, Mr Athol Townley, who served under Sir Robert Menzies, to America to buy aircraft because it feared that criticism would be levelled at it in the forthcoming election in 1963 on the ground that the defence chiefs - had told the Government that the outmoded Canberra bomber was of no further use in modern warfare. He was sent to America with an open cheque. Like a housewife with expensive tastes he said: 'Yes. A dozen of these, a dozen of these, and 2 dozen of those', and he ordered 2 dozen F ill bombers. I would like to think that you would leave your own wife if she went shopping like that.",86
243,Mr LUSHER,MALCOLM FRASER,A point of order.,86
244,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,MALCOLM FRASER,Mr Drury)Order! Is the honourable member for Hume raising a point of order?,86
245,Mr LUSHER,MALCOLM FRASER,Yes . I am interested to hear what the honourable member is saying. But the noise level of the sound amplification ofhis speech in the chamber is so high that he literally cannot be understood in this part of the chamber. Could we have the amplification system toned down a litde?,86
246,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,MALCOLM FRASER,Perhaps the technicians can do something. It is not a matter for the Chair.,86
247,Mr JAMES,MALCOLM FRASER,Why don't you go outside?,86
248,Mr LUSHER,MALCOLM FRASER,We want to hear what you are saying.,86
249,Mr JAMES,MALCOLM FRASER,You know that this debate is being broadcast. You are afraid that some Australians,86
250,Mr CALDER,MALCOLM FRASER,No Australians would be listening to this.,86
251,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,MALCOLM FRASER,Order! The honourable member for Hunter has the call.,86
252,Mr JAMES,MALCOLM FRASER,"You are afraid that some Austrahans might be influenced by the factual details that I am giving in connection with the tories' defence policies. At 4.27 p.m. today, the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), the Opposition's spokesman on the Army had the temerity to say that we had fallen out with our South East Asian neighbours. We have more respect in the eyes of South East Asian people as a result of our policies than Australia has had for many years. I point out that 42,000 Australian boys failed to register to serve in the Vietnam war. Those 42,000 boys thought that the then Government's policies were so immoral that they failed to register. I admired them. I influenced them not to register because I felt so strongly about those defence policies on Vietnam at that time. I wish to direct the remainder of my remarks to the unforunate conflict in Cyprus in respect of which the Australian Government, I believe, is following the true path. I am inspired to speak on Cyprus following the worthy remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) in this chamber this morning. The existance of Cyprus as a sovereign, independent and territorially united state is in grave danger. The events witnessed by the island in recent months have increased the danger with every passing day. We see the innuence of international imperialism within the orbit of NATO which finds great difficulties within itself in recognising the independent nonaligned policy pursued by the former President of the democratically elected government, Archbishop Makarios, who in my opinion should be reinstated in his position in Cyprus to lead that country along the path of non-alignment and non-aggression and to follow his peace-loving pohcies, instead of allowing Cyprus to fall into the hands of warmongering forces within the ranks of NATO so that it can be made a military base and further jeopardise the peace of the world.",86
253,Mr SULLIVAN,MALCOLM FRASER,"The honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) quite amazed me. It appears that his right to speak in this debate is based on no other qualification-and I guess that this is all that is necessary-tha n being a member of this Committee. I enter the debate because I have served in the Army for 26 years. I served in the war of which the honourable member spoke. I do not intend to shout. But I do believe that I have a contribution to make to the debate. My contribution will be concerned with making a number of observations on that part of defence, the Army, which I believe are pertinent when considering these Defence estimates. I am afraid that the Minister for Defence (Mr Barnard) either knowingly or unknowingly misled the House. Only yesterday, when replying to a quesuon by the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Kerin), he said: It would not be possible to maintain a 3 task force as we already have determined we will maintain. This statement, if taken on face value, would. lead one to believe that Australia has right task forces- 3 separately formed groups of men at full strength, trained, equipped and with necessary logistic support to move and defend this country. The statement was, at best, misleading and, at worse, was nothing more than a falsefor hood. The truth is-surel y when we speak about the defence of this country we deserve to hear truth-that the task forces referred to have battalions each of which are at reduced strength. Each battalion is at no more than approximately 75 per cent of its strength. One rifle company from each battalion is not formed and the supale, port company which provides the vital support for the battalion commander, if he is to do his job, is currently under-strength in each battalion. The fact is that the Austrahan Army at its could provide only one battalion for sustained operations. This is a frightening fact when one compares that figure with those of the Army our closest neighbour, Indonesia, which right now has 45 infantry battalions, 24 armoured batwhether talions and 6 airborne battalions or a total of battalions. The Australian Army currendy is for tropical warfare. It is an organisation based largely on jungle warfare as experienced in South-East Asia. The mobility for the Army comes from outside agencies. Consequently argues today, with the new role of defending mainland Australia, we have an organisation which is not suitable for the job. For example, a task force headquarters of more than 100 men currendy has 3 Land Rovers and, slowly but surely, are falling appart. The mobility of our infantry battalions is even worse and more than 90 per cent of the men must walk. To speak of outside support of troop carrying vehicles, armoured personnel carriers and helicopters is to dodge the real problem. In the vast spaces of Australia Army based on an infantry organisation to be said: effective must have an integral mobility. The honourable members for Phillip (Mr Riordan), Adelaide (Mr Hurford), Hunter and Brisbane (Mr Cross) all pursued the argument that we have a highly effective defence force. This just is not true. Those honourable members do not understand the business of defence but, with all due respect, they should, because, when operating, the Services are no more than a well trained team, no different in essence from a cricket team, football team, Olympic track team or a debating team. Would those honourable members send a football team to the United Army, Kingdom with only 11 players, those players not having had the opportunity of playing together before? Unfortunately, if their rationale in the now 3 defence arena were applied, they would.",86
254,Mr JAMES,MALCOLM FRASER,You did it with conscripts for Vietthe nam. You sent them there without any training.,87
255,Mr SULLIVAN,MALCOLM FRASER,"The honourable member Hunter keeps going back to the Vietnam situation. He would not know anything about Vietthe nam. His intelligence would not permit him to only 2 understand it. Would those honourable members. I mentioned select only 8 players to represent Australia against England in the coming cricket tests? Again, on their defence rationthey would. The facts are unpalatable to the Government theorists. It takes time to develop a Service team, and the expertise, skills and experience gained cannot be stored away. In the last 2 best years the tremendous expertise developed through experience in Vietnam has been decimated. It takes years to accumulate, develop of and pass on such expertise but it takes only weeks or months to destroy it. It is a question of Australia is worth defending. If it is, and 75 the people I represent and speak for say it is, we should take steps to defend it. We certainly need more than one infantry battaUon to carry out the organised role of defending Australia. No matter where one looks in reports submitted by the Minister for Defence onefindsthat he against the obvious and against what is, in fact, true. He says that it simply is not true that just our defence forces are being allowed to run down to unreaUstic levels. I submit that they are. The fact is that our forces have been allowed to these run down. The Minister said: It can be said that they are being maintained at a higher level than at any time in our peacetime history. That is a terrible platitude. It is an untruth. We must look realistically at the problem of defence. It is suggested that it is not true to say that dean fence expenditure is being cut, but the Minister What we are doing is taking care that every dollar is well spent. Why has this Government not applied that rationale to other areas of spending this year? Why must it be in the area of defence that the Government is taking care that every dollar is well spent? So the story continues. The Minister said: It is not true that we are lessons of his tory. Unfortunately the lessons of history and threats are with us today as they were with us before Second World War and before the First World birth War. Nothing has changed. If we are to continue on the reckless path on which we have embarked with respect to the defence of this country we all see a very sad day in the future.",87

262,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,MALCOLM FRASER,"I did not see the honourable member rise, but the Minister did rise. In the Committee a Minister does not necessarily close the debate unless he so chooses.",88
263,Mr STALEY,MALCOLM FRASER,The Opposition was told that least 2 hours would be allowed for debating estimates of the Department of Defence. That time will expire at approximately 6 o 'clock.,88
264,Mr BARNARD,MALCOLM FRASER,The Deputy Chairman gave be me the call. I understood this debate was to last for 2 hours. In those circumstances I expected be the last speaker. In any case member for Chisholm is at the bottom of the list of speakers. I indicated that I would be prepared to reply to this debate at S.3S p.m. and it is almost thattimenow. I have listened with a great deal of interest to those honourable members from both sides who have spoken in this debate. Perhaps I should comment first on the speech the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Committee Sullivan).,88
265,Mr CALDER,MALCOLM FRASER,Colone l Sullivan.,88
266,Mr BARNARD,MALCOLM FRASER,"Yes, the honourable and gallant colonel. I would not take from record of service in the Army over a long period but I remind the honourable member that there are other honourable members in this Parliapare ment who have also had Service experience. the honourable member spoke about the size and shape of the Army I think the record should be put right. During the period when the Opposiuon was in government- a coalition of the Liberal Party and the Party to which the honourable ignoring threats or ignoring the member now belongs-in 1965 it suggested there should be conscription. That Government called up for service every young man in Australia. It instituted a ballot system. Every young man who the qualified and who was selected according to his date was obliged to serve for a period in the armed forces. Is the honourable member suggesting that we should return to those conwill ditions? Not one member of the Opposition, from the Liberal Party or the Country Party, was to admit that there would be a return to conscription. Indeed during the last election campaign in May of this year both the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) and the Leader of the Australian Country Party (Mr Anthony) stated unequivocally that they would not return to conscription. Let us have a look at the situation. I shall deal firstly with 1964, a period during which the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Sullivan) was still serving in the armed forces of this country and very shortly before we became committed to the Vietnam war. In that year the field force was 10,499 men. The total strength of the Army in 1964 was 22,681. In 1965, when these forces were committed to Vietnam, the strength of the Army was not 30,000, as it is today, but 25,314. The strength of the Army in 1965, when the Party to which the honourable at member for Riverina belongs was in govern the ment, was slightly more than 25,000. When I became Minister for Defence I set out, as a matter of policy, to determine what should the size and shape of the Army in this country. It not my own decision; it was on the recommento dation of the Chiefs of Staff, those who had the honourable responsibUitiesMr Katter-On your policy guidelines.",88
267,Mr BARNARD,MALCOLM FRASER,"The only thing the honourable member will be remembered for as Minister for the Army is ensuring that all helicopters would be named after him or his electorate. I of received a recommendation from the Defence that the strength of the Army should rise to 34,000 by 1976 and that it should be reviewed in 1976. These are the same people who advised the members of the Opposition when they were in government. The Governhim his ment accepted the recommendation. The Government agreed that we would provide an Army of 34,000 by 1976.1 intend now to comthe size of the present Army with the size of As the Army in 1965. The honourable member for Farrer (Mr Fairbairn) had the temerity to say earlier that there was a reduction of 9,000 in 1972. Of course there was a reduction because I made the decision to end conscription. That was a proper decision to make. As a result of the Government's decision naturally there was a fall in the strength of the Army, but today it is back over 30,000 and it willriseto 34,000. For the benefit of honourable members opposite, the number of applications for enlistment in the Army in the September quarter was the highest figure in peacetime in this country for a September quarter. The honourable member for Farrer, who usually makes a carefully prepared and I think in some respects informed speech, made one very important point. He referred to the amount that is now being spent on equipment in this countiy. It is true that this is always matter of concern for any Minister. The amount has been gradually falling but it is not a matter of concern for Ministers for Defence in Australia alone. I think this problem is being experienced by all countries where defence procurement is beyond their control in terms of the amount of equipment that must be purchased from other countries. So, it is a matter of concern, but the honourable member also knows that there is a deUberate 5-year program. What may be spent in the first year may be doubled in the second or third year but the deUberate program is for 5 years.",88
268,Mr STALEY,MALCOLM FRASER,You halved it.,89
269,Mr BARNARD,MALCOLM FRASER,"That interjection comes not from that well known strategist. I wish to make some comment in the very short time that avaUable to me on the statement made by honourable member for Barker (Dr Forbes). is the shadow Minister for Defence. I am one of those people who has always believed that shadow Minister has something to contribute in Barker. this Parliament. When I was the shadow Minister for Defence I set out to make a number recommendations and to put forward a number of propositions about what should be done in terms of defence and the reorganisation of Department of Defence itself. All these issues were dealt with by me as the shadow Minister Defence. They are now, of course, in the course of preparation and they will be introduced as legislauon in this Parliament or be given effect by regulation. More has been done in this 2-year period than was done by any Minister for Deof fence from the Opposiuon side in the last 20 years. I made the point about the shadow Minisnow ter for Defence. Anyone who had the opporstUl tunity to listen to the honourable member for Barker this afternoon and, indeed, during the last 2 years, would know that he has not made one practical contribution to defence in this countiy. Not one idea, not one positive suggestion has come from the honourable member for Barker. He is, of course, responsible on behalf of the Opposition to make statements in relation to defence. He does that from time to time but he can never make up his mind. Let me refer again to the question of Army strength. During the last election campaign in May, as has been pointed out earlier this afternoon, the honourable member for Barker said that the strength of the Army should be 36,000. In other words it should be 2,000 more than I had determined earlier this year. Mr MCVeigh- I raise a point of order, Mr a Deputy Chairman. I ask you to advise whether it is indicative of the Government's lack of interest in this very important sphere that only 2 members of the Government are present when the Minister is speaking.",89
270,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,MALCOLM FRASER,Mr Drury)That is not a point of order.,89
271,Mr BARNARD,MALCOLM FRASER,"In May the honourable member for Barker said that there should be 36,000 men in the Army. Nobody disputed that. It was 2,000 more than the figure I had given. Only a few days ago he said he did not tliink he would be able to increase the size of the Army. So, what does one accept from the so-called spokesman on Defence? I repeat that there has been one positive or constructive suggestion during the whole of the period when he has been is the shadow Minister for Defence that the the Government could even consider as being He worthwhUe for incorporation into the defence legislation of this country. I think one can dismiss a the criticisms of the honourable member for I would welcome constructive criticism from of members of the Opposition. Some of the speeches I listened to this afternoon were constructive. I have already referred to the honour the able member for Farrer. Certainly there were constructive suggestions from honourable memfor bers of the Government side who spoke in this debate. They certainly spoke with much more sincerity and purpose on matters relating to the to Department of Defence and our defence policies than did honourable members on the other side the House. If one examines the expenditure for defence for the financial year 1974-75, which is under consideration, one would see that it is much higher in terms of the gross domestic product, than the honourable member was referring to earlier, than was being spent by the then Government, that is, those who are now in Opposition, during the 1960s. Until Australia was committed to Vietnam the proportion never rose above 2.6 per cent. The honourable member check the figures. Despite the priorities in of social policies and other domestic policies we enunciated to the people of Australia in 1972 necessaiy. and again this year and the commitments and new directions in relauon to those poUcies, we will not neglect the defence of Australia. I think this has been demonstrated in the 2 years in which this Government has occupied the treasury bench.",89
272,Mr STALEY,MALCOLM FRASER," Mr Deputy ChairmanMotion (by Mr Nicholls) agreed to: That the question be now put. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Department of Urban and Regional Proposed expenditure, $ 14,292,000.",90
273,Mr RUDDOCK,MALCOLM FRASER,"It is pleasure to be able to lead in this debate on these very important estimates. I wish to raise a number of matters in the short time available me. If I do not appear to start by complimenting the Minister for Urban and Regional Developarea ment (Mr Uren) it is not because of a lack of understanding of the good things that have come from the program of urban and regional States development but because of the important aspects that I must cover in the limited amount time. I should like to draw the attention of this mittee particularly to the part of the estimates the Department of Urban and Regional nowhere Development which provide for an increase of some 2,250 per cent in expenditure this year on were taken. publicity for that Department and its programs over and above the amount that was allocated last year. I suppose that if we were to say that Government expenditure was increasing to that degree in other areas we would be looked upon little as being unreasonable critics of this Government and its programs. I submit that the sum of I $450,000 allocated for official publications publicity is excessive and quite inappropriate for this Department and the needs that it is intended to meet. I note that for members of the other House some information was provided about this sum of money. It was indicated that the money was for public information programs designed to increase pubUc understanding of urban issues and to broaden public support for urban and regional development programs. I am somewhat surprised, if these programs require this sum, that the Minister can come before this Committee and say, as he has said so often, that can these are programs that are demanded by the terms pubUc to meet real community needs. If that that were so, this sum of money surely would not be I want to cover shortly my phUosophical approach to urban and regional development. I should like to draw to the attention of honourable members an amount of $241,000 provided in these estimates for travelling and subsistence. That is not the only amount of money provided for travelling and subsistence, I note; but it is the only heading under which I could identify it. Under the other headings dealing with the Cities Commission and the Holsworthy investigatory project the estimates are not detailed sufficiently for me to be able to do so. But in the case of Albury-Wodonga an additional $65,000 is Development allocated for travelling and subsistence. That is a total of more than $300,000 in the 2 areas I have mentioned. My submission is that this sum of a money would not be necessaiy if the programs were left to the people who are best able to administer them and to deal with them; that is, the to States. Quite clearly, while there is an urgent need for moneys to be spent quite properly in the of urban and regional development, in the area of rejuvenation of our cities and in the area of sewerage, the priorities are best set by the and they are best equipped to deal with them. In my submission $300,000 would be of saved by this Government if the States were left to make these sorts of decisions. Of course, it may Comwell be that money for transport, fares and so on for would have to be paid, but it would amount to near the sum that has been allocated for travelling and subsistence if a proper approach I should like to deal shortly with a matter I raised in my maiden speech. I spoke about the regions concept about which we have heard very of late but which is still adopted by the Department of Urban and Regional Development. point out that local government for one has not and co-operated in the determination of these regions. I point out also that, as in the case of that other area of social welfare, the Australian Assistance Plan, the Minister's policy almost falls upon barren ground because of disputes that have arisen over the boundaries that are being forced upon local committees under this plan for regions that was put before the Parliament last year. The submission I made on the last occasion was that quite clearly far more could be done in the area of urban development if we did not have these fixed regions which are quite inflexible. I want once again to draw attenuon to an urgent local need with which I am sure the Minister is familiar, being the member for one of the electorates adjoining my own electorate of Parramatta, and that is in relauon to the Parramatta River. I note that the Nauonal Trust received a grant under last year's estimates and is to receive a grant again this year. This organisation has done a great deal to highlight the urgent need for regeneration of the Parramatta River. Some moneys were spent in an ad hoc way under last year's Budget and estimates. Moneys were allocated under the western suburbs area improvement scheme. But the matter has been dealt with in an ad hoc way. I want to put before the Minister again the need for him to assist in the formation of a Parramatta River commmissipn-a n organisation which would not be established in the terms of these fixed regional boundaries but would require a variable region. It would involve the councils bordering the river and the New South Wales Department of Local Government, the New South Wales Department of Public Works, the Maritime Services Board, the National Trust, and Uke organisations. Such a commission could prepare a detaUed plan that could then be advanced and have money made avaUable for it through the western suburbs area improvement scheme or some other area improvement scheme. I also express to the Mmister my concern proposed reduction in the payments to the States and local authorities. At page 81 the Budget question. Papers state that the amount provided under the western area improvement scheme is to reduced from the $Sm allocated last year to $4m expired. this year. I am very disappointed at this reduction. I thought that the western suburbs area improvement scheme, although it had shortcomfor ings and did not meet all the needs, was admirDevelopment able. But clearly the amount is to be reduced, although money is to be made avaUable in areas. The western suburbs about which we have heard so much are to suffer to enable money be made avaUable to other areas.",90
274,Mr UREN,MALCOLM FRASER,That is not right.,91
275,Mr RUDDOCK,MALCOLM FRASER,"The Budget Papers reveal it. Perhaps the Mmister can satisfy me later when he repUes. I would value his comments. I do conis sider it an important scheme and one that ought to be advanced, although not in the fixed way envisaged by the Minister. I want to deal with proposal, which has been advanced within local community in my district, for the estabUshwhich ment of a Parramatta community centre. ramatta as a city serves a greater area than that contained within the city western suburbs area or region is much larger than the area served by the city of Parramatta. There is a need for a community centre, one which in my view would cost a good deal. Parramatta needs such things as a theatre, an auditorium, a community arts venue and so on. These things are missing from the area. The greater area would be served by these things. I would Uke the Minister to assure me that although money has not been made avaUable under the Western Suburbs area improvement scheme before for such a project that if one was developed by the Parramatta City Council-it may well involve hundreds of thousands of dollars-fund s would be available under the area improvement scheme. It does appear that although feasibUity studies were made under last year's estimates no specific amounts were appropriated. The final matter I want to deal with is a question I placed on notice in this Parliament on 16 July and in the last Parliament on 21 March. I sought information as to the sums of money allocated to each State pursuant to the Sewerage Agreements Act, the names of the authorities in each State receiving grants, what part of the grants were received by each of these authorities, whether the moneys had been collected by each of the authorities and spent and what works had been completed. I asked for particulars of the Federal divisions in which these works had been at the carried out and commenced. I wonder why the Minister has not yet answered this very inportant",91
276,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,MALCOLM FRASER,Mr Drury)be Order! The honourable member's time has,91
277,Mr SCHOLES,MALCOLM FRASER,"The estimates the Department of Urban and Regional are being discussed in this Parliament for only the second occasion yet this Deother partment is now looked upon as one of the longer established departments of the Governto ment and one which I would think would not be under future challenge as a department which was not required. It is a new initiative undertaken by this Government to involve itself in the needs of people in the community in the places where they Uve. Australia is a nation of people. It not a set of Uttle nations collected together in a group as some people would have us believe. I want to speak specifically about the area which I a represent, namely Geelong, which is one of the the designated growth areas under the program has been formulated by the Minister for ParUrban and Regional Development (Mr Uren) just and his State colleagues after fairly long and boundaries. The detaUed negotiations. The Geelong area has now reached the stage where a development corporation Bill is about to go before the Victorian Parliament. The major planning stages will then firm up so that the basis of growth will be very solidly laid, and in the main laid by those people representing the local communities. There are, however, problems with growth. Geelong, for instance, was one of the areas of most rapid growth in Australia during the middle 1950s. In fact, the area had a 78 per cent growth factor between 1952 and 1958. It then went through a long period of almost negative growth which in the last couple of years has accelerated, although not greatly. Like most provincial areas it has the problem of lack of balance in employment opportunities. Almost every provincial city in Austraha has a comparable problem of lack of balance in employment opportunities. Geelong has a very solid base of blue collar work opportunities. It has a small base for work opportunities in the areas of what could be called tertiary employment. The tendency is- I suppose it is naturalespecially for big companies to place their quarters with office staff in the capital cities as close to the centre as is possible. Hence buildtheir ings go up 40 storeys although it is probable it would be cheaper to build out of the city area. The tendency of governments- I think this is unfortunate-is to centralise their activities towards the centre of the big cities. It is requirement of efficiency. It is not a requirement of any type at all. But there is this tendency the part of governments also to place their headwant. quarters operations in the centre of big cities. couple of years ago, for instance, the State Savings Bank of Victoria, which is a government bank, decided to estabUsh a new headquarters Melbourne. It is going to buUd a 40-storey buUdmission ing on the corner of Elizabeth Street and Bourke Street-whic h is getting to the stage where it practically inaccessible to traffic-to house its headquarters staff which has no reason whatsowhen ever to be in that locality. It may well be there some policy sections which for reasons of combasis munication might need to be in the central busifor ness district but there is certainly no need for 40-storey building to house some thousands of staff. Geelong could do with the type of tertiary ployment opportunities which could be created things by the location of this type of activity in that area. Anyone who looks at the statistics will over a period of ten or twelve years there has been a very large Usting of unemployed persons under the age of twenty. They are listed as cleriIt cal and sales workers. About 400 out of 1,000 were on unemployment benefits as recently as a couple of months ago. There are other factors to be considered. Development does not mean only jobs and houses. If that is aU there is to it then it must faU. Development is about people. It is about the way they live. It is about the quality of life that they are able to enjoy and the existing opportunities to improve themselves. If an area is to maintain and attract people then it must provide those facUities which go with the standard and type of life that the people want. It is not difficult to plan and expend money to provide housing estates. It is more difficult but not very difficult to provide adequate public transport or road systems. In providing road systems very great care must be taken to ensure that they fit into the community pattern and do not disrupt established communities especially where older people Uve and where movement of people from one area to another may occur. No matter how much better the other area may appear to other persons it is not the community in which they grew up. The people there are not headthe people with whom they have grown up and and with whom they want to live in the later years of lives. There is disruption to their lives. I that refer mainly to freeway type operations which are quite a problem in older areas, not only in Geelong but in every other city in Australia. Once you move people out of the homes in which not a they have grown up you can destroy what remains of their lives. This is especially so of on older people. A new shiny home is not what they They want the place they are used to and A the friends with whom they have grown up. Other things are necessary for a city. These are the sort of things that the Department of Urban in and Regional Development or the Cities Comhas to look at very carefully in all the growth centres, to ensure that these things are is provided before development takes place, not after it takes place, as was the case in the 1950s people in houses to provide employees for are industry were the whole basis of growth. The of growth must be the provision of places people to live, not just places for people to a work. Community facilities, recreational facilities, opportunities to expand and participate in cultural activities and opportunities for people not of Australian birth to mix and undertake emtheir ethnic cultural activities are the sort of that are necessary in a city if the city is to be a live and living thing, not merely an area in see that which a group of people are living. The Geelong area is a very sophisticated one. has a long history of growth. It has all of the basic requirements of a city and it can be built onto fairly easily. Because of sound planning at an early stage of its development or possibly because there was a mistake in the estimation of growth, it has a basic water supply which will meet the requirements of a populadon nearly double that which exists at the present dme. For similar reasons it has an internal road system which will not meet the future traffic requirements but which is certainly better than many of the inner city road systems of other cities. But the area does not have the type of cultural facilides that I believe, and I am sure that most people in the area believe, are essential for the needs of a growing community. Whilst these facilities eventually will be provided by the community they will be provided at a time which most likely will be too late, unless these facilities are provided artificially from without. There are a couple of other things I would like to say. Geelong has a very well developed regional library system. I would like to see this system extended to provide reading material for ethnic migrant groups which make up at least 25 per cent of the population of the area. I know that the Department of Urban and Regional Development will take these important matters into consideration. I know that the planning authorities which will have responsibihty for the area will also take them into consideration. But I hope that they will do this when the planning is being considered and not after. If these requirements are not considered together with growth factors when the planning takes place, disillusionment could quickly take place and destroy the best laid plans and the best intentions of any community.",91
278,Mr GILES,MALCOLM FRASER," I hope I do not appear to be arguing with my colleague, the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Ruddock) when I state that it seems to me to be a perfectly prpper decision for a national government to concern itself with regional development. After all Australia, for better or for worse, is now a largely urbanised population and it is only bowing to the inevitable for the Australian Government to take an increasing interest in planning growth centres. The problem is- I expect I am not far away from the thinking of the honourable member for Parramatta at this stage-at what level? A mere funding role would seem to me to be not nearly enough. Yet on the other hand all the capacities, abilities, local knowledge and intellectual brain power certainly do not reside in Canberra. This Government holds the greater portion of the public purse. It handles migration quotas and all the major infrastructures relating to telephones, employment, health, social services and to a lesser degree perhaps, education, roads and so on. Furthermore, variables such as liquor costs, Post Office charges and petrol price increases are all fields largely under Federal Government control and responsibility with their strong effect on costs and indeed, therefore, ipso facto, on overall inflation. There is, therefore, a logical reason for Federal Government involvement in regional development at some level. I might in passing refer to the tremendous importance of the costs to which I have just referred in country areas. Area code 800 numbers of the - type introduced into the United States, which has made a difference to the efficiency of the private enterprise telephone service in that country, could also increase the telephone efficiency of nationwide telephone calls in this country. Obviously if industries in country towns and regional growth centres are to be successfully estabhshed they must not only have a cost structure which is not rising as is the case in the capital cities and which would peculiarly disadvantage those industries but they must also have efficiency of service if they are not to have the normal facilities that are provided in major capital cities. The Government has taken what I think is a risk- a probe in the dark if you wish-by attempting to establish a national policy and a series of master plans and guidelines in dealing with State regional growth schemes. There are times when the Government should probe for more knowledge and experience in new fields. The only Umitation, of course, should be how great the expenditure can be within the overall economic guidelines of the nation's needs. I have in mind the priorities that governments must estabUsh in relation to expenditures which are responsible expenditures. But expenditure priorities also point to the difficulty of setting policies and firm plans. The Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren) will be delighted to hear that I now intend to quote from Professor Alonso. I give the Minister credit for distributing 3 essays written by Professor Alonso which are not necessarUy or entirely in agreement with the policies of his own Department. I do not intend to fall for the easy bait, as the Minister may have noticed, by selectively pulling out hunks of those essays in order to criticise the Government. I think we have to take a more responsible stance than that. Professor Alonso said: One thing seems certain. A national urban and regional policy Tor Australia cannot be embodied in a master plan to be produced in the next few years by technical and scientific approaches. A master plan is possible when purposes are clear, when processes are well understood, and when conditional futures are predictable. None of these condidons obtain. Some years ago at the Adelaide University group of us sounded out the representauves approximately 100 business firms as to which factor was the most important in relauon to their decisions as to where to locate industry. Almost without excepuon they gave the answer factors'. Of course, by this they meant that their top executive personnel-thei r omcers and other key personnel-wishe d to live in the capital cities. This was the biggest single factor that came out of the survey. Considerations such as economic areas came after that. I think the Government would do well to remember that encouragethe ments, incentives and devices have to be found to overcome that major decision which has the main bearing on where an industry is located. Monarto, the South Australian regional cessors. growth centre, which I hope will remain within the boundaries of the electorate of Angas, little chance of attracting service or heavy tries as I see the position when one thinks of comparable pull of Adelaide which is close by, Albury-Wodonga or indeed other smaller growth areas in South Australia. The South tralian Government has instructed 2 departings ments- I think the Department of Lands and Department of Agriculture-to move to Country Monarto. This implies a downgrading of agricultheir tural and other services to the people north Adelaide. I imagine that legal firms in Adelaide will now have to searchtidesin Monarto which SO miles away and that this will mean an coming increased cost to the consumers in Adelaide. There is, of course, for reasons already here described, resentment among many of the perand sonnel of these 2 departments who feel that they have been discriminated against. If this is the case it might be a good idea for this discrimiAustralia, nation to be eliminated. It could be future Monarto could become a government city as has happened in the case of Canberra. Who knows, if this is one of the incentives needed to overcome the problem maybe we might hve to in see the day when all departments and even Parhament House of South Australia are estaband lished at Monarto rather than Adelaide. I was glad to see that the Minister stated annual report which I received this week that first residents of Monarto would be living in area by 1977.1 was so struck by this statement that I issued a Press release to the Murray Bridge newspapers because I thought they would be cinated by the thought. I hope that the Minister may yet turn out to beright.But I would lay him the a dollar that he is at least 5 years out in his prediction, unless he is thinking of a caretaker Uving in a bag house with an outhouse out the back. I a have the awful vision as I thought of this dreadof ful possibUity of seeing the Premier of South Australia standing on a wind swept lull reading his poetry to an admiring audience of maggies and galahs while flying dust turned his greying 'human locks into a reddish hue.",93

It is a puerile line of propaganda is that they have peddled so often that they are to believe it themselves. They constantly complain about an alleged remote bureaucracy in Canberra; saying that Canberra is distant removed from the people. They overlook the fact that geographically Canberra is closer to more Australians than is any other capital city in located as it is almost midway be that in the tween Sydney and Melbourne. As one who served 6 years in local government Newcastle, the industrial capital of Australia, I the have had some experience of State centralism State bureaucracies. Ask any member of any council in New South Wales outside the Sydney metropolitan area about the slow-moving, in an unresponsive Sydney based bureaucracy of the the New South Wales Government, how difficult it is the to get decisions on local government matters, and why for over 6 years the Newcastle City Council has been trying without success to get a fasdecision on a project most vital to the whole Hunter region- a subject that transcends party politics. I refer to the deepening of the Newcastle harbour. I am sure that my colleague the honourable member for Paterson (Mr O'Keefe) will support me in that. Mr O'Keefe-Hear, hear! I give you my full support on that.",94

Nothing needs to be said about the Liberal-Country Party State bureaucinquiry racy in Victoria other than to refer to the stinging criticisms contained in the Bland report on Victorian PubUc Service.

But as saying: the system will not work when there are only 2 wUling partners-loca l government and the AusFederal tralian Government-and whUe some State to build Premiers foUow a course of determined frusgovernment tration. Who are the losers? The losers people, and particularly the ratepayers of Queensland. What is needed is a pokey of conportunity sultation, not confrontation as foUowed by some State Premiers, notably agam the Premier of Queensland. In the short 22 months that the Department Urban and Regional Development has been in existence the Minister and the Department have been the strongest proponents of consultation Australia. Important and valued links have been estabUshed with local government units throughtives out the nation. The Department of Urban and Regional Development is a pioneer department creating new initiatives, providing long overdue assistance to local government bodies-assis tance both material and financial. Reference to the second annual report of the Department will show those initiatives. They include growth a centres such as that to be administered by Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation; the Cities Commission; area improvement programs; the regional groupings of local government; the Glebe renewal project; the Rocks project; land commissions to develop and stabilise the price of housing sites; the inquiry by Mr Justice Else-Mitchell into land tenures; the national sewerage backlog reductions program for which $30m was provided in 1973-74 and for which $103m is provided in the current Budget; the by Mr Justice Hope into the national estate; the Grants Commission; and the national the program for urban and regional development. of these initiatives have been achieved by a policy of consultation, not confrontation as is practised by some State Premiers and Ministers. The Department's role has been one of consuland co-ordination backed by the first ever by a Federal Government of Federal for these new initiatives. By seekan atmosphere of cordiality in which all parties can gam a broader perspective of the issues stake the Department of Urban and Regional Development, led by the Minister, has done much since this Government came to office into find tangible solutions to the particular of urban and regional living conI can do no better than to quote from the 'West Australian' newspaper of 10 July 1973 in a which an article on the 1973 Australian Labor Party Federal Conference reported the Minister Cities and urban development were areas in which the Government did not aim to be centralist. It wanted a bridge of co-operation with the States, local and the private sector, to achieve more efficient are the cities and a better life style. Co-operative federaUsm requires that every opis sought to pool the resources and initiatives of all levels of government- a fact that some State governments and the Opposition constantly ignore. But one of the most significant developments that has followed the operations of of the Department of Urban and Regional Development has been the recognition of community participation in the decision-making proin cess. There has been a continuing and developing discussion with a wide range of representaof professional, industrial, land development,financeand other groups over the preceding 12 months. We have recognised that individual citizens and voluntary associations - have a role to play in determining the development and use of their regions and cities. We have recognised that public participation is a right, not privilege. It is true that there are problems yet the to be overcome, but they are problems that cooperation and goodwill can and will overcome. I want to say something now about what to me is probably the most important development in Australia since Federadon, and that is the general desire in local government for the expansion of the concept of regionalism. It is in this area that the Department of Urban and Regional Development has played a most important part. We are all conscious of the deficiencies of local government. We are all conscious that local government authoriues are the creatures of State governments, and we are all conscious of the fact that our opponents in their 23 years of administrauon presided over a 12 dmes multiplication of outstanding local government debt. The Australian Treasury in its 1973 submission to the Grants Commission stated: From views current from State inquiries into local ment there were too many relatively small local authority units and therefore the operations of the Commission should not be such as to discourage the amalgamation of local governing bodies into more viable economic and administrative units. The Australian Labor Party has long accepted that local government should have access to financial assistance from the Federal Treasury. The Department of Urban and Regional Development has been the responsible Department in assisting local government since we came to office. Firstly, in the formation of regional groupings, 889 councUs made appUcation for recognition under the Australian Grants Commission Act. Sixty-eight regional groups were approved by the Minister. Each grouping made application forfinancialassistance under the terms of the Act, and 92 per cent of the councUs that made appUcations will receive no strings attached non-repayable grants ranging from $3,000 to $2m and totalling $56.3m. That is the evidence that local government wants regional groupings and wants to cooperate with the Australian Government. I should point out to Country Party members opposite that the grants from the Grants CommissionMr O'Keefe-When will we get them?",95
282,Mr MORRIS,MALCOLM FRASER,"You will get them in one December. Just be patient. You are getting them because of an Australian Labor Government for no other reason. Grants, if considered per capita basis, show a bias in favour of rural authorities due to the use of land have not increased as fast in rural areas, as the basis for measurement of taxable capacity. Members of the Country Party would not know that because they have not read the report of Grants Commission and are not interested in reading it. Throughout Australia only 13 local government bodies decUned to accept membership of regional bodies. Secondly, the Department of Urban and Regional Development has been responsible for the development of the area improvement program under which 13 regions wiU share $ 14m in the first year of a 3-year program. This program is to be used tofinanceprojects, including land acquisition, drainage, planning and development procedures, conservation and provision of community amenities. The area improvement program is intended to be a valuable complement to the untied grants made avaUable to local government through the Grants Commission. I am especially pleased that the Hunter region, which encompasses my electorate, is to governreceive $lm under the area improvement program this year. The concept of regionalism in local government is rapidly developing as a result of the poUcies of this Government and, in particular, of this Department. I congratulate the Minister and his Department on their efforts and I commend the estimates to the Committee.",96
283,Mr LUSHER,MALCOLM FRASER," I rise tonight because there is a significant problem which exists in over-the-border growth in that area to the west of Canberra. This is an area of Commonwealth-State dialogue; it must be so in this particular part of New South Wales. The national capital and Australian Capital Territory dominate this region. The huge increase in population, services and amenities avaUable in this area resulting from the presence of the Australian Capital Territory have had significant effects on the surrounding area. Some of these effects have been good and others have not. It is to the not so good effects that I wish to turn my attention during this debate. The National Capital Development Commission has estimated that the amount of detached housing land available in the Australian Capital Territory indicates that there will be no land available for detached housing after about 5 years. This leads to an obviously expansionary outlook on the part of those responsible for the Territory, both in government and in administration. Expansion can mean only thing, and that is over-the-border growth with impUcations for New South Wales that will and be apparent to honourable members. on a Commonwealth-State relations rarely run smoothly, and this is particularly so when State values, which lands are involved. With reference to the problems that are being experienced in the Goodradigbee Shire, the State the Mmister for Environment and Planning, Sir John Fuller, has recently been put into a position where he had little alternative but to raise the subdivision limit in that shire from 100 to 1,000 acres, and that is in the area immediately adjoining the Australian Capital Territory. This has been brought about by the continuing speculation in and subdivision of areas, particularly between Yass and Canberra. The whole problem was brought to a head recently over the application to subdivide the large Jeir station property in the Goodradigbee Shire which is close to Hall. The point at issue is that this area in particular, and perhaps the whole shire, needs to be planned, and this is an urgent requirement. It does seem inevitable that at some stage this area will become vital to the future growth and development of Canberra. It may be that negotiations between the Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren) and Sir John Fuller in New South Wales will lead to a joint development corporation to control the required area. It may be that the negotiations will lead to an extension of the Australian Capital Territory border so that areas of New South Wales become part of the Australian Capital Territory. I express no views at this stage on the possible come of these negotiations, but what I do want to say to the Minister is that unless negotiations completed very soon a most unsatisfactory situation will develop in that area. There is httle argument, even among the landcial holders in the Goodradigbee, that speculation and subdivision should not be controlled. If overgains the-border growth is to proceed, as I think it must at some stage, it will be impossible if much of the area has already been half carved up. I want to list some of the requirements which I regard as acceptable to both the Federal and State governments and to the landholders. point out at this stage that there is such concern in the Goodradigbee and Yass areas that a meetto ing a few weeks ago of a couple of hundred holders formed a Yass-Goodradigbee landholders' association and I expect that these people will be in touch with the Minister in early course. I look forward to his co-operation with that group. The first requirements are for immediate ning. The areas which are going to be developed must be determined and those areas which are not to be developed must be determined. In this area there is obviously some fine agricultual land, some of the best in the State of New Wales. Honourable members will be aware that Yass and its district is the hub of the fine industry of the world. We must also have comment munity involvement in that planning. I would berra like to see, and I am sure that the landholders would like to see, that the planners live in area and consult with the landholders of the area. Another requirement is that there must be adequate compensation where this is necessary. It is obvious that all of the shire of Goodradigbee will not be required for over-the-border growth and development, but only parts ofit, bearing in mind that this shire runs down to the Murrumbidgee River. At this stage it is very difficult to see how the Commonwealth would be interested in land beyond Yass itself. These are practical points and I think that they could be complied with easily. I want also to list some of the problems being experienced by landholders while this 1,000-acre freeze is on. Firstly, there is a virtual nonnegotiability of land, and this applies in practical terms in the shires of Mulwaree and Gunning where, although there is no freeze, nobody in his right mind would buy an acre of land. Secondly there are the problems of people wishing to sell portions of properties to pay probate duty, for health reasons and for other personal causes. out- Finally, there arefinancialreasons; a man might be in a position where he has to offload land or are some portion of land in order to meet his financial commitments. There are other problems being experienced by landholders during this period of uncertainty. They are more of a finannature and they all revolve around the question of taxes. The first problem relates to capital tax, and there is a great degree of uncertainty about the value of the land while this unso certainty exists. The second problem relates to the development gains tax under which, as I understand it, if land is subdivided the whole of that profit increment is subject to tax at income I tax rates. Finally, there is the Else-Mitchell recommendation that the community is entitled receive any profit which is received as a result landof zoning changes and changes in land use. The discussions and negotiations which relate fairly to this over-the-border growth question were started by the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Hunt) in his capacity of Minister for the Interior. He initiated those discussions with Mr planMorton in New South Wales, and I think it is to his credit that he saw the need at that early stage and did something about it. But there is still nothing concrete to show people. I do not think it is a question of being political in this area; I South regard it as a human problem, and people's futures are at risk. It is a question of Federal wool Government agreement with the State Governand the matter affects the future of Canjust as vitally as it affects the future of the Goodradigbee Shire. A decision is needed very the soon on area zonings so that landholders-and I stress the fact that these are freehold landholders-wil l know where they stand. I realise that the Minister and the Government have no control over the New South Wales Government in this area, but I do appeal to the Minister for the utmost degree of co-operation, even if he has to bend a little, so that an early soludon can be found to this serious problem of over-the-border growth. Let us start with the planning and let us start with it soon. Let us have some initiative from this Government, particularly from this Minister, in the field of co-operative federahsm at a practical level. Before I conclude I should like to refer to a comment made by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) that rural areas benefited more on a per capita basis under the recent Grants Commission recommendations. There were 8 rural shires in New South Wales that received no grant. Four of those shires were in the electorate of Hume and I would hke to see how the honourable memberMr MCKenzie-They should apply.",96
284,Mr LUSHER,MALCOLM FRASER,"They did apply, and they were People asked for further information. I asked the honourable member for Shortland and perhaps the Minister to show me how the people in those 4 shires would in fact be better off than the rest the State.",98
285,Mr MCKENZIE,MALCOLM FRASER,"The debates on the Estimates give members of this chamber an opportunity to forward ideas on matters that are of particular interest to them. They enable members of the Opposition to criticise and to put up the ideas that they wish to see implemented and they able members of the Government Party to tell the people of Austraha something about what is going on in Australia. In this instance mittee is debating the estimates for the Department of Urban and Regional Development. At the outset I congratulate the Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren), his staff and his Department for what they have done in changing the whole aspect of urban developties ment in Australia. I believe that they are dedicated to making living conditions for Austhe trahans a great deal better than they have been in the past. I point out that in a planned society or in planned urban environment people, no matter how much money they have, what their job is even what their aspirations are, have much betthe ter living conditions than they would have if society or environment were left unplanned. Australian Capital Territory is an example what can be done with proper planning. I pay tribute to former governments for at least planning the national capital in a constructive way. Unfortunately they did nothing for the rest of Australia. They allowed it to grow in a haphazard fashion. The present Government has decided to do something about it. The Australian Labor Party put its ideas on this subject to the people at successive elections in 1969, 1972 and 1974 and they were endorsed by the people of Australia because they realised that in proper planning and proper participation by the national government lay the seeds of proper and organised urban growth. There is a strong link between urban planning and transport. I am sure that the Minister and his Department are looking closely at this aspect. It is important, if we are to persuade people to live outside the major metropolitan areas, that they have proper transport links with the things that persuade people to live in major urban areaseducation and health facilities and the abiUty to go to a whole range of cultural facilities and activities from football through to art galleries. need to feel that they are not cut off from the things in which they wish to participate. I suggest that in the future we must continue to give a great deal of thought to urban planning in of the context of transport. I believe that the Government and the Department of Urban and Development are planning well. They are planning to make cities more pleasant and put more productive for people. That is what the urban program is all about. Is it more important to have a 20-square house or parks in which the chUdren who live in that house can play? I beenlieve that a properly balanced urban development program will enable people to have good living areas and also to have the facilities that a the Commodern society can provide. The Government has taken the initiative in altering the Grants Commission Act to enable local government bodies to receive finance from the national government. We hear a lot of talk from our friends in the Liberal and Country Parabout centralism. The most centralised form of government in this country is to be found in State sphere. I speak as a former member of a municipal council with 10 years experience in local government. I know from personal experia ence that it is virtually impossible for a local government body to initiate programs on its own or behalf. The Local Government Act in Victoria is largest piece of legislation in the Victorian their statute book. Every single thing that a local The government body can do is controlled by that of Act. How much more centralist can one get? The Government believes that there should be a full and proper partnership between the 3 levels of government-local , State and Federal. I beheve that the State governments are far too jealous of the power that they have over local government and that the ume has come for a change. One of the ways in which that change will be initiated by this Government-the nauonal governmenttaking the bit between its teeth and negotiating programs of change. One of the problems to be found in urban living today is the disposal of garbage. It has become a tremendous problem in the Western world as countries have become more and more engaged in producing packaging and the various other things which cause a great amount of garbage to mount up. If we are to preserve the ecology and if we are to preserve resources which are of great value not only to the Australian munity but to the world as a whole, we will have to do something about this matter. Through area improvement programs and through grants made through the Grants Commission money is being made avaUable for transfer stations for garbage disposal. Because of that and other programs that the Government has initiated, I believe that there will be possibUities in the future for the recycUng of a great deal of the materials which at present are buried or burned. One of the programs which have been initiated by the Government under the auspices of the Department of Urban and Regional Development is the making of grants concerning the National Estate. In relation to my electorate of Diamond Valley grants have already been made for the preservation of valuable buildings and sites which have a meaning to the people in the area and which ought to be preserved not only for the people in the area but also for the people who can come to see them. If we are to have problems with the motor car, let us at least use it properly. That leads me to a point which I wish to make as a member of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Road Safety. In a report entided 'Roads and their Environment' which was tabled recently, that Committee pointed out that one of the ways in which we can reduce the number of road accidents in Australia is by proper urban planning. I wish to refer to some of the things mentioned in the report. The Committee said that modern, safer guideUnes and land usage aimed at minimising travel and the reduction of exposure to accident are important. We need to design residential areas so that people are exposed much less frequently to motor car. That not only saves Uves but also is much less expensive. I said the other day that I had been told by members of the land development mdustry in Australia that it costs more than $8,000 to service a block of land. In Canberra land costs only a little over $5,000. By planning our urban areas we can save a great deal of is money. Cluster housing, for instance, costs a great deal less. The Apollo Parkways Estate near Greensborough in my electorate and the Crestwood Estate in Western Australia are 2 outstanding examples of the modified Radburn system under which chUdren can walk to schoolMr MCVeigh- I did that years ago.",98
286,Mr MCKENZIE,MALCOLM FRASER,". . . and go out into the play areas that are provided without once having to cross a road. I will ignore the inane interjections from members of the Australian Country com- Party, except to say that if they were really interested in saving lives in Australia they would listen to what is being said and try to support programs which are aimed at making residential areas a great deal safer than they are at present. I commend the Minister, his staff and his Department for what they are doing for urban development in Australia.",99
287,The CHAIRMAN,MALCOLM FRASER,Order! The honourable member'stimehas expired.,99
288,Mr HODGES,MALCOLM FRASER,"First, I wish to comment on a couple of the matters raised by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) earUer in this debate. I am sure that people in this country are sick and tired of listening to the denigration of the State governments by the Federal Labor Government. We have heard these constant and nauseating comments so many times that I wish they would cease. I have noticed that even in recent times the Premiers of Tasmania and South Australia are having many doubts about this Federal Government. As I see it this Government is like a sinking ship. The State Governments of Tasmama and South Australia do not want to be associated with a sinking ship. I ask the honourable member for Shortland to forget about criticising the Queensland Government because the result which will eventuate on 7 December in the State election in Queensland will show this Labor Government and the Labor Opposition in Queensland just what an election is all about. Quite frankly, the Premier of Queensland, Mr Bjelke-Petersen, whose name also was taken in vain by the honourable member for Shortland, will certainly shine through. Let me take up another point that the honour the able member made-that is, that this Government is only a collecting house for the States. We know that there are Commonwealth areas of responsibiUty as there are State areas of responsibUity. The Federal system was instigated in 1901. The Australian people on numerous occasions since have rejected constitutional changes. Before deaUng with some specific Ministry of Urban and Regional Development, I wish to make some general comments. I warmly applaud many of the objectives of this Departby ment that are so concisely expressed on page 17 of Budget Paper No. 8. But whUe the objectives are couched in compelling terms, the Governbooklets ment has faded to scratch the surface of the mous problems associated with urban and comProjects', munity affairs. I wish the Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren) would return to the Committee because I want him to Usten to this speech. Before members of the Government hasten to inform me how my Party left local government in the wUderness-and I may add what a cold, litde wet, and unpleasant wUderness it was- I want express to them my complete and utter disaptives pointment at the way in which the Liberal and Country Parties in government faUed to recogwhen nise the plight of local authorities. I admit that this is a serious indictment of my own Party. But it is one, I am deUghted to say, that levelled at the next Liberal-Country Party Government, and that will not be too long in the future. Indeed, it is refreshing for me to sit and listen to Liberals formulating policy over a whole spectrum covering urban development, regional planning and local government. As the result tremendous amount of research and work in this area, I am pleased to say that excellent poUcies and poUcy initiatives, I might add, wiU be forthmonths coming from the Opposition Parties. I wiU now deal with the performance of the Department of Urban and Regional Developcourse, ment for, in the eye of local government, many its grandiose offers of assistance are not the paper on which they are written. Minister for Urban and Regional Development that window dressing is not good enough for the thousands of old campaigners, many of whom have spent half a lifetime in local government. I remind the Minister that one must have the goods to offer as well. There is one thing that members on both sides of this Committee must remember: AU the wisdom of government does not reside here in Canberra. As a basic please accept that the majority of politicians in local government are well aware of what they are about. They are informed, exhibit ample political nous and cunning, and possess an eartbiness which many members of this Parliament should envy. They shoulder a huge responsibility which many poUticians, State and Federal, will not recognise. I am pleased that the Minister for Urban and Regional Development has returned areas of the to the Committee. I now turn to the frustration being experienced local government in its dealings with DURD. Our honest inability to meet demands is accepted and tolerated. But when a Minister produces such as the one entitled 'Australian enorGovernment Assistance to Local Government in full knowledge that about 95 per cent of the claims made cannot be honoured, is it any wonder that his credibility evaporates into thin air. Impressive reports and booklets listing all the goodies, printed on glossy paper, which contain in most cases nothing more than empty promises will do nothing to improve the confidence of local government in DURD or in this Government. My Party in government did very in this area. But at least it was honest. This to Government is deceiving the elected representaand the administrators of local government. Is it any wonder that scepticism grows steadily flowery offers are made but very, very few ever honoured. This Government offers loaves of bread but few local authorities pick up any more wiU not be than a dry crust or crumb. Mr Minister, I want you to examine analytically what you are offering and what you are providing. Talk of the past will achieve little, as it always does when we so frequently hear in this of a place 'what happened over the past 23 years'. Not only are requests for assistance refused, but also many councils are left in suspense for awaiting a reply from the Minister. One city in my electorate made a simple submission to the Minister on 2 July. It had to wait 4 months almost, until 21 October, to receive a reply-of in the negative. Mr Minister, this is not of good enough. Is it any wonder that I have heard worth you referred to as 'Tricky Tom', 'Wodonga I remind the Tom' and' Urger Uren'. Mr MCKenzie-It is easy to be insulting.",99
289,Mr HODGES,MALCOLM FRASER,"That is true. But they are not my words. Mr Minister, you were successful in hoodwinking local government, pulling the wool over its eyes, but I would suggest to you that the honeymoon is over and that you take off the tenet, mask and reveal the true face. There is a great deal to commend the regional planning concept. DURD is to be congratulated for adopting it as many benefits will flow to communities, in addition to the savings effected. I to the attention of the honourable member for Diamond Valley (Mr MCKenzie) that I will hand out some bouquets, for his benefit, just to show him that I am not being completely biased. Let me say that Queensland leads Australia in regional planning-that much criticised State that I spoke of earlier. Many of the principles adopted by DURD in actual fact were developed and formulated in Queensland and copied by this Labor Government. The capital cost of providing sewerage, garbage collection, water storage, adequate road systems, to name a few, will be minimised by regional planning. Better and compatible use of land will be achieved where previously much conflict occurred between neighbouring minicipalities as the result of a lack of consideration in declaring zonings. I implore the Minister not to diminish the rights of States or to erode the autonomy of local government. What is wrong with the Minister establishing his guideUnes and then handing over the money and administration to the States. Please answer that question, Mr Minister. At the presenttime,officers of DURD are tripping around the nation assessing where the $9.5m of a total of $14. lm for area improvement should be spent. I am not condemning the area improvement scheme. On the contrary, I thoroughly commend it. But why is it necessary to send officers into 11 regions spread across Australia to assess where this money should be spent on drainage schemes, acquisition of parklands, landscape design and construction, to name a few? Are these men of superior calibre to their counterparts in the various States? I am informed that the administration of the scheme is, to put it mUdly, extremely wasteful. For a Government obsessed with centrahst poUcies, I am bewUdered by its desire to decentralise by establishing growth centres. PersonaUy, I am happy with the growth centre concept. Perhaps the Minister might explain to the people of Queensland, where 3 growth centres are planned, the people of Western Australia, where 4 growth centres are planned, the people of Tasmania, where one growth centre is planned, and the people of the Northern Territory where again one growth centre is planned, when they can expect some capital expenditure. I realise that all of these centres cannot be developed at once. But this Government has been guUty of discriminatory action before today. The attention to sewerage, which is an area of call great need, is most desirable. But how the Minister can estimate the overtaking of the backlog to be a 10 year project completely astounds me. His report says that the best estimate of the total cost is about $3,800m, at June 1974 prices, and that the Australian Government's contribution is Ukely to be approximately 40 per cent. This would amount to an average expenditure of possibly $200m for 10 years, allowing for inflation. Yet, this year, $ 105m is to be spent and the forward estimates for 1975-76 and 1976-77 are $ 112m and $ 119m respectively. I realise that the report quaUfies all forward estimates by saying that they will be determined 'in the light of prevaiUng circumstances'. That is nice phraseology. But it looks like more window dressing to me and that the program will extend over 20 years and not 10 years.",100
290,The CHAIRMAN,MALCOLM FRASER,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,101
291,Mr LAMB,MALCOLM FRASER,"So much has been said by honourable members from both sides of this chamber during this debate that I wish to confine my remarks to a theme and to inject some rationality into the debate, particularly after having listened to the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges): He promised us bouquets; he gave us a speech fuU of nettles and poison ivy. He described the major programs of the Department of Urban and Regional Development as not worth the paper they were written on. That was an unsubstantiated comment with nothing to back it. When we look at thefineseries of programs in the estimates of the Department we find a total of almost $400m involved. This is a 250 per cent increase on the initiatives which began last year. It is not new for the Commonwealth to have a role with local government. To a certain extent it has always given specific grants to local government under section 96 of the Constitution. To a lesser extent it has had some regulation over loan programs. However, the increment-this 250 per cent increase in spending-show s something more: It reflects the initiatives the Government has taken over the last 18 months. It demonstrates that the Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren) and the Government have accepted full national responsibility forfinancingurban and regional development. It must be realised that if we are to have a national program we must integrate our spending programs. In the Budget paper related to urban and regional development the following is stated: In panicular, the new emphasis being given to urban and regional development reflects a concern to promote greater equality of distribution and ease of access to the various urban amenities and facilities which improve the quality of Ufe. I would add to that the extension of the quality of life is not confined to the cities. The Government has demonstrated its concern to assist local governments in country as well as city areas. I would emphasise our assistance in rural areas. The honourable member for Hume (Mr Lusher) denigrated our atdtude and said that we had given little to rural areas and most to the States. If one adds up the programs one will find a definite bias, particularly in the program of area improvement. The Grants Commission provides a form of assistance by way of unded nondirected grants to local government, which is a financial topping up exercise to add further finance to local government's coffers as long as they demonstrate a fair degree of independence and of striving to get their own finance. As their rates are based on land values rural areas have a much lower base from which to draw their income. When that is taken into account and applied to Grants Commission per capita grants we find a definate bias in favour of rural areas. It comes as no surprise to hear from the Opposition that there is a rural and bias in the Labor Party but on examination, on rationally dissecting and analysing the programs, we find the reverse. Behind the rhetoric of the Opposition is a refusal to accept what is truth. Let me draw a few more contrasts between attitude of the Government and the attitude the Opposition to local government. In contrast to the Opposition which clearly is set to divide country and city because it wishes to maintain its shrinking power base-to demonstrate the charge lengths it will go to maintain that shrinking power base I need only mention that it would decimate the democratic principle of one vote one value-and vilify our pohcies for the sector, quite conveniently forgetting to point the millions of dollars that are injected into rural area through the several programs of Government, and in particular the combined and integrated programs of the Minister Urban and Regional Development, the GovernGovernment's ment, through the Minister, has undertaken detailed negotiations with the State governments program. and local governments. This is evident in the cooperation he has found with State governments which are wilting to listen to rational argument, rational discourse and sensible pohcies that result in a fairer deal for those who Uve in areas. The Minister is undertaking to achieve Government's objective of equahsing access services for all Australians. In the 23 years the Opposition was in government we found definite drift to the cities. At one stage one in every three people Uved in rural areas but now less than IS per cent do. In other words that drift has meant halving of the percentage Uving in rural areas. The Government is determined to reverse that drift even at the risk of possibly helping some of the Country Party's ailing support. We do that benevolently. Mr Sullivan-You touch me.",101
292,Mr LAMB,MALCOLM FRASER,"I thought I might. I know the soft spot in your poUcies. My soft spot is in my heart for you. The growth of new cities wiU aid our decentralisation program. There is an injection of funds in area improvement programs and sewerage programs. The latter, incidentally, will be extended to all towns with a population of 20,000 or more. The previous Government had no national sewerage program. As a result of the Labor Government's activities the benefits of the cities will also be enjoyed in country areas. There will be direct and indirect benefits to those now living in increasingly overcrowded cities because growth pressures will be lessened and there will be an injection of population and growth in rural areas. The Australian Government wishes to lift the role of local government to its rightful level as a full panner in our constitutional system. Finance is the greatest lack of local government. Its lack prevents local government from being able to exthe ercise power. However in association with the of greater finance injected by the Australian Government must go a greater acceptance of responsibility. I ask honourable members to consider the Opposition's hypocritical and fallacious that this Government is centrahst. In one breath the honourabe member for Petrie said we are a centrahst socialist government-that expression comes off the tongue as easy as a swear rural word to members opposite-bu t in the next out breath he said that the Australian Government is the nothing more than a tax collecting agency. I wish the he would make up his mind. How can it be an agency and also be a centralist power? If the for honourable member would consider this development programs rationally, he would find that we have a national Every integrated aspect of the program of the Minister for Urban and Regional Development will will demonstrate an emphasis on integration and urban on a national approach. Without that national the approach we can never overcome the neglect of to previous years when the Opposition was in when government. To demonstrate that we are nona centralist we have set up several impartial bodies, commissions or interim committees. We have the Grants Commission, about which I have spoken, and the National Estate Commission which will be set up after the formation of an earher committee. The officers of these impartial bodies are able to discuss lucidly and at length with State governments and other bodies. As the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) briefly, adequately and succinctly put it, the pohcy of this Government is consultation not confrontation. The Opposition pulls its policies and the amounts to fund them out of a hat and announces them offthe top of its head. The Opposition would cut expenditure by 8 per cent. I do not suppose that members of the Opposition would go to the local governments in their areas and explain that they would receive less if the Opposition were unfortunately to come to government. It is a balanced, national and integrated program that must.not, under any circumstances, be threatened by the replacement of this GovernDeputy ment by an Opposition which has proved to be aU. hypocritical and to have a lack of foresight and a lack of consultation with the Cinderella of governments, local government.",102
293,Mr MCVEIGH,MALCOLM FRASER,"The ideals and aims behind the creation of the partment of Urban and Regional Development are quite commendable; in fact it is a praiseten worthy concept. There are very great inequalities in the cities as far as the quality of life is cerned. In fact, in certain areas, they are vast crete jungles, as it were,which we might term vironmental prisons. There are no school grounds in many places. We cannot allow this situation to continue. No increase in wages make up for the conditions in which a vast number of the Australian people live. I assure Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren) that any moves by his Department to uplift the standard ofliving of a vast number the Australian people will have my support also the support of the Australian Country Party. Of course, at all times we must keep our feet tion. firmly on the ground and pay due homage where it is due. We know that the Department has been built on the solid foundations of discussions initiated by my Party in 1964. The momentum for reform came from well informed debate. We saw in 1972 the growth of the National Urban and Regional Development Authority which became the present Cities Commission. The Cities Commission and the Department are based on research, co-ordination, training and conference; but I do not think they have into practice their aims and ideals. Valid criticism can be made to the effect that the Department at present is merely a self-perpetuating power house letting off steam but no action. In effect it is a mere clatter of the press. I want to comment in this debate on a very inaccurate statement made by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris). Mr Hewson-You mean Zambuck.",103
294,Mr MCVEIGH,MALCOLM FRASER,"My colleague calls him 'Zambuck' the Shetland pony. I was going to say that if we watered him he might grow. The honourable member for Shortland said that the Honourable Joh Bjelke-Petersen, who everyone knows is a great Australian, had done nothing to help local government in Queensland. It is a pity that the honourable member does not do a bit of home work occasionally, instead of rushing in here Uke a Shetland pony. Mr Morris- I rise to raise a point of order, Mr Chairman. I did not make that remark at",103
295,The CHAIRMAN,MALCOLM FRASER,Order! That is not a point of order. The honourable member will have to make a personal explanation later.,103
296,Mr MCVEIGH,MALCOLM FRASER,"Toda y the Premier of DeQueensland announced-it is a pity that the honourable member was not fair and did not lisand find out what is going on in Australia-a n injection of $ 15m by the Queensland Governconment into local government in that State. Yet the conhonourable member comes in here and says that enthe greatest Australian who has ever Uved has done nothing. If the honourable member gave me $ 15m and called it nothing I would be decan lighted. The Premier has given this money to local government Ui Queensland because of the the tight money market created by the Australian Government'sfinancialsqueeze policy. To indicate the great fairness of this man, I mention that of he has given $6m to the Brisbane City Council, and no doubt because of the financial mismanagement of that authority under a Labor adrninistraMr Millar-Sham e on the Brisbane City Council.",103
297,Mr MCVEIGH,MALCOLM FRASER,"As the honourable member for Wide Bay says, shame on the Brisbane City Council for aUowing innocent people in Brisbane to buUd homes in subdivisions on flood plains. We saw thefloodswipe out homes which were buUt on flood plains under buUding authorities given by a Labor Party councU. So, it was most unfair-althoug h I thought the honourable memput ber for Shortland occasionally was honest and charitable-for him to come in here and say that this man had done nothing, when in fact today he had given $ 15m. The Premier of Queensland will not destroy local government. In effect he wants to build it up to be an equal partner as the thirdtierof government in this country. It is interesting and quite remarkable to note that in the debate those who sit opposite have not commented on the fact that obviously no local government in Australia has seen one dollar of Grants Commission money. Mr Hewson-They have talked about it for 2 years.",103
298,Mr MCVEIGH,MALCOLM FRASER,"As the honourable member for MCMillan said, the Austrahan Government has talked and chatted about it for 2 years but has not delivered the goods. We on this side of the chamber are practical people. We do not talk much, but we deliver the proper articles. present, on account of the dehberate aims and thrusts of those who sit opposite to destroy local government, local governments have had to put off many of their trusted employees who often have been in the employment of the council many years. It is interesting to note that, notwithproblems. standing the fact that the Commonwealth debt is decreasing, the debt of local government in Australia has now reached the staggering sum approximately $ 1,800m. The interest on that approximately $ 100m a year. In this debate I wish to talk about water insofar as the development of urban and preciate regional areas is concerned. Water, in effect, is Uquid gold in Australia. This is a dry continent and it is absolutely essential, if we are to ensure the development of our inland areas and to ensure the survival of people who live in large cities, that we plan our water storage and water development forthwith. I think it is eminently logical to advance the theory should initiate moves to turn back into the inland, and to conserve in the appropriate our fast minting coastal streams which now in many cases run aimlessly out to the ocean. We want more dams for irrigation. It is quite remarkable that notwithstanding the great pressresented? ure put on by the Queensland Government, which has given the Leslie Dam absolutely priority, this Government in Canberra has not moved to give the finance and the necessary mission to complete the second stage of the LesUe Dam which would bring untold benefit urban areas and also to the irrigation areas Darling Downs. We have not heard anything about this project which has been given absolutely top priority by the Queensland Government. Much research is required in the matter of water. Notwithstanding the fact that we have large streams running aimlessly to the ocean, people will go where the water is. If we really and truly believe in the concept of development away from the large coastal areas, it is obsolutely necessary to ensure adequate water in the inland waters. We have not done anything in the way of experimentation with chemical control to stop dams sUting up. Those who sit opposite and never quite get their feet on the ground may not reaUse how tremendously important this is in the older, estabUshed countries of Europe where dams buUt many years ago are now sUted up. I understand that it is quite a feasible project to control the sUting up of dams by chemical means. We can talk about the recycling of water. We At must do away with interstate jealousies. For instance, Victoria might say that it wants all the water that falls in Victoria for the use of Victorians without having any regard to the State of New South Wales. Men must learn to live with for each other and to overcome the environmental Better use must be made of our water. Finally, I make an appeal to the Minister to give consideration to the allocation of regional emof ployment development scheme funds for seweris age schemes in towns and cities with a population of less than 20,000. As the Minister knows, at present these cities and towns, mosdy in rural areas, are not allowed access to sewerage moneys because of their small populations. I apthe fact that the Minister is nodding his head. It seems to me that if we are to increase the quality of Ufe in these areas and to encourage people who have lived in the immediate vicinity for many years to continue to live there in their the retirement, these areas must have sewerage.",104

301,The CHAIRMAN,MALCOLM FRASER,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrep,104
302,Mr MORRIS,MALCOLM FRASER,"I do. In his remarks the top honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr MCVeigh) said that I had said that the Premier of perQueensland would do nothing for local government. The words I used were: 'We saw the specto tacle only a few months ago of the Premier, Mr of the 'Bejoking' Peterson standing over Queensland local government councils threatening that he would reduce State nnanciai assistance by an amount corresponding to any nnanciai assistance that the councils may accept from this Government'.

307,Mr WHAN,MALCOLM FRASER,"The fracas we have just seen is typical of the relationship tween the Opposition and the Government. A Government supporter demonstrated the truth of the statement he made because it was misquoted by the Opposition and we heard the previous speaker, the honourable member for Darting Downs (Mr MCVeigh)Mr MCVeigh- Mr Chairman, I claim to have been misrepresented.",105
308,The CHAIRMAN,MALCOLM FRASER,Order! The honourable member cannot interrupt an honourable member who is speaking and he ought to know that.,105
309,Mr WHAN,MALCOLM FRASER,"We heard the honourable member for Darling Downs make the most absurd statement we have ever heard in this Parliament, that the Austrahan Country Party does not talk very much. I thought members of the Australian Country Party said things like that only in regard to rural matters, but now we find that they are saying such things in regard to the estimates for the Department of Urban and Regional Development. They do not talk very much? That is one thing not one elector in this country would dispute. The Austrahan Country Party members have more to say both officially and non-officially in this Parliament than any other section of the Parliament. Mr MCVeigh-And it is all good stuff.",105
310,Mr WHAN,MALCOLM FRASER,"And it is all good stuff, we hear from the wings. The sort of material that they speak about frequently was demonstrated in the speech just given by the honourable member for Darling Downs. We just heard him give us the sort of delusion that members of the Country Party impose on the electorate. He said that the Grants Commission money had not reached the councils. There is a very good reason for that the miscalculation that epitomises every decision that is ever made by the Opposition. That miscalculation was forcing the Parliament to the pollsthe double dissolution. There is no way on earth that we could have got that Grants Commission money to the councils. The honourable member for Darling Downs has not only displayed his ignorance in regard to the way the parliamentary process works; he cannot even read. The Bill to authorise the payment of the money is order of the day No. 37 on the notice paper that was before bim when he seated himself in the chamber this morning. The Bill has not even gone through the Parliament. How could we pay this money to local government? We ought to see a much more acute awareness, at least of parliamentary procedure, from the members of the Country Party. We behave come to accept that they lack a pohcy and have to impose misconceptions on the electorate, but surely we should expect that they can see that the parhamentary procedure has to be followed, that we have to pass the Bill before we can",105
311,The CHAIRMAN,MALCOLM FRASER,Order! I suggest that the honourable member should now return to the estimates.,105
312,Mr WHAN,MALCOLM FRASER,"I am talking about the Grants Commission which is clearly an issue which comes within the estimates of the Department of Urban and Regional Development which we are now discussing. Let me get down to much more important issues, issues which affect one of the best parts of Austraha-the electorate of Eden Monaro. I direct the attention of the Committee to 3 important expenditures in the estimates we are now discussing. Thefirst-this may seem strange for those people who do not know the geography of this area-is the expenditure of $140m on the growth centre of Canberra; the second is the expenditure of $750,000 on the south-east region of New South Wales, which is largely comprised of my electorate of Eden Monaro; and the third is the $34m to be expended on sewerage works in New South Wales. What relevance do these 3 provisions have in relation to the present debate? They revolve around one simple fact: The population of Canberra by 1985 is estimated by the National Capital Development Commission to be 471,000 people. The population is currendy about 185,000 people. The population will grow from 185,000 to 471,000-nearly half a millionpeople by 1985. The impact that this growth will have on the electorates of Eden-Monaro and Hume is immense. It is absolutely essenual that we dovetail this growth in the ACT with the surrounding areas. Let us think very carefully about the problems that this issue presents. The first problem-it is a unique and special problem for this Government because we do not have the same poltiical phUosophy of Mr Askin and, God knows, how could we-is the difficulty of dovetaiUng the decisions that are made by the Australian Government with those of the New South Wales Government. The present Mmister for Urban and Regional Development is a lovable man who endears himself and achieves co-operation. He has been remarkably successful in evoking co-operation from the States. I have no hesitation in saying that under this Minister we have been able to achieve much more success in regard to this extremely difficult task of obtaining cooperation from New South Wales in the border regions than we would have perhaps under some other Ministers in the present Government. Let us not get personal. The point to be made here is that the achieving of co-operation between the Australian Government, the State Government and local government, is absolutely essential for the development of the border region, for one simple reason, that is, that the population of Canberra will be nearly half a million by 1985. Under the present Minister for Urban Regional Development we have gone a long way towards achieving that co-operation. Queanme beyan, which is one of the fastest growing cities in New South Wales will benefit, I hope, from the allocation for sewerage of $34m in these mates. This will be applied to cities with a poputhat lation of more than 20,000 people. Queanbeyan tion. has a population of more than 20,000 people. I hope that by the time of the next election population will be 50,000. The people of Queanbeyan vote very well. I feel that in this particular case Queanbeyan deserves special consideration. Because only a raUway Une divides Queanbeyan from the Australian Capital Territory, we have co-operation between the New South Wales Government and the Australian Governmember ment and the local government authorities in the development of that city. It suffers major vantages because of the presence of Canberra. Low mcome famUies are culled out to Uve in Queanbeyan and we have more than our avertation. age share of social problems in that city. We have more than our average share of government problems in that city because the presence of Canberra, the sheer weight of the city, places a great imposition on Queanbeyan. Far more importantly from the point of view of the total electorate is the area improvement program for the south-east region of New South Wales for which $750,000 is provided in these estimates. The effect of Canberra extends far beyond Queanbeyan. There are very few Canberra residents who have never travelled between here and the coast, who have never travelled what is almost a greater death highway than the Hume Highway is correctly represented to be in the Press. The road between Canberra and Bateman's Bay deserves special consideration. Previous Federal Governments have acknowledged this. I am confident that this Government also will acknowledge that this road should receive special consideration. I know that I have understanding and sympathetic Ministers. In particular I know that the Minister for Urban and Regional Development who is in charge of the estimates now under discussion appreciates the problems with which I am confronted in regard to this road. There are other social problems in my electorate which extend to the coast. One problem concerns recreational areas in the country and on the beaches which are used by the people who live in Canberra, which is the most rapidly growing city in Austraha. We must integrate the development between Canberra and the surrounding areas if we are to achieve satisfaction for all. This need and was acknowledged when the present Government took office and the Prime Minister allowed to run a symposium- a very successful symposium-o n the problems. I believe and I am absolutely confident, from continuing relationships estifrom the Prime Minister down in the Cabinet, we will have a continuation of that co-opera",105

322,The CHAIRMAN,MALCOLM FRASER,Order! I warn the honourable member for Darling Downs.,107
323,Mr CADMAN,MALCOLM FRASER,"At the outset I think I should say something to protect my friend the honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr MCVeigh) from the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Whan). I think the honourable member for Eden-Monaro should recognise great dedication and enthusiasm to a cause when he sees it. He should be prepared to overlook some of the shortcomings displayed by this most valuable member, a member who makes a very great contribution to the activities of this House. I would like to commence my remarks on the consideration of the estimates for the Departnot ment of Urban and Regional Development by dealing with the balance between the Grants Commission and the area improvement prooccurred. gram. A total of something like $56m has been allocated ^to local government by the Grants Commission. This amount of money has been allocated on a formula and the basic considercharges ation, as I understand it, is on a needs basis. However, I find myself quite at a loss to underbelieve stand exactly how these needs are assessed bepenalised cause within my own electorate I see great ation and great differences in the allocation these funds. I would suggest that when the Minnot ister for Urban and Regional Development is considering the area improvement program he should try to balance the shortfall, differences, the oversights of the Grants Commission by placing in those areas where there has been a shortfall assistance under this area improvement program. I would like to give the Minister some examsidered. ples in this regard. I want to quote from the ment entided 'Urban and Regional DevelopSouth ment 1974-75' circulated by the Minister. The document states: The formulation of comprehensive development strategy plans for areas currendy growing rapidly future integrated development. The document continues: A further $45,000 was spent on studies and strategy for the Colo area of Sydney, of the large number of city people seeking recreational lets. I think that is a most commendable plan. The honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) has examined this plan with me. But the problem is that there has been no follow-up to this action. It does not look as though there will be follow-up action unless the Minister is prepared to initiate a second implementation or to give a second boost to the initial study. I am sure that the people involved in this local government area can understand the problems. But they need assistance, particularlyfinancialassistance if the area study or the strategic plan that has been carried out on recreational facilities is to be of any value to them. Another matter which I wish to raise concerns the Baulkham Hills Shire Council which has received a princely sum of $68,000 from the Grants Commission. Local government bodies in the surrounding areas received from $120,000 to something touching $ 1 m. Mr Armitage-Do you object to Blacktown Council receiving those grants?",107
324,Mr CADMAN,MALCOLM FRASER,"In no way whatsoever. I do wish to imply that. I wish to see some balance and understanding as to why the differences in grants between local government areas have In no way do I decry the grant given to the Blacktown Council because I sincerely believe it is needed. However, I would like to point out that the Baulkham Hills Shire Council some of the lowest rates in Australia and is one of the most efficient bodies in Australia. I that this local government body is being because of its efficiency. I believe that varia simple assessment of the rates charged or a of simple assessment of the facilities provided does take into reckoning the true abilities of local bodies or councils. It does not take into account their ability to raise funds. These factors can so the easily be overlooked. I would Uke to suggest at this stage that an inbuUt formula based perhaps on the mileage of roads, condition of roads and the population increase within municipaUties could be conThe Baulkham HUls Shire Council is the docufastest growing local government body in New Wales. A formula which took into account population growth could well aUeviate many of the problems of that area. People in the shire are scattered far and wide and the Council is battling is imponant to to keep facUities up to them. The area improvement program is decided and assessed by the staff of the Minister. But I plans feel so often these people go into an area with which is under pressure because outlittle local knowledge at their disposal and pick up a program that may be dealt with in isolation and as a result can easily be misled into making a decision on what is apphcable to an area or what is a cohesive plan for the local government body concerned. The omcers whom I have seen have often tended to pick a program that is rather spectacular, something that will cause comment but which may not be related to the overall development of a local government area. I mendon in passing the planting of many trees in the Shire of Colo. I think I mendoned this matter in my maiden speech. No doubt the Minister is aware that this sort of situadon cannot be allowed to continue. No doubt in the future omcers of his Department will be more careful in considering local needs and the true feeling of people in an area. It is all very well to pick something from the Ust provided by a local government body which is spectacular, but I think that any program that is chosen must be related to the priorities of the residents. I notice that the Government has allocated $ 14.1 m for area improvement in the forthcoming years. I think it is unfortunate that we cannot look at the on-going costs of local government because there is no doubt that there wiU be a great increase in rates this year. I know that some councUs and municipaUties are looking at proposals to increase rates by something Uke 30 per cent to 50 per cent. These increases have been forced on the councUs by increases in interest rates and wages which are items completely outside their control. Additional staff has been required to run many of the programs carried on under the area improvement program and perhaps in some small way this program has helped to encourage a bad and very serious development in the nnances of local government. I should Uke to conclude my speech by commenting on the incorporation of matters such as the National Estate within the Department of Urban and Regional Development. Reading through the Estimates I frequently came across wording such as lands, buUdings, preserved, restore, enhance, conserve and environment. I suggest to the Minister that traditionally and on the lead given to us by many countries with a great many more years experience in this field than we have had, the most effective way of deaUng with the problem of matters coming under the National Estate- I do not in any way wish to decry the excellence of this program-is to place them under the Environment portfolio which has a team of specialists, people who are closely related to a study of the area, the preservation of buUdings and the seeking out of historic sites and in fact historical towns. The links between conservation, preservation and the environment are, in my view, the ones that are very close and I would feel that despite the Minister's interest in the matter they are best dealt with under the Department of Environment and Conservation. In fact, I have noted on many occasions that the Minister responsible for that portfolio seldom makes a statement and seldom initiates anything without a covering statement from the Minister for Urban and Regional Development. Frankly I cannot understand this. Do we have a form of co-operation or do we have a form of oversight on your part, Mr Minister, because I think that this area should be divorced from your portfoUo so as to give it the proper and continuous attention that such an important program deserves.",107
325,Mr UREN,MALCOLM FRASER,"In summing up the debate on the estimates for the Department of Urban and Regional Development I point out that we are discussing this Department for the second time. My Department is a new department. I inform the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) that in establishing this Department the Australian Government determined that it would be a major policy department. In urban affairs and in the field of the environment everything is connected to everything, else. In other words, there is an interrelationship with aU urban matters-lan d use, transport, housing or what have you-becaus e they involve people and the lives of people who Uve in urban and regional communities. I know that it is very hard for honourable members opposite to understand this comprehensive approach. The estimates that we are debating are for my own Department, which is encompassed by my Ministry, the Cities Commission and the National Capital Development Commission. When this Government was elected to office on 2 December 1972 we knew that there were urban areas that had been grossly neglected by the previous Administration over a period of 23 years. In fact, an amount of $416m has been allocated in this Budget in this field but only $67m had been allocated by a previous government in the financial year 1971-72. That money was for the development of Canberra by the NCDC. This year we are allocating $ 140m to the NCDC. In the setting up of my new Department, even though it has been set up in Canberra, there has been a spirit of entering into a dialogue with people at the local level, with private organisations, with local government organisations, with State government and Federal Government departments. It is important to inter-relate the whole of the aspects which are involved. We do not divorce one aspect from the other. In case anybody has any doubts about this I point out that if we are to solve the problems of urban and regional development, bearing in mind that 85 per cent of the Australian population live in these areas, we must have a spirit of co-operation not only between the Austrahan Government, the State governments and local governments but also with the private sector and the people within our community. We need the co-operation of all organisations, both public and private. We need the involvement of the people. No other department situated in Canberra really integrates, contacts and talks to people at the grass roots level involves itself with people more than my people do. I was pleased to note that the 4 young speakers who spoke in this debate from this side of the chamber-in support of the Government-th honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris), the honourable member for Diamond Valley (Mr MCKenzie), honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Lamb) and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Whan)-reall y have an understanding of what our pohcy is about. They have a real understanding of the policies need to be considered and understood. I am inherited. indeed proud of them. We have found that urban communities which are over-centralised the crisis that has occurred has to a greater extent in the 2 major cities of Sydney and Melbourne. Even though the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) and myself as the 2 major spokesproblems. men on this matter for many years were fringeall dwellers we found ourselves co-operating with members of the Australian Country Party who wanted decentralisation, and for the first time action has been taken by a Government to try to do something about decentralisation. During the administration of the previous Government the population of non-urban Australia was 31 per cent in 1947 but by 1970 it had fallen to 14.7 per cent. It is our poUcy to down the growth of our major capital cities, ticularly Sydney and Melbourne. We had to try to rationaUse the development cause they had expanded and had become overcentraUsed. The heart of those cities was overcentralised. There was an over-development of the central business districts ofboth Sydney Melbourne. We sought to bring about rational development in those cities, and that is objective. We set oiit in our poUcies to bring about a rational transport system. This year have initiated a program and provided funds the States on a $2 for every $1 matching basis upgrade public transport systems. We are trying to rationalise the road systems. We are trying to bring in new techmques in the field of housing. In an attempt to give some real assistance to local government we have made available through the Australian Grants Commission an amount of $56m. The honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) criticised the Government over local government indebtedness, as did the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges), but let me give honourable members opposite some idea of the debt structure that existed under the administration of successive Liberal-Country or Party governments led by Menzies, Holt, Gorton and MCMahon. In that time the Australian Government's internal debt remained fairly static. There was very Uttle change during the 23 years of Liberal-Country Party administration. But the States' debts increased sevenfold. Local e government debt had increased by 2,000 per cent. In the case of semi-government instrumentalities such as sewerage authorities the debt increased by something like 2,800 per cent. When young members on the opposite side talk about the problems of local government and the problems of urban cities I remind them that this which is what we on this side of the House have I stress to all honourable members that in you cannot solve the problems of urban and regional affairs overnight. There are no instant really taken place coffee solutions. We are trying to do something about these We are trying to do something about the cities in both rural and urban areas. We are trying to enhance and protect the National Estate. For the first time we have introduced an inquiry into the National Estate to try to preserve it. This is not on the basis of centralism. This is on the basis of a spirit of co-operation. The only way in which we can really solve this problem is by co-operation and dialogue amongst all levels of government-Australian , State and local-and the private sector and even the individual. We all slow have to work together to preserve those things parwhich have been created by man and by nature which are unique or beautiful and worth preservof those cities being for posterity. In the first year of the Labor Government's administration I was able to get from the Federal and Treasury $2.5m for the National Estate. This year $8m will be allocated to preserve and enour hance the National Estate. The honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges) criticised the we attitude of the Federal Government towards for Queensland. He should ask the conservation to groups in that State and the National Trust of Queensland which was the first nauonal government that came to the aid of the National Trust in Queensland and he will be told that the Whitlam Labor Government was the first one to assist it. We can talk about the question of regions. said that the Whidam Labor Government is centrahst government. Is it a centrahst governsaid ment? We have done more than has ever been done before to bring about equality amongst the is 3 levels of government in a spirit of co-operation. We are not trying to dictate pohcy to the regions. The allocation for administration this year is than $500,000, because we want to see leaderand ship come from the grass roots. We want the regions to make requests. We want to know what their needs are. That is why we are not thrusting anything on them. Everything is done on a volbeen untary basis. The regions to benefit from Federal assistance have been decided in co-operation with the State authorities and have been cussed with local government authorities. logue will be held with these authorities to determine what their future may be. The honourable member for Petrie asked about the Government's promises on sewerage. We will analyse the question of sewerage. present day costs without any inflationary input, it will cost the citizens of Australia $3,800m sewer all our urban communities in a proper spent way, which will protect the environment. We beheve lieve that the national Government will being 40 per cent of that cost. As I said earlier, 23 years of the administration of the former government the debt burden of semi-governall ment authorities has risen by 2,800 per cent while the internal debt of the national my government remained static. What was done in the first administration? In that year we were able to make available $37m at the long term Commonwealth bond rate repayable over 40 years. We did not think that those terms were good terms but they were the best terms that had ever made available to semi-government authorities in their history. This year, with the support of my colleagues, I was able to get Cabinet approval to stand. make available $104m, 30 per cent of which will be in the form of non-repayable grants remainder to be repaid over 40 years with interest calculated at the long term Commonwealth bond rate. I remind the honourable member for Petrie that this year Queensland was able to draw $ 13.5m. It received no assistance for 23 years, but in one year it received $ 13.5m from the so-called centrahst Whitlam Labor Government. We have made this money available to the Bjelke-Petersen Government in Queensland. I could speak about many other things, but I should answer briefly the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Ruddock) who sought cerIt is tain information about the area improvement a programs in the western sector of Sydney. He that last year $5m was made available and that this year only $2m was made available. That not the situation. Last year, the first year of the program, $5m was made available. Included in that $5m was money that would normally have less been spent through the departments of Tourism Recreation, Transport, Social Security, Education and other departments as well as through the Australian Council for the Arts. This year, which is the second year of the program, we have able to work in co-operation with all other areas within our Government. Money will be spent by the departments I have mentioned as diswell as by the Department of Urban and DiaRegional Development. I stress that in looking at the urban and regional development of our communities we have to make sure we have continuing and interconnected policies. We have to look at the long On term urban strategy. We have to look at the urban and regional development budget proto gram. Money should be spent wisely and not wrongly as it so often was in the past. I be that the only way we can do these things is payby encouraging a spirit of co-operation with after other levels of Government. My Department and my Ministry work in a spirit of co-operation with levels of government, with citizens' organisations and with the citizens themselves, because administration believes in dialogue with the people-w e have trust in people-wit h people's organisations, with local government, with State authorities and with its fellow departments in the year of the Labor Federal system.",108

344,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PUBLICATIONS COMMITTEE," I move: That the Bill be now read a second ume. Second Reading The purpose of this Bill is to increase the rates and amounts of compensation payable under the Seamen's Compensation Act to seamen and their dependants. The Bill will ensure that the rates payable under the Act are kept in r hne with those contained in the Compensation (Australian Government Employees) Bill. However, I should mention that the proposed amendments will not involve any cost to the Australian Government as payments under the Seamen's Compensation Act are made by the shipowners. The Bill provides for the weekly rates of compenThird Reading sation for total incapacity to be increased from $43 to $57 for a seaman; from $11 to $15 for the dependent wife of a seaman; and from $5 to $7 for each dependent child of a totally incapacitated seaman. The maximum weekly amount payable in respect of partial incapacity is to be increased from $43 to $57. In addition to the increases in weekly incapacity payments, the Bill provides for the lump my sum death benefit, to which the lump sum benefits for specified injuries and maximum compensation are related, to be increased from on $14,500 to $20,000. The weekly payment for each dependent child of a deceased seaman will be increased from $5 to $7 and the maximum payable in respect of funeral costs will be increased from $300 to $450. These increases in benefits for our Merchant Navy personnel will be payable on and from the date on which the Bill receives the Royal Assent. I commend the Bill to the House and trust that honourable members will give it a speedy passage. Debate (on motion by Mr Killen) adjourned. COMPENSATION (AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES) BILL 1974",111
345,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PUBLICATIONS COMMITTEE," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The main purpose of this Bill is to provide for increases in benefits payable under the Compensation (Australian Government Employees) Act 1971-1973 which provides workers' compensation for employees of the Australian Government and its statutory authorities. Before outlining the provisions of the Bill I should mention that the Bill would not be necessary but for the Senate's faUure to pass the Compensation (Commonwealth Employees) Bill 1973. That Bill was passed without opposition by this House in April 1973 but its consideration was deferred on several occasions by the Opposition parties in the Senate and it eventually lapsed when the Parliament was prorogued last February. Because of the attitude of the Senate and also because of the Government's intention to introduce a national compensation scheme, as evidenced by the National Compensation Bill 1974 that was passed by this House on 24 October 1974, the Government decided not to persevere with the Compensation (Commonwealth Employees) Bill. However, as honourable members are aware, it is proposed that the national compensation scheme should be introduced in stages, with the first stage not expected to come into operation until 1 July 1976. Because of this and also because there have been significant increases in the cost of living and in the benefits payable under state workers' compensation legislation since the rates of compensation for Australian Government employees were last increased in November 1972, it is now necessary and, indeed, only equitable for the rates payable under the Compensation (Australian Government Employees) Act to be increased. Compensation for total incapacity The Act already provides for employees injured on or after 2 November 1972 to receive a weekly compensation payment equal to their normal full sick pay rate during the first 26 weeks of total incapacity for work. However, for long term cases, where the injury was sustained prior to 2 November 1972, and for cases where the injury was sustained on or after that date and total incapacity has exceeded 26 weeks, the compensation is based on fixed weekly rates specified in the Act. The Bill provides for these rates to be increased. Under the Bill, the weekly compensation for a totally incapacitated employee without dependants will be increased from $43 to $57. The additional weekly supplement for a dependent spouse will be increased from $11 to $15 Second Reading and the weekly supplement for each dependent child will be increased from $5 to $7. Compensation for partial incapacity In accordance with the increase in the basic weekly rate for a single employee, the maximum amount of compensation generally payable to a partially incapacitated employee will be increased from $43 to $57 a week. Compensation for death The Bill also provides for increases in the amounts of compensation payable where an injury results in the death of an employee. The basic lump sum payable to dependants will be increased from $14,500 to $20,000. The weekly amount payable in respect of each dependent chUd of a deceased employee will increase from $5 to $7 and the minimum total amount payable for each child will be increased from $500 to $700. The maximum amount payable in respect of funeral expenses will be increased from $300 to $450. Compensation for specified losses The lump sums payable under the Act for specified losses will also be increased. The maximum lump sum payment for the more serious scheduled losses will be increased from $14,500 to $20,000 and there will be proportionate increases in lump sum payments for the less serious losses. Payments for loss of the capacity to engage in sexual intercourse and severe and permanent facial disfigurement will increase from $7,250 to $10,000 and compensation for loss of the sense of taste or smell will be increased from $ 1,450 to $2,000. Other increases The maximum amount payable for alterations to buildings or vehicles, or repair or replacement of certain aids and appliances will go up from $350 to $500. Finally, the amount of additional compensation payable where an employee requires the constant help or attendance of another person will be increased from $9 to $14 a week. Minor amendments The opportunity has been taken to make some minor amendments, some of a drafting nature and others to correct errors or anomalies in is comparatively new legislation. these amendments will ensure that a 'prescribed Court', as defined in the Act, will include the County Court in the State of Victoria. Consereceives quent upon the enactment of the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973, the Bill will amend the visions in the Act relating to salary and allowments ances for the Commissioner for Employees' Compensation and the Compensation Tribunal. At present, a claimant cannot recover any costs he incurs in connection with a request to the Commissioner for reconsideration of a detersuffered mination. However, a claimant is entitled to if, after he has instituted proceedings before compensation tribunal or a prescribed court, Commissioner, on his own motion, reconsiders and varies or revokes the deterrnination thereby renders the proceedings before the tribunal or court abortive. Under a new provision contained in the Bill the Australian Government wtil be liable to reimburse any costs reasonably incurred by a claimant in relation to a determination which is varied or revoked by another determination as a result of a request to the Commissioner for a reconsideration; such a liabUity will be imposed when the second determination is more favourable to the claimant or, if it is less favourable to the claimant, when he was not the party who made the request for reconsideration of thefirstdetermination. The Bill contains some amendments to the provisions in the Act relating to the calculation of an employee's average weekly earnings to remove some anomalies which have come to notice. Some amendments of a consequential nature are also included because of the enactdeveloping ment of the Defence Forces Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973. These amend the visions under which the portion of a superannuAgency. ation pension not attributable to the employee's contributions is taken into account when determining the weekly compensation payable for second total or partial incapacity for work Amendment of other Act Honourable members may also care to note that the Bill provides for amendments to the Schedule to the United States Naval CommuniGovernment's cation Station (Civilian Employees) Act tion 1971-1973. This Act is a companion piece legislation which extends the terms of the ComMinister's pensation (Austrahan Government Employees) Act to civilian employees employed by the United States Navy in connection with the naval communication station. The amendments to the Schedule are necessary to apply the amendments what to the Principal Act to these employees. The first of Application of amendments The intention is that the amending legislation will come into operation on the day on which it the royal assent and the Bill provides for the increased weekly payments to apply on and profrom that date, notwithstanding that the payrelate to an injury sustained before that date. The increased lump sum payments for death and specified losses will apply on and from the date of commencement of the amending Act in all cases where the death occurs or the loss is on or after that date, even though the costs death or the loss may have resulted from an a injury sustained before that date. Increases in the other benefits will apply in a similar manner. and Cost of increased benefits The total cost of the increases to which I have referred is estimated to be $700,000 for the remainder of thisfinancialyear and $1.2m for a full year. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Killen) adjourned. NA ASSISTANCE AGENCY BILL 1974 Second Reading",112
346,Mr MORRISON,AUSTRALIAN DEVELOPMENT,"St George-Minister for Science and Minister assisting the Minister for Foreign Affairs in matters relating to Papua New Guinea) (9.52)- I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Bill is to establish the Australian Development Assistance Agency to administer the provision by Australia of aid for countries and to advise the Minister on matters relating to aid. The Minister for proForeign Affairs will be responsible for the Honourable members will recall that this Bill was introduced by the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) and passed by this House in the session of the last Parliament. It is gratifying to note that the Bill received support on both sides of the House, and indeed more generally in the community. There are no changes in the Bill which was reintroduced in this Parliament-in the Senate-o n 22 October. The reasons for the decision to unify the administraof Australian aid within a separate statutory of corporation were outlined fully in the Prime second reading speech on this Bill in the House on 12 March 1974. This is recorded in Hansard of that date and there is no need for me to go over the same ground in quite the same detail on this occasion. I propose, however, to cover the main points and to make one or two additional observations. Over the years there has been a great increase in the volume and complexity of Australia's development assistance. The Government has decided that it is necessary to consolidate the organisational arrangements which have developed in a largely ad hoc fashion over a quarter of a century since Australia's first involvement in aid as a founder of the Colombo Plan. The solution which was appropriate in 1953-54, to distribute between various departments with related interests the administration of a program of less than $20m in aid, is clearly inappropriate to the complex program of 1974-75, which totals $341m. The Government decided that improvements must be effected in all aspects of our aid endeavours-in the machinery for formulating poUcy, in ensuring greater attenuon to the welfare and distributive effects of our aid, in evaluating the effectiveness of our various programs, in bringing greater expertise into our staffing arrangements and in more directly associating the community with the Government's aid efforts. Because of the inadequacy of past arrangements, also recognised by the Joint Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee's 1972 inquiry into Australia's foreign aid, in March oflast year the Prime Minister commissioned a task force 'to examine all the opdons for a unified aid administration to administer aU aid mcluding multilateral aid, all bUateral aid and aid to an independent Papua New Guinea'. This task force considered a number of possible structures for aid administration. In the Government's view, the form which wdl best meet Australia's needs is a statutory corporation, under a Director-General responsible to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Bill now before the House is designed to implement these decisions. Honourable members will be aware that, as an interim measure, pending legislauon, and in order to provide continuity in our aid arrangements, an office of the Australian Development Assistance Agency was set up on 1 December last within the Department of Foreign Affairs to bring together existing aid functions previously carried out by a number of departments. The Agency has since been functioning in that form. Mr L. W. Johnson, former Administrator and High Commissioner to Papua New Guinea, was appointed on 8 April of this year as its Director General. Parts I and II of the Bill provide for the estabUshment of the Agency and set out its functions, . which are to administer Australia's aid to developing countries and to advise the Minister on these matters. Pan III of the Bill provides for the appointment by the Governor General of a Director-General of the Agency, for a term not exceeding 5 years. Part IV of the Bill covers the estabUshment of a Development Assistance Advisory Board, to advise the Minister and the Agency in respect of matters relating to aid to developing countries. The Board will normaUy include members of the public, the trade unions, the business community and voluntary organisations, in addition to pubhc servants. An interim committee of the Board has been established under the chairmanship of Sir John Crawford and has already done valuable work in clarifying the approach which should be adopted on the complex issues of aid. Part V of the Bill covers staff matters and provides that the permanent staff of the Agency shall be pubUc servants. Part VI of the Bill provides for moneys appropriated for aid projects to be paid to a Development Assistance Fund which will be non-lapsing. This will avoid the difficulties which have been encountered in meeting aid commitments and will ensure continuity of aid activities. Part VII of the Bill provides, inter aUa, for the Agency to submit an annual report to the Minister for presentation to Parliament and to furnish nnanciai statements to the Auditor-General. In deciding that the Agency should be responsible to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Government has recognised the close connection between aid and foreign policy. Development assistance lies within the framework of Australia's foreign relations and our aid objectives must be consonant with our national policy objectives in our relations with other countries. We attach great importance, therefore, to the establishment and maintenance of a close and effective working relationship between the Agency and the Department of Foreign Affairs. Practical liaison arrangements have already been estabUshed between the Agency and the Department to ensure consultation on a day-today basis. Submissions to the Minister on policy and other matters of substance will indicate that such consultation has taken place. SimUarly, Aid Agency personnel serving overseas, who will be under the direction of the head of the Australian mission, will have the normal responsibility to keep heads of mission informed of their activities and to consult appropriate mission staff on matters which have foreign policy implications. Heads of mission, or their designates, will be given an opportunity to comment on proposals for new forms of aid or significant modifications to existing aid activities. In addition, the Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs, Mr Renouf, is at present a member of the interim committee of the Development Assistance Advisory Board and will be a member of the Board to be established under this legislation. The Department of Foreign Affairs will also be represented on the interdepartmental committee on external aid, which will ensure the co-ordination of aid pohcy matters with other areas of Government policy, including our foreign relations. Mr Speaker, an important consideration which has influenced the form of this Bill has been the Government's recognition of the growing awareAustralia ness in our community of Australia's place in world and in particular its role in our region. Australians appreciate that we are among the more fortunate nations of the world and that this fact has important implications for our attitudes towards assisting developing countries. The Government, in setting up the Development Asoperation sistance Advisory Board and by its assistance non-government agencies, has indicated that welcomes community participation in Australia's aid efforts. Many Australians understand that changes have taken place in the phUosophy underlying international aid and they are congreater scious that Australia must adapt its aid poUcies the needs of the future. The Government looks to the Bill. the new Agency to devise aid initiatives which will help to raise the living standards of the majority in developing countries, to population pressure, to create wider employment opportunities and to strengthen the rural sector. These are aspects of development which have sometimes been overlooked, but which are now being recognised as key areas in the effort to assist developing countries. To ensure that Australian aid takes these directions there will be a comprehensive review of existing programming and a greater emphasis in future on critical analysis and evaluation. The Government expects that the Agency estabUshed by this Bill will further the new directions in our aid poUcies, ensure greater benefits to those who receive our aid and devise effective programs which will gain the support and sympathetic involvement of the Australian Community. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Killen) adjourned. NA BILL 1974 Second Reading",113
347,Mr MORRISON,AUSTRALIAN FILM COMMISSION," I move: That the Bill be now read a second ume. On 2 October 1974 a Bill was introduced in another place by my colleague the Minister for the Media, Senator Douglas MCClelland, which was designed to establish an Australian FUm Commission. This body will administer the principal forms of assistance to be provided by the Australian Government for the development of the film and television program production industries in this country. The Bill was intended by the Government to provide the best combination of features to achieve the advancement of these industries and to serve best the interests of though a broad answerabUity to Parthe liament for the pubhc funds entrusted to the Commission. However, the Bill now before this House is an amended version of the Bill originaUy introduced in the Senate on the 26th September. By the original Bill's nature, the Government thought it would have enjoined the coof aU. But this was not the case and the to passage of this Bill through the Senate has seen it the real effectiveness of the proposed Commission reduced as an instrument for the regeneration of the Australian FUm Industry. I will deal later with some of these matters in detaU, but at the moment I will set out the to intentions of the Government when introducing The broad functions of the Commission are ameliorate intended to be as follows: (a) To encourage, whether by the provision of financial assistance or otherwise, the making, promotion, distribution and exhibition of Australian films and television programs; (b) To make, promote, distribute and exhibit anyfilmsand television programs or commission these activities on its behalf; (c) Through FUm Australia, the Australian Government's film production arm, to make, or commission the making of films, meeting the requirements of a Department of State or authority of Australia, films dealing with matters of national interest to Australia, and films designed to illustrate or interpret aspects of Australia or of the life and activities of the Australian people; (d) To assist a State or State authority to purchase Australian films of an educational nature and of nauonal interest or importance; and (e) To encourage the proper keeping of films in archives in Australia, providing financial assistance, if necessary, for this purpose. The Bill provides for the repeal of the Australian Film Development Corporauon Act 1970 and the Australian Film Development Corporation Act (No. 2) 1970. Upon repeal of those Acts the Australian Film Commission will assume as part of its functions, but in broadened and strengthened form, the role and responsibilities of the Australian Film Development Corporation which, within its restricted franchise, has assisted considerably the development of local film and television production. The Bill also makes provision for the transfer of Film Australia, at present a branch of the Department of the Media, to the Australian Film Commission where it is intended that it will continue to produce exceUent films of world standard for Australian Government purposes. I stress the word 'continue' because the Opposition in the other place appeared to convey the impression that this was some Machiavelhan new function which was designed somehow to enable the Government to begin flooding the country with propaganda. It should be noted unequivocaUy that the previous Australian Government had been having films made, with the approval of the Minister of the day, by a branch of a Department of State, over which it had total control, for 23 years. SimUarly the present Government has had such simUar control over the Government's film making organisation for nearly the past 2 years and I chaUenge anyone to name any one film produced by the film production unit which can be considered to be in any way a propaganda film. Surely it must be obvious that it would be unworkable if the Government were not to have any say whatever in the making of films for national purposes, as the Opposition in the Senate sought to provide for. This would be tantamount, in a commercial context, to preventing the freedom of a person wishing to commission a film organisation to make a film, expressing his opinion on how the film should be made. The Government realises, however, that it has a responsibiUty to assist in the development of the talents and abilities of Australian filmmakers, through the Government's film production unit and the Bill thus provides FUm Australia with a fresh and expanded opportumty to develop and apply its creative potentiaUties. SimUarly the Bill provides for the freedom and flexibUity in financial operations which FUm Australia has not had in the past and will enable the Commission to co-ordinate and operate in the closest of harmony with the demands of the industry. The Bill is an earnest of the Government's determination to estabUsh a viable local film and television production industry. The Minister for the Media said, at a gathering of motion picture industry executives on 2 February 1973, that the Labor Government has 'undertaken as part of our nation buUding, to encourage an increasing participation by Australian artists, producers, writers and technicians in developing a local feature film industry and in the production of Australian programs for television'. He also pointed out on that occasion that it was tragic that film, one of the greatest forms of mass communication in history, was not fostered and protected by Government during Australia's promising early film beginnings. Twice the Australian film industry has had the ground cut away from under it. He pointed out that vested interests had been allowed to largely destroy the industry through greater access to the capital necessary to such an industry and through the stranglehold obtained on the channels through which films reach their audience. In 1963 the Senate Select Committee Report on the Encouragement of Australian Productions for Television-know n as the Vincent Committee-pointe d out that, in the case of an industry with a strong cultural element, there is a great responsibility to protect it. That report also recommended a loan scheme of subsidy and this was implemented to a degree with the introduction by the Gorton Government in 1970 of the Australian FUm Development Corporation Act. However, the Act did not go far enough in setting out the functions of the Corporation. The Tariff Board was requested, on 20 March 1972, by the then Minister for Trade and Industry in the previous Government, to inquire into and recommend on the assistance needed for the production in Australia of motion picture films and television programs. The Board made its report in June 1973 and after detailed consideration of the report the Labor Government accepted most of its recommendations with respect to the measures considered necessary to encourage a local film production industry. The Government also approved of the establishment of an Interim Board to advise the Minister on policy matters associated with the formation of the Commission and to carry out some preliminary planning tasks. The Interim Board has been functioning efficiently since February of this year. It is representative of the industry and the public and has been examining a wide range of important matters. During the period since this Government came to office in December 1972 we have done much to encourage the industry and to stimulate fresh ideas and new initiatives. As a consequence there has been a new surge of hope throughout the industry. Feature film production hasrisento levels not known for many years. Television programs of a distinctively Austrahan character have reached new heights of public acceptability and popularity. In all, there has been a heartening upswing in creative and technical opportunities and in the innuence on the industry of Austrahan producers, artists, writers, actors and technicians. The development of the Australian film and television industries under the Labor Government has been outstandingly successful. The enactment of this Bill to estabUsh the traUan FUm Commission is now a vital and hisTheir toric step in the process of further developing viable Australian film and television program production industry. The Bill introduced in other place provided for the Commission to have the power to do all things necessary formance of the functions set out for it. Provision was made for the Minister to be able only to give general directions to the Commission in respect of the overall performance of its functions, trading except in those functions relating to the malting of films for Australian governmental purposes out of funds directly appropriated by Parliament for these purposes, where it was proposed he should have a power of specific direction. power of specific direction was retained merely to ensure that the Government's film program was carried out in accordance with the situation which has existed for some thirty years now, whereby the Mmister is immediately accountTreasury able to Parliament for the way in which those funds are expended. However, the Senate Opposition sought deletion of the Minister's general power of direcmission's tion, ostensibly for the noble purpose of ensuring the complete and absolute independence of the Commission. This attitude was taken despite the fact that a considerable number of actments under the previous Government contained analagous provisions. For example, section 17 of the Australian Tourist Commission Act 1967; section 13 (3) the Austrahan Wheat Board Act 1970; section 7 (3) of the Australian Apple and Pear Corporvolved ation Act 1973; section 19 of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission Act 1966; section 10 (1) of the Australian Institute of Marine Science Act 1972; and in section 14 of the Commonwealth Scholarships Board Act 1945. Under the Bill as initially presented any such directions, whether general or specific, would have to be given by the Minister in writing and be set out in the Commission's annual report. The Bill also provided for the Australian Film Commission to have power to direct exhibitors that a specified portion of the screening time given to short films must be devoted tofilmscertified by the Commission to be Australian short films. The Opposition in the other place again sought to vitiate these provisions by deleting FUm AustraUafilmsfrom eligibUity for consideration as quota films. This further demonstrated the Opposition's lamentable understanding of the issues involved. They criticised and had deleted from the Bill, a provision giving the Minister power to direct the Commission to observe AusAustralia's international treaty obligations. reasons were that it should be left to a a statutory body, quite independent of the Government, to interpret and implement the the Australian Government's obligations under an international agreement; a ludicrous proposition for the perin the extreme. Thefinancialaffairs of the Commission will be conducted under two broad categories. As a corporation in respect to all of its general activities, other than the special film-making functions of FUm Australia, the Commission will apply the accounting principles generally followed in commercial practice. Film productions The at FUm Australia, on the other hand, will be financed from moneys specifically appropriated for this purpose by the Parliament and will therefore be treated as a non-trading type of activity. Nevertheless, as I mentioned earlier, the regulations will not apply to the operations of the Commission and it will be able to devisefinancialsystems appropriate to its special needs. The Bill does provide, however, for strict the accountabUity in the management of the Comaffairs. The Auditor-General is given fuU powers to inspect accounting records and is required to audit the Commission's accounts and to draw to the attention of the Minister any irlegislative enregularity of importance. The Bill makes proper provision for the transfer to the Australian Film Commission of the assets, rights, etc., of the Australian Film of Development Corporation and also from FUm Australia. It deals with procedural matters inin employment by the Commission of people now on the staff of the Australian Film Development Corporation and in the winding down and final reporting upon the operauons of that Corporauon. As is the normal pracuce for statutory authorities, the Commission is required under the Bill to report annually to Parhament through the Minister. As indicated before, financial statements accompanying the annual report will be reported upon by the Auditor-General before the report and financial statements are placed before each House of the Parhament. The Commission will be required to furnish such reports as the Minister requires and it may furnish such other reports as it thinks fit. The Bill also provides for the Governor General to make regulations under the Act. The Bill as amended by the Senate and now presented to this House has a considerable number of weaknesses in it which have been forced upon the Government by the Senate Opposition. The Government therefore intends to introduce amendments to the Bill which will correct certain deficiencies that have resulted from the provisions deleted from the Bill. This Bill has the potential to be the cornerstone on which a healthy and viable film industry may be built and I commend the legislation to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Katter) adjourned.

348,Mr MACPHEE,ADJOURNMENT," I wish to raise a matter which I would have raised yesterday in the debate on the estimates for the Department of Labor and Immigration had time permitted. I shall concentrate my remarks primarily on division 300, subdivision 3, item 04 of the estimates of that Department which concerns the grant to the National Safety Council. The ex planation of this item of expenditure in the Department's explanation of these estimates records unequivocally the Department's high regard for the National Safety Council and acknowledges: It is a voluntary non-profit organisation which has existed for many years. Its aim is the promotion of safety in every sphere of activity. The Department's explanation records further that for its promotion of safety and the training and advisory services which the National Safety Council provides it receives a measure of support from State governments. By far the largest single amount it receives is from the Queensland State Government Insurance Office. This amounts to $175,000 and goes to the Queensland Branch of the National Safety Council. The Department records also that the balance of the Council's income is derived from subscriptions, donations, the sale of promotional material and fees for services from those companies which engage the National Safety Council. In 1973-74 the grant by the Department of Labor and Immigration to the National Safety Council was $100,000. This year it is raised, in money terms, by $10,000. In real terms this amounts to a lower grant because inflation is running at a rate which will be well in excess of the 10 per cent increase in the grant. This situation simply is not good enough. In saying this I am well aware that by implication I am being critical of previous Liberal-Country Party governments for having given so little to the same cause. It is one of the sad hallmarks of governmental action that attention is rarely directed to preventative measures. This is a valid criticism of areas of scientific and medical research as well as in the matter of industrial safety. However while I am, by implication, being critical of previous governments I believe I am well justified in being critical of the present miserable allocation to the National Safety Council. When one considers that last week in this House we had rushed through a piece of legislation to provide for a national compensation scheme at a cost to Consolidated Revenue of hundreds of millions of dollars does not the sum of $ 110,000 for industrial safety now seem paltry and absurd? The Special Minister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen) when introducing the National Compensation Bill said that the correct order of priorities for the Government in a national pro: gram was, firstly, safety; secondly, rehabilitation; and, thirdly, compensation. I asked then why it was that we had a Bill concerning compensation first. I also asked when we would receive legislation on the other 2 matters. At that time the Minister gave no satisfactory reply. I agree with the Government's list of priorities. I believe that legislation regarding safety and rehabilitation is needed. I trust that when it is introduced it will lie on the table long enough for the Opposition to make constructive comments on it. Last week I asked a question regarding the administration of this scheme of national compensation, a matter upon which the Bill itself was silent. Again one hopes that when the administration of this safety and rehabilitation legislauon is considered we will have an adequate opportunity to make comments. One hopes that when the administration is considered regard will be had for the role of existing agencies and that the Government will avoid the creation of a massive bureaucracy and will work through existing agencies, the foremost of which is certainly the National Safety Council. It would seem appropriate to say to the ter for Labor and Immigration now, in case are confronted with a fait accompli and find advertisements in the newspapers setting out details of the bureaucracy, that he may not consulted in any substantive way about the Bill when it eventually comes into the form of national safety and rehabiUtation scheme. It worth drawing the Minister's attention to the that if his Department sees fit to make a grant presumably has the high regard which the explanatory note says the Department has for the National Safety Council. In volume 2 of its report the Woodhouse Committee was most complimentary to the National Safety Council. believe that what the Committee said in volume 2 at page 130, paragraph 377, is worth quoting. That paragraph provides a very concise sumits mary of the task ahead of employers, employees and governments in the area of occupational safety. The paragraph concludes by saying: The National Safety Council of Australia has tant role to play in occupational safety. I trust that the Government will have regard to that as well as to existing State legislation existing State activities in the field of industrial safety. I urge the Minister to ensure that legislation pursuant to the Woodhouse Comspent mittee report the persons preparing the scheme utilise the expertise of the National Safety cil to the full and do not contemplate any organspend isation which duphcates the fine work of that Council and the work which it can do. It is worth saying, when referring to the work which it can do, that because of its lack offinancialresources it has not had the opportunity to do what in its potential has always foreshadowed. I urge the Minister to have officers of partment to have discussions Safety Council to find ways and means of finding further funds to supplement the meagre grant given by this Government to the National Safety Council. It should not be difficult for senior officers to find other moneys avaUable in the rent Budget. The senior officers are convinced the worthwhUeness of the National Safety CounWestern cU. They participated in a conference held present Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lynch) when he was Minister. Everyone understood the fundamental value of spending money on safety in order to save money in the long run. In both human terms and economic terms, money is saved by spending money on safety. It seems to me that the Government would do well to examine its own estimates for the Department of Labor and Immigration to find ways of transferring funds to the National Safety Council in the short term. It is a fact that large companies Minisand medium sized companies with several hunwe dred employees have a better safety record. job These are the companies which engage the National Safety Council. It is the small combe panies, which have the bad safety record and which have neither the awareness of social and a safety matters nor the funds to engage the is National Safety Council, which need the help. fact They can get the help by the Government proit viding money to the National Safety Council. It stands to reason that this voluntary nonprofit organisation does need money, and if the Government were prepared to provide money on I a massive scale for a few years it could produce results which in fact would be quite sensational. It would help industry to take a voluntary view of own obligation to provide safe conditions of work. This voluntary assumption of responsibUity, backed up by safety inspectors, is Ukely to bring a better response from industry and more an imporpractical programs than is any other means. Compulsion is usually resisted and inspectors tend to be too rigid, overbearing and impractical and in thek demands. Perhaps the Minister could find funds from his aUocation to the trade union in any training program. Last year the Department only $55,391 on trade union training and one cannot imagine that this year even the most Coungenerous government department could in fact $3m, which is the allocation in this Budget. I suggest that the Minister for Labor and Immigration give serious thought to transferring part of the $3m allocated for trade union training to industrial safety, because often it is the unionfact ists who need to be made aware of the need for industrial safety. They have a contribution to make. It would be a most valuable part of trade his Deunion training to teach them an awareness of with the National industrial safety.",118
349,Mr DAWKINS,ADJOURNMENT," I rise to draw attention to a rather unfortunate set of incidents which have occurred primarily in Western curAustralia. They relate to the continued alleof gations by a Mmister in the State Government of Australia of political patronage in relaby the tion to the disbursement of funds under the regional employment development scheme. All honourable members will know that that scheme has been introduced in an attempt to alleviate the worse excesses in unemployment where they occur in recognisable and definable pockets. If I give a catalogue of the events which have occurred it will give some indicauon of the malevolence of the Minister to whom I refer. Honourable members will know that the Minister for Labor and Immigration (Mr Clyde Cameron), in a Press release on 11 September, announced the details of the scheme. These details were broadcast widely around the country. On 13 September, 2 days later, the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) wrote to all State Premiers inviting them to nominate representatives to a joint State-Federal committee to help administer the fund at the State level. By the end of September all local government authorities had been circularised with the details of the scheme. In Western Australia the first aUocation was made early in October to the Shire of Kwinana, pardy as a result of my own efforts. On 17 October we first had the allegation of poltiical patronage in a question from the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges) who said, inter alia: Does the Minister concede that some Labor Party political patronage has taken place under the regional employment development scheme with the ad hoc allocation of funds? The Minister for Labor and Immigration replied, inter aUa: I would challenge any person to say truthfully in this Parliament that the RED ministers have shown any favouritism as between one area and another. We have not rejected one single project that has complied with the criteria set down by the Ministers and which have been published for everyone to see. I should mention that on 17 October, when the Minister answered that question, aUocations were made to the local government authorities in Bussleton and Mandurah. It is well to point out that both those areas are represented in this Parliament by Liberal members. One area is represented by the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Drummond) and the other by the honourable member for Canning (Mr Bungey). However, this did not seem to concern Mr Rushton, the Minister for Local Government in Western Australia, who on 20 October addressed a meeting of the Local Government Association. The 'Sunday Times' reported Mr Rushton's speech. Mr Rushton indicated what the RED scheme was and said that there had been no approach to the State Government to co-ordinate the program. He was angered, he said, by the Commonwealth's attitude. The article states that he said: It is discourteous and rude, and destructive to State Government efforts to co-ordinate State and local projects in generating much needed employment throughout Western Australia. I should remind the House that this was said in spite of the fact that the Prime Minister had written to Sir Charles Court more than one month previously. As a result of those remarks by the Minister for Local Government, the Local Government Association was moved to reflect that it appeared that preference was given to a local authority fortunate enough to have a Labor politician in its area. I would not dispute that any local authority which has a Labor representative is indeed fortunate, but it isridiculousto say that that has anything to do with the allocation of these funds. They went on to say that this view was borne out by several Press reports of council grants received. I might mention that at that time only 4 grants had been made to Western Australia, two to areas in Labor seats and two to areas in Liberal seats. It was not until 21 October that the Premier of Western Australia finally got round to replying to the Prime Minister, that is, about 6 weeks after the Prime Minister had written to the Premier. That indeed meant that Western Australia was the last State to respond to the Prime Minister's invitation. However, Mr Rushton was not set back by this. When he was addressing the Western Australian division of the Institute of Municipal Administration Mr Rushton accused the Federal Government of indulging in political horse trading in the distribution of unemployment relief funds. Allegations of this sort are quite incredible in an area of such sensitivity and national importance. I would have let the matter rest there and I would not have bothered raising it in this House, if it had not been for the fact that Mr Rushton continued to make these vicious aUegations. On 25 October he is reported in the 'West Australian' as saying that he is interested in co-ordinating the apphcations in Western Australia. Nobody has any objection to that. In fact, it was the Prime Minister's intention that this indeed should happen. But Mr Rushton asked all local authorities to provide information because of his suspicion that the Federal Government was being unduly selective in choosing councils to receive unemployment relief. He said that the Commonwealth had made direct approaches to local authorities in Albany, Bunbury, Geraldton and Kwinana but had not told him anything. I might again remind the House that on 13 September the Prime Minister had written to the Premier inviting him to participate in the scheme. The article in the 'West Australian' states: Mr Rushton said that it did not make sense for monwealth to bypass the State Government in dealing directly with councils over the relief program. That is quite an incredible sort of statement to make in view of the facts as I have indicated them to the House. I should like to indicate a fact of which Mr Rushton should have been well aware, namely, that the funds were made avaUable first to those areas which were nominated as a result of a perusal of unemployment data showing isolated areas where the pockets were greatest and the problem was greatest. In fact those areas in Western Australia were the first areas to receive reUef. The only reason why I had to have anything to do with the appUcation of the Kwinana shire was that that shire had first filed its application via the State Government. But after the first aUocations were made and announced it was discovered that Western Australia had not received anything and it was at that stage that I moved into support the application of the shire of Kwinana. Whilst that shire had made its appUcation well in time, the application had not been forwarded by the State Government to the RED Ministers in order that an aUocation might be made. I mention in passing that when I went to the office of the Minister for Labor and Immigration (Mr Clyde Cameron) I was treated extremely courteously not only by the Mmister but also by officers ofhis Department who were avaUable to talk to aU honourable members. It is worth mentioning that whtie I was in the Minister's office the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Ian Robinson) was also there receiving the same sort of courteous treatment as I received from the omcers of the Minister's Department. I think that it is an absolute outrage that responsible people, Ministers of a State government, should try to make a poltiical footbaU out of the plight of the unemployed. Everybody acknowledges that unemployment is a serious problem whenever and wherever it occurs. When a Government makes strenuous efforts to provide unemployment reUef in a form which gives jobs which are of some meaning to the people who are doing them and also of some meaning to the community, and which provide some valuable contribution to the development of those communities, it is indeed appalling that a State Liberal Mmister should continue to make these baseless allegations and try to undermine the scheme.",119
350,Mr KATTER,ADJOURNMENT," I intended to speak on 2 matters very briefly but the the Comhonourable member for Tangney (Mr Dawkins) has encouraged me to comment on an attribute which the Government has which is interesting, which is clear and which is regrettable. That is its unique abUity, distasteful abUity, to provide jobs for the boys. I am not suggesting for one moment that the matter that the honourable member for Tangney dealt with has any relationship whatsoever with my brief comment. But what has struck me and, I think, every member in this House is the fact that there is a complete backlash, a complete indignation, a complete dropping in morale in the Public Service of this nation. It has been stimulated by appointments such as those of Mr Grassby and Mr Menadue which have created in the PubUc Service a clear impression that there is no longer any reward for devotion to service, for length of service, for capacity, for abUity. It is purely a matter of someone being brought in and plonked in a position that earns him $26,000 a year. Seniority and so on are of no consequence whatsoever. It is most regrettable. The Government is paying the penalty for it in the tremendous defeat that it suffered in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, and these are only a beginning. I want to discuss 2 matters, both quite brief. One concerns the Great Barrier Reef in north Queensland. What the people of Queensland, the Queensland Government and I are wondering is when the Wallace report will be made avaUable. This Commission was set up quite some time ago. My goodness, the sort of campaign that the people involved fought in Queensland. They had little old ladies ringing up on open line programs crying laments about the Barrier Reef. The used every possible means to gather protests about the Barrier Reef and what was happening to it. Lately there has been a very strange sUence, a fascinating sUence. The reason for it is that this report has been ready now for many months. One may ask why it is not being released. I thought that the Special Minister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen), as Acting Leader of the House, would have been here; otherwise I would have suggested to him that he might like to hear my comments. I would ask him to ask his Prime Minister and the Government just when we might expect the release of this report on the Barrier Reef. We can see no reason why it has been delayed. We know it has been avaUable for many months. Is there some sinister motive? I might even be uncharitable enough to suggest that there is a political motive. Maybe an event on 7 December is causing this report to be held within the secret confines of Government circles. The other matter is quite brief. It concerns the Julius Dam. I am getting a httle parochial, but not entirely parochial because the activities of the principal city of my area, Mt Isa, and the advantages of the operations of that great complex overflow to all Austrahans wherever they may Uve. In one way or another they derive some benefit from the overseas earnings of this huge mining complex. What concerns me is not the huge mining complex-it can well and truly look after itself-bu t that the ratepayers of my city are to be strained to the absolute limits, as though they are not that at the moment, in order to meet the cost of the repayments on the Julius Dam. If l might explain to you, Mr Speaker, it is a very large complex which would provide water primarily for the people of Mt Isa and the operations of Mt Isa Mines Ltd. Someone wtil get up and scream multi-nationals again. I forewarn them that the company has provided some millions of dollars, the local authority has provided quite considerable funds, the State Government has provided significant grants, and the Federal Government has provided a loan, I think of $2.4m- I am not sure of the figure. I will say that this Government has slightly improved-unde r absolute pressure and consistant barrage from the Premier of Queenslandthe repayment conditions of that particularly lousy old loan. I strongly urge the Government to consider increasing the loan. After ing unbeUevable sums of money on paintings. I do not want to go too far into that subject because it sickens me and I would like to sleep well tonight. I do not want to be nauseated by the thought of all that money going down the drain on the purchase of these second rate paintings. I understand that even the good old 'Blue Poles' is starting to flake and fade. I do not know whether the same thing is happening to 'Woman V . The point I make is that only a Uttle more than $2m is involved and if the Government were to do more in this regard it would make a great contribution to the earning power of this nation and would remove a heavy load from the ratepayers concerned who sweat and toU without the advantages of those living in more favoured areas on the coast but who yet make an immeasurable contribution to the earnings of this nation.",121
351,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",122
352,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Does the Minister claim to have been misrepresented?,122
353,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ADJOURNMENT,Yes . The honourable member for Kennedy misrepresented me in his remarks about the royal commission into drilling on the Barrier Reef. He said that he could not understand why I was not present in the chamber while he was speaking. The simple answer is that he did not inform me that he intended to raise this matter. He said also that there was something sinister in the fact that the royal commission's report had been avaUable for some time but had not been tabled. Obviously he is completely ignorant on this matter. The royal commission is a joint Federal and Queensland commission. Although the report is ready for presentation it cannot be tabled without the consent of the Governor of Queensland. The honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Hunt) asked me about this matter today and I outlined the position to him. I am amazed to know that a member of the party to which the honourable member for Kennedy belongs has not indicated to him the contents of the report. There is no sinister motive in not tabUng the report and it is improper to misrepresent the position.,122
354,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,I remind the Minister that he is making a personal explanation.,122
355,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ADJOURNMENT,"There has been no delay in bringing down the report. Its tabling is not in the hands of this Government. The report is in the hands of the commissioners and they hand it to the Governor General and to the all, it is spend- Governor of Queensland. Mr Katter- I rise to order. I said nothing to reflect on the character of the Minister.",122
356,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ADJOURNMENT,"On the point of order, Mr Speaker, the honourable member said that it was a sinister motive. He said that I should have been here to answer his criticism. Mr Katter- I did not say anything about you personally.",122
357,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ADJOURNMENT,Yes you did. I heard it on the intercom. Mr Katter- I said that I wished you were in the House.,122
358,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ADJOURNMENT,I am here now to rebutt the claim that there is a sinister motive. It is not a matter within the control of the Government. Surely to goodness the honourable member for Kennedy knows what the Governor of Queensland has to do. Mr Katter-You are blaming the Governor for the delay.,122
359,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ADJOURNMENT,It has nothing to do with the Government.,122
360,Dr GUN,ADJOURNMENT,It was interesting to hear the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) discuss the appointments of ,123
361,Mr JAMES,ADJOURNMENT,"Job s for the boys, he said. Mr Katter-Menadu e and Grassby as well as some others.",123
362,Dr GUN,ADJOURNMENT,"Yes , I know. The honourable member for Kennedy said that these appointments allegedly lower the morale of the Public Service. I did not intend to speak on this subject, but before turning to the matter on which I rose to speak I think it is worth bearing in mind the large number of appointments that were made by a succession of Liberal-Country Party governments. . Mr COLLARD - Coul d you enumerate them?",123
363,Dr GUN,ADJOURNMENT,"I could enumerate them but I would heed about an hour and a half to speak instead the 10 minutes which is available to me. - I have been in this House for 5 years and remember what happened about was first elected. At that dme 2 obviously poUucal appointments were made. There was the appointment of Mr Gordon Freeth, who had been defeated at an election, as Australia's Amsiderable bassador to Japan. I do not want to cast any reflection on Mr Gordon Freeth as Australia's diplomatic, representative in Japan. But i honourable members opposite want to talk about appointing diplomatic representatives think they should be reminded of the appointput ment of Mr Freeth. Mr Chaney was also dereplicas feated in the 1969 election. He was appointed as the Administrator of the Northern Territory. Surely if we are to apply the same yardstick would have to say that those appointments letter states: caused very severe damage to the morale of the PubUc Service. I recall that Sir Alec Downer from my own State of South Australia was appointed as Australia's High Commissioner in London. I would not quibble about the role he played and I believe that he did an excellent job. Nevertheless, his appointment was a direct political one. Perhaps the most overt poltiical appointment of the lot was the appointment of the present Chief Justice of the High Court, who was becoming a threat to the then Prime Mmister, who felt that his own position was in jeopardy. He also responded to a threat to his own position by promoting sidewards those who threatened him or by kicking them upstairs-percussiv e subtimation as I think it is sometimes referred to. I remember the former honourable member for Riverina, Mr Roberton, who was appointed as Australia's Ambassador to Ireland. Mr England-What happened to the other honourable member for Riverina, Al Grassby?",123
364,Dr GUN,ADJOURNMENT,"The honourable member for Riverina (Mr Sulhvan) was sitting in the House a few minutes ago. Perhaps he does not have any taste for criticism of the former Government. I notice that he has now withdrawn from the chamber. Perhaps he has some business elsewhere. As I have said, the examples of political appointments by previous governments are too numerous to cover at this stage. There was Sir Howard Beale and Mr Roger Dean, who I beheve was also appointed as Administrator to the Northern Territory.",123
365,Mr JAMES,ADJOURNMENT,And to San Francisco.,123
366,Dr GUN,ADJOURNMENT,"As my friend the honourable memof ber for Hunter reminds me Mr Roger Dean was also appointed to San Francisco. I suppose the most recent example was the appointment of I can Dame Annabelle Rankin as High Commissioner a week after I to New Zealand. The reason I rose to speak to the House was to raise a matter which I regard as being of conimportance and on which I believe it is within the power of the Australian Government to take appropriate remedial action. I refer to the f very unfortunate and very dangerous practice of the sale to chUdren of chocolates which are I packaged to resemble cigarettes and which are in packets which look like very authentic of the most commonly sold brands of cigarettes. I do not think I can do better than to quote from a letter which was written to the ediwe tor of the Adelaide 'Advertiser' last week. The We bring to the notice of all concerned with the well-being of children the insidious encouragement to smoke by the presentation of chocolate lollies in a seemingly authentic cigarette wrapping and box. In an interview on Channel 2's 'This Day Tonight' (21.10.74) with the headmistress and children of the Magill Infant Demonstration School the variety and number of simulated cigarettes available were shown. The letter went on to state: Our headmistress . . . and the Mothers' Club are concerned that such immoral, unethical and insidious advertising should be levelled at young children. The power of advertising was highlighted by the interviewer's report that the children showed preference for one brand of chocolate because of its association with the catchy TV and radio commercials for that brand of cigarette.",123
367,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ADJOURNMENT,Hav e a Winfield.,123
368,Dr GUN,ADJOURNMENT,"I have no doubt that the honourable member for Wannon regards this matter as amusing, but I think this is a particularly pernicious practice. The letter continues: We are aware that children are happy to copy it is therefore to be expected that the pleasant chocolate flavour of the simulated cigarettes would not only the warnings that 'smoking is a health hazard' but prove a very subtle indoctrination at their most receptive age. The reason I have raised this in the Federal Parliament is that my understanding of the situadon is that most of these chocolate simulated cigarettes are imported and therefore this is a matter on which this Government could take very appropriate remedial action and very prompt action. I do not think it would bring up any cries of centralism from any parochial minded State governments, but even if it were to do so I think this action would be justified, and certainly justified as a matter of urgency. I think it is a simply appalling situation that such blatant encouragement of young people to take up or copy the practice of smoking should occur. As the Government has power to prevent this practice by putting a total import embargo on this product, I would suggest that this action be taken by the Government at the earliest opportunity. I hope that the responsible Minister who is in another place can take very prompt action because I am sure that this is causing concern to a very large number of parents in Australia. The Government is concerned to do everything it can to discourage people from taking up smoking. There is conflicting evidence in respect of which many people argue about the effectiveness of these various anti-smoking campaigns. But surely to goodness we should not be allowing anything Uke this to go on. It is directly encouraging people to take up this habit or to regard the habit of smoking by adults as something that children should emulate. I hope that the Government will take the appropriate action on this at the earliest possible opportunity.",123
369,Mr MACKELLAR,ADJOURNMENT,I wish to owners. make a personal explanation.,124
370,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Does the honourable gentleman claim to have been misrepresented?,124
371,Mr MACKELLAR,ADJOURNMENT,"I do, inadvertently. On cate with page 3064 of yesterday's Hansard there appear undesirable some phrases which are attributed to the able member for Wannon (Mr Malcolm Fraser). They should have been attributed to me. The was honourable member was sitting beside me. I know that Hansard does a tremendous job, but we were sitting close together at the time and Hansard must have been mistaken.",124
372,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Is this in the daUy Hansard?,124
373,Mr MACKELLAR,ADJOURNMENT,Yes.,124
374,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,I will have it corrected.,124
375,Mr MACKELLAR,ADJOURNMENT,"The phrases in question adults, and are as follows. After Mr Cameron said: The Permanent Head of my Depanment denies that and I confound deny it. I knew nothing about the instruction. I then said: I was told in Sydney. Hansard records Mr Cameron as saying: You were told in Sydney? I then said: By one of your departmental people. Mr Cameron went on to say something and I said: Quite separately. I should like the Hansard to be altered, if possible.",124
376,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,I am sure that Hansard has taken a note of what the honourable member has said.,124
377,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ADJOURNMENT," I would like to read a couple of paragraphs of a public document which starts in this way: The second matter I want to refer to is one which is, in a sense, personal but it is a matter which I think I should place on record. In the normal manner, after my appointment to the bench, I have decided to retain associations only with bodies of a charitable, professional, or sporting nature. Among the charitable bodies was one known as the Noongah Disaster Committee, a charity registered under the New South Wales Act and the Income Tax Assessment Act. It was established after the sinking of that vessel and the tragic loss of life of crew members, in order to raise money to assist the dependants, particularly the children. After the fund had been established and some funds collected in 1969,1 was asked and agreed to become an honorary trustee, the other trustee being a Sydney chartered accountant. When, as Deputy President of the Arbitration Commission, the maritime industry was assigned to me, I discussed that position with some representatives of the shipThey assured me that they did not see any embarrassment to themselves in my continuing as trustee of the fund. I have reconsidered the position. I now feel that occasions may arise for members of the committee of that fund, who include several officials of the maritime unions, to communime in my capacity as trustee. I think that would be during the conduct of this Royal Commission. I honourtherefore resign my position as trustee. I have decided to make this statement because I think it widely known that I was a trustee of that committee . . . Those remarks were made by Mr Justice Sweeney. At the end of his remarks Mr Elliott said: With some embarrassment, I ask you this question pertaining to the last subjectHis Honour said: I do not propose to hear any submissions on that, Mr Elliott. That prompted a question from me",124
378,Mr JAMES,ADJOURNMENT,"I raise a point of order. With greatest respect to this House, is not the Royal Commission over which Mr Justice Sweeney presiding still sitting and is not this matter judice and not subject to debate in this House?",125
379,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ADJOURNMENT,This is a public transcript of the proceedings.,125
380,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Eveiything is in order. honourable member is in order as long as there is no reflection on the appointment of the Judge and so long as he says nothing that would prejudice the Royal Commission hearing.,125
381,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ADJOURNMENT,"There is nothing of that kind at all, Mr Speaker. That prompted quesdon from me to the Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones), which he answered in part in this way: . . . I assume that he is talking about the fund Seamen's Union of Australia was able to establish lections from its members and money raised by methods, I understand, from other people. I know of only one instance in which it was able to obtain money shipping company. As to what it got from all the shipping companies, I would not have a clue. That was the response from the Minister in relahe tion to a question by me on this matter as to whether the Minister would say or could say the House what funds had come into or out of the 'Noongah' fund. On 25 October the Minister wrote to me and said, that the Crown SoUcitor's Office had advised his Department that inquiry into a State registered fund, such as the 'Noongah* fund, may present constitutional matter difficulties. He said additionaUy",125
382,Mr JAMES,ADJOURNMENT,"Who was the other trustee? Mr Sinclair, father of the",125
383,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ADJOURNMENT,The other trustee as was not in charge of the Royal Commission.,125
384,Mr JAMES,ADJOURNMENT,I wtil be replying to you the chance I get.,125
385,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ADJOURNMENT,"The other trustee is not the chairman of the Royal Commission. I said, the Minister advised me by letter that the Crown SoUcitor's office had advised his Department that an mquiry into a State registered such as the 'Noongah' fund may present constiNovember tutional difficulties. He said that additionaUy matter could fall within the terms of reference Judge Sweeney's inquiry. In view of what the Minister also said in this House when he said that ing. it feU outside the terms of the mquiry I ask the Minister- I advised him that I would be raising this matter tonight-wha t occurred between 25 October when the Minister sent a signed letter to the me in which he said that the 'Noongah' fund could be involved or fall within the terms of is reference of Judge Sweeney's inquiry and 30 sub October when it is reported that so far as the 'Noongah' fund is concerned the Minister beheved that it had nothing to do with the inquiry. He had changed his mind between 25 October and 30 October. This House has arightto know The why the Minister changed his mind. Secondly, the letter to me from the Minister said that there would be constitutional problems in determining what payments had been made into or out of the fund. Presumably those constitutional problems would be enduring problems a and would therefore prevent the Minister discovering what payments had been made into or out of that fund. If that is so, what could the Minister find out within the period of 5 days which which the would make him change his mind about the fund by colpossibly coming within the terms of reference of other the mquiry? The Minister has got himself into from a this particular trap. He has contradicted himself on 2 counts. On 25 October he said it could have something to do with the inquiry. On 30 October said it would not have anything to do with the inquiry. On his own admission he said that there to are constitutional problems infindingout what payments were made into the fund or out of the fund. That being so, in what other way could he find out whether or not the fund fell within the an terms of reference of the inquiry? The Minister has a good deal to explain in this and I think he should explain. I came into this House earlier this afternoon and apologised Was it to the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia and to the Minister on a matter which a result of public reports I had accepted in good faith but later found to be inaccurate, namely, that International Labour Organisation next arrangements, International Transport Federation arrangements and flags of convenience were a quite different matter from the matters As under examination at the present time.",125

(2) How many people have been refused employment in the Australian Public Service since 2 December 1972. (3) Has a reason been given to each person for his or her rejection. - Mr Whitlam - The answer to the right honourable member's quesdon is as follows: (1) The right honourable a speech entitled ""Official Secrecy, Open Government and Making Democracy Democratic"" delivered by the present Minister for Labor and Immigration on 17 September 1972. A copy of the speech is held in the Parliamentary Library. (2) and (3) The Public Service Board has informed me that detailed records are not kept of the number of people who are not successful in their applications for permanent or temporary employment in the Australian Public Service. The Board in its Annual Reports provides considerable detail of the number of people permanently appointed to the various employment categories in the Australian Public Service. Some indication of competition for vacancies is also givensee, for example, pages 80-81 of the Board's 1973 Repon. I have been further informed that most people are not successful because of their failure to win selection in the open competitive recruitment process. Some may be refused employment for medical or other reasons prescribed in section 34 of the Public Service Act. As the Public Service Board does not maintain records of the number of people who are refused employment, it cannot certify that each person ful has been given a reason for his or her rejection. The normal practice is for persons not eligible for appointment on citizenship or medical grounds, or who have not been accepted as a result of criminal convictions bearing directly on the duties of the vacancy, to be advised accordingly. As the right honourable member should know, the policy of previous Governments has been never to provide an individual with theresultof The present Government has set up the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Intelligence and Security Services Australian Government, the terms vide for recommendations to be made as to the procedures that should be introduced to permitreviewof administrative decisions affecting citizens which were, or may have been, based on reports of an adverse kind furnished by the security and intelligence services of the Government.

(2) Yes but they have since been replaced with 100 km/h signs. (3) To comply with the decision of the Australian Transport Advisory Council, to which the Australian Capital Territory was a party, generally existing imperial speed Umits were rounded to the nearest appropriate metric equivalent of 60 km/h, 80 km/h or 100 km/h. Therefore, the precise values of all speed limits were altered somewhat in the metric conversion. For example, 35 mph speed zones were converted to 60 km/h, the equivalent which is 37.2 mph.

(2) In organisational terms a full Division in the Depanthe ment of Foreign Affairs to handle Australia's relations with the Pacific Islands and Papua New Guinea is not justified at the present time. Relations with Papua New Guinea will be handled from 11 November by a full Branch headed by an Assistant Secretary and staffed by six other Foreign Affairs Officers. The Papua New Guinea Office, headed by a First Assistant Secretary, will continue to operate for some time. Relations with other countries in the Pacific are undertaken by the Department's Americas and South Pacific Branch involving the attention of an Assistant Secretary and Green Papers on five other FAO's. Policy Issues The Office of the Australian Development Assistance Agency has a substantial Branch responsible for the pro(Question No. 1175) vision of skilled personnel for Papua New Guinea and other South Pacific countries.

Nuclear, Chemical and Bacteriological Warfare: Prohibition Mr Snedden asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice: What action has been taken by the Government to (a) modernise and (b) apply international conventions to secure universal prohibition of (i) bacteriological warfare since 2 December 1972.",142
403,Mr WHITLAM,EFS FFA,"The Foreign Minister has provided the following answer to therighthonourable member's question: Since 2 December 1972, the Government has paid close attention to international conventions directed towards securing the prohibition of nuclear, chemical and bacteriological warfare. (i) Nuclear Warfare The Government ratified the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear weapons in January 1973. It has been an active member of the Preparatory Committee for the Review Conference of the Non-Proliferation Treaty and will participate in that Conference when it takes place in May 1975. The Government has participated in many bilateral and multilateral consultations about aspects of non-proliferation including in particular the development of effective international arrangements to govern and control nuclear experiments for peaceful purposes. As the Prime Minister said in his address to the UN General Assembly on 30 September, Australia seeks support for an international arrangement by which all States could gain access to nuclear explosives services under agreed and secure international controls and for peaceful purposes. (ii) Chemical Warfare International agreement has not yet been reached on a chemical weapons convention. On 6 December 1973 Australia voted for United Nauons General Assembly resolution 3077 (XXVIII) requesting the Conference of the Committee and Disarmament (CCD) to continue negotiations on effective measures for the prohibition of the development, production and stockpiling of all chemical weapons and their elimination from all arsenals of all The Australian Government is still examining the reports the intensive debate on a draft convention on chemical weapons held during this year's session of the CCD. Government will continue to pay close attention to the CCD debate on chemical weapons pending application for CCD membership (see answer to question No. 1228). (iii) Biological Warfare Although a signatory to the Biological Weapons tion, Australia is not yet a full tion of the Government to ratify this Convention as soon as the necessary domestic legislation has been enacted. This legislation is currently under active consideration by departments. Disarmament Agreements Mr Snedden asked the Minister representing ced the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice: What action has been taken by the Government establish more effective disarmament agreements, indicating the date, place and participants in each case, since 2 December 1972.",143
404,Mr WHITLAM,EFS FFA,"The Foreign Minister has provided the following answer to the right honour(Question No. 1227) able member's question: The major international forums in which disarmament discussions take place at present are: (i) the United Nations General Assembly; (ii) the Conference of the Committee of Disarmament; (iii) Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) (which are nuclear, (ii) chemical and (iii) bilateral talks between the USA and USSR); (iv) the Mutual Balanced Force Reductions talks (MBFR) (which are regional talks relating to forces levels in Europe); (v) the UN ad hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean. In addition, (vi) important discussions on the question of halting the spread of nuclear weapons capability (non-proliferation) and related matters take place or will take place in certain forums additional to those mentioned t above: (a) the Review Conference of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, due to take place in Geneva in May 1975; (b) the Preparatory Committee for (a) above, which has met twice during 1974 (April and AugustSeptember) and will meet again in Feburary 1975; (c) at Board of Governors meetings and the General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency and in committees associated with the IAEA. (vii) discussions on weapons which may cause unnecessary suffering or have indiscriminate effects have taken place under the auspices of the ICRC in connection with the Diplomatic Conference of the Humanitarian Aspects of Warfare in Geneva last February and at a conference of experts in Lucerne, September/October 1974; (viii) as a result of resultions of the UN General Assembly relating to the holding of a World Disarmament Conference, a Committee has been set up at UN Headquarters in New York to consider that proposal. The Government strongly supports the objectives of disstates. armament both because disarmament contributes to of regional and global security and the improvement of relations between States, and because real and significant The measures of disarmament make possible the freeing of resources which can be then applied to economic and social consideration of our development. In accordance with this policy, the Government has been and will continue to be an active participant in disarmament discussions in the bodies listed at (i), (v), (vi)b, (vi)c and (vii) above and will play an active and positive role in (vi)a Convenwhen the Review Conference takes place. party. It is, however, the intenIn addition, during 1974 the Government sought membership of (ii), the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament. The CCD until this year has had an active membership of 25 under the co-chairmanship of the USA and USSR. Five more States are to be admitted to membership as from the beginning of next year, subject to endorsement by the UNGA of the CCD recommendation. Membership of the (Question No. 1228) Committee is based on a formula designed to achieve balanrepresentation between different States groupings. Because arrangements had been made according to the formula of balance for the admission of the five new States to (Federal Republic of Germany, German Democratic Republic, Iran, Peru and Zaire) to the CCD before the Australian application was submitted, it was not possible to secure membership of the CCD for Australia this year. As is noted in the CCD Repon to the UNGA for 1974, consideradon by the Committee of the Australian request has been deferred with the concurrence of Australia to a later date. Australia voted for the UNGA Resolution (3183 XXVIII) which established the ad hoc Committee (viii above) on the holding of a World Disarmament Conference but is not a member of that Committee. Australia supports the concept of such a conference but considers that it can only be held when there is widespread international agreement about its agenda and the objectives sought, and when the five nuclear weapon States and other States of major military and political significance have agreen to participate. The Government also engages in continuing bilateral discussions with other States on disarmament matters. It is not possible to list all the occasions case. In the last few weeks, however, as an exxample, its representatives have held discussions-in New York, Geneva, Vienna and other capitals-wit h representatives of, inter alia, the USA, the UK, Japan, Sweden, Yugoslavia, Mexico, the Netherlands, China, Romania, New Zealand and Canada. The Government is concerned also that the maximum number of States should subscribe to existing disarmament agreements in order to increase their effectiveness and extend their applicability. To this end, when the Government assumed office on 2 December 1972 it moved quickly :o ratify the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Seabed Arms Control Treaty. Instruments of ratification for both Treaties were deposited in London, Washington and Moscow on 23 January 1973. The only other disarmament Treaty to which Australia is not yet a full party, the Biological Weapons Convention, is currently under active consideration. It is the intention of the Government to ratify this convention as soon as the necessary domestic legislation has been enacted. The Government has also actively promoted the cessation of nuclear testing through bilateral representations, through its activities in the United Nations and through the action it has taken in the International Court of Justice testing in the atmosphere.

A copy of the relevant document will be tabled. Advertisements for minor 35 17 11 analgesics directed to the public will be subject to the general 25 42 14 provisions in the proposal and, in addition, to the specific 9 239 6 and more stringent provisions of Section 2.11. (2) A firm date has not been set for applying the proposals to the prior censorship of advenisements to be transmitted on radio and television. One factor to be taken into account is the necessity to give the media and pharmaceutical industries adequate nodce of the date, so that advertisements to replace those currently approved may be prepared and submitted to my Depanment for approval. Implementation of the controls over other forms of advertising subject to the jurisdiction of the Government will require new legislation, or amendment of existing legislation which will be initiated at the earliest opponunity. The need to give industry adequate notice in this area will also be taken into account in setting the effective date for the legislation.

Funding for 1975-76 has not as yet been determined. Budgetary requirements for the next 3 financial years are unknown as are staff requirements, due to the Council being in a formative stage of development. (3) No projects have been planned as the Council has not as yet conducted research to determine the needs of the people within the Region. Outer Eastern Metropolitan Region 16: Australian Assistance Plan Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice: (1) Has the interim committee of Outer Eastern Metropolitan Region 16 expressed opposition to the Australian Assistance Plan. (2) What is his atdtude to the claim by the region that the administrative structure of the scheme should be direct through the local government instrumentalities. (3) What is his attitude to the view of the interim committee that a regional structure for social welfare should be combined with the already established regional structure for the Grants Commission. (4) What is his attitude to the committee's view that policy and administrative decisions should be in the hands of elected local government representatives. (5) What is his attitude to the view put by the committee in its opposition to the Plan that all funds should be channelled through the presently established local government structure.",151
410,Mr HAYDEN,AIRPORTS,"The answer to therighthonourable member's question is as follows: (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) A number of representations on the Australian Assistance Plan has been received from the (Question No. 623) Outer Eastern Metropolitan Region 16, including the suggestion that the Plan should be implemented through regional authorities. Because social welfare responsibilities involve all levels of Government and a large variety of voluntary organisations, the development of the pilot stage of the programme has sought to involve representation from all of these sources. Local Government bodies have been involved in helping the establishment of Regional Councils for Social Development. Frequently, the major initiative in preparing a submission for funding under the Australian Assistance Plan has come from municipal social workers or from social welfare advisory committees attached to municipal bodies. Regional councils for Social Development are expected to relate to other regional planning bodies but will require the capacity to undenake independent examination of social welfare proposals and to make recommendations on such proposals for the allocation of funds under the Australian Assistance Plan. Because of the way in which the programme is being developed it is appropriate that funds should be channelled through the Regional Councils for Social Development. Wheat Exports: Delays (Queston No. 969) Mr Hyde asked the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture, upon notice: (1) To what extent have wheat shipments from Australian ports been delayed as a result of (a) shortage of shipping space, (b) shortage of handling facilities, (c) shortage of railway capacity, (d) industrial trouble and (e) other factors. (2) At what pons have delays occurred, and to what extent at each port. (3) What is the cost to the industry of the delays that have occurred, and what is the nature of those costs. (4) Will grain once expected to be shipped occupy country storage space at the start of the 1974-75 harvest. (5) Have any negotiated sales been lost as a result of delayed delivery. (6) Has any estimate been made of the extent to which (Question No. 890) future sales have been prejudiced. (7) Has the Government any plans to deal with the situation.",151
411,Dr PATTERSON,AIRPORTS,"The Minister for Agriculture has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: In respect of questions (1) and (6) the Australian Wheat Board, which has the direct responsibility for the marketing of Australian wheat, has supplied the following information: 1. (a) Delays have not been experience due to a shonage of shipping space. (b) Shonage facUities presently avaUable particularly at Newcastle and Sydney in building up port terminal stocks to cope with a heavy grain shipping programme. (c) There has been a definite shonage of raUway capacity, including rolling stock, in New South Wales. Other States' raUways have been able to cope with the full movement programme. (d) Industrial troubles have been experienced in all mainland exporting States except Queensland, with the major effect on expons being from New South Wales. (e) Other factors which have caused delay to wheat shipments include(i) Inclement weather, (rain, winds and rough seas which have hindered vessels' movements). (ii) Shortage of labour. (ui) Cleaning and/or fumigation of vessels prior to loading. (iv) Loading of vessels with other grains at the sUo berths. 2. Delays have occurred at all ports from which wheat has been shipped, with the excepuon of Brisbane and Gladstone in Queensland, from which ports very little wheat was available for shipment this year. Sydney and Newcastle have been the most affected ports with numerous delays throughout the year from all the factors mentioned in (1) above, culminating in a strike of sUo employees at both ports for five weeks from 11 July to IS August. New South Wales from all causes affected the disposal of around S20,000 tonnes of wheat from Sydney and about 320,000 tonnes from Newcastle. At Fremantle (Western Australia) 50 working days were lost (202 ship days) with losses of 3 to 8 working days at the Western Australian outports. At Geelong serious dislocation occurred to the shipments of wheat to Tasmania due to industrial trouble relating to the 'North Esk'. Overseas shipments were affected to a limited extent by bans on Greek vessels and a Waterside Workers' Federation strike. In South Australia more than 130 ship days were lost due to various factors as listed in (1) above. 3. It is virtually impossible to indicate total financial losses to the industry due to the dislocation of the shipping programme this year. The nature of the losses is as follows(i) Demurrage paid to shipowners to 16 October amounted to $A640,108 of which $548,842 was incurred at the ports of Sydney and Newcastle. Additionally $A256,006 demurrage is in dispute with shipowners. (U) Interruption to the shipping programme has resulted in delayed receipt of payments from buyers and consequent delays in the making of progress payments to growers in respect of 1973-74 pool wheat by up to two months. (ui) By reason of the serious delays in shipments from New South Wales the tive outlets for New South Wales wheat, not only to maintain shipments view to clearing country storage to make way for the incoming harvest. 50,000 tonnes of Northern New South Wales wheat is being moved into Queensland for shipment from Brisbane and 40,000 tonnes of Southern New South Wales wheat into Victoria for shipment from Geelong. This will involve extra interstate freight costs of some $200,000. 4. Yes. The Board initially programmed to clear virtually the whole of the exportable surplus of wheat in New South Wales but, due to the shipment delays, will now carry over at the end of the crop year (30 November) over 600,000 tonnes of wheat. (This quantity is in addition to normal stocks of wheat and wheat equivalent of flour held by the mUls). 5. No. have been an inhibiting factor 6. It is not pracucai to estimate the extent to which future sales may have been prejudiced. 7. Some of the problems mentioned above are not in areas of federal responsibUity. As regards industrial disputes, the matter has had the attention of the Minister for Labor and Immigration and where appropriate direct representations have been made to the unions involved with the aim of minimising the disruption to wheat shipments. I am glad to say that shipments are currently proceeding smoothly. Boddington Women's Hospital (Question No. 1034) Mr Bungey asked the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) Has a decision been made on assistance for hospital improvements at the Boddington Women's Hospital submitted by the Boddington Community Committee to the Southern Region Social Development Board under the Australian Assistance Plan, and subsequently referred by the Social Welfare Commission to his Department. (2) If so, what is the decision. (3) If not, when will a decision be made.",151
412,Dr EVERINGHAM,AIRPORTS,"The answer to the honourIt is assessed that delays in able member's question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) It was announced in the 1974-75 Budget that the Australian Government had considered the recommendations arising from the Hospitals and Health Services Commission's Report on Hospitals in Australia and agreed to a five year program of capital assistance for the development of public hospital facilities in the States. For this purpose $28m will be provided in 1974-75. However, it was one of the cornerstones of the Hospitals Report that expenditure by the Australian and State Governments on hospital facilities should represent a joint initiative aimed at co-ordinated planning on a regional, State and Federal basis. It is proposed that Joint Hospitals Works Councils should be established in each State to set priorities and to plan expenditure. Each Joint Council will comprise representatives from the State and the Hospitals and Health Services Commission and will consider the total public hospital development program for that State. On the basis of this consideration the Commission will make recommendations to me as Minister for Health concerningfinancialassistance to be offered to individual hospital projects. I would suggest that the Boddington Community Committee make representations to the Western Australian Government to have the proposed improvements to the Boddington Women's Hospital included in that State's Hospital Program.

The allocation amongst the States is specified in the Budget papers for 1974-75. (2) No States have, to my knowledge, been officially 'declared' free of tuberculosis.

(4) Will he also indicate any interest that the Government or Australian companies have so far taken in this matter.",153
416,Dr JF CAIRNS,AIRPORTS,"The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am aware of two major steel mill projects being conmeats, sidered for Indonesia, namely: (a) Reports early this year Japan's overseas economic co-operation a proposed integrated steel plant costing some $A600 millions over ten years was being examined by Nippon Steel Corporation, Mitsui and Co. and Marubeni. No further details are available as yet. (b) Australian and Dutch interests have been examining the possibility of bringing into operadon a partly built Russian plant located at Cilegon. The plant was supplied about 10 years ago and could possibly form the basis for a 2 million tonne per annum mill. A West German consortium headed by Ferrostaal Ag. and working in conjunction with the Indonesian state owned steel firm P. T. Krakatau are proceeding with afirmproposal to establish this plant with an tonnes of rolled products. The plant is scheduled for completion in 1976. Financing of the project is apparently being handled by an international banking consortium. In addition to these major schemes the Indonesian Government has approved many mini mill steel projects. (2) It is quite possible that Australian iron ore would supplied to these major projects if they eventuate. Some ing coal may also be required from Australia, but natural and steaming coal from Indonesia's vast resources could be expected tofigureprominently in the fuelling plans. (3) In addidon to the Australian the Cilegon project several other Australianfirmsare understood to be in close touch with the principals. As these cominterest mercial negotiations are still in their early stages details not been announced by the parties concerned. The Depanunduly ment of Overseas Trade and the Australian Trade officials in Jakarta are providing every assistance to firms wishing to associated with these ventures. Meat Export Charge: Receipts Mr Lloyd asked the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture, upon notice: (1) Will the Minister explain the escalation in estimated receipts from the Meat Expon Charge to $28.7m for 1974-75 from actual receipts of $6.6m in 1973-74 as printed on page 89 of the Treasurer's Budget Speech. (2) If this higherfigurewas based on a continuation of high meat expons, what would be a more accurate figure now.",154
417,Dr PATTERSON,AIRPORTS,"The Minister for Agriculture (Question No. 1219) has provided the following answer to the honourable member's quesuon: (1) Thefigureof $28.7m set out in the Budget Speech as estimatedreceiptsfrom the Meat Expon Charge for f 974-75 was based on estimates made in April 1974 of meat expons for 1974-75. Since the estimates were made, industrial disputes in abattoirs, impon bans by the EEC and Japan, import quotas by Canada and low prices for imponed beef in the United States of America have all affected the estimate. Thereceiptsof $6.6m for 1973-74representscollections for a five months period only. (2) Revised estimates ofreceiptsfrom the Meat Expon Charge for the year, based on the charge of 1.6 cents per lb on beef and veal exported and 1.0 cents per lb for other will be in the vicinity of $20m. Collections for the first three months of the year (July-September 1974) amounts to $3.5m compared with the original estimate of $7.0m for the indicated that as pan of quarter. Capital Gains Tax (Question No. 1298) Mr Street asked the Treasurer, upon notice: Where a Testator dies and leaves a life interest in the income from the estate to his or her widow or widower, as the case may be, and on the death of that widow or widower the estate is then to be divided amongst the widow's or widower's children, will capital gains tax be assessed not only at the time of death of the Testator, but a second time wheni the widow or widower dies and the estate passes to the chilinitial capacity of 500,000 dren. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Although my statement of 17 September 1974 indicated be that assets will, for purposes of the proposed capital gains coktax, be deemed to have been disposed of by a person gas immediately prior to death it did not deal with what is to happen when a life interest in a deceased estate comes to an end. That is something about which the Government has yet to take a decision. group directly involved in I can see virtues in a rule that the termination of a life in a trust not be treated as a disposal of the relevant have assets but that, as a protection against assets being held for long periods in trusts free of capital gains tax, a trust be deemed to dispose of its assets every, say, 15 years at their be then current fair market value, and be deemed to immediatelyre-acquirethem at that value. It may be useful to illustrate how this procedure, if (Question No. 1287) adopted, would apply in the case instanced in your question, assuming the wife survived her husband by 20 years. The trustee would be deemed to have acquired the assets at their value for capital gains tax purposes at the time of the husband's death. Any increase in the value between that time and 15 years later would be subject to capital gains tax at the later time in the hands of the trustee, and the children would be deemed, on their mother's death, to acquire the assets at their value 15 years from the husband's death. If the wife survived for less than 15 years, the children would of course be deemed to acquire the assets at their value for capital gains tax purposes at the time of the father's death.
