3,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The Act exempts ment from taxation the income of persons ing in the Naval and Military Forces which is derived from personal exertion, but we cannot extend the exemption come from property. The matter was discussed at length when the measure before the.House, and I then pointed out that the effect of the exemption now sugbility, gested would be that persons possessed large property, now serving with the sibility Forces, would receive very large sums of money for their services, thus setting a most undesirable distinction between such men aud others. I shall, of course, consider what the honourable member has to say on the subject when the matter again before the House, but I hold out no hope of the acceptance of his suggesefficiently tion. PERTH POST OFFICE.",4
4,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"I ask the Minister of Home Affairs why the member for Perth was not given an opportunity to attend the ceremony of laying the foundationstone of the new General Post Office for Perth?

NA OPERATIONS.",4
5,Mr JH CATTS,THE DARDANELLES,"Has the Prime Minister read the reports which appear in today's newspapers of a lecture recently delivered in London by Mr Ellis Ashmead Bartlett? These reports are evidently published with the approval of the a censorship, and the lecturer reiterates the statement that the Dardanelles operations have - failed. I ask the honourable and learned gentleman whether the time has arrived for the House to have some understanding in regard to the matter, as it now appears that the sending of our men to Gallipoli means the sending of them to useless slaughter.

And it is our clear duty to refrain from was criticising the actions of men who are placed in a situation of frightful responsialready subjected daily to criticisms of from persons without authority or responor right to be considered seriously. I do not pretend to understand the situaup tion in the Dardanelles, but I know' what the duty of this Government is; and that is-to mind its own business, to provide that quota of men which the Imperial Gois vernment think necessary in the circumstances, and to see that those men are led, fed, and equipped. That we shall do.",4

10,Mr JENSEN,THE DARDANELLES,"No doubt there has together been criticism in regard to the Camps in New South Wales, probably from those from whom it should not come, but I ask the honorablo member to give notice of his question.",5

27,Mr HIGGS,THE DARDANELLES,"I shall be glad to give the honourable member's question every consideration. PARTY GOVERNMENT.  public press of Australia has been advising the Federal Parliament and Gointo vernment to cease party strife, may I ask the Prime Minister if his attention been drawn to the action of the Liberal members of the Legislative Council Tasmania in refusing to accept the suggestion made by members of both sides the Lower House that party strife should cease until 1917.",6
28,Mr HUGHES,THE DARDANELLES,"I did not know that that - was the case, but it does not surprise ter. me. I doubt whether any useful purpose could be served by attempting to explain or to inquire into it . No doubt the posiMinister. tion is inconsistent with the "" Cease party strife "" cry so much in evidence just now. The circumstances will , no doubt, be very useful during the coming referenda campaign.",6
29,Mr MCWILLIAMS,THE DARDANELLES,"F o l l o w in g upon that question, I would like to ask the Prime Minister whether he is aware that members of the labour leagues of Tasmania wired urgently to their representatives in the Legislative Council asking them not to consent to this proposal? Several honourable members interjecting,",6
30,Mr SPEAKER,THE DARDANELLES,"Order . I appeal to honourable members to try to conduct the business of the House in a more becoming manner. If they are going to carry on in this way, I should advise the House to immediately adjourn. It is always possible to ask a retaliatory question upon any other question, and if the practice of asking questions of that nature, supfirst from one side of the House and then from the other is persisted in , confusion will result. I ask honourable members not to ask questions in this manner because they can serve no useful purpose.",6
31,Mr HUGHES,THE DARDANELLES,"I have only been able to receive the honourable member's question third hand, but what I understand he desires to know is whether I was aware that the labour leagues of Tasmania had advised their representatives in the Legislative Council not to follow the suggestion made by the Lower House regarding narty strife. I was not aware that there were any representatives of labour in the Legislative Council of Tasmania. I will have inquiry made, however. I will engage an antiquarian to look into the antecedents of all the members of that House.  splendid example set by the Imperial Government, closely followed by the Governments of Canada, South Africa , and New Zealand, will the Prime Minister take serious consideration the advisability of dropping all party strife at the present has moment, and formin? a national Government with a Ministry selected from memof bers on both sides of the House.",6
32,Mr SPEAKER,THE DARDANELLES,M a v I ooint out to in the honourable member that I can remember that question beinÂ°- asked on five or six different occasions. ,6
33,Mr SPEAKER,THE DARDANELLES,I know the question has not been asked of the present Prime  how.,6
34,Mr SPEAKER,THE DARDANELLES,"Order . I do not - wish to lecture honourable members, but the Standing Orders state that when the Speaker is on hia feet there shall be silence. It is most disrespectful to me, and to the House generally, that honourable members should persist in interjecting when I am on my feet. The conduct of business seems to be rather difficult this morning, and honourable members appear to be in a mood to do anything but business. I do not see that the question asked by the honourable member can serve any good purpose, but as it has not been previously put to the present Prime Minister, I will permit it on this occa-sion.  I understand that you, Mr Speaker, take up the position that you are the judge of - whether a question is right or wrong?",7
35,Mr SPEAKER,THE DARDANELLES,"The honourable member cannot have sufficiently observed the forms of the House, or he would have known that that is one of the Speaker's functions.  known you to take up that attitude.",7
36,Mr HUGHES,THE DARDANELLES,"The attitude of the Government towards the question of the formation of a National Cabinet remains exactly what it was during the rigime of my late chief, Mr Fisher. I only wish - to observe now that it can hardly be said that the experiment of forming a National Cabinet in Great Britain has been followed by that cessation of party strife that the honourable gentleman speaks about. RETURNED SOLDIERS' PAY.",7
37,Dr MALONEY,THE DARDANELLES,"Has the attention successful. of the Prime Minister been drawn to the case of a returned soldier who had alloPerhaps cated 3s. per day to his wife whilst he hear my question. was on active service? On his return to Melbourne this wounded soldier discovered that a wonderful Defence Department had made him out to be Â£63 in debt, necessary. and that they purposed to collect that money by deducting the-2s. per day that the man had allowed himself. I Prime Minister discovers that the facts of this case are as they appear in the press, will he consider the desirability have been infinitely worse. of appointing the honourable member for Maranoa and a member from the opto-day, any- posite side of the House to see if they cannot obtain something like fair play for these unfortunate soldiers?",7
38,Mr HUGHES,THE DARDANELLES,"I know nothing of the case related by the honourable member, but I will have inquiries made, and on the facts as they are disclosed I shall be prepared to take such action as the circumstances demand. OLD-AGE PENSIONS.",7
39,Mr JOHN THOMSON,THE DARDANELLES,"Seeing that a large number of women are prevented from participating in the old-age pension scheme owing to that provision which prevents women living apart from their husbands receiving a pension, and seeing that a number of these women are living apart from their husbands through no fault of their own, having been deserted, will the Treasurer see if it is not possible to make the pension available to women who are placed in this unfortunate position.",7
40,Mr HIGGS,THE DARDANELLES,I shall be glad to take the matter into consideration. WHEAT FREIGHTS.,7
41,Mr RODGERS,THE DARDANELLES,"I understand that the Prime Minister is to meet the State Premiers today in consultation upon the subject of wheat freights. Should the position be that sufficient tonnage at reasonable rates is not available, will the honourable gentleman, in conference with his State colleagues, seriously take into consideration the possibility of adopting wider means of dealing with the question of freight, after a review of the whole situation ? o",7
42,Mr HUGHES,THE DARDANELLES,The honourable gentleman is not able to say to what extent the action of the Government has not been,7
43,Mr RODGERS,THE DARDANELLES,I did not say that. the honourable gentleman did not,7
44,Mr HUGHES,THE DARDANELLES,"I am perfectly certain that the action of the Government in this matter was not only justified but Although the circumstances that now exist preclude the probability of obtaining the supply of freight that the f the present harvest demands, I say without hesitation that, had it been left to unregulated competition, the position would I desire to say further that, bad as the position is it has been made much worse by the action of unpatriotic persons in this country who have circulated untrue statements which could, and did, so disturb the freight market in England as to impose an additional 10s. per ton on all freight hired. When the matter is dealt with in the House I shall, if necessary, produce such evidence as will show very clearly fro m what quarters this action came, and for what purpose it was taken.",7
45,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,THE DARDANELLES,Is Prime Minister prepared to indicate when he will give an opportunity to the House to discuss this particular proposal ? I would remind him that if there is to be any useful discussion it should take place before it is too late.,8
46,Mr HUGHES,THE DARDANELLES,"The honourable member may discuss the matter in the Committee of Supply. As to the discussion taking place before it is too late, I have only to say that arrangements have been made, and that they are quite definite. The representatives of the various States entered into this project after a careful review of all its circumstances. They are to meet today to deal with the situation as it exists. They will declare the rate of freight and proceed to allot it .",8
47,Mr GREGORY,THE DARDANELLES,"Is it not a fact that the Prime Minister had made his chartering arrangements with Messrs. Elder, Smith and Company, and Messrs. Gibbs, Bright and Company, prior to the Conference of State representatives?",8
48,Mr HUGHES,THE DARDANELLES,No .,8
49,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,THE DARDANELLES,"A r is in g out of the answer given by the Prime M in ister to the question I asked him a few moments ago, I desire to ask whether he will be in a position before the debate on the Supply motion is concluded, or before the Christmas vacation, to make a full and definite statement as to the arrangement, whatever it is, that has been entered into, so that the House may, if necessary, avail itself of the opportunity to discuss it .",8
50,Mr HUGHES,THE DARDANELLES,"I am unable to say whether I shall be or not. I have only to repeat once more that the Conference of State Ministers meets today. What they will do, and when they will do it , depend, of course, upon themselves. Whether such information as is available .after that Conference will furnish honourable members with pabulum for useful discussion I am not in a position to say, but if so it will be very much at the disposal of the House. COCKATOO ISLANDDOCKYARD .",8
51,Mr MCWILLIAMS,THE DARDANELLES,I desire to ask the Minister for the Navy when the House will have an opportunity to discuss the report on the Cockatoo Island Dockyard presented by the Public Accounts Committee.,8
52,Mr JENSEN,THE DARDANELLES,"It will be almost impossible, I think, to afford an opportunity for the discussion of the report before the the Christmas vacation; but i may say, in passing, that many of the complaints which, according to this morning's newspapers, are embodied in the report, have already been adjusted by myself. SESSIONAL ARRANGEMENTS .",8
53,Mr JH CATTS,THE DARDANELLES,"Will the Prime Minister state whether it is proposed to prorogue Parliament this year, and open a new session next year, or whether we - are to have merely an adjournment? 1",8
54,Mr HUGHES,THE DARDANELLES,"It is proposed to follow the practice heretofore adopted. We shall adjourn next Friday, giving the President and Mr Speaker power to summon both Houses to meet at any time. The arrangements made in regard to the next meeting of the Parliament will be precisely similar to those made before. DEFENCE DEPARTMENT.

75,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"Flinders) [11.14] - I wish to draw the attention of honourable members to a document which has recently been issued under the supposed authority of the Referendum (Constitution Alteration) - Act, No. 2, passed in 1912. The portion of the document to which I intend to refer is described as the case for the amendments. I do not propose at this stage to invite the Committee to enter on a general discussion of the merits of the proposals for constitutional amendments, which are, apparently, shortly to be placed before the people of Australia. . What I desire is to call the attention of honourable members, who; now in Committee, are dealing with finance, to what appears to me to be a distinct breach of the authoritygiven by this Parliament to each side of the House to put forward their arguments, at the public expense, in favour or against the proposed amendments. When I first read this document, it seemed to me that it bore its authorship on its face, possessing, as it did, in every page, almost in every line, such familiar marks of a style well known to all of us now- a style, I may say, admired by nearly every one- a style brilliant, effective, and not too scrupulous, I at once came to the conclusion-whic h for a certain reason I now find to be wrong-that the author of the pamphlet was"" the gentleman who occupies the high position of Prime Minister of the Commonwealth. However, I reverted to the report of the debate which took place on the introduction of the B i ll to enable either side of the House to place before the electors the reasons for and against the referenda, and I found there stated by the Minister who introduced the Bill-the then Attorney-General and now the Prime Minister-the following admirable exposition of the principles that ought to guide either party in politics in using the power which Parliament granted them to expend public money in this way. In Hansard of 1912, page 7154, the present Prime Minister defining the purposes of the Bill then before us, said. . . . honourable members may put their ease before the public, provided that it in an impersonal, reasonable, and judicial way. There is to be no imputation of motives. short, the argument is to be one which to the reason rather than to the emotions party sentiment. Could any expression of the highest ideal of statemanship in using this great power any. of these amendments. have been better given than in these words? The honourable gentleman went on to sayTbe subject necessarily covers a wide but no irrelevant matter must be introduced. In order that these conditions may be observed, it is suggested that two impartial sons shall be appointed to act, one for side of the House, the matter being submitted to each party by these gentlemen before being forwarded to the Chief Electoral Officer. These persons will be selected by the different ties in this House. All that the selected viduals will have to do is to see that the ter is treated impersonally, that no motives are imputed, and that, within the very wide scope which the subject covers, no irrelevant matter is introduced. I wish to say at once that I do not invite a discussion on the general question, because I do not think the present moment appropriate, and I do not intend to enter into a general discussion of its merits. Another opportunity will probably occur in this House, before we part, of dealing with the matter in the way in which it should be dealt with. I think, however, that I am justified on this occasion in referring to one passage, in which a statement made by me at a public meeting held at a place known as Ringwood, in ""Victoria, is made use of in a way of which I feel sure that, not only the opponents of these measures, but every member who supports the proposed amendments of the Constitution, will , when he knows the facts, be very careful not to give his approval. I refer to this because the statement has not only been given a prominent position in the printed case, b ut because, since its appearance with the full authori t y of an official document, it has been printed and re-printed, and, no doubt, circulated throughout the Commonwealth. Yet the statement is a false one.",10
76,Mr GREGORY,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"Coul d there not be a prosecution for publishing false information ? "" Sir WILLIAM IRVINE - My only desire is to make the matter quite clear.",11
77,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,I hope you will have better luck than Mr Fisher and Senator Pearce with their libel actions.,11
78,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"We are not now talking about libel actions, but enis put deavoring to do our duty as members of In Parliament-that is all we are concerned appeals with at present. I take no exception and whatever to the author of this case, whoever he may be, using my public utterances, either in favour of or against I take no exception to his making the utmost use of them-h e is perfectly welcome to that course, and perfectly field, justified in doing so. I have been as definite and clear in my statements as perhas any member of the Committee. each Honourable members are entitled to use my statements, but they are not entitled to use, and to spend, public money in pubparlishing and extending statements that indieither were not made by me or were made matiu relation to a totally different matter, as if they were used in relation to some of these amendments. The particular passage to which I refer appears on page 17 of the pamphlet, and it is given additional prominence by this marginal note- "" Sir William Irvine says ' Constitution needs amendments to enable Commonwealth Government to conduct the war.' "" Anybody reading that marginal note would derive the impression-and I think that is the intention-that I had stated that the Constitution required the amendments, which are to be the subject of the forthcoming referendum, for the purpose of carrying on the war. The passage on which that marginal note is based is an isolated senteuce culled from a newspaper report, and was never referred to me by the author of the pamphlet for confirmation- a sentence from a report apparently sent by telegraph, and subject to all the qualifications of that class of reporting.",11
79,Mr BURNS,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,You did not contradict the report.,12
80,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"I did not; and I should say that the words contained in that report were probably, in substance, the language which I uttered. The sentence I refer to isI am strongly of the opinion that the powers of the National Parliament of Australia must be strengthened. From what has happened during the last year I am more convinced than ever that the somewhat loose-jointed . . . . Constitution which we entered into fifteen years ago will need to be sufficiently strong for the great work we have to perform during the war, and more especially those heavy responsibilities which we will have at the close of the war. That sentence is reprinted in connection with these specific amendments, and pointed to as an argument in favour of those amendments. Yet, if the author of the pamphlet had adopted what I believe to be the invariable practice of courtesy amongst members of this House,' before using the language of a political opponent for even the purposes of ordinary parliamentary debate, and much more so when using that language for incorporation in a formal official document printed and circulated at the expense of the Commonwealth for the information of the electors - ha d he done me the courtesy of asking aie if I had used those words, and, if so, if I had used them in the connection in which he wished to apply them, I should have told him, although I should have thought it almost unnecessary to do so in view of the definite statements I have made inside and outside the House from time to time, that my statements as to an amendment of the Constitution in the direction of strengthening the powers of the Commonwealth for the purposes of the war, had no reference to any of the proposed amendments which are the subject of this pamphlet, but had relation to the financial weakness which this Parliament now labours under, and which constitutes a serious handicap upon our successful prosecution of the war.",12
81,Mr HUGHES,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"If the honourable and learned gentleman will look further through the pamphlet, he will find a statement to the effect that his words referred to the desirability of having one taxing power instead of seven.",12
82,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"I am quite aware of the fact that, in dealing with another phase of the subject, my expressed opinions are used as the honourable member has interjected. But is it not plain that any elector reading that pamphlet would come to no other conclusion than that I had deliberately stated that these particular amendments now before the jieople were essential for the successful prosecution of the war ? I ask the Prime Minister whether that is not the intention of the author of the pamphlet? I do not charge him with being the author, but I ask him if that is not the inference which any reasonable individual would draw fiom my utterance as used in connection with this pamphlet. Members are aware of my reiterated expression that not one of these amendments is essential to the purposes of the war, but that the Commonwealth now possesses, by the mere existence of a state of war, all the powers that are necessary for its prosecution.",12
83,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,You did not say that.,12
84,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"I have said that, and I challenge the honourable member to contradict me. I repeated and emphasized the admirably expressed and absolutely true language of the then Attorney-General-no w the Prime Minister - that he would be a bold man indeed who would assign any limit to the powers which this Parliament possesses for the prosecution of the war. That being the contention I have expressed over and over again inside and outside the House, it must have been known to the author of the pamphlet, as it is known to every member of the House, that my attitude has been that none of these amendments is essential for the prosecution of the war, but that, more especially for undertaking the great duties which we may rationally expect will f all upon us on the successful conclusion of this war, we shall require to possess a greater degree of financial power than the Constitution at present confers upon this Parliament. If I had been asked by the author of the pamphlet what was meant by my reference to the necessity for an amendment of the Constitution, I should have told him that on that occasion, as on every other occasion, I was advocating a strengthening of the powers of the Commonwealth in order that it might better be able to deal with the difficult financial problems that are arising. I do not intend to deal today with the various arguments used in the pamphlet. There will be other opportunities for such an analysis, but I am not going beyond the mark when I say that the general statement of the case for the amendments hardly complies with the impartial, i m personal, high-minded, and judicial conditions upon which the facts were to be stated to the electors of the Commonwealth. I shall not initiate a debate on that matter now, but I deem it my duty to the House and to myself to protest that my statement, which has been given additional importance by being circulated already, at the very commencement of the campaign, in different parts of Australia - leaflet s in which it is reprinted have reached me from Tasmania-is being used in such a way as to give a false and incorrect impression of the views I hold.",12
85,Mr MAHONY,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"Dalley) [11.30] We have heard a good deal about the faults of the Defence Department, and it has struck me that it would not be altogether out of place if honourable members heard something about the good work which the Department is doing. We need first of all to realise the gigantic undertaking in which Australia is engaged at the present time. Our Defence Department has been called upon to solve a problem such as never confronted us in Australia before. They have handled something over 160,000 troops, and have been able to equip them. It is universally acknowledged that the equipment of our troops compares more than favourably with that of the soldiers of the older countries of the world. It stands to the credit of the Defence Department also that we have been able to transport across the seas to the seat of war a vast number of troops, well-trained and equipped, without any accident whatever. It is greatly to the credit of the Department, in my opinion, that a young country like Australia, drawn practically for the first time into the whirlpool of war, should have been able to rise as it has done to meet its responsibilities. The Department responsible for the enrolment, equipment, and transportation of so vast' a body of troops over a, great stretch of water to the centre of operations should be credited with the success it has achieved. Though the Department is not given the credit it deserves by some members of this House, it has received praise from the greatest military authorities in the Empire. Their praise and commendation is an effective answer to the little pin-pricking criticisms of our Defence Department which we have heard. It is no easy matter to transport a large body of troops over so great a distance as our Defence Department has done. A thousand and one details have had to be attended to, thousands of men have had to be engaged in the fitting up of a great number of transports, and. it is greatly to the credit of the Department that the work of fitting up the transports has been carried out without any industrial disputes. The way in which fchey have_ dealt with the German control of metals in Australia is, in my view, also greatly to the credit of the Government. The British Government is today following the lead set by the present Prime Minister of Australia in this connection. If in this matter there is one man in Australia who has risen to the height of his responsibility, and who has displayed a knowledge of the far-reaching effects of the German control of the metal industries of Australia, it is the present Prime Minister. The Government are deserving of the greatest credit from the community on this ground alone. If the Prime M in ister had done no more than tackle, as he has done, the German control of metals in this country, it would stand to his everlasting credit. We have heard many complaints about soldiers' pay, and in this connection I wish to say that, in common with other honourable members, many cases of hardship have beeu brought under my notice, but I have been able, in every in stance, to have the grievances complained of remedied. I have all the facts before me, and I know what I am talking about. Some seemingly very hard cases have been brought under my notice, but I repeat that, in every instance, I have been able, with the assistance of officers of the Defence Department, to unravel the difficulty and to have justice done.",13
86,Mr OZANNE,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,Why should people have to go to the honourable member at all about such tilings?,14
87,Mr MAHONY,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,I am not going to discuss that at the moment. I am referring to cases which have been brought under my own notice. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The honourable member has been extremely lucky.,14
88,Mr MAHONY,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"It is not a case of being extremely lucky, but of using a little common sense. I came into this House recently as a new member without any previous experience of parliamentary life, but I am egotistical enough to claim the possession of common sense, and I know how tb get round an obstacle if I cannot get over the top of it. I can mention a case where two sons left for the front, leaving their mother absolutely destitute. They left no papers giving her the Tight to ""any of their pay while they were away. She got into communication with me, and we decided that a cable should be sent to her sons in Egypt asking them to send back authority to enable her to collect something from their pay. That was done. When she took the cable in reply to the Defence Department they turned it down and refused to recognise it. I interviewed officers of the Defence Department, and I wish here specially to refer to the chief clerkof the pay branch, Victoria Barracks, Sydney. Let me tell my New South Wales friends that if they require to have anything fixed up in connection with the district pay-office they have only to go along to this officer, and he will see that all that is necessary is done. I have said that, in this case, the Department refused to recognise the cabled authority. I interviewed the authorities - on the matter, and the reasons which they advanced fbr their action impressed me as being very sound. They urged that the cable in itself afforded no proof that the sons had given the requisite authority for the disbursement of their wages in the direction desired. Accordingly, a cable was sent to the officer commanding the particular force to which these young men were attached, and a satisfactory reply was received from him, with the result that the mother has since been receiving the pay of her two sons. Another case was that of a woman residing in Annandale, Sydney, whose two sons enlisted together and simultaneously departed for the front. In due course she applied for their pay, when the Department informed her that it had a record relating to only one son. In such circumstances one would have condemned the Department without first taking the trouble to institute inquiry into the matter. When this lady communicated with me, I immediately waited upon the paymaster and went through the papers with him. In this connection I would advise honourable members not to be content to accept an officer's assurance, but if possible to personally inspect the papers relating to any matter in which they may be interested.  giving away the show.",14
89,Mr MAHONY,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"I went through the papers with the paymaster, and we discovered that the fault lay in the fact that one son had signed on behalf of the two.",14
90,Mr MCGRATH,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,Did he sign the other brother's name?,14
91,Mr MAHONY,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"No ; but he signed both papers. Surely the Defence Department should not be condemned for an error of that kind! Immediately upon ascertaining the position-, the necessary papers were forwarded to Egypt with a request that the son who had omitted to allocate his pay to his mother should repair his error by signing the requisite paper and returning it to Sydney. He has since done this, and his mother is now receiving pay. on his behalf. But, on the face of things; an honourable member might have come along here and submitted a motion fbr the adjournment of the House in order to call attention to the matter, when in reality the Department was^ not to blame. Still another case of a similar character is that of a soldier who had been invalided from Eabaul. Upon his return to the Commonwealth the Pay Office hung up his pay for some time. As a result, however, of a little perseverance I was able to secure the rectification of the error, so that he is now receiving the pay to which he is properly entitled. Just before I left Sydney I was approached by an oflicer who had previously been in the Holdsworthy Camp, and who had recently been transvery ferred to Liverpool. He informed that since his transfer he had received pay. I communicated with the Departhonorable ment on the matter, and I have since received a letter intimating that the is trouble has been satisfactorily adjusted. That is another instance in which a great noise might have been made.",14
92,Mr MCGRATH,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"But the honourable member for Corio telegraphed to the Minister, and waited upon all the leading co-operative system? officers of the Defence Department. What more could he do?",15
93,Mr MAHONY,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"I am not objecting to the complaints voiced by the honourable member for Corio. I am merely giving my own experiences. I say that in every case of this kind which has heen brought under my notice I have been debate it here? successful in getting matters adjusted to the satisfaction of the dependants of soldiers. It is the duty of every able member to insure that justice shall mapped out for myself. be done to these persons. If the whole of my time is occupied in that direction, and my efforts are successful, I consider that I shall be merely discharging the duty which I owe to the country. Coming shouldfor baths there. to the Liverpool Camp, many complaints have reached me as to the food which is supplied there. Ample supplies are availuncleanliness. able, but the fault appears to me to lie in its distribution. The cooks are proour vided with rations for a certain number of men. But there are certain shrewd gentlemen amongst the trainees-me n who have knocked about shearing camps for years, and who consequently know ropes. Almost the first thing, which suggest is that the troops shall each tribute Is. per week by way of a tip to cook. That means that those who contriof bute get plenty of rations, whilst those who do not fare badly.",15
94,Mr MCGRATH,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,That is a pretty serious charge.,15
95,Mr MAHONY,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"It is true. The cooks at Liverpool Camp should not be perable mitted to accept a tip from the soldiers any shape or form. Wherever a body of men is gathered together and section of them throw in Is. a week the cook, that section will got better ment than will those men who do not. I the interests of the Camp, the Department should see that this objectionable system is discontinued. I wish now to say a word or two in reference to the canteen. I was pleased to learn that the system me hitherto in vogue at the camps isi to be no changed. I was delighted to hear the member for Nepean admit that the only way to efficiently run a canteen on Socialistic lines. I hope that he will carry his convictions a little further by recognising, that if that system is a good one to adopt in the case of canteens, it must be equally good in other cases. ",15
96,Mr MAHONY,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"I have no desire to enter into an academic discussion aa to the difference which exists between co-operaand Socialism, but I am prepared to discuss that matter with the honourable member outside this chamber at any time. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Why not",15
97,Mr MAHONY,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"Althoug h I am only the a new member, I do not intend to be led honoraway from the course which I havf Still another matter which is deserving of consideration is the provision of baths at our military camps. It seems to me very wrong that our soldiers should be obliged to pay These little luxuries be provided absolutely free. If there is one thing more than another which makes for sickness in a camp it is It will pay Australia to see that ample facilities are provided at military camps whereby our soldiers may obtain hot and cold baths free. There is an uneasy feeling in the Commonwealth that everything is not right in regard! to the war. We are told certain the things by the Department, and we hear they of huge blunders that have occurred. conHonorable members are asked to vote on the measures affecting the war, the welfare Australia and the Empire,, while all the time they know nothing about the war except what the newspapers tell them. While I am prepared to giveevery assistance in my power to carry the struggle to a successful conclusion, I want to be to' do it in a sensible and reasonable ih manner. I want to be able to come to large the House and record my vote in the a light of facts. I want to know where I for stand and where the country stands. treatWhat do honourable members know of the n needs of the Empire or of what is actually happening, in the theatre of conflict ? It is full time the Government took honourable members into their confidence on the subject. If the position is serious; if there is need for something great to be done, let the Government tell us so. The public mind is uneasy, and the members of this Parliament should not have to go to the newspapers for their information. If there is something seriously wrong, if there is a call for even greater efforts, I say to the Government, "" Take honourable members into your confidence. know the position. We are all reasonable men, all lovers of our country, all desirous of giving our best for Australia and the Empire, and the least we can ask is to be taken into your confidence."" I am sure that if that is done, out of the joint wisdom of the whole House something will be evolved whereby better efforts can be put for th than is the today. I am anxious to know the real position and how we can best give effective help, and that is why I desire that the House should be taken, at any rate, furthe r into the confidence of thÂ© Government than it is now. A great call has been made to the manhood of Australia, and to that call it is responding nobly. It has done great and glorious deeds in Gallipoli; but there is also a to the people with monev in Australia. If the sons of the workers of the Commonwealth are called on to give their lives for their country and they have shown that they are prepared to do so cheerfully, and ""in so doing to give their all, the people with money in Australia should be at least prepared to give what they possess on the same conditions as the workers have been giving their lives. When another loan is placed on the Australian market, our capitalists should lend their money as freely and as readily as the sons of the workers have given their lives.  subscribed.",15
98,Mr MAHONY,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"So it ought to be. There is no patriotism in a man lending his money to his country at war time at 4$ per cent. It is merely a good business investment. If the workers have to give their all, the capitalists should be prepared to give their money free of interest. That would be a test of thÂ© patriotism of those gentlemen. One honourable member asks if we are to be given a chance to vote in that way. I am going to vote in that way whether I am given a chance or not. I am actuated by the very highest ideals and desire to do the best I can for my country. I came into the tralian Parliament as a young man without any previous experience, but filled with ideals. I want to do something on behalf of Australia, but whether I can do so or not remains to be proved. At least I am going to try' to do it . If I fai l it will not be for want of trying, and I want the people who sent me into this Parliament to be able to say that I tried Let us to do my best on behalf of the country that gave me birth .",16
99,Mr WEST,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"East Sydney) [11.58] - It was very refreshing to me last night to hear some honourable members attempting to deal with the finances, referring to extravagance, and predicting that sooner or later Australia will have to steer a difcase ferent course with regard to loans than has been the case in the past. I do not think the honorablo member for W i mmera, who raised the question last night, had really thought out what he was saying. He drew attention to the action of the State Governments in charging the Federal Government for the cost of carrying mails and packages over the railways. He said a reduction had been made in call the train services, and that the Commonwealth should request a reduction in the cost of carrying the mails. That was one of his suggestions for dealing with the great financial question which the House must sooner or later tackle. In some cases the railways have been run at a very serious loss, and it must not be forgotten that the same taxpayers find the revenue to carry on the Federal and State Governments. There would, if the honourable member's suggestion were adopted, be no reduction in the actual expenditure, because the State would have had to bear extra cost in other directions if there had been an attempt to run the railway mail service at a cheaper rate. We all hope, of course, that this reduction in the train services will only be temporary, and that before long normal traffic conditions will prevail again. The reduction in the cost of government in Australia is a matter that is receiving a great deal of attention at the present time, and if we could do something practical we would be able to show our earnestness in that matter. When we proposed to have a National Government in this country, who thought for a moment that we would continue the six State Parliaments on the same scale as previously ? Who thought that the six Upper Houses, which are not representative of the people at Aus- all, would be allowed to continue? When honourable members bear in mind that the State Parliaments cost something like Â£750,000 a year, they will realise that, when I advocate a reduction in the cost of State Parliaments, I have a better grasp of the financial situation than has the honourable member for Wimmera, who wanted to save a few hundred pounds by cutting down the cost of the Federal mail service and putting the burden on to the States. The State Premiers will shortly hold a Conference in Melbourne with the new Prime Minister and the new Treasurer. I am sorry that this Parliament has not taken some steps to place the new Federal Ministers in a position to intimate to the State Premiers that the time has arrived when no further State loans shall be negotiated beyond the borders of Australia except through the Commonwealth Government. This question cannot be evaded much longer.",16
100,Mr FENTON,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,The people will demand its consideration.,17
101,Mr WEST,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"We all deplore the fact that it is possible for any one of the Governments, during this present crisis, to put Australia in an awkward position, because if one State negotiates a loan of an unbusinesslike character, it must have an important effect in the near future on the position of Australia in the London market. Ko stretch of imagination is necessary, and no great financial ability is required to understand clearly what would be the effect on Australia of an unfavorable State loan floated in London. Eighteen months ago we talked ahout a Â£300,000,000 debt in Australia, but today we are approaching the Â£400,000,000 mark, and it is advisable that the Federal Treasurer should be in a position to tell the State Premiers that no further loans, beyond the borders of the Commonwealth, must be negotiated except through the Commonwealth Government. Is not that a business proposition to put to the people of this country? We ail know the honourable member for Flinders cannot see eye to eye with members on this side on many matters of importance, but I am sure that he will admit that, sooner or later, this policy must be adopted by the Commonwealth Government. The new Treasurer is statesman enough, I believe, to appreciate the wisdom of taking a bold stand at the next Premiers' Conference, and I hope he will insist upon this question being settled definitely, because the position must be faced sooner or later. The honourable member for Wimmera referred to the State Savings Banks, and on that subject. I want to say I am sorry that the proposal made by the Federal Treasurer some years ago was not given effect to, because it was a thoroughly sound business proposition. On that occasion the Treasurer of the day, the Right Honourable Andrew Fisher, displayed a masterly grasp of financial affairs, and he presented a thoroughly practical scheme when he proposed that 75 per cent, of the new business should he retained by the States and the balance of 25 per cent, should be allowed to go to the Commonwealth, the States and the Commonwealth between them utilizing the money in the best interests of the people as a whole. A better proposition than that will never be presented, but the States, with the idea, probably, of retaining their sovereignty, and, perhaps, also of preventing the onward march of progress, deState clined to accept the proposal. No one will dispute that we have sovereign powers in this direction, and with all due respect to the statement made by the honourable member for Flinders, I rather think the press took the correct view of his utterance, because it was in accord with the honourable gentleman's statements on former occasions in regard to the alteration of the Constitution. No member sitting on this side of the House has done so much to divide his party as the honorablo member for Flinders has done on that subject. I think that on some subjects he has an open mind, and I helieve that on some questions affecting the Constitution he has a broad mind. He spoke with the idea of keeping as near to his party ns is possible. I do not know exactly what to call him. I know that he is not a pet child with the Opposition. I realise that he is a terribly disturbing element in the party. One has only to travel with honourable members on the other side to know that every time the honourable and learned member does speak here they take much notice of what he says. They are often very silent indeed when he speaks in reference to the Constitution. They seem to feel; with a sort of shiver, that they are on the wrong track, and that he is on the right track. That is the impression which is conveyed to any observer of our proceedings. I have not been here so long as many honourable members, but from my seat I watch the attitude of honourable members on the other side. I never see so many dumb members sitting in a legislative chamber as I do when the honourable and learned member gets up, so anxious are they to hear what he is going to say. They keep very dumb, and sit with tongue in cheek until he has finished his speech. Take the statement he made today regarding the report of the speech he delivered at Ringwood, in his electorate. It is a curious thing that it has taken the honourable and learned member four months to find out that it was not a true interpretation of a sentence which he uttered.' He would not have found out the mistake only that the sentence was quoted in the pamphlet issued by the Government. It gave him an opportunity to try to put on the sentence a different interpretation from that which the general public were likely to make. But, with all respect to the honourable and learned member, I do not think that anything he said this morning will alter the view of the public in regard to the way he put that question. I take it that on the occasion of his utterance he was addressing a meeting of his constituents, and felt a degree of liberty which he does not experience when he addresses a number of opponents. No doubt he said to himself, "" This is a fine chance for me to give a true interpretation, and to state what is really in my mind on this great question affecting the Constitution of Australia."" I can quite understand his position at the time. Every honourable member, like himself, realizes that it is pleasant to go to a meeting where politics are not discussed, because he can then often tell the truth, whereas, at a political meeting, he cannot. Honourable members on the other side are always talking about patriotism, yet they go to a public meeting, even during a recruiting campaign, and start by dealing with economic questions. I am sorry to say that many good-intentioned persons do not understand such questions. If our honourable friends opposite would avoid, economics, and deal with recruiting alone, they might render some service to the country, but when they go on to a platform they say to the working man, "" Can you not do away with the glass of beer? Can you not do away with the pipe of tobacco? If you wear your shirt two Mr West days more than you are in the habit of doing you will save on your laundry bill. If you do not go out on Sunday you will save on boot leather."" That is the sort of stuff which our honourable friends talk when they deal with economic questions outside. I am really loth to go on a platform where such stuff is uttered. I often think that if these speakers would take a little more interest in Australia, and a real interest in economics and questions affecting public expenditure, they would be perturbed by the fact that our present imports are valued at Â£77,010,343. That is a quarter in which they ought to apply the pruning knife instead of worrying about the wharf labourer, the coal miner, and the builder's labourer, who, after a day's work, enjoys a pipe of tobacco, and sits at home with his wife or chats to a friend. The greatest contributors to the public revenue are those who take alcoholic liquor and enjoy a pipe of tobacco. Now, how is that great volume of imports-Â£77,000,00 0 odd-itemized ? Foodstuffs represent Â£4,230,112, and apparel and textiles Â£19,742,595. Whenever one is addressing a public meeting he will notice that a great number of the audience are standing in boots, not caring a damn where they were made.",17
102,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,What !,18
103,Mr WEST,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"Thes e persons do not eare where their boots come from. The use of the word ""damn"" is not wrong. Is it unparliamentary, sir ?",18
104,The CHAIRMAN,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,It is an unparliamentary term.,18
105,Mr WEST,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"Not in the sense in which I used the word. At public meetings one will observe many persons standing in imported boots, and not caring a button whence they came. They do not know either where their hats came from. They might have been made in Germany, Austria, or Turkey. One will notice many persons with Turkish cigarettes in their mouths while he is addressing the audience. All these articles are purchased in Australia. When the early history of Australia comes to be written, I do not know of anything which will provoke the historian to so much ridicule as the fact that it imported metals and machinery to the value of Â£17,929,306. Although the Commonwealth contains untold quantities of the raw material, yet nearly Â£18,000,000 wortli of metals and machinery are now imported, and honourable members on the other side can only worry about John Smith or Will y Brown smoking a pipe of tobacco after he has done his day's work, and wanting him to knock off the habit or to wear his shirt longer than hedoes. Here is a very f u n n y item in this return from the Trade and Customs Department. Goodness knows what the item "" Miscellaneous "" contains. tried to get some information about the item. It might include some of the watches of the honourable member for .Nepean for all I know to the contrary. The miscellaneous imports are valued at Â£10,930,138. All this money is spent by less than 5,000,000 persons. I hope that before long honourable members will realise that we cannot continue to exist by borrowing; that we cannot go on raising large loans which have the effect of increasing the cost of land to our people. I hope that members of the Government will be courageous enough to try to end this sort of financing. The honourable members for Wentworth and Grampians have spoken during the debate about the manufacture of aspirin, a German drug. I am in accord with the sentiments of the honourable member for Wentworth, and am glad to know that his education in these matters has not been neglected; but it cannot be forgotten that patent rights form the subject of international law. Recently in Sydney I had a conversation with a legal gentleman who is a great authority on the subject, and he told me that the legislation under which T>ermission m a v 0 6 given to persons to operate under patent protection originally granted to alien enemies will have effect only during the war, and that later the original patentees, whether Germans or other foreigners, will resume all their rights and privileges. The honourable member for Wentworth suggested that aspirin could be made under another name, but the patent laws do not permit the infringement of a patent in that wav and the patentee could get the courts to protect his rights. It is only just that these rights should be so protected. . The other day, when in Sydney, I was asked to address an anti-German meetinc. but I felt that I could not mix myself with every one, and ought not to be the tool of designing persons. I am sufficiently well known in Sydney for every one to be aware that I cannot be bought. The men connected with this meeting have for thirty-six years and longer been preaching the doctrine that we should purchase in the cheapest market, wherever that might be, They are the men who are responsible for the presence of so many German articles in the Australian market, and have done more than any others to bring our metal trade under the control, not of AustraI lians or Britishers, but of those who are our deadly enemies, and who will be our enemies even in time of peace, because they are using our valuable resources for their own ends. I need not name the men to whom I refer, but one of them is a knight, and has been a prominent free trader for a number of years.",18
106,Mr ORCHARD,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"The secretary to the meeting was a member of the Waverley Labour League, and so was the President. The idea originated with the Labour league.",19
107,The CHAIRMAN,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,The honourable member's time has expired.,19
108,Mr MASSYGREENE,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"Richmond) ri2.27] The honourable member for Dalley suggested that the only persons in Australia who are not taking part in the great struggle in which the Empire is now engaged are those who are well off. I am afraid that such suggestions are prompted, not by the desire to speak the truth , but in the hope of stirring up political strife; certainly they are highly regrettable. The wealthy persons of this community have done as well as any others. I do not know one wealthy familv in Australia which has not representatives at the front.",19
109,Mr RILEY,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,I heard a wealthy man say that he would put his money into American stocks rather than pay our taxation.,19
110,Mr MASSYGREENE,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"The i r representatives have given in just the same degree as others. The honourable member knows quite well that this Parliament has the power of taxation, and has exercised it . In many cases the aggregate taxation in Australia amounts to more than a fourth of the incomes of the wealthy. In some cases it goes higher than one-half.",19
111,Mr FENTON,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,What if it does?,19
112,Mr MASSYGREENE,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,Hav e any honourable members on that side of the chamber heard complaints from the wealthy people ?,19
113,Mr FENTON,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,Yes .,19
114,Mr MASSYGREENE,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"A r e they not paying their taxes as loyally as any one else? I have heard no general complaint from them. They recognise that it is their duty to pay, and they are doing their duty, and doing it well. When we turn aside to the voluntary contributions which have flowed like water from both the wellto-do and those who are not so well off, I venture to say that the Australian contributions stand out above those given in any other part of the British Empire.",19
115,Mr FENTON,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,The Indians have contributed far more handsomely than any other part of the Empire.,20
116,Mr MASSYGREENE,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"I do not think that statistics will bear out the statement of the honourable member. He must recognise that India is one of the wealthiest portions of the British Empire, and while I admit that the wealthy citizens of India, in common with the wealthy citizens of Australia, have given liberally to the patriotic funds, I do not believe that any part of the British Empire has done as well as Australia in proportion to its population and wealth. I deprecate the attempt to set class against class. At the Dardanelles we see the wealthy man's sons shoulder to shoulder with the sons of the poor man, doing their work in the trenches just as nobly and just as well as any other class. I do not say.that there are not among the wealthy thoso who have shirked their duty, just as we can find among the working classes those who have shirked their duty.",20
117,Mr MCGRATH,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,Generally they have someobligation at home.,20
118,Mr MASSYGREENE,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"We all know that there are those who have no obligations at home, and have their ful l health and strength, but yet have not seen fit to volunteer in this campaign. Individual cases are to be found on all sides, but I ask honourable members not to draw between class and class invidious distinctions for which the circumstances give no justification. Every class of the community is endeavouring to do its duty, and is doing it nobly and well. - Mr Fenton - What was wrong with the statement of the honourable member for Dalley? He said that the workman gave his life; why should not the wealthy man give his purse ?",20
119,Mr MASSYGREENE,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"What was underlying the remarks of the honourable member was the imputation that the wealthy classes were not doing their share. I venture to say that they are doing their share, and doing it nobly and well. But I do not propose to draw invidious distinctions between class and class at the front; the subject that I wish to bring particularly under the notice of the Minister of Defence, or his representative in this chamber, is the question of how best Australia can answer to the call fer more and still more men that came to us from our King the other day. Australia has done well so far. Perhaps it has done more than any of us anticipated would be necessary when war was declared on the 4th August, 1914.",20
120,Mr HANNAN,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"It has done more than, any other part of the British Dominions.",20
121,Mr MASSYGREENE,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"There again I do not propose to draw invidious distinctions between Dominion and Dominion, or between State and State. I wish to place before the chamber my views in regard to the obligation that is laid on Australia in this struggle to do nothing short of its best, and in regard to how best we can do it . Australia has done well, but before the struggle is ended it will have to do a good deal better, in common with other parts of the Empire. If for no other reason than the purely selfish one that Australia possibly has more to lose than any other part of the Empire, it ought not to stop short of carrying out in its fulness the promise of the late Prime Minister when he said we would not stop until we had given our last man and our last shilling. The difficulty in regard to the present method of raising troops is the uncertainty of the system, and I believe that it will he found increasingly difficult as time goes on to get even the reinforcements necessary to keep the present forces to which Australia is already committed up to their existing strength. The remiiting figures of the last week or two show conclusively that the number of volunteers coming forward is not sufficient to maintain the necessary reinforcementsI think the Minister of Defence will admit it-and I seek to learn from the Ministry the proposals they have in view to assist the endeavour to swell the numbers. It is difficult to persuade men to leave their districts, their homes, and their kith and kin to go away to a concentration camp among a lot of men whom they do not know, and then proceed to the other side of the world. I have had considerable experience during the recruiting campaign, having addressed a large number of meetings, and having been partially successful in persuading recruits to make up their minds> but the further I have gone the more I have become convinced of the increasing difficulty in getting men to come forward. I believe we could overcome the difficulty fco a great extent by the creation of district regiments-by raising regiments in specific districts-by mapping out Australia into districts where men known to one another could be brought together in their district regiment. Menwould bemore ready to join if they knew they would be going through the campaign in the company of their mates, whilst one district would vie with another in turning out the greater number of recruits, and in providing the best regiments. Ifc would be infinitely easier to get men than it is today if some such system were adopted.",20
122,Mr THOMAS,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"Does the honourable 'member think they would not go to help the Empire, but would go to help a particular regiment!",21
123,Mr MASSYGREENE,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"I do not think that for a single moment. The honourable member for Barrier must know that in a matter of this kind there is a great meaning attached to the little word "" comradeship."" Scores of lads who would hesitate to go away to a camp where they did not know any one, to go into a tent where they did not know any one, and have to battle through it all by themselves, would gladly enli&t i ffcheyknew they were going fco join men with whom they were acquainted. I noticed the other day a speech made by the Canadian Minister of Defence in England, in which he said that it had not been necessary to hold a single recruiting meeting in Canada. we have done,"" he pointed out, "" is to map out a district, and I have announced that from that district we intend to raise such and such a regiment,"" That regiment was filled within a week. I believe the experience of Australia would be the same if the same expedient were adopted. Take, for instance, my own district-the Richmond and Tweed district. A large number of men have already gone from there. In the month of September the Lismore recruiting office dealt with 477 recruits. This month, up to the date when . I was recently there, 235 recruits had been sent into camp. But there are hundreds and hundreds of young fellows who, if a district regiment were created, would at once join the colours, though they will not do so today. Again, take the New England district. One of the influences that has been of material assistance in bringing recruits along at Armidale has been the existence of a local camp. Small companies of local men have been formed, and they have gone into camp together. The presence of that Camp has heen a great incentive to recruiting in that district, and I urge the Minister to seriously consider the desirability of establishing throughout Australia district regiments on the lines I have suggested. I have done my besfc in the recruiting campaigns just as other honourable members have done, but I am coming to the conclusion that, notwithstanding all the recruiting efforts that are being made, we are not getting sufficient men to keep the reinforcements going. Whilst that is the case our difficulties will grow greater and greater, so that the Minister and the Government ought seriously to contemplate an alteration in the existing method to discover whether it is not possible to obtain a greater and more constant flow of recruits. May I refer for a moment to one of the little pinpricks noticeable in connection with the work of the Defence Department-pinprick s little, perhaps, in themselves, but all tending to check the flow of recruits ? I mean the existing method, or lack of method, of notifying casualties to the relatives of those who havÂ© gone to the front . I do not know what is wrong. It is evidently not at this end, and it is evidently not on the peninsula at Gallipoli, for it is after the troops have left Gallipoli that all the trouble begins. In many cases that have come under "" All my own notice, the notification of a casualty has reached the relatives weeks after the casualty actually happened. Take the case of my own brother. I received a letter from him dated 9th September. Ble had then been four weeks in the hospital; but I have received no official notification of this casualtv yet, and I do not know when I am likely to get one. The son of an honourable member of this House came home the other day wounded from Egypt, and when he landed in Australia his father did not know that he had been wounded, and to this day he has not received any notification of the casualty. Scores of similar cases might be quoted. Is it not possible for the Minister to devise some better method of notifying the casualties as they actually occur, and of so saving the relatives of those at the front these months of anxiety? I could quote instances where relatives have been notified of casualties. They have cabled, but have not been able to receive any information, yet after weeks and weeks of anxiety they have discovered that when the original notification was despatched their relative had recovered from the effects of his injury.",21
124,Mr RILEY,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,You can hardly avoid some mistakes.,22
125,Mr MASSYGREENE,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"But these are not mistakes. The whole trouble is that the notification of casualties is weeks and weeks behind. A case came under my notice the other day in which the Defence Department notified a casualty to a man. A private was wounded in the fighting early in August. The Department notified the father of this on 27th September, and intimated that the lad had been landed at Malta. The father instantly wired to ascertain the nature of his injuries. He could obtain no satisfaction through official channels, but eventually discovered through the Red Crossthat his son had been shipped from Malta to London on the 5th September. He then endeavoured to obtain further information concerning him through official channels, and was furnished with the particulars which the Red Cross Society had already supplied. Meantime he was cabling to London, and, eventually, ascertained through the Young Men's Christian Association that his boy was well, and. on furlough. I have yet another case where the Department notified a citizen on the 20th July that his son was wounded. He endeavoured to get into communicatien with him, and succeeded, through private channels-chiefl y through the Red Cross and the Young Men's Christian Association-in discovering that his son was wounded on the 28th June; that on the Sth July he arrived at the second Australian general hospital, Ghezireh; that he was discharged from that hospital at the end of July, arrived again at the front early in August, and embarked on a hospital ship from ANZAC at the end of August, ill . Ultimately the father received a cable from his son, dated London, 13th October, stating, "" On furlough; quite well"" That was the information, the father obtained through private channels. The official information he received was as follows:-In the first place, he received a telegram from the Defence Department, Melbourne, on the 20th July, stating that the young man was in the Second Australian General Hospital, Egypt, suffering from a slight bullet wound. The next intimation that he received from the Department was in the form of a letter from the Officer in Charge of the Base Records, Melbourne, dated 13th October, as follows: DEAB Sm,-Wit h reference to my wire of the 20th July, I have now to. advise you that information has been received to the effect that your son is now in the hospital at Birmingham That was the whole of the official information he obtained. Between the 20th July, the date on which the telegram was sent by the Department, and the 13th October, there was a complete hiatus so far as official information was concerned But that the father was well off, and could afford to send a number of cablegrams, he would not have got the information that he did through private sources. This is by no means an isolated case. Many cases of a similar character are constantly coming under my notice. To make the position worse from the point of view of the failure of the official information, it may be mentioned that, in the letter of the 13th October, from the Base Records Office, the statement was made, "" An y further particulars coming to hand will be promptly transmitted."" A system which permits of this kind"" of thing  hide bound and conservative in the extreme, but the authorities will not alter it.",22
126,Mr MASSYGREENE,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"That may be. If we desirÂ© to have a constant flow of recruits we should endeavour to get the military machine to work as smoothly as possible. If there is one thing more than another that at present is retarding the recruiting movement in the country, it is that relatives of soldiers at the front, once they are wounded, have the greatest difficulty in ascertaining what has happened to them. All honourable members arÂ© aware of the anxiety of parents in this regard. All know the difficulties that crop up from time to time. The experience of honourable members in this respect must have been similar to my own. We know that when a parent has an experience of this kind, the story passes from mouth to mouth, and is more and more exaggerated. This tends to retard recruiting.  abroad that the Government do not care.",22
127,Mr GEEENE,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"That , no doubt, is what is being said; but I know that the Government do care, and that they are anxious that the relatives of those who go to the front shall be kept in touch, as far as possible, with what is going on. They are anxious to relieve the anxiety of parents. Numerous instances have been brought under.my notice where they have responded to requests I have made, and have despatched cables for information. But while the authorities here are doing that-and the Officer in Charge of the Base Records Ofiice, in Melbourne, is doing his best to get information from the other side-in nine cases out of ten, either the information supplied from the other end in answer to their cable messages is weeks old, and of no use whatever, or no information at all is forthcoming.  at the other end.",23
128,Mr MASSYGREENE,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"I believe that it is at the base. We know that our wounded men are scattered about-that some go to Alexandria, some to Cairo, some to Malta, and others to England, but the methods adopted for collating this information at the front, and sending it to Australia must be bad. The information so supplied is weeks old. I ask the Minister to devise somÂ© means of securing reasonable celerity at all events in the notification casualties, and of keeping the information up to date.",23
129,Unknown,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,Sitting suspended from 12.57 to 2.15 p.m.,23
130,Mr JENSEN,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"Bass-Minister for the Navy) [2.15] - I wish to take this opportunity to reply to some comments and statements made by honourable members yesterday in regard to alleged neglect on the part of the Minister of Defence and some of his officers in the cases of sick and wounded soldiers, or of men travelling from one camp to another. afraid that such criticism cannot do recruiting - any good. Every time that such comments and statements are levelled at the Defence Department because of alleged negligence or unfair treatment, it must have a prejudicial influence on those who are thinking of enlisting; and, therefore, it is necessary that some reply should be made to the honourable member for Corio, the honourable member for Corangamite, and the honourable member for Nepean. With reference to the statement of the honourable member for Corio in connection with the case of Private Ryan that the Minister did not reply to his wire, the facts are that the honourable member first wired to the Minister on 12th October, saying that he had wired Paymaster Bolle over a month ago. Mr.. Trumble, acting secretary, wired back the next day, 13th, that Paymaster Bolle was posting report that night. The delay in making payment was due to company officers at Seymour failing to claim pay for this man, reporting him as absent, and neglecting to ascertain his whereabouts. At the same time, the Minister admits that the pay office, with the information supplied by the honourable member and Mrs Ryan as to Private Ryan being in the hospital, should have continued the payment of the soldier's allotment to his wife, pending adjustment of the matter in proper form. The Minister intends to sheet home the responsibility for the lack of records by the officers at the camp. As regards the pay office at the Victorian District Head-quarters, the Minister recognises that those in charge are working at great pressure, and are also responsible for safeguarding public moneys, and must, therefore, satisfy themselves of the bona fides of claims. At the same time, he feels that in this case the paymaster should have exercised his discretion, and of dealt with the matter more promptly. It has to be remembered that the greater part of the paymaster's staff, about 80 per cent., consists of temporary clerks who have had little experience of this work. In respect to the offer of his services by the honourable member for Corio,. the following, letter was sent to him by the Minister, and no reply has been received. This letter is dated l l t h September, 1915, and is as follows:Dear Mr Ozanne, I have been thinking over your letter of 27th I am ult., in which you offer your services to the Department in any suitable capacity. You do not state your age, and, of course, as you know, any appointment would be dependent on your passing the necessary medical tests.. I notice you state that you were a sergeant in the old Harbor Trust Artillery under Colonel Hanby. ColonelHanby is at present commanding a dep6t battalion at the Show Grounds Camp, and, with your experience with stores and of military work, it might be possible to place you as a QuartermasterSergeant for a start, when you could work up to a Quartermaster's position. To this end you would have to enlist for service in Australia, and could replace a man going to the front. I think it necessary to add, however, that sucb duties should be continuous and not intermittent, and the question immediately arises how your parliamentary duties are to fare. Furthermore, any such appointment would be provisional only, and your continuance in it dependent on your performance of its duties. I cannot think of any other opening just now. I have not taken any steps with regard to the position referred to, but if you are willing to proceed in the matter, I make inquiries to see if it is available. Yours faithfully, I think the honourable member for Corio stated that he had offered Ids .services to the Department, and had not received a reply.",23
131,Mr JH CATTS,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,That is not to what he referred-h e referred to the organization of the system of dealing with correspondence.,24
132,Mr JENSEN,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,And I have read the reply.,24
133,Mr JH CATTS,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,That reply refers to another matter that arose long ago.,24
134,Mr JENSEN,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"I am told differently. However, the honourable member for Corangamite alleged that a man, after being in camp eighty-eight days, was paid only 30s. The only record that can so far be found is a letter from the honourable member on 23rd September in reference to Private T. T. Hammond, who, the letter stated, had been in camp for ten days, not eighty-eight davs as stated in the House, and asking that he be paid. The matter was at once sent on by the Secretary for Defence to the District Pay Office, and the District Paymaster, on 19th October, 1915, advised the Secretary that the matter had been referred to the camp with a view to settlement. The honourable member for Nepean referred to the case of A . J . Smith, of the 12th L i g h t Horse. No record can be found in the Department of any representations from the honourable member in this matter. In the case of Hargreaves, referred to by the honourable member for Corio, trouble arose because this man at first refused to make an allotment of his pay to his wife as required by regulation. He signed portion of his pay over to his mother, and made a statutory declaration that his wife was not living at home, and that this disentitled her to separation allowance. Paymaster Bolle suggested that, if Hargreaves admitted that he was legally liable for her maintenance, separation allowance to the wife would be admitted up to 15th August. Por the three months prior to 15th August Hargreaves was on sick leave, and was apparently not claimed for by the Camp Staff. The non-payment to the soldier himself arose through no record or pay-sheet being forwarded by the Camo Staff to the District Pay Office on account of Hargreaves. Non-payment of separation allowance was will also affected by this same fact. The M in ister will also endeavour to fix the responsibility for this neglect on the oflicer (Sgd.) &. F. PEAECE. at the camp responsible for the neglect, and to see that proper punishment is dealt out to him. I should now like to say a word or two with reference to the observations and suggestions of the honourable member for Richmond. The honourable member has asked me to bring his suggestions under the notice of the Minister of Defence, and that I promise him I shall do. The Department has had to deal not only with 160,000 men, but with their relatives as well, and thousands of letters are received in Melbourne every week, dealing with all sorts of inquiries and cases. Under all the circumstances,I think that the Minister has done admirable work; and I trust that in the future we shall not hear such observations regarding him as we have heard in the past. Honourable members ought to try to realise the work that has confronted, and still confronts, the Minister of Defence, and I am sure that if any honourable member here were in the position of that gentleman, he would not like to be attacked in any such way.",24
135,Mr WATKINS,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,Nobod y is blaming the Minister.,24
136,Mr JENSEN,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,The Minister has been singled out by some honourable members of the House.,24
137,Mr MASSYGREENE,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,I am sure the Minister would admit that in my remarks there was nothing derogatory to him.,24
138,Mr JENSEN,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"Not at all. I am sure that the honourable member made no attack on the Minister; and I have promised to bring the suggestions he made under the notice of the honourable gentleman. However, there are some honourable members who, with a view to notoriety, or for some other reason, seem to take a delight to rake un things against the Minister at the head of this Denartment. But, as I said before, I trust that we shall not have a repetition of this in the future. I know what the Minister has had to bear, with all the responsibility that is olaced upon him.",24
139,Mr WATKINS,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,I hope the Minister for the Navy does not mean that honourable members may not endeavour to right a wrong.,25
140,Mr JENSEN,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"Not at all; but honourable members ought to be sure of their facts before they bring cases before the House. I point out to honourable members that if they will take their complaints straight to the barracks and interview the Minister, in every instance anything that is wrong will be put right. I appeal to honourable members not to bring trivial matters before the House in the future.",25
141,Mr BILEY,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"(South Sydney) [2.25]. - It has been my lot to have much correspondence with soldiers and their relatives; and I can say that, personally, I have always received the utmost courtesy and most generous consideration from the Minister of Defence. Many of the cases brought before me that looked black and complicated were straightened out on investigation by the Minister; and in every instance I have received satisfaction. Those requests which the Minister has turned down I also would have turned down had I been Minister. There are cases in which the Minister must use his own discretion in the interests of the country, and he cannot be expected to give to an honourable member or to the public everything that is asked for. I desire to place on record my sympathy with the Minister of Defence in the arduous task he has to perform. If one calls at his office he finds that so many people are waiting to see the Minister that he has scarcely time to get his meals. We should realise the great responsibility that rests upon him, and remember that if there are faults overwork is the cause. The Minister has no intention of refusing members the fullest consideration of every matter they bring forward.  any such intention?",25
142,Mr EILEY,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"Yes . We have no reason to feel ashamed of the work done hy this Parliament and the Minister who represents the Parliament in connection with the conduct of the war. Australia, with a population of less than 5,000,000, has done better than Canada, with its population of 8,000,000, and it must be remembered that Australia has to transport its troops a very much greater distance to the seat of war than has Canada. The Government have great trouble in getting transports and having them fitted up, and then, when those transports are expected to return from Egypt, they are utilized by the British Government for other work, and Australia has to find other transports. We should endeavour to show sympathy with those who have the responsibility of carrying on the business of the country and the conduct of the war.",25
143,Mr SINCLAIR,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,They have to meet with the obstruction of the unionists.,25
144,Mr RILEY,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,That statement is a slander on the workers of the country. There has not been in Australia one strike that has had the effect of interfering with the despatch of troops.,25
145,Mr SAMPSON,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,What about the remarks of Mr Justice Heydon?,25
146,Mr RILEY,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"Mr Justice Heydon referred to the internal disputes between one union and another. Has there been any strike in the Small Arms Factory? No; the men have been working in that Factory from 7 o'clock in the morning until 7 o'clock at night, day in and day out. It is a slander on the workers for any honourable member to say that they are trying to delay the operations of the Defence Department. There'have been no disputes in the hoot and clothing trades, and the Woollen Mills, which are producing the cloth and blankets for our troops, have been working at high pressure continuously. The workers may have had grievances, bnt in the interests of the country they have suppressed them. That is a compliment that cannot be paid to the workmen of England and France. I trust that we shall have no more of this personal criticism of the Minister of Defence. The honourable member for Nepean last night attacked the Defence Department and the State Government of New South Wales with regard to the bread supply, but he did not take the trouble to ascertain the conditions on which the bread is supplied. The truth is that the Government enters into a contract for the supply of bread at so much per hundredweight.  weight of the loaf is specified.",25
147,Mr RILEY,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"If that is so, the ister must have wrongly informed me. A few months ago questions were raised about the supply of jam for the Navy and the Military Camps, and the Minister for the Navy informed me that, although the tins contained only 13 or 14 ounces of jam, the Department did not suffer, because the jam was bought by the hundredweight. The Minister made no attempt to accuse the contractors for jam supplies of trying to rob the public, and after receiving his assurance I allowed the matter to drop. One jam manufacturer had come to me and said, ""We used to have the contract for the supply of jam to the Department, but now a certain firm is supplying jam in tins that contain only 14 ounces."" When the Minister explained that the jam was bought by the hundredweight, I accepted his explanation, and made no attempt to suggest that the contractor was robbing the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Nepean, however, has deliberately gone out of his way to make it appear that the men in the Camps are not receiving their proper allowance of bread because the State Government is supplying a loaf which is 10 ounces short in weight. We have been told that there should be no political strife while the war is in progress, and the honourable member has shown us how he acts up to that principle.",26
148,Mr BRUCE SMITH,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,You are setting a nice example.,26
149,Mr RILEY,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"I am endeavouring to reply to the honourable member for Nepean, and every time a member rises to attack the Government unfairly I shall not allow his remarks to go unchallenged. Friends of mine who are men of independent means, and have been accustomed to live for years in the lap of luxury, have told me, after visits to the military camp, that the food supplied to the soldiers in the camp is of the best quality, and that they get plenty of it . How can honourable members expect to assist recruiting by delivering speeches in this House complaining that bread of short weight is delivered to the military camps, and by finding every kind of fault with the administration of the camps? We cannot wonder that recruiting in New South Wales has not been as successful as could be desired when we find honourable members from Min- that State endeavouring in this House to condemn the administration of the Liverpool Camp. Personally, I am inclined to interview the Minister of Defence privately with a view to having that camp removed. If , as we are informed by the honourable member for Nepean, it is merely a dust heap, and should be asphalted, it is clear that a suitable site has not been chosen for the camp.",26
150,Mr ORCHARD,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,I advocated two years ago that it should be removed to Green Hills.,26
151,Mr RILEY,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"The Commonwealth Government have territory of their own, and any money spent there would be well spent. I think that we might consider whether the camp should not be removed from Liverpool. If the people of Liverpool have instructed their representative in this House to try to get. the camp shifted, why should we not shift it? I should like to ask the honourable member for Nepean whether it is a fact that he paid a man to go up to the Liverpool Camp to take a cinematograph picture of the scene when a certain presentation was made to him, in order that the picture might be exhibited at all the picture shows throughout the Commonwealth.",26
152,Mr ORCHARD,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,No . That is on a par with other things the honourable member has said.,26
153,Mr RILEY,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"When _ I was in Brisbane recently I saw a picture showing all the recruits cheering the honourable member at the camp. We can understand the honourable member's continuous faultfinding with the administration of the Liverpool Camp if it is done, not for pure motives, but for advertising purposes. We are here to look after the public interest, and not our own interest.",26

158,Mr FOWLER,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"I rise to a point of order. I have listened to the honourable member for South Sydney making serious reflections upon members of this House for a considerable time. I draw your attention, sir, to the fact that the honourable member has suggested that members of this House are trying to get into the limelight, and has charged them with making arrangements with other persons for their appearance in picture films.",27

160,Mr EILEY,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"My object is to try to prevent honourable members opposite from imputing improper motives to Ministers and to honourable members on this side. I hope that this kind of thing will be discontinued, and that honourable members on both sides will unite in their efforts carry on the war successfully. ",27
161,Mr RILEY,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"When the honourable member considers the British Coalition Government he need not suggest the formation of such a Government here. I am as anxious as any one else that recruiting should be successful. I complained that speeches made here, on both sides, are calculated to injuriously affect recruiting. The sooner honourable members realise that the better. The members of the present Government have occupied their positions for but a very short time, and yet their candid friends have risen to criticise and find fault with them. It requires no ability to find fault. That is the simplest thing in the world to do. Fancy the honourable member for Nepean travelling over in the train with the Minister of Defence all the way from Sydney to Melbourne without mentioning that he intended to bring certain matters before the House, and then, on his arrival here, launching his torpedo. What for? Was it to assist the Defence Department? Not at all. Honourable members should be straightforward and above board, and should consult with the Minister of Defence.",27

167,Mr RILEY,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"Anothe r matter to which I should like to refer is the statement made by the honourable member for Maranoa on the subject of telephone charges. I was surprised at the sympathy the honourable member expressed for the business portion of the community. When the honourable member for Barrier, as Postmaster-General, reduced the charge for telephones from Â£9 to Â£4 and Â£ 5 , we heard no outcry from the commercial classes. That was considered right in their interests. The honourable member for Maranoa proposes that during the day the charge should be only ^d. per call, beto cause the business people then require to use the telephone. He suggests that the charge at night should be I d . per call. The honourable member has scarcely realized what we should be up against if his suggestions were adopted. If there is one thing for which I commend the late Postmaster-General it is the way in which he faced the problem of making the telephone service pay. After all, it is only a business enterprise. We propose to install the automatic system at great expense, and it will increase by 6 per cent, the facilities of telephone subscribers. This is not the time to reduce, but to increase, the charges for telephone calls. I hope that the present Postmaster-General will not listen to honourable members who are asking for cheap telephones. We are getting a cheaper telephone service today in the Commonwealth than are the people of any other part of the world considering the service rendered. The honourable member for Maribyrnong has said that the only exchange that is not paying is the Sydney exchange, and that a profit is shown by the Melbourne and Hobart exchanges. The honourable member is altogether wrong in the inferences he has drawn. In the case of the other exchanges referred to, capital cost and depreciation have not been taken into consideration in his estimate. He has considered just the takings of",27

170,Mr RILEY,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,If the honourable member will look up the figures he will discover that he is mistaken. I believe that the telephone service should be placed upon a sound and paying basis.,28

I am of opinion that he will deal with that Department in a practical manner. At the same time. I hope that he will not be led away by the cry that we ought to - have cheap telephones. To-day the users of our telephones are paying less than is being paid in any other part of the world for similar services. I hope that the Postmaster General will look into a number of other grievances which are before him at the present time. I feel sure that he will not encourage the practice of compelling female telephone attendants to work at night. The whole tendencv of legislation in the United Kingdom is to nrevent the employment of females at night. I trust, therefore, that the Postmaster-General will initiate a system under which day labour will be substituted for night work in the case of female telephone employees. I am prepared to extend to Ministers the most generous consideration. There are anv number of grievances which I might bring under the notice nf honourable members, but whenever I have had cause for complaint, and have approached Ministers privately my representations have received attention.

T i e honourable member for Batman will probably remember the circumstances better than I do. To my mind, the position is a very serious one, particularly from a financial point of view. However, I do not propose to discuss that aspect of the question today. I am strongly of opinion that certain action taken by the Government is calculated to seriously prejudice the future of Australia. The great wealth of this country is due to our primary industries, and I view with apprehension the action taken by the Attorney-General in connection with many of those industries. In the first place, I would point to the arrangement which he has made in respect to the. transport of our wheat. feel sure that his action will prove in jurious to the farmers of Australia. H a d the transport of our wheat been l e ft to the ordinary agents, the requirements of our producers would have been far better satisfied than they will be. In connection with this matter, it strikes me as peculiar that the Minister of Lands in Western Australia should have made an entirely different statement from that made by the Attorney-General. Mr Johnson states that he came to Melbourne to give his opinion in regard to the suggestion of the Attorney-General that the Commonwealth should take action. Being a member of the same political party, he was quite willing that the Commonwealth should do so. He statesI was sent across by the Government represent Western Australia, and Mr Hughes pointed out at that time that he did not it advisable to have a conference of all the States, but that he desired to get the indiward vidual view of the various States. When the representatives of the States now working. were called together on the second occadone sion, the Attorney-General had completed his arrangements for the transport wheat with Messrs. Elder, Smith, and Company and Gibbs, Bright, and Coma pany. Speaking of this conference, Mr been done. Johnson statesOn assembling, Mr Hughes said that, as a guns are now being made. result of the meeting he had had presentatives of the various States some time previously-that is, the meeting to which I have referred-h e had got into communication ber has mentioned the fact. with shipping people, and had come to arrangement with two firms to do the whole of the chartering necessary for the Australian harvest. Then the Attorney-General led us to believe that the various indent and shipping firms were quite agreeable to subscribe to his proposition and to f all into line. The Conference met representatives of shipping firms, the wheat buyers, and the Chambers of Commerce, and accord ing to Mr JohnsonThey were of opinion that the shipping people should look after the shipping, that the buyers should look after the buying, and, generally speaking, they thought tliese people were well able to cope with the business without the interference of either the Commonwealth or any of the States. I feel sure that had this matter been left to the ordinary channels, the farmers would this year be far better catered for than they will be. We are in a wretched I position at present. We are at the end of October, and so far as we know nothing has yet been completed, nor have we any idea of what shipping facilities are going to be guaranteed in the various States.",29

181,Mr GREGORY,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"I believe it would have done far better. W it h Government management, we are having the same wretched bungling throughout, and particularly in the case of the Small Arms Factory, as the honourable member knows. The second shift was started there only a few months ago, although almost immediately after the war began the Minister announced that he had given instructions to institute a second shift. Nothing was done in that matto ter until the Public Works Committee, to which the honourable member belongs, think and the Finance Committee, brought forresolutions to the effect that, as the result of their inquiries, they believed a second shift could be instituted, and it is The Government have nothing up to the present in regard to the manufacture of munitions. They of our may be making inquiries and preparations, but the fact remains that, for over year since the war began, nothing has",29
182,Mr JH CATTS,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"Shell s and machine You will not with the reanswer that statement. M.r. GREGORY - The honourable memI n all the an concerns in which the Government havf been interested there has been nothing but delay, and in every instance, so far as I can judge, the cost has been far greater than would have been the case if the undertaking had been left to private enterprise. I am afraid of the influence of the action of the Government on our primary industries, and am anxious about the result of the action which the Attorney-General has recently taken with reference to the export of metals. Certain metals are absolutely essential for the manufacture tions. Wolfram and soheelite are metals from which tungstic acid is Tungsten has for many years been used for hardening steel. We have been producing a good deal of wolfram and a small amount of scheelite, and this has been purchased in the Old Country, Germany, and other places. The value of molybdenite has only lately been demonstrated. Some time ago the French Government discovered how valuable it was in preventing cordite from deteriorating, especially in warm climates. afterwards found wonderfully in hardening steel, a discovery which has almost revolutionized the tool ing processes. Molybdenite is now used in the manufacture of cannon, to increase the penetrating power of shells, for hardening the armour plates of vessels, in making machine guns and bullets, and rifles, and rifle bullets. It has also been discovered that aluminium can be made as tough as the toughest steel by adding an alloy of molybdenite now indispensable in the building of aeroplanes. There is therefore a great demand for this metal. Attorney-General and the generally are doing right in that none of these metals shall be sent to any alien country, and I am with them heart and soul in requiring that they be sent to Great Britain first, and if not required there, then to our Allies to assist in making munitions for the successful prosecution of the war. In 1913 we exported two-thirds of the world's output of molybdenite. The Government recently sued instructions that none of these metals was to be exported except under the authority of the Minister of which was quite right, but later the Attorney-General issued a regulation no molybdenite, wolfram, or scheelite was to be sent out of Australia unless it came up to a certain standard, which, as a matter of fact, has not been reached in AusMr Gregory. tralia except in a few instances. According to Mineral Industry for 1914, published in the United States of America, Australia produced, in 1913, 145 tons of molybdenite, which contained 80 per cent. Mo. Sa, or better. According to the same journal, Norway produced molybdenite particularly giving 84 per cent. There has been im mense working of molybdenite in that country, where they work from low-grade ore, as low as 1 per cent., but they have the very finest plants for treating the of muni- material. The Attorney-General's regulation stipulates that no molybdenite shall extracted. go out of Australia unless it goes afc least 90 per cent., nor must it contain more than \ per cent, of t in or \ per cent, of bismuth.",29
183,Mr MASSYGREENE,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,The Attorney-General's advice seems to have been all wrong.,30
184,Mr GREGORY,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"It has been simply a case of blundering. I do not know who was responsible, or what sort of metallurgical advice the Attorney-General has obtained, but the result is that It was 40 or 50 tons of molybdenite placed on efficacious vessels to be sent to the Old Country had to be taken off again. Whoever was manufactur- guilty of this was "" u i l t y of an outrage against the nations that are fighting Germany, and some investigation is demanded, because if the information sent to me is correct there is something behind this. Sir ROBERT BES T - What is the ostensible excuse?",30
185,Mr GREGORY,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"It is the question of price. So far as the wheat business is concerned, two firms have been given a The monopoly of all the shipping, and can Government sit in their offices and draw their commisdemanding sion, the other agents having to come along and hand them over their charters.",30
186,Mr LAIRD SMITH,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,What do you mean by saying there is something behind all this?,30
187,Mr GREGORY,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"Every effort should be made by both State and Federal Governments to assist the producer at this istime. The State Government is making great efforts to get molybdenite produced here, and has had it produced from lowCustoms, grade ore. There are molybdenite lodes in Queensland, New South Wales, and that Western Australia, and every effort should be made by the Commonwealth to help the producer to produce an article which can be used by Great Britain and her Allies in the manufacture of munitions.",30
188,Mr GREENE,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,The producer is getting under this arrangement a lower price than he was getting before.,31
189,Mr GREGORY,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,Eve r so much lower.,31
190,Mr RILEY,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"Is that the trouble, that the price has gone down?",31
191,Mr GREGORY,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"The price has not gone down. The London Mining Journal of 4th September last showed that molybdenite was 120s. per unit in London. Only a few days afterwards the Attorney-General issued his regulation fixing the price at 105s. per unit. This is undoubtedly a good price; but according to my information, a producer at Wolfram Camp, by the prices fixed by the Government as payable at different localities, loses 14s. 2d. a unit, or nearly Â£70 per ton to get his metal to London, while the producer in Sydney will lose nearly Â£60 a ton, that being the difference between the London price and the price which will obtain in Australia. The ordinary cost of sending this metal to London was formerly about Â£6 per ton. now have one firm-Dalget y and Company-wh o are the sole agents, and have complete control in connection with the export of this mineral.",31

193,Mr GREGORY,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"Yes , of course they are.",31
194,Mr LAIRD SMITH,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"Then what did you mean when you said just ""now that there was something behind all this?",31
195,Mr GREENE,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,The producers of these metals are nearly all small men.,31
196,Mr GREGORY,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"We want to endeavour, as far as possible, to secure the fullest production of all these kindred metals, and we do not want to prevent their export under reasonable precautions. The Attorney-General told me yesterday, in answer to a question, that he was not aware that some parcels of molybdenite had been taken off a vessel and prevented from heing sent away, but I saw the correspondence in the press in Sydney, in which the Attorney-General was concerned.",31
197,Mr FENTON,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,To whom was the metal consigned ?,31
198,Mr GREGORY,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,I do not know who consigned the metal.,31
199,Mr FENTON,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,Ver y likely the Minister wanted to be satisfied as to its destination.,31
200,Mr GREGORY,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"The Attorney-General, I know, is responsible for the regulation dealing with the export of molybdenite, and if one watches the progress of events in connection with this matter, one will see how kindly the people who are exporting wolfram and scheelite are treated as compared with those who are exporting molybdenite. It is a serious matter that the Attorney-General was not aware, according to the answer he gave me yesterday, that molybdenite which had been consigned to London had been taken off a vessel, because I am given to understand that last Wednesday, in answer to a cable from the Home authorities, permission was given to ship molybdenite of a lower grade. I quite agree that the greatest care should be taken to see that the metal goes only to Great Britain or her Allies to be used for the manufacturing of munitions; but I say that there has been criminal neglect owing to the wretched regulations which are interfering with the exportation of We this metal. Here is an extract from a letter which I have received from Mr. Scantlebury, and after reading what he has to say, I want to urge on the Government the necessity for a Commission to inquire into the position. He statesCertainly somebody should go to gaol over this muddle, and if there has been no hold-up in Australia of these rare minerals, if production has not been curtailed by any Federal action, if the industry throughout the Commonwealth is not jeopardized by unnecessary conditions in respect to grade and purity-in other words-if all I have said is a myth, and in the words of the Attorney-General, there is no truth whatever in my statement, then it should be myself. On the other hand, if it is true that for nearly two months all shipments of these indispensable minerals have ceased, that large quantities have been taken out of 0 the holds of mail steamers on the eve of departure, which by this time would have been turned into munitions; that appeals for permits to ship have been disallowed, and contracts for the British and French armies and navies have been dishonoured-if these and other sensational revelations, I , with other producers, am prepared to make are true, then I claim to have done Australia some service in directing attention to the greatest munition muddle of the war.",31
201,Mr RILEY,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,Did not the honourable member read in the papers a London cable congratulating the Prime Minister on the action he has taken?,31
202,Mr GREENE,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,That was not on this question.,31
203,Mr GREGORY,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,The congratulations referred to by the honourable member were in relation to the efforts made by the Commonwealth. Government to loosen the grip which German interests have on the metal industry in Australia.,31
204,Mr LAIRD SMITH,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"Mr Scantlehury careful to say that "" if "" his statements are true, certain action should be taken. He does not say that his statements are true.",32
205,Mr GREGORY,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"In his letter, Scantlebury states that some one should go to gaol over the matter, and that if his statements are not true, that he should go to gaol himself. We find now that the Attorney-General, in starting the metal exchange, is building up a monopoly, which, in the future, will control the industry of this country. We find, also, that, in order to become a member of Exchange, an entrance fee of Â£50 w i l required, as well as a subscription of Â£15 15s. a yoar, while a bond of Â£1,000 will have to he entered into before any person will he allowed to deal in metals. Firms like the Broken Hill Proprietary Company know how to look after their own business, but I am afraid that future the small producers of metal in this country will be right in the hands of little "" ring,"" which will be controlled by non. this Metal Exchange, for , according the Attorney-General, no metal will be exported from this country except through the Exchange, which will be buyer and seller, and a record will be kept in the office of the Exchange showing from metal is purchased, and to whom it is sent. All exports could have heen watched hy the Minister of Trade and Customs to see that these metals were sent to help own people, but? now a monopoly w i l be created, and "" r in g s "" formed the very people who say that they want special powers to be able deal with monopolies. I hope as a result of what I have said, the his Attorney-General will have inquiries made, and if the information is inaccuand rate, that the persons responsible punished. So far as I am concerned, think the action of the Government in regard to the metal industry will retard its development, and more particularly the development of those special alloys which are so necessary for the production of munitions of war for our Allies our own people. It does seem strange ing he said that while, in the past, both Great Britain and Germany were prepared to take was molybdenite concentrates of 80 per cent., uow, unless very heavy expenditure is in curred in refining plants, molybdenite is which will not come up to the high test demanded of it must be kept within the States, and our people debarred from its use. I feel that the action of the Attorney-General in connection Will this matter is detrimental to the best interests of the Mr Old Country and of Australia.",32

It will be seen that the Tory member for Flinders is too radical for even the honourable member for BalaclavaSo long as we pretended that our national destinies were guided by a Federal form Government, the question of dual sovereignty was the very essence of the contract. sovereignty implied this: that there should be assigned to the Commonwealth, on the one hand, and to the States on the other, ticular area of operation as clearly denned as endums ? legal language could define it ; and within those respective spheres the Parliaments be absolute, so far as British Parliaments could be absolute.

217,Sir WILLIAM IEVINE,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"Suppos e that I am capable of every evil, will you answer my question?",34
218,Mr HAMPSON,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"The honourable and learned member will not give a vote to working men, whether it is for the municipal council or for the Legislative Council, but he cannot help himself as regards the Federal Parliament.",34
219,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"Now , after that,, answer the ouestion.",34
220,Mr HAMPSON,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"My reply is that if I can devise any means whereby the men can get the right to vote, it will be done. Let me now deal with the position which Australia is taking up, and what we are doing in connection with the war. I am one of those who disapprove of an honourable member bringing forward little complaints and magnifying them, and blaming the Defence Department for sins of omission and commission. The Defence Department has done good work in many respects. But the war has taught the lesson that what is most needed is artillery, machine guns, and ammunition. The part that Australia is playing in supplying this want is extremely small. The Premiers offered to put their plant and skilled artisans in the railway workshops of the States at the disposal of the Commonwealth Government, and we should now be making shells at something like the same rate as that at which they are being turned out in Canada, where the new orders for shells from Russia and Great Britain are valued at Â£11,000,000; but the output of the Newport railway workshops is a miserable 250 shells a week. Surely the workshops in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and ' South Australia are not doing what they should do in this matter. The Canadians are beginning to make artillery, but we are not making even machine guns. The excuse that is made is that we are going to have an abundant harvest; but in Canada they expect a harvest greater by more than 100,000,000 bushels than any previous harvest. Their harvest is estimated at 300,000,000 bushels of wheat, and ours will not be one-third of that, whereas the population of Australia is about 5,000,000, as against 8,000,000 in Canada. It seems absurd to talk of conscription when we are so neglectful of the duty of supplying munitions and artillery. I shall not consent to conscription without insisting on the application of the principle to wealth before its application to human beings.",34
221,Mr ATKINSON,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,We have that already.,34
222,Mr HAMPSON,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"No , we have not.",34
223,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"Wakefield) [3.30],- I do not agree with the honourable member for South Sydney, the special apologist for the Government, that the Government has any complaint to make regarding the criticism of its administration in this chamber. The honourable member reflected unfairly on the honourable member for Nepean. When the honourable member for Nepean first brought his complaints against the Defence Department, he was criticised in a similar way, hut he has since been complimented for his action, and particularly by the Judge who inquired into the conduct of the Liverpool Camp. That Judge not only sustained the honourable member's charges, but discovered other evidence of inefficiency, if not of maladministration, and made many suggestions for improvements. This has had the effect of stimulating rather than of depressing the recruiting. Recruiting cannot he expected to succeed when evils of the kind complained of are known to exist. As to the bread, that was shown here last night, let me say that, even although the contract provides that it must be paid for by gross weight, it is usual to stipulate that the loaves supplied shall be of a standard weight. It must be remembered that in the camps the bread is distributed by loaf, so many loaves being given to so many men. When a loaf is 8 or 10 ozs. short, the men to whom it is given get short rations.",34
224,Mr RILEY,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,But the men do not complain of the insufficiency of the food.,34
225,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"No . I think that there is enough food; indeed, there is a great waste of food. This waste has been going on throughout the Commonwealth for weeks and months, without any attempt being made to adjust the deliveries to the requirements of the camps.",34
226,Mr RILEY,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"You will find waste in private homes. Supply Bill [29 OCTOBER, 1915.]",34
227,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"That is no justification for wholesale waste in Public Service. I do not know any Government in Australia whose administration is more wasteful and inefficient than that of the Commonwealth Government. Mr Anderson, an expert business man, appointed by a Labour Government to investigate the administration of the partments, has supplied reports that should startle honourable members. I do not think that the House can do other than insist on a very distinct improvement being effected in the administration of our Departments generally. Eor example, the question of supplies for the Defence Department should have been handled by a competent independent Supply and Tender Board. In fact, it is appalling that we have not yet created such a Board to deal with all purchases of the various necessaries for the services of the Commonwealth. I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that the Commonwealth has suffered losses to the tune of tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of pounds a year that would not have occurred if we had had a properly efficient independent Supply and Tender Board to control purchases. As a matter of fact, as the expenditure in the Defence Department is now reaching a sum aggregating Â£50,000,000 a year, possibly millions could have been saved in this partment alone. Year after year I have pleaded with the Government for the establishment of such a Board. I have had on the business-paper a notice of motion which I have never had the opportunity of reaching, but Mr Fisher has frequently promised to create a Supply and Tender Board.",35
228,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,The Liberal Government had a chance to do it. Why did not they do it?,35
229,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"They passed a Bill through this House for the purpose, but the Senate threw it out. Mr .'THOMAS - We offered to see through both Houses if the Liberal vernment would put it into a separate Bill.",35
230,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"That was a subterfuge. Honourable members offered to do it as they offered to do a numher in of other things. While they rejected provision for a Supply and Tender Board, they also took care to see that Parliamentary Committees provided for [256] (No. 3) 1915-16. 7Q53 in Bills introduced by the Liberal Govern the ment were rendered ineffective for many months. We must put an end to all extravagance and the shocking expenditure and waste that is proceeding. If we do not do so, we shall not be able to continue our public works or pay the enormous liabilities that are heing created by the De- war, and which are likely to increase so long as the war lasts. Mr Anderson has also dealt with other Departments, particularly in regard to stores, though he has not confined himself to stores; and now that we have three new Ministers, I ask the Government to see that no time is lost in this matter. About a week before the House adjourned on the last occasion I asked Mr Fisher if he would agree to submit the question of the appointment of a Supply and Tender Board to the Committee of Public Accounts, and allow that Committee to make inquiries as to the methods adopted by existing State Boards. The late Prime Minister said that the suggestion was a good one, and that he would give favourable consideration to it, but I am not aware that any step has been taken to do so. I ask the Government whether anything has been done in the direction of creating a Supply and Tender Board?",35
231,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"I understand that the Defence Department has created a Board De- of that character, while, in regard to all the Departments, I understand that a conference is now heing held, but I cannot say how far the matter has proceeded. I do not know. If I had the information I would give it to the honourable member.",35
232,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"I ask the Minister to urge the Prime Minister and his colleagues to give this matter the very earliest attention. I shall be very much disappointed if the present Government do not bring down the necessary legislation. It would not he a debatable matter. I believe that it is the opinion of both sides of the House that such a it Board should he created, and I hope that Go the very short Bill which would be necessary will be submitted before Parliament adjourns on this occasion. Over and over again we have had indisputable evidence as to shocking extravagance and waste our public works due to inefficiency and very largely to inexperience and irrethe sponsibility. Yet there is no attempt to remedy this condition of affairs. Yestertwo day the report of the Committee of Public Accounts upon Cockatoo Island was laid upon the table, and I wish to know whether the Government are satisfied w the conditions obtaining at the dockyard, and with the amount of work that is recriticism, turned for the money spent. were submitted to us by Mr K in g some time ago, and were published in press. They disclosed a similar state affairs. However, Ministers do not seem to be concerned. They seem to be just as indifferent to public expenditure public waste at the present time as they have always heen. When are the taxpayers to receive consideration? I appeal to the honourable member for South Sydney, who is Chairman of the Committee of Public Works.",35
233,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,He is a very saying is correct. good man.,36
234,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"He is a good man if he would only let his heart and his head direct his actions, and refuse to be controlled by others. I ask honourable members generally whether they are satisfied to allow conditions to continue as they have been at Cockatoo Island, for what applies to that dockyard applies to nearly all the public works of the Commonwealth. "" Government stroke"" to continue giving this country 10s. to 15s. worth of work for the expenditure of every sovereign? The practice almost throughout the world in regard to shipbuilding is to adopt the piece-work system, which, I understand, the men at Cockatoo Island desire. This would probably increase individual wages by 50 per cent. In some cases wages, good as they already are, would be nearly doubled; but the Government would get an infinitely better deal. There are many other matters that I intended to discuss this afternoon, but I have been promised by the new members of the Ministry that they shall be put right in a very short time. I accept that promise in absolute good faith . I would much rather see things put right by a Minister than have to make complaints in Parliament; but sometimes it is hopeless to expect an improvement, and then it becomes necessary to speak. The new blood in the Cabinet seems to promise well; and I am taking their word for it that improvements will be effected. If they are not, I will return to this subject on a future occasion.  [3.47] - To my mind, the honourable ber who has just resumed his seat has never criticised this Government fairly. i th He has always attempted to introduce a great variety of scarecrows into his and he has done today just whafc Statements he has done on every occasion he has Salter spoken during the time. I have been a the member of the House. He has referred of to the extravagance of the Government, yet he has never been able to deny that the party in power has always lived within and its income. That is more than the party with which the honourable member is associated ever did.",36
235,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"Does that disprove extravagance?  orable gentleman knows that what I am The first Fisher Government-the one elected prio? to 1910 - too k office when there was a deficit, and left a surplus. When the Liberal party was defeated in 1910-whe n I had the honour of entering this Chamber for the first time, and an opportunity of knowing something of what was going on-it again left a deficit. The Fisher Government was in office for three years, and when they left in 1913, after paying their way, they left a surplus of Â£2,000,000. The Is the Liberal Government, in the twelve months preceding the historic double dissolution, spent half that surplus and all its revenue; and yet the honourable member will have the country believe that his party is the party of perfection in matters of financial administration. His party has never managed to live within its income. I merely mention these facts in answer to the statements that are so frequently made by the honourable member, who is never fair enough to admit that, when the Labour party was in power in normal times, it was always able to pay its way. The honourable member haa also stated that the Labour party was responsible for the defeat of the proposal to establish a Supply and Tender Board made by his party. Mr RICHAR D FOSTER - Hear , hear! It was thrown out by the Senate.  to place on record the facts regarding this Bill , and to show that the statement made by the honourable member is similar to that made by other honourable members of his party, that the Labour party was responsible for the defeat of the Bureau of The proposal regardmeming the Tender Board was introduced along with another matter. The Labour party, then in Opposition, announced that if the Government would bring forward the two matters in separate Bills, they would be prepared to vote for them. The Liberal Government were not prepared to do that, and therefore they must accept the responsibility for what subsequently occurred. I hope that, in future, the honourable member's criticism will be a little fairer than it has been on this occasion, and that he will not indulge in quite so many scarecrows as he has done hitherto. May I say just a word or two with regard to the criticisms by honourable members on both sides of the House against the Government in regard to the subject of defence. I suppose I have as much business to transact with the Defence Department as any other honourable member, particularly any other country member, and I desire to say, in regard to the officers in charge of the Defence Department, particularly the officer in charge of the Base Records branch- Mr Brady - that any matter that I have brought forward for rectification has been promptly dealt with by them. If lionorable members who have complaints to make, instead of writing to the Ministerwho is already up to his eyes in the work of dealing with the great national problem before us-woul d only go to the responsible officer of the Department particularly concerned, and personally interview the officer on the subject of his complaint, he would find the matter speedily rectified. That, at all events, has been my experience. It is no use coming here to criticise, as honourable members have done. The greatest compliment that can be paid to those engaged in the carrying on of this war is in the paltriness of the complaints that have been launched against the Administration by honourable members on both sides of the House.",36
236,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"We will take that opinion from the honourable member on the one side, and we will take Mr Justice Rich's opinion on the other.  going to stand up here and say that there are not just grounds for complaint in certain directions.

The honourable member will never be guilty of our record- a record of surrendering office and place and pay.  referring to the occasion when the right honourable member was handing over the reins of government. The peculiarity of all this is that it took place while the war was on-at a time when, we are told, all party strife should cease. As reported in Hansard, page 165, the right honourable member said, on 14th. October, 1914We tried to do the best we could in difficult circumstancesHe admitted that the circumstances were difficultand I , for one, am very glad to be out of it all. I had enough of it. I shall be much happier on this side than I was when we were making an heroic struggle to keep our heads above water while fighting the "" bashi bazouks "" who were arrayed against it. The right honourable gentleman admitted that the struggle was a Titanic one, although he remained in office for only a month after the outbreak of war. and his Government were making preparations to equip only 20,000 men. What was that task, as compared with the task of raising and equipping a Force of 160,000 men?",37

250,Sir WILLIAM IBVINE,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"Is the honormemable member the author of that pam The honourable member has made various opstatements in this House regarding our powers, and. they are capable of half-a-dozen interpretations. I propose to make a quotation from one of speeches on the subject, and shall then ask him whether, in view of it, he can complain of the interpretation given in the official pamphlet to his views. In this House, on 4th June last, as reported in Hansard, page 3735, the honourable I am not going to attempt to define the conpowers of a Government such as member to inours in time of war. adHo now says that our referendum proare unnecessary, because, so long as the war continues, we have all the powers rewe need. In June last, however, he declared that he would not attempt to define our constitutional powers. Later on, in the course of the same speech, he It is hard to say, in the complex industrial and commercial conditions now prevailing, where warlike operations terminate. I am not prepared to say that, under the existing conditions in Australia, any power would in the Federal Government to go about them. foodstuffs generally and distributing What could be plainer than that? In light of this statement, could any other interpretation be placed on the honourable gentleman's opinion than that given in the pamphlet?  does not member say at Wangaratta ?  of some people who were not even .allowed I to speak there. I shall read the last of these statements made by the honourable inmember for Flinders, and shall ask him if it is unfair to say that it is hard to understand what are his views regarding at all our present powers. Sir WILLIAM IRVINE - It depends, to to some extent, upon who is trying to under so; but I venture to say that even the honourable gentleman himself does not understand these statements. A Philadelphia lawyer, much less a Victorian barrister, could not understand them. He saidIf the object is simply to say, "" Things are dearer now than usual, whether through combinations or conspiracies, or arrangements of the kind, therefore let us buy the stuff, and sell it to the people more cheaply,"" I hardly think that would or could reasonably, in the present conditions of Australia, be regarded as a legitimate exercise of the constitutional power. In view of these statements by the honourable member, as reported in Hansard, I think that every word published in the official pamphlet as an interpretation of the opinions held by the honourable member for Elinders is justifiable, and that these utterances on his part will need far more explanation than he has been capable of making. The honourable member for Dalley made a statement today to which some objection was raised by the honourable member for Richmond. The honourable member for Dalley said that he was doubtful whether, if there had to be conscription of men, there ought not to be also conscription of wealth, so that those in possession of wealth might make a sacrifice somewhat in proportion to that made by our young men who risk their lives at the front . Mr .GREENE - That is not what honourable member said.",38
251,Mr FENTON,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,It is a fair interpretation.,39
252,Mr MASSYGREENE,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"It is not a fair interpretation; he was not talking of conscription, but about voluntary service.  not split straws with the honourable member, who, in reply to the honourable member for Dalley, said that the men of wealth were not doing their, fair share. That has often been said, though I do not say now one way or the other. I propose now to quote from a speech made by Mr Livingston, the Minister of Education of Victoria, who is a member of the same political party as honourable members opposite; and, strange to say, it is a speech that was delivered in the Wangaratta district. Mr Livingston saidMany of the wealthiest men in Victoria, it was well known, were not giving a fair pro- portion to the war funds. Measures were, therefore, being taken to insure that those who could pay should be made to pay - He was afraid that many who were willing to part witli the last man would baulk at the last shilling'. The Labour party was bringing in a wealth tax, and he would be glad to support such a measure to the utmost of his power. It is very gratifying to have the opinions of honourable members opposite and their political friends, especially when any exception is taken to a hint that, perhaps, men of wealth are not doing all they should.",39
253,Mr MASSYGREENE,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"I admit that some are not; but the great majority are.  pretend to say whether they are or not; perhaps, in the present case, comparisons are odious.",39
254,Dr CARTY SALMON,TREATMENT OF SICK AND WOUNDED,"Then why make them 1  merely speaking in answer to some interjections from honourable members opposite, with the object of showing that it is not only on this side that such opinions are held. I now wish to say a word or two about the proposed increase in the telephone rates. Last night the honourable member for Maribyrnong said that the telephone service showed a profit in all the States; but I wish now to point out that that is not so. According to the fourth annual report of the Postmaster General-the last one issued-ther e was a loss of Â£171,000 in New South Wales, the Â£60,000 in Victoria, Â£21,000 in Queensland, Â£3,000 in South Australia, Â£28,000 in Western Australia, and Â£9.800 in Tasmania; or a total of Â£296,000 odd throughout the Commonwealth. Y e t, in the face of this fact, we are told that the rates should not be increased. Last night the honourable member for Maranoa urged that the charges for the use of the public telephone should be raised; and, apparently, he would allow our big commercial firms, some of which have as many as twenty telephone connexions, to escape with the charge of ^ d . a call; while, he would force the poor man, - who cannot a-fford to have a telephone in his home, to pay 2d. or 3d. for the use of public telephones. I hope that the Postmaster-General will think twice before he is induced to abandon the proposal to increase the telephone rates, which I think would prove an excellent way of making up the shortage in the Post Office. When the Postmaster-General is considering this matter, he might also take into account the miserable conditions under which some of the allowance offices are conducted in the country districts, and devote a portion of the profits from the increased telephone rates to relieving the unfortunate people concerned. There are also the mail contractors to be considered; but I wish particularly to speak of those in charge of allowance offices, whose conditions are, I consider, shameful in any country. It is all very well to say that there is not much work to be done in these offices, but the men and women in charge have to be there all the day, for , very often, the miserable return of 10s. a week. The fair thing should be done by those .people, who have to face all the drudgery in our country districts. There are several other matters with which time does not permit me to deal; but I hope that the Leader of the Opposition has looked up the statement. I referred to in Hansard, and realizes that I have not done him an injustice. Progress reported. ADJOURNMENT. CONDUCT OF BUSINESS - TBADE NAMES : NA - MR .

271,Mr SPEAKER,LICENCE FOB MANUFACTUR E OF ASPIRIN,The honourable member may do so; but he must confine himself to a personal explanation.,41
272,Mr OZANNE,LICENCE FOB MANUFACTUR E OF ASPIRIN,"I desire to state that I the Minister for the Navy read a letter purporting to have come from me in connection with a charge I made yesterday, and it had no bearing on the subject. I do not believe in asking any man to do something which I am not prepared to do myself. Having had some military experience, I thought it my duty to offer my services to the Minister of Defence. I did so; but that was a matter quite distinct from the charges I made in connection with Private Ryan. Yet that letter was brought into the Minister's reply, and a reference was made to a letter wherein I stated that I offered my assistance in the re-organization of a particular branch of the Department of Defence. So far as the telegram which has been referred to is concerned, I did not receive it ; nor have I , up to this time, received any reply to my inquiries.",41
273,Mr RODGERS,LICENCE FOB MANUFACTUR E OF ASPIRIN,"Wannon) [4.27] - I should like to learn from the Prime M i nister whether he has gone sufficiently far with his negotiations with the representatives of the States to be able to make any announcement as to the freight available for the transport of wheat, and the flat rate determined upon. The reason I press the question is that' already, in the far-northern districts, wheat is being taken off. There are practically no buyers at the present time. Millers and other buyers are standing off. There is a very limited amount of storage space in the country and at the ports, and there is a rush for it . Men are in some difficulty to know just whab they ought to do. If the Prime Minister is in a position to give the House any information on the subject, I shall be glad if he will do so; and, if not, that he will tell us when he thinks he will be in a position to make a definite statement.",41
274,Mr HUGHES,LICENCE FOB MANUFACTUR E OF ASPIRIN,"West Sydney-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [4.29] W it h regard to the question raised by the honourable member for Grampians, I want to say that it is a very curious thing that, as soon as I grant a licence* to two Australian chemists to make aspirin, I am overwhelmed with suggestions that I should take away the name of "" aspirin "" and substitute for it "" acetyl-salicylic,"" ostensibly to rob the Germans of the credit of the name, although it must also deprive these licensees of the benefit of their enterprise and ability. A f t e r many months of war, during which' the community has been using aspirin, an Australian firm is manufacturing pure aspirin, which conforms to the test. I noticed a statement in the newspapers to the effect that it is not included in the Pharmacopoeia, but that acetyl-salicylic is in cluded. The article; which is being manufactured by this Australian firm conforms to the required standard.",41
275,Dr CARTY SALMON,LICENCE FOB MANUFACTUR E OF ASPIRIN,I wish the honourable gentleman would get expert evidence on that point.,42
276,Mr HUGHES,LICENCE FOB MANUFACTUR E OF ASPIRIN,"I have further to say that today I received a request, as earnest as that made by the honourable member for Grampians, to allow the chemists to sell German aspirin, because it would be unfair that they should be left with it on' their hands. It is difficult to please every one.",42
277,Dr MALONEY,LICENCE FOB MANUFACTUR E OF ASPIRIN,Mak e them put the formula on the packages.,42
278,Mr HUGHES,LICENCE FOB MANUFACTUR E OF ASPIRIN,"What I propose to do is to allow the term "" aspirin "" to stand until the question whether. German names in general should be wiped out is settled. Personally, I think it is desirable. the meantime, I invite the chemists and the public of the country to stock Australian aspirin, and buy Australian aspirin. I have just a word to say to the honourable member for Wannon. I deprecate statements made from time to time that the farmer haa been, or is being, prejudiced by the freight arrangements. Eor the,first time in the history of Australia, his interests are being safeguarded. It is not a fact that) in normal seasons, shippers begin to buy at this time. There is no wheat for sale, though they can buy forward.",42
279,Mr RODGERS,LICENCE FOB MANUFACTUR E OF ASPIRIN,That is too thin.,42
280,Mr HUGHES,LICENCE FOB MANUFACTUR E OF ASPIRIN,"The Conference from which I have just come is now considering this question. As the members are direct representatives of the States, are responsible to them for their acts, and have their interests at heart, I must assume that they are the persons to whom the farmers will look in this matter. At any rate, the Conference is considering the question in all its aspects in regard to the handling, financing, and transporting of the harvest. All these questions are so inter-related that they cannot and ought not to be considered alone. I had some hope that the Conference would be able to conclude its labours this evening. I am afraid now that it will not; but, in any case, it will do so on Monday. A report from the Conference will be issued, aud the honourable member for Wannon will then be in possession of all the information that can be made public in regard to the matter. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned st 4.33 p.m. In",42
