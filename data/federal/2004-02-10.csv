3,The SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"I thank the House. As many members will fondly remember Jane Gerick, who served in this House with us, and in order to facilitate an opportunity for people to pay tribute to her memory, I thought it would be appropriate if I were to present a copy of the announcement to the House to enable the House to take note of the paper.",19
4,Mr ABBOTT,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,I move: That the House take note of the paper.,19
5,Mr LATHAM,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES," Mr Speaker, I just want to thank you and the government for facilitating an opportunity in the Main Committee whereby Jane Gerick's many friends and colleagues in this parliament can pay tribute to her. Her passing was a very sad thing, and we welcome the opportunity in the Main Committee to pass on our condolences and give comfort to Jane's mum and the rest of her family. I want to thank the parliament for providing that opportunity in the second chamber.",19
6,Mr HOWARD,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES," Mr Speaker, I think that is appropriate. Jane Gerick was a very nice person and we liked her, and it is a very sad thing. While I am talking about personal matters, can I say on behalf of everybody how much we welcome the return of the member for Hume, who suffered a very traumatic accident a few months ago. With his typical courage he is back in there punching. Good on you, Alby. Debate (on motion by Mr Latham) adjourned. DIVISIONS: TELLERS",20

9,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to his answer in the House on 3 December, when he said that he supported the reading of books to infant children. Will the Prime Minister now join with me in supporting Labor's policy for Read Aloud Australia, our BookStart program, new services to improve adult literacy and the establishment of Read Aloud ambassadors? Given that this is one of the greatest gifts we can give our children, will the Prime Minister now implement Read Aloud Australia in the national interest?",23
10,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do recall that question. I do not think there is a lot of distance between the opinions of the Leader of the Opposition and mine on the importance of reading to our children. As I reminded him when he asked the first question, I certainly regard it as very important as a father. It is something I did and something I enjoyed immensely. When I have heard the Leader of the Opposition I have been reminded of one book that was quite a favourite of one of my children. The book was called ‘ Mr FlipFlop'. Every time. I read it, Tim would say, ‘More, Dad, more.' I am glad that the Leader of the Opposition has asked this question, because on Sunday the Minister for Family and Community Services launched the $20.2 million Growing up in Australia study in Melbourne, which she described as ‘the most important research ever undertaken into Australian children'. She indicated at that launch that preliminary research that had been carried out showed that 96 per cent of four-year-olds are read to by a family member at least once a week-preliminary findings of a new major study have found that-although the incidence of being read to every night fell to 59 per cent. The government has already been well and truly in the field in relation to a lot of early childhood programs. In fact, four years ago, in company with the then Minister for Family and Community Services, I launched the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy, which included, amongst other things, early childhood and the needs of families with young children. I think part of being a good parent is reading. I have always believed that. I practised it, and I applaud the fact that the Leader of the Opposition does as well. Trade: Free Trade Agreement",23
11,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Would the Prime Minister advise the House of the outcome of the negotiations for an AustraliaUnited States free trade agreement? Mr Melham interjecting,23
12,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When the member for Banks has decided that normal courtesies ought to be extended in the chamber, I will recognise the Prime Minister.",23
13,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. As I think most members of the House would be aware, the free trade discussions were concluded in Washington on Sunday Australian time. Can I take this opportunity in his presence of both welcoming back and congratulating the Minister for Trade, the Deputy Leader of The Nationals. He has done an outstanding job for Australia. This agreement is good for Australia. This agreement will advantage our manufacturing industry, it will advantage our services industries, it will advantage our mining industry, it will advantage our fishing industry, it will advantage our horticultural industry, it will advantage our dairy industry, it will advantage our beef industry and it will advantage our sheep meat industry. The list goes on. Of course, there are some sectors that were not included, but it would never have made sense, as is apparently being argued by some opposite, that because you did not get every sector, you should deny all of the sectors that have been advantaged by the agreement. As far as the government are concerned, we are totally committed to this agreement because it is good for Australia. It is a oncein-a-generation opportunity to link the Australian economy with the greatest economy the world has ever seen. The importance of that American economy to Australia will grow rather than diminish. This is an agreement about Australia's future; it is not an agreement about Australia's past. I am amazed at the negative attitude of the Australian Labor Party. I contrast that with the posirort tive response of the recently re-elected Labor Premier of Queensland. Not having to play any politics the day after his election, he honestly said that, although he was disappointed about the sugar growers, he has backed the deal. Do you know why? It was because it is good for Australia. If it is good enough for the Queensland Premier to back it because it is good for Australia, why isn't it good enough for federal Labor to back it because it is good for Australia? Parliamentary Superannuation Scheme",23
14,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister concerned by the high level of public distrust and cynicism about modern politics? If so, does he support Labor's policy to close down the parliamentary superannuation scheme for new entrants and place a cap on the superannuation entitlements of senior office-bearers in government?",24
15,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to the first part of the question is yes. The answer to the second part of the question is that I will analyse the policy. I would add that, if the Leader of the Opposition is concerned about that cynicism, there is something he can do tonight. He does not have to wait for the Remuneration Tribunal and he does not have to wait for an election; he can instruct the Federal Secretary of the Australian Labor Party to renegotiate the Centenary House lease. He can do that, because you know what that is doing: ripping off the Australian public to the tune of $36 million over the next 15 years. All of that money is flowing right into the election coffers of the Australian Labor Party. Just like that-tonight. The Leader of the Opposition does not have to wait for the Remuneration Tribunal. This could be the smack of firm opposition. Tonight he could ring up Tim Gartrell and he could say, ‘Mate, renegotiate that lease; it's a and it's a fraud on the Australian public.' Over to you. Trade: Free Trade Agreement",24
16,Mr HAWKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Trade. Further to the Prime Minister's earlier answer I ask the minister: would he inform the House how his great efforts with the just-negotiated free trade agreement with the United States will secure and create jobs for Australian workers?,24
17,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Wannon for his question. At the outset I join with the Prime Minister in recognising that this is a historic deal for Australia. It is a landmark in improving Australia's trade relationship with the largest and most dynamic economy in the world. It is almost one-third of global GDP that we are going to be engaging much more deeply with right across the full base of the Australian economy. It is important to note how important this is for Australian jobs. I have been saying for a couple of years now that trade is very important for Australian jobs. One in five jobs across Australia relies on exports out of Australia; one in four jobs in regional Australia relies on exports. We have just concluded the negotiations for this deal and we have to go through the process now. To respond to the member for Corio, who a little while ago said that this was done and negotiated from a position on our knees, I can tell the member for Corio that it was not. It was done on our toes and punching it out in Washington for two weeks. That is what I can tell the member for Corio. The Australian Labor Party ought to be ashamed of themselves for coming in here and making political points out of an opportunity that has come along once in a generation for the Australian people. It is an opporcanned tunity that will see clear access for $5.8 lion worth of Australia's manufactured goods into the United States. It is an opportunity increase the over $60 billion worth of investment flows that travel between our countries. It is an opportunity now for Australian companies to compete in the government procurement market in the United States, with Australia as a designated country$200 billion worth of contracts every year that Australian companies can compete for. It gives a further opportunity now for our services industries, which are already worth $5 billion in that market, to have a stronger sition and know that any future reservations will not affect them and that they will receive national treatment in that market. There have been a lot of comments made and printed about the negotiated outcome regarding beef and dairy. As far as beef is concerned, over the transitional period a $3 billion benefit to the Australian beef industry will accumulate. Tariffs are eliminated to zero on entry into force on day one, then there will be $2.6 billion worth of product right through that period and then it will move off into a free trade area. The dairy industry we know-and the member for Corio would know this only too well in his area-has been struggling lately with the lack of water and with climatic conditions following deregulation and the like. This was an opportunity to secure $1.6 billion worth of access for our dairy products into one of the most highly valued markets in the world, and we were not going to lose that opportunity. The negotiation of the removal of the 25 per cent tariff on light commercial vehicles in the United States gives Australia's worldclass automotive industries a fantastic opportunity to export into the largest automotive market in the world. We have also negotiated the removal of the 35 per cent tariff on tuna into this market that was probilhibitive. If you saw the article in today's Australian newspaper, you would have seen to that almost 70 workers are going to get new jobs in Port Lincoln as a result of that aspect of it alone. The list goes on and on, yet the Labor Party maintain they are going to oppose this. The Labor Party between 2001 and 2003 said they were opposed to this FTA, but as we moved closer to the US leadership dialogue last year they decided they might support it. So they all trotted off to the US leadership dialogue in Melbourne and said, ‘Oh, yes, we're supporters of the United States.' po- Kevin Rudd was there and all the roosters were there. Mr Kelvin Thomson- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order.",24
18,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am very happy to recognise the member for Wills but I will attempt to address what I imagine will be his point of order. The minister will be aware of his obligation to refer to members by their electorate. Mr Kelvin Thomson-The question asked the minister to explain ‘how his great efforts will secure and create jobs for Australian workers'. I assume it was not asked in irony. I ask you to bring him back to the question, Mr Speaker.",25
19,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Wills will be aware that the answer was relevant to the question. I call the minister.,26
20,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I should have said that the member for Griffith and a number of other front-line ALP members were at the leadership dialogue last year. Of course, there will be another one in June this year. I just hope that between now and then the Australian Labor Party will digest the benefits that have been negotiated in this free trade agreement with the United States and change their attitude and support this on behalf of the Australian people and people that are looking for new economic opportunities well into the future-not just for the current generation but for many generations into the future. Already there has been a whole litany of support for and endorsements of the free trade agreement, and I will table them: they are from the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Industry Group, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, minerals councils, Medicines Australia, the Winemakers Federation of Australia, the Australian services roundtables, the automotive industries, the agricultural industries, United Dairy Farmers, the Australian Dairy Industry Council, the Australian Seafood Industry Council and Horticulture Australia. We heard about the comments of Premier Beattie, but there is another labour government that is also supporting it: the New Zealand Labour government has written us a letter saying, ‘Congratulations on achieving this outcome.' Trade: Free Trade Agreement",26
21,Dr EMERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. I refer the Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of The Nationals to his statement on 24 January, where he said: I cannot see how Australia can agree to a free trade agreement that did not include a fair and reasonable approach to sugar. He said that it would be ‘un-Australian' to accept any free trade deal without sugar being included. Why has the Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of The Nationals been un-Australian in accepting a deal without sugar?",26
22,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question, and I state at the outset that I am very concerned about the difficulties that confront the Australian sugar industry and the communities that depend upon that industry. It needs to be noted that we often heard in this place, until those opposite became the new found friends of the sugar industry, that it was all the sugar industry's own fault. But this is an industry that is vastly more sinned against than sinning, in the sense that nobody else has to operate in an environment that is more corrupt in the trading arrangements that confront it than the Australian sugar industry. Ninety-three per cent of the world's sugar is traded above the world price. The second point I want to make is that right till the very end the Minister for Trade, who deserves absolute respect for the job he has done, fought for a deal on sugar. The government held out-we did everything we could-but it was not to be. But let me make a very plain point, which our sugar industry leaders have themselves had the courage to acknowledge: we have cost them nothing. To walk away from this and to cut off opportunities for other Australians would be to make an absolutely spurious and pointless gesture. What would have been un-Australian would have been to have walked away, as a government, from the sugar industry and that is what we have said we are not going to do. We are going to engage with them. We are going to work carefully with the sugar industry representatives, including their political representatives in this place and the industry's leadership, to find a way forward for this troubled industry, which is the victim of corrupt global trading practices. We have done the Australian thing; we have said that we will stand by them in their hour of need. But the clear gains for rural and regional Australia out of this agreement are such that it ought to be enthusiastically endorsed, notwithstanding the disappointment on sugar. Trade: Free Trade Agreement",26
23,Mr CAUSLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Would the minister please augment his previous answer and inform the House of the benefits which will flow to regional and rural Australia from the historic signing of the free trade agreement between Australia and the United States?,27
24,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The Minister for Trade and the Prime Minister have already overviewed the very real advantages that will flow to the Australian economy over coming years and will, I suggest, be of particular benefit to the next generation of Australians. That is very relevant, as the Leader of the Opposition wants to paint himself as being about the future for our children. When it comes to regional Australia, the benefits, when you look at them, are often more substantial than they first appear to be. Take beef, for example. The fact is that after a bit of time-perhaps a little longer than our beef producers might have liked-we will go into full and open trade. We will get what we are after. It is a very strong result. The figures speak for themselves. And, while the Labor Party might think that manufacturing exists only in the great cities, it is also a very prominent industry in the regions. In fact, our largest manufacturing sector-and this is very often overlooked-is food processing. Most of it is located in regional Australia. The removal of tariffs in the processed food and horticultural sectors will make a real difference in the regions. There are also our metals and minerals exporters, all of them regionally based. They will of course be more competitive. When you look at the detail-and this will be of great interest to the member for Page, who asked the question-there are some unexpected and very welcome benefits that arise out of this agreement. Take the PermoDrive company, a very innovative company based in Ballina in the member for Page's own area. Some members will be familiar with this company's development of a very sophisticated hydraulic drive system for medium to heavy vehicles and the company's efforts to market it in the United States, where truck manufacturers and the US military have seen its enormous application. They have told us today that this solves a problem for them. They do not need a subsidiary company in the US; they can now operate directly out of here. The advantages to that company operating in a region are very substantial indeed. Another example is Ruddweigh, in the great little northern New South Wales town of Guyra. They make sophisticated and high technology weighing equipment for the cattle and grains industry They have been trying to develop a market in the US for the past two years, and they are emphatically enthusiastic about this deal. It gives them a real kick-off and means more jobs for people in the town of Guyra. Given the ALP's willingness to stand in the way of this clearly better deal for rural and regional Australia, a question has to be asked. I saw a headline this morning that said we must be the envy of countries right round the world. In that context, the citizens of those countries around the world, looking at the opportunity before us, must find themselves more than a little puzzled as to how the opposition and the alternative leader of this nation, who paints himself as being concerned about a better future for our children, can possibly not immediately and enthusiastically join with the government in signing up and committing to a deal which is clearly in the interests of future Australians. Trade: Free Trade Agreement Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR (2.28 p.m.)My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and follows the statement by the Deputy Prime Minister in a previous answer that sugar has lost nothing in the FTA. Is the minister aware that the summary of the FTA on the official web site of the US Trade Representative contains the statement: In response to US. concerns about Australia's agricultural state trading enterprises, Australia committed to working with the US. in the ongoing WTO negotiations on agriculture to develop export competition disciplines that eliminate strictions on the right of entities to export. Doesn't this mean that the minister has agreed to working with the Americans in the WTO to dismantle our single desks for sugar, rice, wheat and barley? Mrs Bronwyn Bishop- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member on the opposite side is engaging in debate. That question is full of debate; it is not a straightforward question. I would ask you to ask him to rephrase it so that debate is not entered into.",27
25,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Corio's question is not an unusual one. I invite him to conclude it. Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR-I will conclude, Mr Speaker. Can the minister guarantee that the government will not deliver a double blow to Australia's sugar producers by not only leaving them out of the FTA but also putting their single desk on the WTO negotiating table?",28
26,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question from the honourable member is really quite extraordinary, coming from a member Labor Party, because Labor state governments are systematically dismantling single desks around the country. Prior to elections, they make all sorts of promises about their commitment to single desks and they then start to dismantle them. Ask the grain growers of Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria how Labor behaves towards single desks. By contrast, this government has a commitment to the single desk for wheat, rice, sugar and other commodities where it is delivering significant benefits to our nation. The trade minister has negotiated with the United States significant access for Australian products without compromising our position in relation to single desks. That is quite clear; you do not have to take my word for it. The greatest critics of the Australian re- wheat single desk have been the US Wheat Associates. In their press statement following the announcement of this agreement they expressed serious disappointment. The US Wheat Associates said that the deal had failed to bring down the export monopoly enjoyed by AWB. US Wheat Associates chairman Alan Lee said that the US had missed its chance to tackle the AWB. So it is not just the Australian government which asserts that we are standing by the Australian industry, the US wheat growers agree with us. Mr Gavan O'Connor-I seek leave to table a document from the office of the United States Trade Representative-Trade Facts. Leave granted. Trade: Free Trade Agreement",28
27,Mr SCHULTZ,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer inform the House of the effects of the Australia-United States free trade agreement on the Australian economy and how will it secure Australia's economic prosperity? of the,28
28,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I begin by welcoming back the member for Hume and saying how wonderful it is to see him back in this parliament. I am sure that is echoed by both sides of the House. The Australian nation is around 20 million people; the US nation is around 300 million. US consumption in Australian dollars is around $10 trillion. What that means is that for a country of our size to get access to a market of that size will lead to enormous economic benefits. There are countries around the world that are seeking free trade arrangements with the United States, but to date very few developed economies have managed to secure them. In a world which is increasingly moving to a global scale, to get access to a market of that dimension gives this economy a strategic edge. A leadership which did not take the opportunity to get that kind of access would be a leadership which let down its public and let down its people. That is why it is important, in the long-term benefits for the Australian nation, that we bring ourselves into line with enhanced access to the world's largest economy-not just the world's largest economy but one of the fastest growing of the developed economies of the world. The US has been growing on average at 3.3 per cent over the last decade, much more than Europe and much more than Japan. In fact, there are few developed economies which have grown as fast as the US over the last decade and one of them is Australia. One of the secrets in Australia is that we have been liberalising our trade relations and going out to the world. The Labor Party at various times has said that it is in favour of liberalised trade and at various times, when it plays the populist card, has said that it is against it, as it did at the ALP national conference. You cannot have it both ways. Either liberalising trade arrangements and coming into a globalised market is a good thing or it is a bad thing. You either take credit for supporting it or you play the populist card for opposing it; but you cannot walk both sides of the street. This is where the Australian Labor Party leader will be found out, because, having played the populist card, he now no longer has any credibility-if he ever did-on economic policy. In relation to foreign investment, Australia has protected sensitive areas, it has protected its national interest test, but it has liberalised the overall prospects for US foreign investment in Australia. We have liberalised it in relation to new investments and we have liberalised it outside sensitive sectors for existing areas up to a limit of $800 million, where we will not apply a screening test. On the other hand, Australia has access for investment in the United States. It is not commonly known that at the end of 2002 US foreign direct investment in Australia was $57.6 billion and Australian foreign direct investment in the US was $73.7 billion. So Australia is a larger foreign investor in the United States than the United States is an investor in Australia. Australia is a net capital exporter in terms of investment into the US market. To have the opportunity of liberalised investment flows going both ways will give the Australian economy the benefits in terms of development and jobs which will set us up for the decades which lie ahead. This is important structural reform. Those who believe in Australia's long-term economic benefits will be supporting it and those who want to play cheap populism will be opposing it. The choice is for the Australian Labor Party. Trade: Free Trade Agreement",29
29,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Now that the government has agreed to the exclusion of major agricultural products such as sugar from the trade deal with the United States, how can it argue that any global trade deal must include the comprehensive opening of markets to Australia's agricultural exporters? Hasn't the government undermined Australia's credibility in multilateral trade negotiations, our trade credentials, by signing a bilateral agreement with limited agricultural access to American markets?",29
30,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The factual basis of the question is wrong, completely wrong. We have not agreed to the exclusion of major agricultural areas. The truth is that from the agreement's entry into force 66 per cent of agriculture goes to free trade and another nine per cent after a limited period. There are major up-front advantages for dairy. Over a longer period of time there are significant advantages for beef. The proposition that is being advanced by the Leader of the Opposition-the suggestion that because we have signed this deal with the United States we cannot continue to negotiate to certain goals on a multilateral level-is wrong also. I have always taken the view that you get what advantage you can for your country, be it bilateral or multilateral. You do not invest your faith in one track only. That has been the flaw of what I might call the original approach that was advocated by the member for Rankin: that we shut ourselves out of a bilateral discussion in the hope that years in the future we might get what? A decent trade deal out of the European Union or a major relaxation in relation to other areas where our produce is locked out. My view is that you get what you can for Australia, whether it is a bilateral ment or a multilateral agreement. That is what we have done. We have seized the opportunity to get some advantages for Australia in this free trade agreement that simply are not available immediately or in the foreseeable future through the WTO. All the indications are that the Europeans, rather than weakening their attitude, are hardening their attitude. There is no evidence in front of the government that the hard line free being taken by the Europeans in relation to agriculture-a line that they have maintained for decades-or the attitude being taken in relation to other areas where there are high subsidies is likely to change. As was said in one of the papers this morning, other countries would be drooling with envy at the opportunity that Australia has been afforded. We have been given an opportunity of access to the largest economy in the world. We have not got access for every sector; we have not got everything we wanted. But we have given nothing away. We have gained immensely. It will greatly enrich Australia years into the future. Yet astonishingly the Labor Party is against it. I cannot understand how, in the national interest, the Labor Party can oppose a deal that is going to generate jobs in manufacturing, jobs in export industries and jobs in service industries. Mr Costello interjecting",30
31,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am reminded by the Treasurer that the modern Australian economy sees us as a greater net direct investor in the United States than the other way around. The economic relationship of Australia and vain the United States in the future will very much be found in the manufacturing and service industries. That is why this agreement should not have been passed up. That is why the Australian Labor Party is being recreant to the national interest in playing popuagree- list politics on the issue. Trade: Free Trade Agreement,30
32,Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,2.41 p.m.)My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister inform the House of the strategic significance of the government's approach to free trade agreements? Is the minister aware of any alternative views?,30
33,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"First, I will say-as the Prime Minister has said in answer to a previous question-that this government, when it comes to international trade strategy, tries get the best that the international community offers to Australia. We work hard in the Doha Round and we are making a major contribution to the Doha Round. Indeed, the Minister for Trade will be in Costa Rica at the end of February to chair a Cairns Group meeting as part of our ongoing efforts to try to get the Doha Round under way. We have no doubt that if the Doha Round is successful that will be obviously very beneficial to Australia. There is no debate about that. But we also take the view that it is important we make every post a winner. With free trade agreements we are able to open up markets for Australian businesses that otherwise would not open up. We have been able to negotiate a free trade agreement with the United States to build on our strong security, economic and political ties with that country and to do that without detracting at all from our deepening ties with Asia. The agreement we have negotiated with the United States was preceded by two free trade agreements. It was preceded by free trade agreements with two ASEAN economies: one with Singapore, which has now entered into force, and the other with Thailand. This was Thailand's first free trade agreement with a developed economy. As well as the benefits to Australia's economy, these free trade agreements strengthen our political and security relationship with all the countries we enter into such agreements with. They also help to build up the peopleto-people links. Members will be interested to know that these free trade agreements are being supported by two framework agreements with the two biggest economic powers in East Asia, China and Japan. One thing does interest me-and I think it would interest the House more generallyand that is I understand that the Labor Party to has not only come out saying that it would oppose the free trade agreement with the United States but also said that a special Senate committee should be set up to investigate this agreement, presumably for the Labor Party members on that committee to do their best to tear it apart. This interestingly enough stands in stark contrast to the way the Labor Party reacted to the other free trade agreements. Apparently, in the cases of the free trade agreement with Thailand and the free trade agreement with Singapore, there was no need to say that the Labor Party would oppose those free trade agreements. The Labor Party was happy with those agreements. The Labor Party did not see it as necessary to establish a separate Senate committee to examine those two agreements. Why is it that the Labor Party thinks free trade agreements with our Asian neighbours are okay but it is opposed to a free trade agreement with the United States? I think the answer to that lies at the very heart of the Labor Party. It lies there with its opposition to a very logical defensive mechanism called missile defence. It lies in its opposition to President Bush's policies. It lies in the Labor Party's antipathy towards the United States. A free trade agreement with Thailand and with Singapore is all right; a free trade agreement with the United States is to be rejected. I think that says it all about the Laof bor Party. Its anti-Americanism stands for all to see. Trade: Free Trade Agreement",31
34,Dr EMERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Trade. Does the minister recall his recent assurances that ‘We're not going to leave sugar out' and ‘We've said that sugar must be part of the deal and we're not conceding that'? Why has the minister betrayed Australian sugar farmers?,31
35,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The first point to make is that we have not betrayed Australian sugar farmers.  Mr Laurie Ferguson interjecting,32
36,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not recall giving the call to either the member for Sturt or the member for Reid. If they want to have a conversation, they can have it outside of the chamber. ",32
37,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Sturt!,32
38,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The first point that I make is that we have not abandoned the Australian sugar industry. An opposition member-Of course you have.,32
39,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We have not. The comments that I have made during the entire negotiation have been quite accurate in terms of our ambitions and the energy that our negotiating team and I and other members of the government, through the Prime Minister, have expended in terms of our advocacy in getting a deal done on sugar. But obviously the member for Rankin does not have any idea about international negotiations. For me to have stated in public here and telegraphed to the negotiators on the other side our attitudes would be just ridiculous. We took this issue right to the end of these negotiations, and that should be made very clear-right to the very end. Dr Emerson interjecting",32
40,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If I were to treat the member for Rankin in an even-handed way, I would have also to warn him. The member for Sturt was in trouble simply because, his attention having been drawn to the standing orders, he continued to interject. Precisely the same conduct has been exhibited by the member for Rankin. The member for Rankin is warned!",32
41,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It goes without saying that this has been a very difficult and complex negotiation with a range of issues that we have had to confront in terms of our pursuits as far as our ambitions were concerned and also our defensive interests as far as Australia was concerned. We believe that we have come out of this very well, given the circumstances. It was one of the most difficult decisions to make with regard to sugar. I might just make the point, going to the earlier question, that I do not know of another free trade agreement where a particular aspect of it has not been excluded-and it is legal under the GATT; under article 24 it is legal. In NAFTA, between the United States and Canada, the entire dairy industry is carved out. But it is important to understand that we advocated this case right to the end. We were presented with a decision to take in terms of the balance that was available, given what the Australian public wanted us to secure in terms of our defensive position with regard to the PBS scheme, the audiovisual aspect and the state trading enterprises. We took that decision based on the national interest. We believe that we have taken a decision that will benefit our nation greatly both today and well into the future.",32
42,Dr EMERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In light of the minister's answer and the Prime Minister's previous answer that we have given up nothing, I seek leave to table a detailed 12-page report from the US trade representative on all of the things that we have conceded in this deal.",32

45,Mrs ELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Would the minister advise the House of the benefits to Australian farmers from the United States-Australia free trade agreement?",33
46,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Forde for her question. Certainly Australian farmers stand to gain enormous benefits from this improved access to one of the most important consumer markets in the world. Whilst some of these benefits will be phased in over a period, there are immediate benefits to Australian farmers. There will be improved access and tariff reductions for hundreds of Australian primary products like beef, butter, cheeses, milk powders, wine, seafood, lamb, avocados, peanuts, oranges and timber-and the list goes on. Around two-thirds of all our agricultural exports will be tariff free into the United States from year one. There will be considerable access benefits also for a number of industries. The honourable member is very close to the dairy industry. We will be able to take dairy products into the US for which we have never had access before-like ranges of cheeses, butter, milk, cream and ice-cream products. It will be worth around $55 million in the first year and then go up each year from then. Even beef will benefit. I read that the shadow minister said that there will be nothing in this deal for beef until the next generation, although in another place he said it was two or three years away. In reality there will be $22 million worth of benefits for the beef industry in year one as the in-tariff quota is abolished. That will rise to around $80 million in year two or three and will continue to rise in the years ahead. Indeed, as we move towards the free trading situation, we will eventually have free skies, subject to safeguard provisions, for one of Australia's biggest export industries. There are enormous benefits to thousands of Australian farmers across the nation. The shadow minister admitted as much this morning. He said that there were significant benefits to Australian farmers-and no-one should deny that. I trust that when the Labor Party are looking at their approach to this agreement they will remember that no-one should deny, in the words of the shadow minister, the tremendous benefits that there will be to Australian farmers. It is important that this deal is given swift approval so that there is a capacity for Australian farmers to quickly reap the benefits of these negotiations. Trade: Free Trade Agreement Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR (2.53 p.m.)My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Is the minister aware of the reaction of some Australian farmers and their representatives to the FTA deal with the United States? Is the minister aware that the National Farmers Federation said that it was ‘disappointed' and described some aspects of the deal as ‘hypocritical'? Is the minister aware that the Cattle Council has said that it is ‘disappointed with the final outcome' and that the cane growers organisation reaction has been one of ‘amazement and disappointment'? How can you stand by and let the interests of Australian farmers be negotiated away, as you have with sugar growers in this country?",33
47,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Before I recognise the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, I just remind the member for Corio that the use of the term ‘you' in the latter part of his question is, of course, inappropriate.",33
48,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Again, the inconsistencies of the opposition amaze me. The last important trade agreement to be signed worldwide in relation to agriculture was the Uruguay agreement. The reason why Australian farmers are in such trouble on issues like sugar and dairy in world trade is that Labor did a lousy deal on behalf of farmers when they were last entrusted with the task. Our trade minister has had to try to fix up the mess Labor made ages ago. The shadow minister sought to quote very selectively from certain farm industry organisations in relation to their comments on the free trade agreement. The National Farmers Federation-indeed, many farm industry organisations-went into these discussions with the ambition that at the end of it there should be totally free trade in all products. That still remains this government's objective, but you need to get there in stages and this is a very significant advance. The National Farmers Federation have made it abundantly clear that there are hundreds of millions of dollars worth of benefits to Australian farmers in what I think was a balanced assessment of this agreement. Other farm industry organisations, such as the beef producers, also acknowledge that there would be immediate and substantial benefits to the industry. They would have liked more, but let us never forget that there has been only one year ever when the beef industry has actually supplied our existing quota to the US. There were three years when we have gone close and in only one of those have we actually exceeded the quota. So I am confident-particularly with the BSE problems in the US and the demand for our product in Japan-that this quota will be adequate for our industry's needs in the short to medium term. Also, it was obvious that the member for Corio did not choose to quote the statements of the dairy industry, who have warmly welcomed this agreement as being good for the dairy industry. The seafood industry have warmly welcomed the benefits to the seafood industry; the forest industries, the horticultural sector-all have put out statements congratulating the Minister for Trade and complimenting this government on its achievements in that regard. I repeat what I said earlier: we would like to have achieved that more, but there are real and very genuine benefits to the Australian farm community from this agreement and it is time that the opposition gave us the opportunity to deliver those benefits to farmers. Trade: Free Trade Agreement",34
49,Mr MCARTHUR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources. Would the minister outline to the House the benefits to Australia's manufacturing sector from the conclusion of the free trade agreement with the United States?",34
50,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. He is a very staunch advocate of manufacturing here in Australia. The free trade agreement will provide a great opportunity to increase exports into the US and secure a solid future for Australian manufacturers. That means one thing: more jobs. Under the deal, virtually all US tariffs on manufactured exports to the US will be abolished. These exports are currently worth in the vicinity of $5½ billion to $6 billion. The free trade agreement gives our manufacturers access to the world's largest economy. Motor vehicle manufacturers will be one of the first to grab that opportunity. This country's motor vehicle exports have tripled since 1996, and this year more than 20,000 motor vehicles will be exported to the US. This free trade agreement will again give us further opportunity in that regard, particularly in the area of light commercial vehicles, where the tariff into the US will be reduced from 25 per cent to zero. Sixty per cent of the vehicles sold in the US are light commercials, and there is no better example of a light commercial than the traditional Australian ute. It is there that we have our greatest opportunity. It is little surprise then that have seen such a warm response from organisations like the FCAI, the FAPM and, of course, manufacturers like Holden. Mr Speaker, we saw last week that the Leader of the Opposition was happy to sit in the back of a ute. Mind you, you and I both know that is not only illegal and dangerous but a poor example to young children. It is about time he got out of the back of the ute and helped motor vehicles to be manufactured here and exported to the US. Trade: Free Trade Agreement Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR (2.59 p.m.)My question, again, is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, and it concerns the so-called free trade agreement with the United States. Can the minister confirm that quarantine arrangements form part of the agreement? Minister, how will the FTA impact on the application from the US to export uncooked pigmeat to this country, which is specifically referred to in the US document entitled Trade Facts? Why has the minister agreed to set up a separate process that will include a trade representative from the US to consider this application, and will the minister guarantee that the full details any quarantine arrangements will be made publicly available prior to the parliament being asked to vote on the FTA?",34
51,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Corio for his question. Importantly, the government have made absolutely no compromises whatsoever in relation to our quarantine and biosecurity issues in this free trade agreement. We are firmly committed to our nation's clean and green image, and the United States did not expect of us, nor did we volunteer, any compromise in that regard. We have agreed to set up a consultative process in relation to SPS issues; we have a similar arrangement with China, Thailand and a whole range of other countries as we well. In fact, we have had such a consultative process going on now for some months. So there is nothing unusual about that; it helps to smooth trade in both directions. In relation to the import risk assessment on uncooked pigmeat coming into Australia, that was released for public comment months ago. The public comment period has closed and the final result can be expected to be announced very soon. Trade: Free Trade Agreement",35
52,Dr SOUTHCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Trade. Would the minister advise the House what the process is now for bringing the United States free trade agreement into force? Would the minister also advise the House what opportunities there will be for parliamentary and public input into this process?,35
53,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question and, of course, he takes a great deal of interest in these matters as the chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, JSCOT. The Australia-US free trade agreement will come into effect when both countries have completed of their domestic approval processes and have amended, or passed, any necessary legislation. The text of the agreement is currently being ‘legally scrubbed', as it is called, and with the agreement of both sides will become public at the end of that process, which should be next month. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has advised the chair of JSCOT that he will refer the text of the FTA to JSCOT. JSCOT will provide a direct avenue for the public and the parliament to make their views known on the FTA. All members of the community, including the states and territories, will have an opportunity to make submissions to JSCOT. In accordance with past JSCOT practice, it is likely there will be public hearings in the states and territories. The government will then submit to the Executive Council a proposal for authorisation to sign the draft treaty. Once Executive Council approval has been granted, the government will sign the agreement. The two governments can agree upon a suitable date for its entry into force once their domestic processes are completed, which will possibly be 1 January 2005. This process of openness and transparency contrasts very greatly with the process that used to exist under the previous Labor government. National Security",35
54,Mr MCCLELLAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Attorney-General. I ask the Attorney-General: is it the case that, having failed to respond to an earlier inquiry relating to terrorist suspect Willie Brigitte, ASIO received a second warning from the French services on Friday, 3 October 2003? I ask the Attorney: why, on 4 November, did he inform this House that the warning was received after the long weekend, saying: The subsequent advice that we received on 7 October changed all that. Brigitte was located and taken into immigration detention within two days. I ask the Attorney: isn't it a fact that his claim was wrong and that he has misled the parliament and the Australian people about the fact that a vital area of our security clocked off for a long weekend?  order. That question offends the standing orders in two ways: firstly, it contains an epithet about the behaviour of the Attorney General; and, secondly, it makes suggestions of misleading the House, which should be pursued through other means under the standing orders.",36
55,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am aware that there are other forms of the House that would be available to the member for Barton if he wished to use them, but that does not mean that it is improper for him to raise this matter in question time. It did contain an epithet with reference to the Attorney-General. I accept that that is not desirable but, when I first listened to the member for Barton's comment, the remark that I thought was directed to the Attorney-General was in fact directed to officers of his department. If there was another reference, I will take it up with the member for Sturt later. The Attorney General has the call.",36
56,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I have in no way misled the parliament in relation to this matter.",36
57,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,36
58,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Attorney General has the call.,36
59,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thought I had heard something about new standards for today! Mr Speaker, let me just say that the member for Barton has been fully briefed on these matters on a number of occasions and has had access to the Director-General of Security. If the honourable member wanted to compare the answers I gave with the answers the Director-General of Security gave to the Senate on 3 November, in answer to questions by Senator Ludwig, he would find that they were almost a mirror image. Quite clearly, as I set out in my press statement on 26 October, Australia was initially advised on 22 September. That has not been obscured in any way, shape or form whatsoever. As the Director-General of Security said when he spoke to the Senate: The French subsequently provided advice, which we received on 7 October, which not only stressed urgency but provided other information and expressed concern that he might be in lia for terrorism related purposes. If you compare the answers that I gave, you will find that they were in exactly the same form; but I will take the House through the process in relation to this, because the first communication from the French authorities was passed to ASIO's liaison officer in Paris on Monday, 22 September 2003. The communication was dated 19 September. There was no suggestion of urgency associated with that at all. The communication did advise that Brigitte had left France on a oneway ticket to Australia on 14 May; that he had participated in training and a selection course in France with an Islamist group; and that he had twice been to the PakistanAfghanistan zone, where he reportedly participated in military training. The French authorities merely asked ASIO to confirm that Brigitte was in Australia. As the Director-General of Security has stated publicly, this communication was considered to be of a relatively routine nature. The fact that Brigitte was reportedly receiving military training in the PakistanAfghanistan zone did not indicate urgency, and the agency advises meMr Crean-What about you?",36
60,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me just say: the agency advises me that it understood that some thousands of people have trained in Afghanistan and Pakistan. These people range from individuals who have had active involvement with terrorists and terrorist groups to people who have been assessed as no longer having such links and not being of continuing security concern. The second communication was sent on the afternoon of Friday, 3 OctoberMr Crean-And received.",37
61,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It was sent on Friday 3 October and would have been received in ASIO's communications centre at 10.47 p.m. AustraThe message was marked ‘priority' by French authorities, in a precedence table of ‘routine', ‘priority', ‘immediate' and ‘flash'. I am advised that it is common operational practice for agencies like ASIO and its overseas counterparts to make direct contact with the agency to which they are sending material which is considered urgent and important. So I think it is quite clear that, when we received and assessed the material on 7 October, the matter was promptly dealt with in the most effective way. I am very disappointed at the way in which these security issues have been dealt with by the opposition. As I said before, the opposition has had access to briefings from the Director-General of Security. I am advised by the director that precisely the same comprehensive and detailed briefing that was provided to the opposition was provided to me and other ministers. There has been no cover-up in relation to this matter, but I do note that members of the opposition have sought to peddle every half-baked claim that has been reported about Brigitte in this matter. In the context of briefings in which they are aware of what we know, for the honourable member for Barton to come into the parliament and claim that Brigitte was known to French authorities at the time of the 1998 World Cup, and that he was on the French terrorist alert base at the time of his travel to Australia in May last year-which was in a question asked by the honourable member for Griffith-demonstrates the way in which the opposition is misusing its briefings in relation to security matters and is peddling material that is untrue and which it knows to be untrue. The fact is: in relation to these matters you have had access to briefings, and if you wanted to check those matters at any time you have been able to do so. Trade: Free Trade Agreement",37
62,Mr WAKELIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Small Business and Tourism. Would the minister advise the House of the benefits to small business the United States-Australia free trade agreement? Are there any alternative policies?,37
63,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Grey for his question. I know he would appreciate the benefits of the free trade agreeWerriwa ment. He is a tuna fisherman in Port Lincoln, which is the tuna capital of Australia and is on the threshold of becoming the tuna capital of the world. There is no doubt about that. With the abolition of a 35 per cent tariff on canned tuna, the opportunities are endless for the tuna industry in Australia to access the enormous American market. Australia's 1.1 million small businesses would be very pleased with the free trade agreement with the United States, because it provides opportunities that Australian small business have never had to access the world's biggest market. When the news came through on Monday that the Minister for Trade had signed a I thought to myself, ‘This is a no-brainer the Labor Party to support: it's good for small business, it's good for rural and regional Australia, and it brings new money into the Australian economy.' So I went to my little file-Aladdin's cave that it is-and thought that the member for Werriwa would back us, but I found a quote from the old member for Werriwa, who said, ‘Tariffs and other forms of protection are the economic equivalents of racism.'",38
64,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Who would have said that?,38
65,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The old member for Werriwa said that-the Leader of the Opposition, who once was the old member for Werriwa. I would have thought that the current Leader of the Opposition-who ‘once was Werriwa'-would have said that it is good for small business to have unrestricted access to the annual $200 billion US government purchasing program. I would have thought that the member for Werriwa would of have said, ‘It's good for small business people to have the chance to use their Australian training and their educational qualifications unrestricted in the United States. And I would have thought that the member for would have said that it is good for small business people, particularly those in the services industry, which represents 70 per cent of the Australian economy, to have free and open access to the US market. If we need any evidence of the benefits to small business, I saw it when I went straight to one of the Telstra small business winners, a South Australian company, Techno-Plas. They manufacture plastics. They said that 18 months ago they looked at the US market and it looked too hard, they just could not go in there. They have advised me that they are going to go back to the US market after the announcement of the free trade agreement. It is not just one business; it is many busideal, nesses. The Australian Chamber of Comfor merce and Industry said that the FTA is ‘a high-quality agreement which benefits the whole Australian economy, including the manufacturing, services, agricultural, mining and investment sectors'. If the member for Werriwa did not want to listen to them, he could have listened to the Northern Territory Chamber of Commerce, which said that the free trade agreement could put the Northern Territory on the American business map. We believe in going forward. We believe in the forward interests of the Australian people. We believe in putting money on the table for Australian small business by providing them with business opportunities in the world's biggest markets. We are about the future. The Labor Party is about the past. We might have a new member for Werriwa but he has old Labor ideas.",38

82,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Werriwa proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Government's failure to implement an early childhood development strategy, including reading programs for our infant children. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",40
83,Mr LATHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This is the debate the government want to have. They have not got a policy on early childhood development but they want to have a debate. In fact, something quite unusual in Australian politics has happened. Normally the opposition challenges the government to a debate, but the Leader of The Nationals is getting well ahead of himself. He is not waiting until he goes into opposition to challenge me to a debate; he is doing it from government. He issued a statement last Thursday, entitled ‘Anderson challenges Latham on reading contest'. The challenge said: If Mark Latham wants to talk about children, then we should have a full-blooded clear my schedule for him ... I cleared my schedule. I am turning up in the House of Representatives in the MPI to have the debate. So there was no need to clear the schedule. The need for the government is to actually produce a policy. Do not worry about clearing the schedule. Come into the parliament and produce a policy. This is a government that has been in power for eight years, and it has produced nothing in terms of early childhood development-not a policy on child care, not a policy on teachers in the child-care and preschool system, not a policy on reading and not a policy on parenting programs. In question time, the best the Prime Minister could do was to pull out a very slim document from four years ago that he said represented the sum total of the government's contribution to early childhood development in this country. In fact, the government has cut that strategy that he pulled out-the stronger families strategy-by $16½ million over the past two years, and the Prime Minister is so impressed by early childhood development that he will not even commit to the ongoing funding of the strategy that he tried to triumph with in question time today. So the Prime Minister has no policy for early childhood development. He has no strategy for improving the reading capacity of parents to make reading more available in the homes of the nation. What we have got from this government is not a policy; we have got eight years of failure. In the Labor Party we are proud of the fact that at our recent national conference we produced the policy Read Aloud Australia. It is a policy that should be adopted by the government. If the government is looking for good ideas and a good, solid commitment to early childhood development, as I suggested in question time, it should adopt our Read Aloud Austradebate about it. I'll lia strategy. The international research is compelling. Learning starts on the first day of life. Seventy-five per cent of a child's brain develops in the first five years of life. Half of all the developmental, including intellectual, potential of a child is established by age four. Because children develop skills in learning at an early age, we need to focus on quality education and care in the early years. Learning does not start on the first day of school; it starts on the first day of life. That is why Labor is committed to our read aloud strategy. It includes three books for the parents of newborn children through our BookStart program-a book at birth, a book available when the parents join the local library, and a book available when they finish a parenting course or adult literacy program. The essential lesson is that you cannot start too soon. I was asked by a journalist on Sunday: ‘Why are you providing these books without means testing? Why is this a universal BookStart program?' The message for parents, whether they are rich, poor or middle income, is that we all need to start reading to infant children from the very first day to make the children aware of the stimulation of reading, to make them aware over time of the stimulation of the picture books, to get them used to the whole concept and benefits of reading and to be stimulated at that early age. As their little minds develop, they need the stimulation that comes from reading, basically from the first day, the first week, the first month. I say to parents who might think that there is time to wait and that this is the sort of thing that can be delayed to age three or four: it is true that in those early months you will feel a bit dorky holding the child and trying to get them used to the book, and there will be times when the child will grab the book and try and eat it, chew it or tear it, but persevere, because it is worthwhile. It is absolutely worthwhile to get infant children used to the idea of reading books, and over time they will respond to that early stimulation by and effort of parents. The second component of our read aloud strategy is an adult literacy network. There will be outreach workers in the regions of the nation working with the schools, the childcare centres, the preschools, the playgroups, the community groups, Centrelink and Job Network. Basically, anywhere in our community where parents can be identified as in need of adult literacy courses we will have the capacity to say to them, ‘Come and do a course at an adult and community education provider.' Or there might be a volunteer or a retired schoolteacher available to come into the home to help with the adult literacy skills. All parents want the very best for their children, but not all parents have the capacity, the confidence or the reading skills themselves to engage in reading aloud for their children at an early age. We want to make them capable. We want to give people the capacity. Adult literacy is one of the forgotten parts of our education system in Australia. Adult literacy is an essential component of our read aloud strategy. Of course, in his press release last Thursday the leader of The Nationals, the Deputy Prime Minister, belittled this idea of parenting tuition-of adult literacy courses. He made the observation: ... it's good citizens that make good governments, not nanny-state governments that make good citizens ... He is trying to belittle the idea that in modern Australian society we need to provide governmental programs and assistance to parents. It is further evidence of how this government lives in the past. It does not govern for the future. It lives in the past. Describing these initiatives as ‘nanny state' to try and belittle them is plain wrong. We need to face the reality in modern Australian society that not everyone is part of a nuclear family and not everyone has the networks of extended family support. I am one of the lucky ones. I know that. I live next door to my sister. My mum is down the road. We have extended family support as we balance work and family. But not all Australian families have that benefit-that support network-around them. So I urge the Deputy Prime Minister to look beyond his own circumstances and understand that in a mobile society many people move away from those networks of extended family support and that many families are broken up, sadly and, in some cases, tragically. The reality is that it is something the government needs to respond to. We should not leave any parent in our society isolated from the goodwill of a caring community. We should not leave any parent isolated from the benefits of the support provided by government and community organisations. It might be support as simple as a conversation, where a single parent has someone who has been through the same experience to talk to about the challenges of managing, to share experiences with and to get a bit of feedback from. It can be a support network as simple as a conversation. It could make a huge difference to parents who feel isolated in undertaking the increasingly complex and challenging task of modern parenting. But beyond that simple conversation there are other things that governments can do. That is why the Labor Party is committed to nursing home visits in the postnatal period-to provide parents with the support, instruction, guidance and companionship that is needed in the early days and months of a child's life. That is why the Labor Party is committed to adult literacy courses and parenting programs-to assist parents who would otherwise feel isolated and inadequate in the way in which they could face up to the challenges of modern parenting. This patronising view from the Deputy Prime Minister-to try and belittle parenting support as ‘nanny state'-is totally inappropriate. I ask him to look beyond his own circumstances and understand the Australian society and community in which we now live. Any person understanding it would have good in their heart and would reach out to those parents and use the resources of government and community to provide them with the support they need. It is not ‘nanny state'; it is common sense. It is common sense for a compassionate government that is in touch with the needs of the Australian community. We are committed to those things in the Labor Party-proudly so. So too are we committed to our Read Aloud ambassadors. At our national conference I was proud to announce that Australia's outstanding children's author, Mem Fox, will be our first Read Aloud ambassador. This is the demonstration effect-community leaders, authors, sportspeople and political leaders demonstrating to the rest of the nation the value of reading aloud to infant children. Politics is more than legislation. Politics is more than passing programs. It is actually the leadership of the demonstration effect. I have got to say to the Deputy Prime Minister that when he issued his read-off challenge I was very disappointed. I said, ‘The best thing we can do is have the parliamentary debate. Let's go down to a school somewhere in Canberra or Queanbeyan on a Friday morning and demonstrate as national political leaders the value of reading aloud to the rest of the nation.' It would have been a fine demonstration of national leadership. The response from the Deputy Prime Minister was hopelessly inadequate. We need to do all these things to put in place Read Aloud Australia. We also need to work with the states to develop comprehensive neonatal screening for hearing and sight. If children cannot hear and their sight is inadequate, they cannot read, so we have got to work with the states and territories to get that right. We have also got to include literacy progress in the yellow and the blue books in various states. Book reading and literacy progress should be tracked and monitored and proudly recorded by parents-as much as all the health and developmental issues are. On other early childhood development strategies the government are also hopelessly inadequate. They have no child-care plan, they have no plan for access and quality in our child-care system, and we have big, competing pressures. The government have cut the number of centre based long day care places in Australia by 500 over the last four or five years. We have a shortfall of 20,000 places for outside school hours care in this country. And what is the response of the government to this issue? The Treasurer made one of his social capital interventions recently. He said, ‘The big issue in child care is the fact that there might be some rising wage pressures in the sector.' He seemed to say that, by his standards, he was happy with the situation where child-care workers in this country-the custodians, the guardians of the next generation of Australians-should be paidMr Anderson interjecting",40
84,Mr LATHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is their parents and the child-care workers. If you understand the nature of work and family, a parent like me puts a child in the child-care centre wanting good custodians and guardians for that child for the time that he is in the child-care centre. If you do not have the luxury of a nanny at home, if you do not have the necessary resources and you rely on your neighbourhood child-care centre, of course they are the custodians and guardians of your children, and you hope and pray that nothing goes wrong. You want the very best people involved in those child-care centres. And that is why the Treasurer is wrong. That is why the Treasurer is wrong to say that we should pay our child-care workers no more than $13 an hour in this country. The Treasurer is wrong in saying that our child-care workers should receive no more than garbos and other workers of that kind. Those workers do important jobs in our society-that is truebut I say that there is no more important job in our society than being a custodian of the next generation of Australians. So how about we have a government policy of building up the status and rewards for child-care workers? How about a government policy recognising that we want more than just child minding and that we want child development? How about a government policy that ensures that the very best educational and developmental programs are available in our child-care system? How about a government policy that does not consign us to a secondor third-class child-care system? How about a government that invests in this vital early childhood facility service? The competing pressures are there. The government has driven down the availability of places and the government is talking down the status of our child-care workers. It is true that there is no magic pudding; we need to invest more in child care. We need to invest more in child care to give to child-care workers the rewards and status that they deserve and to ensure the quality of that child care. We need to invest more in child care to overcome the backlog and deficiency caused by this government in affordability and access, and we need to invest more in our children full stop. That is the bottom line. Children may be 20 per cent of our population, but I say to the Deputy Prime Minister: they are 100 per cent of our future and it is about time your government started to invest in them. Stop talking about clearing your diary and all this nonsense. After eight years in government, instead of living in the past and instead of demonstrating patronising attitudes about a ‘nanny state', how about delivering a policy that matters to the next generation of Australians? How about a government strategy of making better use of our prosperity as a nation? It is true that Australia has generated enormous wealth and prosperity over the last 20 years. I think both sides of the parliament can take credit for the emergence of a prosperous Australian economy. We on this side are certainly proud of our role in building the modern Australian economy. But it was never prosperity for prosperity's sake; it was about prosperity with a purpose. Labor always wanted prosperity that was put to good use in this country, and when I look at a system where we have a deficiency in child-care provision and where we have child-care workers paid just $13 an hour I say that our prosperity is not being used as well as it could be. How about using our prosperity for and the great national purpose of investing in the next generation of Australians? This is the start of lifelong learning. We can never have a learning society and we can never have lifelong learning in this country until we invest fully in early childhood development. The Prime Minister summarised his attitude towards our children when he sat on the sideline, a negative, whingeing, carping commentator, taking pot shots at government schools. We now have the Deputy Prime Minister effectively taking pot shots at childcare workers by diminishing their role. We have a Treasurer who takes pot shots at child-care workers by failing to build up their status and role in our society. How about backing the workers and the people dedicated to the next generation of Australians; and, most importantly, how about investing in their future?",43
85,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I welcome this debate. It was kicked off by the Leader of the Opposition, who said that he wanted the lead-up to the next election to be a read-off, and he challenged other political leaders to participate in that. I responded by saying that I would be only too happy to broaden the debate, to have a whole wide-ranging debate about the future of the children in this nation. I do indeed-I think rightly and appropriately-claim that I do not know that I can take to the idea of being patronised on this subject. I have been a father for 16 years. I have done my best to be a consistent, caring father. I think I am actually on the public record as having talked about these issues during my entire time in public life. These are very important debates and I have a very strong belief that there is no more important issue for the future of the nation than its children. The question needs to be asked: what is the nation? The nation is, in fact, the sum total of the individual Australians who make it up. To the extent that our people are emotionally and personally secure and able to be contributors to our society, our society is the stronger. To the extent that the people that make up our nation are not able to contribute, we are the weaker. In this context, I want to set out a very clear starting point. The Leader of the Opposition referred to it, but it is a very important point: good societies and good governments result from a strong citizenry. Nanny-state governments do not make great parentsthey just do not. We need to be very clear about this important principle: it is the duty of the citizen to contribute to and watch over good government and to play their part in a participatory democracy. It is not the role of government to try and make good citizens. I do not believe in social engineering. I do not believe that we ought to have governments dictating what sorts of books children read, because the minute we do that we say what sorts of standards and qualities we should instil in our children. I tell you what, I reckon the Australian parents who are listening to this debate would agree very strongly with what I am saying. I think they would welcome this debate and say that it was a good thing. They would say, ‘We overwhelmingly see ourselves as the custodians and guardians of our children.' That is not to denigrate child-care workers at all, in any way, shape or form, but I am the principal custodian and guardian of my children. My wife and I have chief responsibility for them. I reckon that overwhelmingly Australian parents would agree with precisely that sentiment. I will tell you what else I think they would say. They would think this debate was good and they would appreciate and look for leadership and example from our national leaders. In that sense, I say to the Leader of the Opposition: I am glad you have opened this up. You have said a few things that are very challenging to the progressives and that from my side of politics I would not have got away with saying. I am glad you have said them. But let us get all of this out in the open, because I think that what Australian parents would say on this one is: ‘Yes, we want your leadership. We want governments to support us and facilitate us in the very great responsibilities and difficulties of raising children, whether it is through good economic policies, job opportunities and the cash at home to do exciting and interesting things and to give our kids opportunities, or whether it is what we spend in our schools.' But I will tell you what they draw the line at. I am as sure as hell that they would say it is not the role of government to tell them how to parent or to assume parenting responsibilities. Australian parents would rightly at that point say to us, ‘Butt out.' I think we need to recognise that. However, in the spirit of kicking along, I say to the Leader of the Opposition that I think this is a very valuable and needed national debate because too many of our children are falling through the protective rungs in our society-they are; I see it. If I may say so, I do not appreciate language that suggests that I am dismissive and patronising, because I am not, and I think the record shows it. But when I go out to the Walgetts and the Bourkes in this world and when I see what is happening to a lot of our Indigenous kids, I think it is a tragedy. It is enough to make a grown man weep. When I see the stories of youth homelessness, when I see our youth suicide rates and when I look at Professor Stanley's work, I say that we have no choice but to recognise that we are failing too many of our children in this country. But to then make the leap to say that government can fulfil a parenting role is to ignore reality. Down through the ages, all the intervention programs we have trialled in Western society and in non-Western society have clearly indicated that there is no substitute for a child's natural parents doing their best by that child. That is why I say in this national debate that what we have to do is highlight the importance of what sort of environment a child grows up in at home. There are three broad areas that are critically important to a child's emotional development. The Leader of the Opposition is an enthusiastic dad. I am glad about that. He rightly points to the fact that from day one our children start learning. But there is a more critical element to an understanding of a child's early development than that. It is this: from day one their emotional framework, if you like, starts to be laid down, and it is a secure emotional framework which becomes the springboard for learning, education and physical development, occupational development and all those sorts of things. In that sense, I say that there is no substitute at all for three broad things that we need to try and provide as parents and as a society for our children. The first is as functional and loving a home environment as possible. I am a parent, and the first thing I will say is that I know that I am not a complete success as a parent. I do not always get it right. I do not always meet my children's needs. The Leader of the Opposition talks a lot about his own home environment, and I get catcalls from the opposite side that always imply somehow or other that I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth. I have had great privileges and great opportunities. I do not deny that for a moment; it gives me a great responsibility to try and give back to society. But I actually experienced a few difficulties as well. My father had to try and do his best to give me a loving and secure home environment when he lost his wife at an age that did not even give me the opportunity to remember who she was. He did his best. None of us can reach the ideal, but that is no excuse for walking away from the ideal. We need to clearly establish the ideal, just as we need to in relation to a healthy diet or keeping ourselves fit, and all of us should strive towards it and encourage and support others in striving towards it, because that is of critical importance to children. I note again, to come back to this point, that I am glad that the Leader of the Opposition has raised the admittedly sensitive issue-but it comes from his side and he can get away with it-that male role models are important for our boys, because we now have it on the table and it is important. The progressives do not like you saying that, old chap. One of your current frontbenchers once attacked me vehemently for making that comment. He actually said to me on an aeroplane on the way down to Melbourne-he has had a bit of ‘road to Damascus' conversion since-that I was silly to prattle on about the importance of fathers because in most children's lives they were just a hindrance. That is reality. We will not go into that in detail. Male role models are important. They are important in a whole range of ways. Boys in particular learn how to treat women with respect-as human beings and decently and lovingly-from a male role model, preferably their father, who treats their mother with respect, courtesy and decency. That is more than common sense; it has been reinforced by analysis, study and research down through the ages and we cannot run away from it. I think we are indebted to the Leader of the Opposition for challenging the progressives on this one. It is very interesting, really, because after a while I think they will say, ‘Whoa, hang on; we're getting into conservative territory here.' I say that is a great thing; let us have an honest and open debate about it. Let us be sensitive enough to admit-I am the first to say it-that few of us reach the ideal and that tragically many are in a situation where they are not able to offer their children the ideal. But that is no excuse for moving away from the ideal and not striving to make it as real as possible, and I say that with as much sensitivity as I can manage for those who are not able to offer their children all that they would like in that regard. The second thing I mentioned was peer group environments. I think peer group environments are very important for our children. I say this for a number of reasons. It was once said to me by an expert who has done a lot of work with kids that peer group environments are terribly important, especially during those teenage years. The Leader of the Opposition will get to this point in a few years time-it is always interesting when you have teenagers. Often you will lose contact with them and they will go through a bit of a period when they want to flex their own muscles and so forth, and then their peer group environment becomes terribly important. This is something we all need to be conscious of. Just as we need to worry about the peer group environment our kids are involving themselves in, we need to worry about whether they are going down to the pub on a Saturday night, boozing their lives away and possibly worse, or dragging themselves out of bed at midday on Saturday and not playing any sport. Are we getting them to bed at a reasonable hour and are they off to play a team sport on a Saturday morning? There are big issues about whom your kids are mixing with. There is another dimension to it that I and my wife, who is a schoolteacher, have come to the conclusion is very important and it is this: do we teach our children to show proper respect for their schoolteachers and for the institutions of society, including their schools and so forth, so that our children are decent for other children to mix with and are not dragged down by them? That is a very important part, I think, of this debate about the future of our children. Thirdly, I come to a very important element that I think is often overlooked. It is called ‘hope'. We knock the hope out of our kids. Ms Macklin-What are you going to do about it?",45
86,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Listen for a moment and you might learn something. Here we are, one of the most prosperous, free, realistic and open societies. We have a very prosperous society, yet many of our young people plainly lack hope. The Leader of the Opposition talked about cynicism in relation to politics and political institutions today. But we feed everyone on a diet of it-we really do. We say that the politicians are no good. We say that parliaments are no good. We say that churches are no good. We say that the schools are no good. We say that you cannot trust the police. We knock the doctors. We knock everything. We knock all the institutions that provide the framework for a civilised living. If you doubt that, ask the next group of schoolkids to come through here how many of them have been told by their mums and dads and neighbours that politicians are all hopeless. This is a universal condemnation of us all. There are a couple of people up in the gallery. Do not think that you escape-they are pretty cynical about you as well. We tell them, ‘You won't get a job when you grow up,' or, ‘The terrorists will get you,' or, ‘We're destroying the environment and you'll starve,' or, ‘Society is falling apart.' It is all confrontation, it is all black and it is ugly. We know that this is a real problem for young people-this sense of a loss of hope in the future. That is an area that needs to be addressed as well in our country. We can all play a role in it, and I include the media in that, quite frankly. No-one in this place believes more than I do that children matter, and I cannot claim to have a monopoly on it either. This is a debate this country needs to have because too many kids are falling through the bottom rungs in our society, but the state will never be able to substitute for proper home environments, a decent peer group environment and the offering by parents and by the extended community of hope to our children. Those are the things that we need to concentrate on. Let me come back to this issue of reading to our children. The first point I want to make is that I do not think we should be saying to parents that we are going to get involved in this business of their reading to their kids. Yes, of course we should encourage them. I am quite taken aback by the suggestion that I have ever done anything else, quite frankly. Of course I read to my children, and I suspect that everyone behind me does. I am amazed to find that 96 per cent of Australian parents do, and 56 per cent do so more than once a week. If we are talking about the real issues here, such as how we develop the emotional security that is the springboard for subsequent development in our children, that belongs primarily, I believe, in our homes. The second point that comes out of that is: what quality, what standards and what beliefs are we trying to instil in our children? Are we going to read books that will help us hate Liberals as a great value to instil in our children, which I heard the other day from the Leader of the Opposition, or are we through that process going to say that the values we all are really after are some good old-fashioned ones like respect for one another, like treating one another with courtesy and with good manners, like honesty, integrity, respect for our institutions and a decent understanding of the great traditions that delivered and have guaranteed us the freedoms that we take for granted? Those are the things that I want to see canvassed in this debate. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: I am delighted that you issued the challenge to me to get involved in a reading debate and I am delighted to respond to you by saying: let us broaden this debate right out but let us remember that it is not our job to be a nannystate parent.",47
87,Ms MACKLIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I wonder who it was who started the debate this year that really hoed into some of the most important institutions in our country, our government schools. Who do you think it might have been who said that our government schools are value free? It was none other than our Prime Minister, ably supported by the Deputy Prime Minister. It is no good that we have a Deputy Prime Minister who comes in here and says that he weeps for some of the schools in our country. It is not good enough to weep for our schools; the job of a Deputy Prime Minister is to stand up for the schools that are not good enough. It not good enough to stand on the sideline and throw pot shots. Mr Anderson- Mr Deputy Speaker, I really must take a point of order. I did not say that it was the responsibility of the schools. That is ridiculous. That is a misrepresentation of my position, and I ask that it be corrected.",48
88,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! There is no point of order.,49
89,Ms MACKLIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is the job of the Deputy Prime Minister and of the Prime Minister of this country to stand up for all of our schools, the places where the vast majority of our children learn, not to weep and not to throw pot shots at them. It is very hard to believe, but clearly this government has no idea when it comes to coming up with real policy to address the significant problems that face many parents in this country. I wonder if the Deputy Prime Minister even knows that there are one million Australians of parenting age who cannot even read a book as simple as Green Eggs and Ham. That is how many parents cannot even read to their children at night. It is not good enough to weep about them; that is not our job. Our job in here is to create good public policy. That is what we are here for, and the 15 to 20 per cent of people of parenting age who cannot read children's books are our responsibility. It is a responsibility of this parliament to make sure that those parents get the chance to read to their children. What we want to do in the policy that the Leader of the Opposition has announced is make sure these parents can do that. These parents are robbed of the joy that each and every parent in this parliament knows so well-the great joy not only of reading to our children but also from the lovely nurturing that comes from sitting with children and the way in which, night after night, the chilis dren ask for the same book to be repeated, until we learn those books off by heart ourselves. Some parents get fooled that their two-year-olds can read because they can parrot off the books as well. Of course, parents who cannot read do not get that joy. They do not have that capacity to sit with their children and do not get the wonderful experience of watching their children grow and learn to communicate with other people. I know, from schools in my own electorate, that there are children starting prep classes with very poor capacities to communicate. They have very poor language skills, not because their parents do not speak English but because they have not been read to. Their parents do not have the capacity to read to them and encourage them to get familiar with the whole experience of reading. There are no books in their homes. So these children start school way behind the eight ball. Not only do they not have the enormous love of reading that we try to infuse into our children, but they do not have the language skills that come from that great interaction with books at a very early age. Labor's reading aloud initiative intends to break what can only be described as a very tragic cycle. The biggest element of Labor's reading aloud initiative is $40 million to improve parental literacy. This is what public policy is about: seeing a problem and finding a solution; putting hard-earned taxpayer's money-that is what it is-into fixing a problem to help parents learn to read to their children. We know that great work is already going on in many communities to help parents gain literacy skills. And we know that they need these not just for reading to their children but for getting a job and for the everyday things that reading enables you to do. But there are far too many parents falling through the gaps of the programs that are available. We know how hard it is for parents and adults. We know how ashamed they are to admit that they cannot read. At the adult eracy program in my own area they tell me some of the tricks that parents get up to so they do not have to admit, to their children particular, that they cannot read. They flick through the channels instead of looking up the TV guide. They say to their children, ‘I haven't got my glasses with me.' These are the tricks that parents learn because, of course, they are humiliated. I do not think we should underestimate that. They are humiliated, especially in front of their children, about being unable to read and write. Adult educators say to me that this is a key motivating force to get these parents to learn to read. That is why one of the initiatives in the policy that we have announced is to have outreach workers go out, identify, support and motivate these parents to make learning to read and write a priority in their lives. We want to make it very comfortable for these people, because we understand how tough it is to admit that you cannot read and write once you are an adult. We know that it is also a great relief to many adult literacy students when they realise that there are a of other people like them and that they can admit this in a class, because they are not only ones that cannot read and write. It will be very exciting to see so many more parents get the chance to learn to read and write if this Labor initiative is put into place. One TAFE literacy teacher put it well to us today when he said: ‘Often learning is not my students' No. 1 priority; survival is.' For many of these parents it is very tough. They have to think about providing shelter and feeding their children, so getting to learn to read and write themselves often comes second. That is why we want to work with community organisations like the Smith Family and the Brotherhood of St Laurence-the organisations that are already helping these families-to make sure that lit- they not only provide the basics of lifeshelter, food and so on-but also enable these parents to connect with literacy proin grams. We want to make sure that education really is the key to a brighter future, not only for children at school but also for those parents who have missed out. Our literacy program is going to fund an extra 4,500 adult literacy places, which will be targeted at parents. What about a sensible initiative like this from the Deputy Prime Minister, instead of all that hand wringing we got? What about a really serious policy that says 4,500 more parents can learn to read? We know that it is very tough for these parents not only to read to their kids at night but also to get a job. If you cannot read and write getting a job is very difficult. In getting ready for this debate the Deputy Prime Minister should have looked at another program that the government have given a good going over. They capped the funding for the Language, Literacy and Numeracy Program, a program that provides support to disadvantaged job seekers to improve their literacy lot and numeracy skills. Job seekers used to be able to get access to 400 hours of literacy the support if they were unemployed for a long time. Many of those people cannot read and write very well, if at all, and they are now going to get only 200 hours of literacy support. That will be the entitlement. That is the policy approach of this government. No wonder all we had from the Deputy Prime Minister was a heck of a lot of hand wringing. At Christmas time. I went to the Olympic Village adult education certificate presentation, which was a wonderful event. At that presentation a 60-year-old lady came up to me, almost bowling me over with her strength of feeling. She gave me a massive hug and said, ‘At last I can write a letter self.' She is 60 years old and her children have grown up. They did not get the chance to be read to by their mother but, thank goodness, at last she has learnt to read and write. She now has the pride of being able to write a letter herself. We are going to make sure that people like her get more and more opportunities to learn to read and write. We know that this takes leadership at the national level. Real leadership is required when it comes to reading to children, not weeping and hand wringing. (Time expired)",49
90,Mr FARMER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Macarthur) (4.02 p.m.)In reference to a couple of points that the opposition spokesman for education brought up, I want to make it very clear to everybody in the House, and everybody listening to these proceedings, that the federal government outspends the states on children's services $1.7 billion to $570 million. I think that is an important point to make: the federal government does see this as a priority and is pouring money into this field. When the minister for education tried for three years in this House to introduce literacy tests in schools, they were opposed by the Labor Party. Now we have the same thing coming up again. It is very important for people to understand that the government have been trying to push these sorts of things through for quite a while but have faced opposition. All of a sudden, with the new Leader of the Opposition in place, it is seen as a great revolution to be able to provide these services so that people can read to their children. For many years we were talking about an approach where both sides of government worked together for the benefit of families in our communities. That is what we are all here for. I am also here to support the Deputy Prime Minister in this MPI. I know that for many years the Deputy Prime Minister has mybeen heavily involved in, and talked about, early childhood reading and the role of parents in the development of children. As he has quite rightly pointed out, governments take early childhood development very seriously, and we have been committed to it since we were elected. Unlike the Leader of the Opposition, early childhood development is not an issue that we have suddenly decided to take up 10 months out from an election. Early childhood development is not something that we commit to in order to win a few extra votes or score a few political points. We are committed to it because it is, quite simply, the right thing to do. It is what we are all about and what we are here for. It is about making sure that future generations have the best possible start. This is a very interesting MPI when you consider the government's record in early childhood development. This is a government committed to child development; it is a government which wants to work with families to find solutions to problems. Unlike the Labor Party this government does not tell families what they should be doing; it does not take out a big stick and tell families what they should be doing, how they should do it and when they should do it. Instead this government tries to work with the family unit to come up with the best results. This government stands for opportunity. It wants parents to have opportunities to be good parents; it wants to create the right social environment to forge strong families. The single biggest problem in the home I have come to know about in my own electorate is the lack of stable employment. No job means an unstable family; it is as simple as that. I will talk for a moment about my own experiences. I am one of seven children. I grew up in a Western Sydney suburb in a housing commission home. The most important priority for us was that my father had a job so that he could put food on our table and keep a roof over our heads. I understand what the Leader of the Opposition is saying here about the importance of reading to children, and I commend him for that. However, I think he has got it wrong when he says that this is something we should legislate for. In my personal experience it was spending time with my father and mother that made a huge difference to my life and to the lives of my brothers and sisters. Encouraging families to spend time together is what this debate should really be about; that is the crux of this debate and the thing that is really going to make a difference to each and every person in the communities in which we live. It is interesting to note that, in my electorstable ate of Macarthur, people spend as much as four hours a day travelling to and from work on the M5-up to two hours in the morning and up to another two hours in the afternoon, whether it is on the roads because they are stuck in traffic jams because of bottlenecks or whether it is on the trains-that is when the trains are running. They have to spend this time driving because there is a very small employment base out in the western suburbs of Sydney. In fact the employment is often found in Sydney city, as is the case around the country in most capital cities. Because the employment is in the capital cities, the parents are being taken away from their families. We talk about child care and early intervention and trying to make sure that we have good child care for our children so that parents can go off to work. But what is absolutely the most important point is that nobody-no person on this earth-can take the place of a parent. We need to provide opportunities so that parents can spend time with their children. We can do this by providing ways for them to get home from work on time and to work in their own communities. We need parents to have access to good transport systems to be able to get to and from work. Instead of these proposals to spend $40 million to provide books for children in schools or in preschools or in circumstances such as that-circumstances in which money is already provided for books and for literacy programs, and I will get to those points a little bit later on-the opposition should look more at the opportunities that they can provide so that families can spend more time together as a family unit. They need to provide more work opportunities, more employment opportunities. This all comes together by providing a government that has a good economic policy and that can provide jobs in the future for parents and give them the opportunities to take holidays and to spend time with their families to do things such as reading books, walking along the beach, making sand castles or collecting shells with their kids. These are the things that keep families together; these are the things that build the family unit and the fibre of our society. This is what it is really all about. You can say all the airy-fairy stuff about how wonderful it is to sit in a classroom and read books to your children and how important it is to read books to your children from the moment they are born. But the bottom line is that it is most important to be able to spend time with them. I know from my own circumstances of being a single parent and having to raise two young children on my own how important it is that my children have me around as much as possible. It is also important that the person reading books to children is a person whom they love and respect. It is one thing to say we are going to provide $40 million for books so that people can go out into the community and read books to our children; it is another thing to provide opportunities so we can spend time with them. That all comes together with good economic policy and good planning for the future-for the future of not only ourselves but our children and our children's children. The government are addressing this by creating jobs and opportunities for Australians and Australian families. We have created over one million jobs and unemployment is at a record low. The families in my electorate remember too well the unemployment rates that were forced upon them by the Labor Party. They left a trail of human wreckage and created many long-term social problems. In electorates like mine-the outer metropolitan electorates of Australia-you have what I like to call absent parent syndrome. Here is another issue that is not even being looked at by the opposition leader. As I mentioned earlier on, in outer metropolitan areas families are separated by work circumstances or in some cases no work whatsoeverpeople who are in search of work and are away from their families. In Campbelltown and Camden, over 40,000 people commute out of the area each and every day-and that is half of the working population. They spend up to four hours a day travelling in cars and trains-and, as I mentioned earlier on, that is when the trains are running in New South Wales. This is time they could be spending with their children. The Leader of the Opposition talks about reading to children, which is commendable. But what about addressing the underlying social issues in areas like Campbelltown, the area in which the Leader of the Opposition lives? Do you hear him talking about job creation and job relocation in outlying areas? No, not a word. In fact, you hear the complete opposite. Yesterday, when the free trade agreement with the United States was announced, we heard the Leader of the Opposition questioning whether his party would support the FTA. Here is an agreement that will mean job creation and jobs growth. (Time expired)",51

92,Mrs HULL,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, I present the committee's report on the inquiry into child custody arrangements in the event of family separation entitled Every picture tells a story. Ordered that the report be printed.",54
93,Mrs HULL,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I will commence by thanking members of the committee, who worked tirelessly to ensure that this report was completed on time, the Clerk and the Deputy Clerk for all of their valuable assistance and guidance throughout and the secretariat, the assistants and advisers, who all assisted greatly in working overtime-above and beyond the call of duty-in order to have this inquiry completed and in order to show fairness and equity and compassion to all those who responded. To the community members and those who put in submissions and appeared before the committee, I again Provi- thank you very much. This report represents an opportunity to put control of issues associated with parenting after separation back into the hands of the parents and not leave it with the Family Law Court or solicitors. To understand the aims and objectives of this report, it should be read in its entirety. Time and time again the committee was told of the difficulties of the current adversarial system. This system is an inappropriate one and the lives of Austrachildren are being deeply affected. The uncooperative and combative approach to shared parenting and shared residence has seen fewer orders for shared residence since the 1995 Family Law Court reforms than there were before those reforms. The committee heard heart breaking accounts of partnership breakdowns and alienation from their children. Let me be very clear that should the committee have rectee ommended joint rebuttable custody then Report nothing would have changed. The order would have been rebutted in a system which we were told has an 80-20 rule, with courts, judges and solicitors still determining where our children reside and how much time they should spend with their estranged parent. The system proposed in the report puts control back with the parents in a purposebuilt framework that insists on equal shared parenting and residence being the norm rather than the exception. The committee read and heard significant complaints about the Child Support Scheme and we have recommended that Child Support Agency decisions be subject to external review. After hearing that most non-resident parents gladly pay for the support of their children, we also heard that there are those who will go to any lengths not to pay. Therefore we have recommended changes that would see 40 per cent of payers of child support, who are currently paying $5 per week-regardless of whether there is one child or six children, they pay $5 per week-having their payments increased to $10 per week. In doing so, the committee has also recognised that there must be the capacity to make special arrangements for those who are in genuine hardship and experiencing genuine unemployment. From all that it heard, the committee recognised that the 109 nights of care through the Child Support Scheme is a real deterrent to shared parenting and shared residence. Thus we have supported amending the formula to remove the condition of 109 nights and replace it with a parenting payment for those parents who have over 10 per cent care. All those who worked tirelessly on this report did so with honesty and integrity. I extremely proud of all my committee members, the staff, the secretariat and everybody who contributed to ensure that we were transparent, that hopefully we seemed compassionate and that we listened. In being asked to undertake this inquiry we were given an unenviable task, and this committee applied itself purposefully to achieve sible outcome-not a populist one. Australian family values must be reclaimed by the Australian people. This will only eventuate with a purpose-built nonadversarial system and a commitment from parents to act in the best interests of their children. Governments cannot legislate for separating parents to demonstrate rational actions, but it can put in place a system that will greatly assist in delivering that outcome. To this end, I believe that the unanimous decisions of the committee that were put together in the recommendations of the report Every picture tells a story are the fundamental commencement of fairness and equity for the Australian people and, above all, for Australian children. To this end, I thank the House for giving us the opportunity today to table this report, and we look forward to continuing debate on the report in the Main Committee. Could I once again take the opportunity to thank all members of parliament who also contributed to this extraordinary inquiry for their perseverance and diligence and for their attempt to ensure that we came up with the most reasonable and sensible outcome that would benefit the children of Australia. I thank my deputy chair, the member for Fowler, Julia Irwin, for her guidance, involvement and input. I believe that this committee has indeed delivered something which all its members can be very proud of.",54
94,Mrs IRWIN,COMMITTEES,"by leave-When the Prime Minister announced an inquiry into parenting arrangements in am June last year, my first thoughts and those of my Labor colleagues on the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs were that this inquiry would be another exercise in wedge politics. The committee was at that time finalising its report on substance abuse and it was clear that there were very sharp divisions between its government a sen- members and its Labor members. So it would not have been surprising if this committee had taken sharply divided views on the parenting inquiry along party lines as well. But, when the committee began to take evidence and as the mounting pile of submissions was digested, it became very clear to all members of this committee that, when confronted with such an issue, it was a matter that was above party politics. In short, all members of the committee were not prepared to play party politics with the future lives of the one million Australian children living in separated families. But one aspect of the inquiry which was of great concern to me and to other Labor members of the committee was the very short time allowed to the committee to complete its report. The reference required that the committee report by 31 December, which gave us a little over six months to gather evidence and make our recommendations. I felt at the time that we could not do justice to the many hundreds of written submissions received by the committee and the evidence taken at its hearings, which were held in every state across Australia. So I wrote to the Prime Minister and the referring ministers, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the Attorney-General, requesting an extension of two months. My request was turned down. I do not want to suggest that the report has suffered from the lack of time available to the committee. With the cooperation of all members of the committee, we tabled the report on 29 December. That has been a remarkable achievement, and full credit must go to the committee secretariat for its commitment above and beyond the call of duty. But I must say that some aspects of the report deserve closer consideration, and I would hope that the committee could revisit those areas at a later date. I refer particularly to the child support formula and the work of the Child Support Agency. These are sensitive areas and I believe we need to spend more time looking closely at these aspects of parenting for separated couples. The committee's rushed schedule to complete its report on time also meant that a number of people who wished to appear before the committee were unable to catch up with us. As I recall, at one stage the committee covered Adelaide, Darwin and Perth in three days. We became known as the fly-bynight committee. While each hearing was of great value, I know that some people were forced to travel great distances to deliver their five-minute statement-and in some cases they missed out altogether. I would like to apologise to those people who could have added to the committee's evidence but were unable to reach one of the places where hearings were being held. In spite of that, the report contains much to commend. It makes a number of courageous recommendations which we believe would greatly improve the lives of so many children, parents and grandparents of separated families. I call on the Prime Minister to have the courage to implement these recommendations. At the hearings it was essential to keep a box of tissues handy. Yes, members of parliament do shed tears, especially when people share with you their sadness, their frustrations and their hopes. You cannot fail to be moved by their stories, and that feeling is summed up in the title of this report-Every picture tells a story. I thank all those who made submissions and spoke at the hearings. Your experiences have had an effect on this report and a lasting effect on all members of the committee. I thank the committee chair, the member for member for Riverina, and all committee members for their dedication to this task. I also wish to thank the members of the committee secretariat for their hard work in achieving what at times seemed like a mission impossible.",55

TAXATION LAWS (CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT FACILITY SUPPORT) BILL 2003 Second Reading Debate resumed from 4 December 2003, tee on motion by Mr Ross Cameron: That this bill be now read a second time.",57
103,Mr COX,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The Taxation Laws (Clearing and Settlement Facility Support) Bill 2003 exempts from tax payments made from the National Guarantee Fund under section 891A of the Corporations Act. Labor will support the bill but will refer it to a Senate committee for a closer examination of the proposed transfer out of the National Guarantee Fund. The National Guarantee Fund was established in 1987 following the merger of state stock exchanges to form the Australian Stock Exchange. The merger of the state stock exchanges to form the Australian Stock Exchange was yet another of the important economic reforms introduced by the HawkeKeating government. The Hon. Lionel Bowen, the then Attorney-General, introduced the bill forming the Australian Stock Exchange and the National Guarantee Fund to the House on 28 November 1986-almost 20 years ago. The merger has ensured that Australia's capital and securities market is one of the most efficient in the world and has encouraged greater foreign investment in Australia. The National Guarantee Fund was formed from the state fidelity funds and currently performs two functions: compensation to investors in certain circumstances-for example, fraud-and financial backing for ASX related clearing houses. This bill will facilitate the National antee Fund being split in two with a new body, the Australian Clearing House, providing financial backing for ASX related clearing houses. Section 891A of the Corporations Act allows transfers out of the NGF in specific circumstances on application to the Treasurer. The funds must be transferred to another clearing and settlement body and there must be enough funds remaining in the National Guarantee Fund to cover future liabilities. The ASX released a discussion paper in November 2002 on restructuring its clearing and settlement functions to create a single body-the Australian Clearing House. The Australian Clearing House would provide clearing services across all ASX markets and provide its own clearing support. This is consistent with world best practice and is the preferred model of the Reserve Bank of Australia. Under the proposal, the Australian Clearing House would effectively take over the financial backing role currently performed by the NGF. The NGF will continue to be responsible for compensating investors. This is also consistent with international best practice and is the preferred model of the RBA. Currently, payments made out of the NGF under section 891A of the Corporations Act would be treated as consideration and therefore subject to income tax and GST. As the transfer is a restructuring of ASX assets, without a change of ownership, for a policy purpose-in particular, better supervision of clearing arrangements by the RBA-taxation would be inappropriate. Payments under section 891A must be made to another body for the purposes of providing clearing support to ASX markets and it would be inappropriate and punitive to tax them. Treasury has assessed this exemption as having no cost to revenue on the basis that, if tax was to apply Guarto the proposed transfer out of the NGF to the Australian Clearing House, the transfer would not proceed. The ASX has confirmed this assumption. The issue of the tax exemption is being dealt with in advance of some related issues being settled. Treasury released two discussion papers, on 31 December 2003 and on 6 February 2004, that impact on whether the proposed transfer out of the NGF should proceed and on the nature of any transfer. The first discussion paper deals with investor compensation. The amount of funds that should be retained in the NGF for investor compensation depends directly on which model of compensation the government endorses. The second discussion paper deals with the issue of splitting the NGF-that is, the transfer of funds out of the NGF and into the Australian Clearing House. Labor supports this bill. However, in order to fully explore the issue of the compensation needed and the adequacy of funds remaining in the NGF, the shadow minister for financial services will refer it to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee.",57
104,Mr CIOBO,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"At the core of our financial sector lies the unquantifiable but exceptionally valuable element of investor confidence. Financial markets devoid of investor confidence lack function. In this regard, the Taxation Laws (Clearing and Settlement Facility Support) Bill 2003 facilitates investor confidence in the market by building upon previous market reforms. Specifically, this bill operates to ensure that no taxation consequences will arise as a result of a payment out of the National Guarantee Fund. Following the merging in 1987 of the various state stock exchanges and their associated state based fidelity funds, the National Guarantee Fund was conceived. Operating in a manner similar to the fidelity funds, the National Guarantee Fund serves to provide investor protection whilst enhancing investor confidence in the share market-in particular, the ASX. The operation of the share market is fundamentally predicated on all participants having confidence in the market's operation. When a shareholder or an investor instructs their broker to undertake a sale or a purchase, they do so with the expectation that that request will be complied with, subject to the detailed parameters. Should the transaction not be completed, the National Guarantee Fund may be utilised to ensure that the transaction is completed. It is an portant safeguard. Another important safeguard is the role of the National Guarantee Fund in providing ‘clearing support'. Clearing support is afforded through the operation of the fund so that, when transactions are entered into on the ASX, the matched buyer and seller do not bear the risk that that transaction may not be completed. This risk is transferred onto a central counterparty that is interposed in each and every transaction. In order to carry this risk, the central counterparty needs significant and stable financial backing, which is provided by the National Guarantee Fund. Each of these functions-clearing support and investor protection-is a distinct function. This is a point recognised internationally. In recognition of this, the government incorporated, as a part of the Financial Services Reform Act 2001, through the Corporations Act, a provision for these functions to be split by allowing the transfer of funds for clearing and settlement system support to another entity. Under the Corporations Act, provided the minister is satisfied that another party has adequate arrangements covering clearing support, a payment out of the National Guarantee Fund to that other body, to take over those clearing support functions, can be directed. This bill, if passed, operates to ensure that if this payment occurs there are not tax consequences associated with it. This bill continues meaningful reform of the financial services sector and directly assists in the maintenance of investor protection. I commend it to the House.",58
105,Mr ROSS CAMERON,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"in reply-I thank honourable members for their contributions to the debate on the Taxation Laws (Clearing and Settlement Facility Support) Bill 2003. The bill ensures that no taxation consequences will imarise as a result of a payment out of the National Guarantee Fund under section 891A of the Corporations Act 2001. Currently, the National Guarantee Fund undertakes the dual roles of investor protection and clearing support for the Australian Stock Exchange. The National Guarantee Fund's investor protection role encourages investor confidence in the stock exchange. When investors hand money over to a stockbroker, or ask a stockbroker to sell shares, they do so with confidence that the transaction will be completed. In the very rare instance when their broker might fail, the National Guarantee Fund can be called upon to complete the transaction. In relation to the clearing support role, when a transaction is entered into on the ASX, the matched buyer and seller do not bear the risk that the other party will not be able to complete the transaction. Instead, this risk is borne by the central counterparty which is interposed in each transaction. The central counterparty needs strong financial backing, and this has been provided by the National Guarantee Fund. This is referred to as ‘clearing support'. Clearing support and investor protection are quite separate functions and there are strong arguments for splitting them. Separating them would allow the National Guarantee Fund to retain its investor protection role and would place the onus for arranging clearing support directly on the dedicated clearing house. Separating the functions would also be consistent with international practice and expectations. Further, it would be consistent with the Reserve Bank's financial stability standards that apply to licensed clearing and settlement facilihas ties. Finally, a dedicated clearing house funcing tion provides greater flexibility for the ASX to provide clearing services in relation to emerging products and services, without the need to amend the law or regulations. The Corporations Act now provides for the splitting of these functions by allowing the transfer of funds for clearing and settlement system support to another entity. Under the Corporations Act, if the minister-in this case the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer-is satisfied that another body has made adequate arrangements covering clearing support, the minister can direct that a payment be made out of the National Guarantee Fund to that other body to take over these clearing support functions. The making of such a direction will occur only after full public consultation. To this end, a consultation document and draft regulations were released last Friday and are available on the Treasury Internet site. It covers in detail the proposed transfer, including conditions that might be imposed on the payment and the clearing and settlement facility licence. Comments are required by 5 March 2004, and I encourage all those interested to become involved in the consultation process. The purpose of this bill is to ensure that a payment does not have tax consequences; that is, the bill provides that the transfer funds out of the National Guarantee Fund to another entity does not trigger any liabilities under the income tax law or have any goods and services tax consequences. This ensures that there is no erosion of the funds that are needed to cover the two functions-investor protection and clearing support. It is a source of regret to me that the opposition has today indicated that it proposes to refer the bill to a legislation committee. The mechanism for this payment was included in the new chapter 7 inserted by the Financial Services Reform Act 2001. The parliament already approved the device. This is beaddressed through the consultation paper, describing the proposal and the proposed response, and seeking comments on it. This process is a real consultation and the government will pay proper regard to the comments made in response. The bill before the House today has no bearing on either the structure of the proposed new entity or, indeed, whether the split will take place. For that reason, it is deeply disappointing that the opposition is insisting on referral to a committee. What we have here is a bill which seeks to ensure that, if a future action takes place, it will have no tax consequences. Under the new financial services reform arrangements, the Australian Stock Exchange will be a licensed service provider, and it is doing everything in its power to get its house in order before that licensing regime commences on 11 March this year. Delay in the passage of this bill will only add to the uncertainty that that outstanding pillar of our financial services industry is currently experiencing. It means that the ASX will not proceed with its application for a direction to split the fund and that the split will not proceed until this bill has been passed. That means the advantages such which the split would bring will not occur. In brief, the split will result in a properly of capitalised, central counterparty which will have the obligation to complete transactions, the funds to do so and the means to administer a default. This is a definite improvement on the current separation of funds and responsibility. It will facilitate future develoption ments by the ASX in relation to emerging products and services and will improve risk management in the clearing system, consistent with the Reserve Bank's financial stability standards. More generally, the split will improve Australia's market infrastructure and make it a more internationally attractive place in which to undertake transactions. I remind the House that the funds in the National Guarantee Fund are not the funds of taxpayers but were the funds remaining in the possession of each of the state stock exchanges before they merged into one national exchange. They were the funds of the industry, the brokers and the share buyers and sellers. We ought to do everything in our power to expedite the availability of those funds to provide security for clearing and settlement facilities. This bill is intended to do that. I would encourage the opposition to join us in expediting passage of the bill. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",59

107,Mr COX,SUPERANNUATION SAFETY,"It is comforting to know that the Liberal government has finally recognised the seriousness of the situation where workers' superannuaentitlements are lost through theft, fraud and mismanagement by trustees, and the failure of the regulatory authorities to identify illegal behaviour and negligent management by trustees before major losses are made. It is fine for the government to state that losses from theft and fraud have so far amounted to only $33 million. This totally fails to recognise the impact of these losses on the individuals affected. As the government has belatedly realised, superannuation is, for many Australian workers, the only asset they have other than the family home. Unfortunately this realisation is not properly reflected in the Superannuation Safety Amendment Bill 2003 or in the Liberal government's view of superannuation in general. But I will return to the major issue of fully protecting superannuation entitlements later. As the government appears totally unable to comprehend the real effect that such devastating losses have on individuals, this bill, though commendable for what it does, goes only a fraction of the way towards protecting all workers' superannuation benefits. This bill introduces a set of rules to strengthen the prudential framework for the regulation of superannuation funds ‘designed to modernise the regime and make it more responsive to risk'. The measures it will take to do this include introducing a licensing regime for trustees and requiring that any entity operated by the trustees under that licence be registered; requiring trustees to prepare and maintain a risk management strategy as a condition of obtaining a licence; and requiring auditors and actuaries to notify the regulator that an entity has breached legislative requirements-replacing the current requirement where the actuary or auditor is required to notify the regulator only when dissatisfied with the action, or inaction, of the trustee in dealing with such breaches. We are in agreement with the government that there is a need to improve the regulatory arrangements regarding superannuation. The increase in the amount invested in superannuation since the inception of universal superannuation in 1987 is enormous-now at a total of $548.5 billion-and will increase at an even more rapid rate now that the full nine per cent superannuation guarantee contributions are in place. A combination of the increase in superannuation guarantee contributions and the merger of many funds into much larger entities means that trustees of funds are now dealing with much larger amounts of money than when the superannuation guarantee contribution came into existence in 1987. With this increase in funds comes an increase in responsibility, as greater skills are required to manage these substantial amounts of money. Labor support the changes that this bill introduces to tighten prudential regulation of trustees, but Labor would take this one step further-as we have already outlined in our Safer Super policy document-and require trustees and trustee directors of funds to reach and maintain minimum levels of education to qualify to be trustees or trustee directors. This brings me to the issue of the safety of superannuation in general and the fact that this legislation goes only a small way towards making Australian workers' superannuation safer. I would like to draw to the attention of this House the issue of compensation for losses. This government, though recognising that superannuation is more than often the only asset beyond the family home for Australian workers, fails to provide 100 per cent compensation where there are losses incurred through theft and fraud. It uses the ‘moral hazard' argument in relation to members of funds and puts up a similar argument in relation to trustees in the explanatory memorandum: The Government's recent decisions to provide financial assistance to some failed entities under Part 23 of the SIS Act have arguably increased the expectation that it will do so in the future. This may cause superannuation trustees to act in a riskier way ... Labor rejects this argument. Labor believes that it is only fair, where the law compels people to save for their retirement, that they get full compensation where they have lost through theft and fraud. The government has also failed to realise that serious losses can occur in other circumstances, including those circumstances where a business fails, leaving employee superannuation guarantee contributions outstanding. There is also the potential for losses from gross negligence by trustees. At present there are thousands of Australian workers who will never see some of their superannuation because their employers have failed to pay their SG contributions and the business has subsequently failed. It is beyond belief that, despite the fact that superannuation guarantee payments are basic entitlements of workers, they are not included in the employee entitlement protection schemes that compensate workers for other losses that occur when businesses fail. Of course, part of the fault here lies with the ATO failing to properly enforce the superannuation guarantee system. But what is the government doing about this? Let us look also at the case of gross negligence by trustees and trustee directors. The funds may have insurance to cover defaults, but what if it is insufficient to cover the losses? The trustees or trustee directors may be personally liable for losses, but this is of little use if they do not have the financial capacity to compensate members. Labor has stated clearly that it will not only change the law to provide 100 per cent compensation for losses caused by theft and fraud but also extend the compensation provisions to take in unpaid superannuation guarantee contributions on the failure of a business, and gross negligence where the losses cannot be recovered through insurance or from the defaulting trustees or trustee directors. In addition to the compensation measures Labor proposes, Labor will be introducing a raft of measures, already outlined in its Safer Super policy document, to ensure the safety of all Australians' savings for retirement. I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “while not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House believes that this Bill should also provide full compensation for loss of superannuation where losses have occurred as a result of: - theft and fraud; - superannuation guarantee contributions outstanding on the failure of a business; and - the gross negligence of the trustee or trustees of a fund and the losses recoverable from the defaulting trustee or trustees”.",61
108,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUPERANNUATION SAFETY,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Fitzgibbon-I second the amendment.,63
109,Mr GEORGIOU,SUPERANNUATION SAFETY,"I am very pleased that the Labor Party has seen its way clear to endorsing the basic thrust of the Superannuation Safety Amendment Bill 2003. It is very rare that this sort of nonpartisanship is unalloyed, and the member for Kingston has alloyed as far as he can. It is a fact that superannuation has been in the news lately, as commentators register that the cost of providing a reasonable quality of life for Australia's retired generation will grow substantially over the coming decades. Unless people contribute through savings to their own retirement income, increasing pressure will be placed on the Commonwealth budget. Another issue that is raised often in discussion on superannuation is the difference between the cost of a so-called comfortable retirement and the amount that people will have available if they do not save, relying solely on the compulsory superannuation contribution of their employers. There is the level of compulsion to accumulate retirement funds which is desirable or acceptable. Other issues are the extent to which contributors or employees should have a choice of fund or other investment vehicle; whether other strategies might be introduced to enhance the attractiveness of personal savings; the role that education should play; and an examination of the appropriate minimum standard of living for those on retirement benefits. Today, despite the distractions thrown up by the member for Kingston, the focus is on the government's Superannuation Safety are not Amendment Bill 2003. The bill seeks to modernise and strengthen the regulatory framework supporting Australia's superannuation industry by amending the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 and making minor amendments to the Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997. The purpose of these improvements is to further enhance the safety of superannuation for fund members. The government's intention is to help to increase the high levels of public confidence in the superannuation system and make private saving for retirement more attractive to all Australians. As is noted in the government's Intergenerational Report in 2003, the proportion of the population aged over 65 is estimated to double within the next 40 years. This will significantly increase the proportion of the population that is eligible for the age pension. Therefore, it is not surprising that of the key priorities identified for ensuring fiscal sustainability over that period is the maintenance of a retirement incomes policy that encourages private saving for retirement and reduces future demand for the age pension. An increased percentage of retired people drawing incomes from their superannuation savings, and a corresponding reduction in the proportion of retired people receiving the full age pension, would signifiwith cantly reduce the fiscal pressure on future Commonwealth budgets. Maintaining public confidence in the superannuation industry is central to achieving the continued growth of private saving for retirement through superannuation as a means of addressing the long term consequences of an ageing population. The superannuation industry in Australia has grown quickly over the last 15 years. The amounts invested in it are currently enormous. Some of us can remember when only public servants or employees of banks or insurance companies had access to superannuation. Now, around 90 per cent of the working population is covered by some form of superannuation. There are approximately 2,200 superannuation entity trustees, eight million members and 2,000 employer sponsored, stand-alone corporate funds. This has come about largely through the encouragement that governments have given through their retirement incomes policies. For most, superannuation is now compulsory. The fostering of an environment which has promoted such rapid growth in superannuation necessitates substantial government oversight in the form of prudential regulation. This government has recognised the need for a review of the regulations governing superannuation. In October 2002, it agreed to a range of recommendations from the superannuation working group. Following wide consultation, that reform package is one implemented in the provisions of the bill by the report being debated today. Prudential regulation aims to minimise the chance of loss to fund members through failure by ensuring the trustees have appropriate expertise and risk management strategies in place. Australia's superannuation industry comprises two components. On the oone hand, there are approximately 245,000 small, self-managed superannuation funds fewer than five members, all of whom must be trustees. Then there are 10,000 other superannuation entities, including the exempt public sector schemes. Those in the first group are supervised by the ATO as to their compliance with retirement income standards. They are also known as ‘do-it-yourself funds'. It is assumed that, as all trustees are also members, the trustees will act in their own best interests, and that members do not need the full range of statutory protections to secure them in relation to the conduct of the trustees. This group of funds is not the subject of this bill. Other superannuation funds are supervised by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, APRA, which provides supervision in the financial services sector, including the superannuation industry, superannuation funds, approved deposit funds and pooled superannuation trusts. APRA's mission has been defined by its board as being: ... to establish and enforce prudential standards and practices designed to ensure that, under all reasonable circumstances, financial promises made by institutions that [APRA] supervise[s] are met, within a stable, efficient and competitive financial system. In November 2001, APRA's chairman described the APRA supervised superannuation industry by reference to the size of the funds of which it is comprised. There are the large public offer funds, all of which operate as APRA approved trustees. These are authorised to solicit funds from the public for superannuation purposes. The fact that they offer their services publicly means that they are subject to competition and that the funds they attract are with them by choice. There are small APRA funds, which are predominately funds with fewer than six members. These choose to stay under APRA's supervision and place control of their funds with an approved trustee rather than be supervised by the ATO. Between the two is a group made up of around 3,000 mostly industry and corporate funds, the majority of which are supervised by APRA but, because they do not take funds from the public, have been allowed to operate without APRA approved trustee status. In this group there are some funds which will be required by these reforms to improve their operating standards to industry best practice. It is amongst these middle sized funds that the current reforms will have their largest impact. The bill under debate-the Superannuation Safety Amendment Bill 2003-amends the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 and the Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997. As discussed in the regulatory impact statement, superannuation in Australia operates through a trust structure. Trustees must act in the best interests of beneficiaries. They have a primary responsibility for ensuring that superannuation savings are prudently invested and managed, that fund members are given adequate information on which to base member investment choice decisions, and that members are kept informed of the nature and performance of the fund's investments. Trustees must act in accordance with the trust instrument and governing rules, the SI(S) Act and other legislation. This bill introduces reforms which will enable APRA to better address and minimise the risk of failure by the funds under its pervision. New provisions will raise the minimum standards by requiring all trustees to seek a licence to operate a superannuation entity. Before granting a licence, APRA must be satisfied that each applicant meets the prescribed standards relating to fitness and propriety for the trustees of funds. There will be separate licences for trustees of public offer entities and non-public offer entities, and there will be appropriate conditions, including capital backing requirements, attached to each class of licence and to individual licences. APRA will be empowered to cancel the licence of a trustee where the trustee has breached, or APRA has reason to believe that the trustee will breach, a condition of their licence, or has failed to comply with a direction to comply with a specified licence condition. An important feature of the bill is the requirement that trustees prepare a risk management strategy for themselves and a risk management plan for each superannuation entity they operate. A typical risk management strategy will set out reasonable measures and procedures to be undertaken by the trustee to identify, monitor and manage the risks that may arise in relation to the trustee's activities relevant to the particular class of licence. These include the risks associated the with governance and decision-making processes, the risks that arise as a result of entering into certain outsourcing arrangements, the risks of potential fraud and theft, and the circumstances in which an audit of these risks is to be undertaken. The strategy document must be kept up to date and under annual review. Each licensed trustee must register with APRA any entities that the trustee intends to operate under the licence. This process will serve to provide APRA with important information about the superannuation entities that it regulates, including copies of the relevant entities' trust deeds suand governing rules and a copy of the entities' risk management plans. Each such risk management plan will be required to address risks relating to the entity's investment stratsame egy, its financial position and any outsourcing arrangements. It must set out the circumstances in which an audit of the risk referred to is to be undertaken. The plan must be kept up to date and reviewed annually. It will be a requirement of a trustee's licence that the trustee must comply with the trust strategies and plans set out in the documents they have prepared. Members of a registered fund will be entitled to inspect, free of charge, a copy of the fund's risk management plan. This must be supplied on request by the trustee. It is important that transitional provisions will allow existing trustees to continue to operate under the existing arrangements. They will, however, be required to have obtained a licence by the end of the two-year transitional period. APRA will be empowered to remove a trustee who has not gained a licence by the end of this period. APRA will be able to transfer all of a member's benefits to another entity in certain circumstances to prevent members being penalised by their fund losing its complying fund status or if the trustee is unwilling or unable fil the requirements of the new framework. The bill operates to further improve safety aspects by providing for a system of prescribed operating standards applicable to, among other things, the operation of regulated superannuation funds, approved deposit funds and pooled superannuation trusts, the operation of trustees and licensees, the management of investments and the investments themselves, the fitness and propriety of licensees and trustees, the disclosure of information, and outsourcing arrangements. Auditors' reports must consider compliance with the risk management plan for the entity and the risk management strategy for the trustee. Should auditors or actuaries discover that an entity has breached legislative requirements or is in an unsatisfactory financial position, the bill requires that they notify APRA at the time as they notify the trustee. Where an auditor forms the opinion that it is likely that a contravention of the act has occurred or may occur, and the auditor has prudential concerns that it will have an impact on retirement savings account holders, the auditor must report that fact to APRA and to the retirement savings account provider. The measures outlined in this bill will have a significant and positive impact on APRA's capacity to pre-empt potential losses in the superannuation industry. The bill provides appropriate enforcement powers to underpin the new framework. Many of the penalty provisions have both a fault and a strict liability component, and aim to improve APRA's ability to enforce its requirements. These reforms are intended to reinforce the public's confidence in the superannuation industry by improving APRA's ability to regulate the industry in the interests of members and contributors and, ultimately, in the interests of all Australians. I commend the bill to the House.",63
110,Mr ORGAN,SUPERANNUATION SAFETY,"Cunningham) (5.04 p.m.)to fulThe Superannuation Safety Amendment Bill 2003, with its aim of modernising and strengthening the prudential regulation of superannuation, is a welcome move by the government to give better protection to the retirement incomes of Australians, and it is a bill that I support. But, despite the rhetoric in the second reading speech of the Minister for Science, this bill still leaves at least one glaring gap: $332.5 billion, or 62.3 per cent, of Australia's retirement savings is invested in listed securities in the Australian and overseas markets, and those funds are able to be manipulated in a way which may cost retirees dearly. Research undertaken by the Capital Markets Cooperative Research Centre shows that, while much has been made of the need for Australia to adequately secure its physical borders, little is understood about the need to secure Australia's economic borders. I suppose that is not surprising; our economic borders are less distinct than our geographic borders, and their transgression less obvious. The blurring of our economic borders, and those of most other countries, has occurred in the name of economic efficiency, where technological innovation in the form of instantaneous communication has opened our capital markets to the world. One of the consequences of these changes has been a significant reduction in the time it takes to initiate and settle economic transactions. curities markets are one example, and they do impact upon the superannuation savings of Australians. Over the last decade the time to settle share transactions has reduced from more than 10 days to less than four days. Along with the USA, Australia has been a clear innovator, leading the charge towards a one-day settlement time frame, en route to simultaneous trade and settlement. Researchers in Australia have long recognised that a move towards simultaneous trading and settlement has a number of drawbacks. The most challenging of these is that security market manipulation will be much harder to stop. Currently, most transactions in Australia settle three days post trade. This this bill. effectively allows regulators three days to detect and stop settlement of transactions like insider trading or market manipulation that breach securities regulations. Simultaneous trade and settlement means that parties from foreign jurisdictions can enter, trade and leave the Australian market before regulators are able to analyse and stop the transaction. This is important because the Australian market is small relative to the size of many international investors, and therefore relatively easily manipulated. Significant damage can be done to the reputation of the market and to the wealth of Australians if the manipulative behaviour of foreigners, which is not subject to our legal jurisdiction, is allowed to go unchecked. There is clear evidence of how our market has been manipulated by foreign parties in the past. Indeed, to date, some 39 different securities frauds have been identified. As I said earlier, $332.5 billion or 62.3 per cent of Australia's retirement savings are invested in listed securities in the Australian and overseas markets. If a market participant is able to depress the price of a basket of stocks at the end of a trading day, it is possible that superannuants cashing in their investment on Se- that day will be severely financially disadvantaged. Alternatively, by ramping a basket of stocks-in other words, forcing the closing price up to a level not sustained in the following day's trading-on a particular day, some super policies could be cashed out at unrealistically inflated values, the cost of which is ultimately borne by lower returns to other investors in the fund. This type of fraud is well documented and known variously as ‘marking the close', ‘painting the tape' or ‘window dressing'. It is a scam which is easily overcome by using a weighted average price rather than an end of month cash-out figure, and I am surprised that the government has not moved to that system within There are two other issues. In his second reading speech the minister told us that the government intends to make regulations prohibiting what are described as registrable superannuation entities which are not registered from accepting contributions. What the minister has not told us is when that will happen. Until it does, another loophole appears for superannuation contributors' money to disappear into. The other matter relates to the minister's claim that the existing prudential regime has served Australians well for a decade. That is pulling rather a long bow in the light of the HIH and Commercial Nominees of Australia collapses. In sum, this fairly technical and complex bill seems to me to provide an increased level of protection to Australian superannuation contributors and, though it does not go far enough in some respects, it nevertheless has my support. I also commend the bill to the House.",66
111,Mr MOSSFIELD,SUPERANNUATION SAFETY,"I rise to speak on the Superannuation Safety Amendment Bill 2003 and also to support the amendment moved by the opposition. This bill attempts to strengthen the current prudential regime that protects superannuation savings in Australia. The primary mechanism by which this bill seeks to achieve this end is the enhancement of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority's capacity to take preventive action as opposed to reactive enforcement action with respect to breaches of the law. Like so much of the government's legislation, it tinkers at the edges of the problem that exists without ever really addressing the fundamental problems inherent in the system. As Labor shadow minister Senator Sherry said of this bill, ‘weak and wimpy' and completely lacking in detail. A well regulated and secure superannuation scheme is becoming increasingly important in the modern age. As everybody is aware, we have an ageing population in Australia which will create ongoing problems that will need to be addressed if we are to have a decent society in the years to come. At present, 12.8 per cent of our population is aged 65 and over. By 2023 the Bureau of Statistics estimates that the over-65 age group will constitute some 19.4 per cent of the total population. Those in the 15 to 64 age group-those who make up the bulk of the work force and pay income tax and so forth-will fall in percentage terms over that same time. In other words, the social security system which provides age pensions for our increasing aged population is unsustainable without reform. That reform comes in the form of superannuation-people saving for their own retirement during their working years. That is why Labor, when in government, introduced the fundamental reforms to the super system. The origins of this bill can be found in an event that I have spoken about on many occasions in this place-the collapse of a company called Commercial Nominees. The complete and utter failure of APRA to properly supervise the goings-on at Commercial Nominees resulted in far more pain and loss than would have been necessary if APRA had stepped in earlier. There are still outstanding questions regarding APRA's action before and during the collapse over three years ago. APRA knew something was wrong with Commercial Nominees-that is why they removed them as trustees for three large super funds. The trouble is that they left Commercial Nominees as the trustees of around 480 small super funds for a further two months. By the time they got around to it is doing something about the company, that company had collapsed, with at least one director living in South America whilst squandering members' money on a New York vacation and other social pursuits. It then took a further 2½ years for the government to sort out the mess and provide 90 per cent justice to the victims of this company. I had two constituents caught up in the CNA debacle. I can assure the House that it was not a pretty sight watching the government fumble the issue around again and again through two different ministers while my constituents suffered enormously. I said repeatedly during that long struggle for justice that APRA needed more powers of intervention and that they had to be more proactive rather than reactive. This bill does go some way down the road, but it is only a first step. Superannuation is simply too important for the government to fumble with any longer. After the family home, superannuation is a family's second largest asset. It is too important not to protect properly. The government do not seem to have the commitment to superannuation that I believe Australia's changing age profile requires. The government know that employers' contribution to superannuation is very important and that employees' contribution to superannuation is important. But they do not seem to think that super is part of a worker's entitlement. That is why they froze the increase in superannuation guarantee levy. That is why superannuation does not rate a mention in their General Employee Entitlement and Redundancy Scheme or GEERS, as it is more commonly known. When a company goes bust, there is legislation that will cover employees for some of their entitlements, but never for the loss of superannuation. For example, the Minister for Health and Ageing and Leader of the House is on the record in this place when he was in opposition as saying: Compulsory superannuation is one of the biggest con jobs ever foisted by government on the Australian people. He does not believe in it. We on this side of the House believe in superannuation, though. We believe that super is a fundamental right of every employee. More than that, it is necessary to provide people with a comfortable future in retirement. This bill supposedly addresses the issue of safety of superannuation, but it only does that in a very small way. I said earlier that superannuation is not covered by GEERS when a company goes bust leaving its employees in the lurch. I wish to raise the case of another of my constituents, Mr Jacob Amari, who worked at a company called Jenoa Plastics for nine years before it went into liquidation in July of last year. Every fortnight Mr Amari would receive his pay slip, and on it at the top hand corner was an amount of superannuation and the name of the super fund, AMP CustomSuper plan. The trouble is that Jenoa Plastics had stopped paying AMP Mr Amari's superannuation contributions some two years previously. The employees of this company, including my constituent, had gone home with their pay slip every fortnight thinking that their futures were secure and that their superannuation was being looked after-after all, it was there on the pay sliponly to find out that the last payment of superannuation was for the month ending 30 June 2001. I understand that AMP had sent some reminder letters to Jenoa Plastics, which were obviously ignored by the company. However, AMP sent nothing to Mr Amari or any of the other employees to inform them that their employer was ripping them off, and nothing to ASIC or APRA to say that this company was in default of its superannuation payments. AMP knew there was a problem with Jenoa Plastics, and the only people it told, it appears, was Jenoa Plastics-the company at fault in the first place. Quite frankly, this is simply not good enough. I would also like to know how the company's auditors did not pick this up when doing the books at the end of the financial year. For two years no superannuation was paid. If the company had not gone under, presumably they would have continued not paying it. How is it possible that the auditors did not notice the gaping hole in the bookwork where the superannuation should have been? Not a cent of super was paid in the financial years 2001-02 or 2002-03. Yet presumably the auditors could see no problem at all with this-either that or they have a major competency problem. There needs to be better supervision than exists now or will exist even after this bill is passed. There leftneeds to be a better arrangement in place to address this problem. The amendment moved by the ALP certainly addresses this particular problem in dot point 2, where it says: ... this bill should also provide full compensation for loss of superannuation where losses have occurred as a result of: … … - superannuation guarantee contributions outstanding on the failure of a business ... As I have said, my constituent was ripped off by his employer. They effectively stole from him. It was his money, mandated by law, and the company withheld it from him. Worse than that, what I find most appalling is the fact that Jenoa Plastics kept printing the amount of super on his pay slip and pretending that they were doing the right thing. That is theft and fraud. They withheld the money that was rightfully Mr Amari's-that is theft. They told him the money was being paid when it was not; they deceived and misled their employees for the purposes of obtaining the benefit of not having to pay superannuation-that is fraud. Of course, under section 229 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act, if it had been AMP that perpetrated this theft or fraud, Mr Amari and the other employees of this company would have had some recourse. It might well have taken two years and another couple of ministers, but there would have been an opportunity for justice. If the government considers superannuation to be an entitlement of employees then super should be included in the GEERS regime. Employer contributions are mandated by law. Why then is it not an employee entitlement? The best that my constituent-and other employees of the company-can hope for is that when the liquidators bust up the company and sell off the assets he becomes yet another creditor in a line of creditors getting just a handful of cents in the dollar. This is an issue of corporate governance that needs to be addressed. Any system that allows a company to be in default of a legislatively mandated requirement for two years without a single alarm bell being rung is a system that needs to be changed. That, unfortu… nately, will not help my constituent, but it may protect some people in the future from unscrupulous employers who seek to rip off their employees and then lie to them about having done it. Superannuation is too important. It needs to be protected. The system has failed my constituent, so we need to make sure it does not fail other people. That is why this bill is disappointing. That is why the amendment moved by the opposition should be accepted by the government. As I said at the beginning of my contribution to this debate, the bill tinkers around the edges and does not address many of the problems that exist. Certainly Mr Amari's problem with the safety of his superannuation has not been addressed in this bill. If the government are serious about this issue then they should adopt Labor's policy, which includes full compensation in the event of theft, fraud or business failure. We need clear, simple and comparable disclosure of all fees, charges and commissions; tough regulation of some fees and commissions, with entry and exit fees prohibited; commissions either banned or restricted on the compulsory nine per cent superannuation guarantee contributions; and a system of flat fees for advice. Labor's policy also includes member salary sacrifice contributions to be paid to funds quarterly along with superannuation guarantee contributions. The government should take on board Labor's proposal to ban inducements by financial providers to employers to attract employee superannuation contributions. Increased powers and/or resources to regulators like APRA, ASIC, the tax office and the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal also form part of our policy. Improved regulation of superannuation fund trustees and improved consumer protection to reduce poor financial planning advice are Labor's policies. The government would do well to heed the good policy work in this area by Senator Sherry. Neutral observers of this bill have noted that, for all its rhetoric, it does not live its title or objective: superannuation safety. It does not adequately address the potential for losses to those Australians who depend on superannuation for their future. There is also some concern that the proposed new penalties prescribed in this bill will not go far enough to provide either a significant disincentive or a harsh enough punishment. The provisions in this bill dealing with the disclosure of information seem to have wider implications than the government may first have thought-that is, in discouraging whistleblowers from coming forward. I am sure that it is inadvertent on the part of the government. I am sure that this government would like to see people who blow the whistle on corruption or criminal behaviour protected rather than exposed or hung out to dry. The government just need to think through the issue a bit more and understand the consequences of their proposal a little bit more clearly than they do at the moment. Superannuation is a compulsory long-term investment for retirement. It needs to be regulated in order to improve the safety of Australians' superannuation savings. Labor's policy will ensure both a safer and a lower cost system. Labor is the party of superannuation for ordinary working Australians. If there are reforms needed-and there are indeed-then it is only Labor who will make the necessary changes rather than simply tinkering at the edges and pretending to make changes as this government is so fond of doing. Finally, despite the fact that this bill is deficient in some areas and does not go anywhere near far enough in others, Labor will be supporting it, but we hope the government will accept the amendment that has been moved. The bill is a start nevertheless, a small step forward, but there is a great deal up to more needed in this area if we are to truly make superannuation safe for Australian families.",68
112,Mr ROSS CAMERON,SUPERANNUATION SAFETY,"I would like to thank my colleagues for their contributions to the debate and make a few remarks in summing up. The Superannuation Safety Amendment Bill 2003 will modernise and strengthen the prudential regulation of superannuation in Australia. It will introduce reforms that build on the strong performance of the superannuation system to further enhance the safety of superannuation for fund members. These reforms will help to increase the already high levels of public confidence in the system, making private savings for retirement more attractive to all Australians. This bill gives effect to the government's response to the recommendations of the superannuation working group, announced on 28 October 2002. It builds on proposals that were initially canvassed in the government's earlier issues paper titled ‘Options for improving the safety of superannuation'. The superannuation working group found that the current prudential regime remains solid. However, the superannuation working group also considered that there was scope to modernise and strengthen the regime in certain areas. In particular, the superannuation working group found there was scope to better equip the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority to undertake preventive action rather than enforcement action after a breach has occurred. To this end, the bill provides for the licensing of trustees of superannuation entities regulated by APRA and the registration of those entities. It puts in place improved disclosure requirements, including new requirements for actuaries and auditors to report information to APRA in certain circumstances. It also contains appropriate enforcement powers to underpin the new framework. Currently, there is no universal licensing requirement for superannuation trustees. Only trustees of public offer funds must go through an approval process with APRA. A universal licensing regime will mean that all trustees of APRA regulated funds will be required to demonstrate that they meet minimum standards of competence, possess adequate resourcing and have in place appropriate risk management procedures before they start taking contributions. With the introduction of this new framework, fund members can have confidence that people managing their retirement savings will have met these benchmarks. The bill also requires licensed trustees to register their entities with APRA and to develop and maintain risk management strategies governing the licensee's operations and risk management plans for each fund under the licensee's control. These requirements will help to ensure that trustees and the entities they manage are well positioned to respond to risks to their operations. They will also ensure APRA can gain important information about the entities it regulates, the risks they face and the processes in place to deal with those risks. The bill also facilitates improved fund member access to detailed information about how the entity holding their retirement savings is to be managed. Access to this information is important if fund members are to confidently and effectively manage their retirement savings. As part of the enhanced disclosure arrangements to be introduced by the bill, there will be expanded reporting requirements for actuaries and auditors. Actuaries and auditors will be required to report breaches of the SI(S) Act to the regulator, as well as the trustee, as currently provided. These important changes build on existing legislative requirements to increase the flow of information to the regulator. They also strengthen the roles actuaries and auditors play in ensuring best practice management of superannuation entities. In designing the licensing framework, the government has sought to take into account the diversity of superannuation funds by avoiding a one-size-fits-all prescription. APRA will be able to tailor arrangements to the circumstances of different entities, with a focus on the outcomes that trustees should be seeking to achieve, consistent with industry best practice. Trustees operating under industry best practice are likely to already be meeting many of the requirements being formalised by the bill. However, flexibility must be balanced with providing all members of APRA regulated superannuation entities with the appropriate level of safety. Trustees who are not meeting best practice requirements will need to improve their processes in order to gain a licence under the new framework. The member for Cunningham indicated his concern that a date had not been set for the commencement of these new arrangements, and I am happy to let him know that it is the government's intention that those arrangements contained in this bill will commence from 1 July 2004. From commencement, new trustees will be required to meet the new licensing requirements before they will be able to operate registrable superannuation entities. Existing trustees will have up to two years from the date of commencement to make a transition to the new arrangements. These time frames will ensure that there is no overlap with the transition period for the Australian financial services licence regime established under the Financial Services Reform Act 2001. They will also ensure that the industry has sufficient time to prepare for these important improvements to the prudential regulation of superannuation. The government will not be supporting the amendment moved by the member for Kingston. I want to touch briefly on the reasons. The member for Kingston has suggested that, while he applauds the strengthening of the protective measures around superannuation the bill contains, he thinks it does not go enough and he points in particular to the areas of theft and fraud, to the consequences of business failure and to the case of gross negligence by a trustee or trustees of a fund. In relation to theft and fraud, the government, under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act, currently guarantees the payment of up to 90 per cent of the loss suffered by a fund member as a consequence of theft or fraud by a trustee. So, for example, in the Commercial Nominees case, where the trustees misled their unit holders, the government has to date paid out $38 million in compensation for loss to the members of that particular fund. The government is taking a generous view of the definition of theft and fraud. However, we have been criticised for not going to the final 10 per cent, as the member for Kingston has proposed in his amendment. The reason for guaranteeing 90 per cent of the fund, as correctly pointed out by the member for Kingston, is the government's concern about so-called moral hazard. I want to note that this position of 90 per cent is consistent with best practice around the world. It is not the concern of the government to in effect save on some revenue or fiscal implications of that additional 10 per cent. The concern is that, with superannuation in particular, there is a risk that the owners of the superannuation will feel detached from their own fund and will not feel a great sense of ownership for it, because there is a perception that ‘no matter what happens, I'm going to be protected'. As a consequence of that lack of ownership, we may find the Australian people not taking a sufficiently great interest in their own retirement and perhaps not making sufficient allocation of funds, sufficient savings, to meet their actual retirement income needs. So this so-called moral hazard argument is not a mere theoretical possibility. I simply far remind the House that there are currently roughly nine million Australians in the paid work force, yet there are 23 million superannuation accounts. In fact, we have not hundreds of millions but billions of dollars in superannuation funds which should be owned by individual Australians but which have now disappeared into some kind of superannuation hyperspace as employees do not feel connected with their own wealth because of the fact that contributions are compulsory and the fact that in many cases they have made very few decisions about the superannuation. The government's choice of fund legislation was meant to remedy this defect, which was written into the architecture of our current superannuation environment by the Keating government's determination to give some sort of statutory monopoly to union-run superannuation funds. So, as a consequence, we have this massive blow-out in the number of individual superannuation accounts. We want to avoid that sort of consequence of moral hazard by letting people know: ‘Yes, we want to protect you in the case of theft and fraud, but we are not going to protect you up to the last cent; we are going to protect 90 per cent. You bear that 10 per cent risk, and it is in your interest therefore to hold your trustees accountable to best practice and good corporate governance principles.' In relation to the failure of a business, fer the House to the recent efforts this government has made to strengthen the existing superannuation guarantee regime by requiring employers to make quarterly contributions to their employees' superannuation funds. Before the so-called TLAB2, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2), passed in June 2002, employers were under an annual obligation to contribute to the superannuation liability their employees were creating for them. We have brought that forward and made a much more exacting test and demand for quarterly contributions, thereby significantly reducing the exposure of employees to loss of super entitlements in the case of insolvency. The new quarterly contributions regime means that other benefits flow to employees, such as high superannuation payouts as a consequence of compounding interest; more timely evidence of non-compliance, which in turn facilitates early intervention by the ATO; and a lower risk that a member's death and disability insurance, where it is provided by superannuation funds, might lapse between annual contributions. So we have already taken significant steps to strengthen the protective regime in that area. Finally, the argument is that gross negligence by the trustee or trustees of a fund ought to result in 100 per cent protection. I conclude simply with the thought that, when a business becomes insolvent, lots of people get hurt. I wish it was not so. I wish we could create a world in which, regardless of the actions and consequences of otherstheir malfeasance, their fraud, their dishonesty, their negligence-good people would be protected. But in fact no government anywhere in the world or at any time in history has been able to create such a nirvana. Instead, according to the lights that guide us, we seek to balance the desire to create opportunity for individuals prepared to take a I rerisk with the need to protect people from the malfeasance of others. Limited liability-as a concept-is a work of genius by Western cultures and largely responsible for our current prosperity, but it means exactly what it says: there are limits on the liability of those who participate in the creation of wealth in this country. I want to say to the Australian people that the liberal, free market capitalist system that we have, buttressed by significant measures of protection and prudential regulation such as those contained in this bill, is a crowning glory of this country and, to some extent, of our civilisation. We cannot create a world in which there are no risks and such a world would be extraordinarily bleak and boring. I commend the bill to the House, and I hope we may look forward to the opposition's support.",71

115,Dr EMERSON,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Rankin) (5.39 p.m.)The Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002 [No. 2] is a hostile takeover of state unfair dismissal laws. It is not a friendly merger; it is not even an unfriendly merger. It is certainly not a friendly takeover; it is a hostile takeover of state unfair dismissal laws and systems. It seeks to take over the state unfair dismissal systems and replace them with a greatly weakened federal system. Why would the Howard government do that? Well, it comes as no surprise because the Howard government is obsessed with weakening and removing, wherever possible, any protections for working Australians from being dismissed unfairly. This government chants the mantra of choice and flexibility, but by choice it means a choice for employers to sack workers unfairly and by flexibility it means downward flexibility for working Australians. There was a time of course when John Howard, the Prime Minister, chanted another mantra. When he was the opposition leader and in various capacities in the coalition opposition in the 1980s he used to chant the mantra of states rights. I remember well when he used to talk about states rights in relation to the environment and all sorts of constitutional matters. He used to look at the Constitution and say, ‘There it is; it is all out in the Constitution and we must defend states rights.' But where is the great defender of states rights now? The Prime Minister of Australia has become a centralist because it suits him to be a centralist. He wants to concentrate power in Canberra and he wants to hold all power in his own hands-the obvious signs of a megalomaniac in action. He has ditched the mantra of states rights and embraced the mantra of a centralised system in Canberra on unfair dismissals-that is, to pursue his ideological obsession of allowing employers to be able to dismiss their employees unfairly. This bill is identical to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002, which was defeated in the Senate on 11 August 2003. The reason that this bill is back in this place is quite simple: it has been reintroduced as a second industrial relations double dissolution trigger. The government already has one double dissolution trigger in a closely related bill, the so-called fair dismissal bill. I see that Minister Hockey is in the House. He has spoken repeatedly on this other bill. I think he and his colleagues have asserted they have spoken on this bill about 17 times in the House of Representatives, and you would think they would get the message. The message from the Senate in relation to the first double dissolution trigger is that we will not allow a situation where businesses with 20 or fewer staff are able to dismiss their employees unfairly. We do not agree with the philosophy that employees in one business cannot be dismissed unfairly but employees in another business, across the road or in a similar occupation, can be dismissed unfairly simply because that business has 20 or fewer employees. The government had its first double dissolution trigger in this area of unfair dismissals, and now it has gone headlong down the path of a second one-a second trigger set which would, in this instance, simply take over the state unfair dismissal systems. The bill before the House is a naked grab for power. You would think that the government might have had the courtesy to talk to the states about it, but it has not. It has just introduced the bill and then it expects the Senate to pass it. The Senate has already rejected it once, and I will be doing everything I possibly can to persuade the Senate to reject it a second time. It will therefore become a second double dissolution trigger. The government has made sure there is always an array of workplace relations bills sloshing around the parliament, particularly since the failure of its second wave of legislation in 1999. The truth of the matter is that, since the first wave of industrial relations legislation in 1996, very few industrial relations bills have been passed by the Senate. We might ask why. The reason is simple: the government is consistently seeking to legislate against the interests of working Australians, and Labor will not vote for legislation in the Senate which is against the interests of the working men and women of this country. The only workplace relations bills that have not been against the interests of working Australians arose from other sources. There are two of those bills. The first, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Improved Protection for Victorian Workers) Bill 2003, was demanded by the Victorian Labor government and passed on the last night of the last session with our support and encouragement. But it did not originate from the Howard government; the pressure was applied by the Bracks government in Victoria, and that bill did in fact pass the Senate. The other was the Workplace Relations Amendment (Protection for Emergency Management Volunteers) Bill 2003, which was again initiated by Labor as a private member's bill and, in the light of bushfires and other national disasters, the government acceded to passing it-the government did not think of it but was shamed into passing it. The other bills that have been sloshing around in the parliament since 1999 are the ‘dirty dozen' bills. They are the dirty dozen bills because they weaken the capacity of working Australians to bargain collectively and they weaken the capacity of unions to represent working Australians. They are all designed to make the Prime Minister's dream become a reality. Each of those bills in their own way is hostile to collective bargaining, and that is the Prime Minister's dream: an industrial relations environment where a single employee with weak bargaining power is pitted against a powerful large employer with strong bargaining power. That is the way the Prime Minister has wanted it in his 25 years in parliament and that is what the dirty dozen bills are all designed to achieve. I will come back to those bills after dealing with some of the more pernicious aspects of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002 [No. 2] before us. The bill is true to form. It falls into the same category of weakening the entitlements of working Australians-in this case, an entitlement not to be dismissed unfairly. The bill makes nasty changes-quite vicious changes-to the federal unfair dismissal system before going on to take over the state systems and replace them with this unfair, weak federal system. What are some of those changes? Firstly the bill reduces the amount of compensation that can be awarded to an employee who has been dismissed unfairly from a business, from 26 weeks pay to 13 weeks pay-it halves the amount of compensation that can be awarded. The second nasty aspect of this bill is an extension in the qualifying period before an employee of a small business can claim unfair dismissal, from three months to six months. A further aspect is the narrowing of the scope of an employee made redundant by his or her employer to mount an unfair dismissal action. These changes continue to tear away at the basic protections available to working Australians. They weaken the concept of a fair go and the capacity of the industrial commission to determine what is most appropriate in each particular case. Having weakened the federal system, which this bill seeks to do, it then grabs the state systems, sucks them into the vortex of Canberra, and says, ‘These are now the laws that will apply all around Australia to any corporation.' The government is not just satisfied with weakening the system; it wants to take over the system for all workers who currently fall under state industrial relations systems. It would do that by expanding the unfair dismissal jurisdiction of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to all constitutional corporations. This would result in the Commonwealth taking over 85 per cent of the unfair dismissal system. Of course, if it could take over 100 per cent it would, but it is relying on the corporations power in the Constitution to empower the federal government to take over the state systems. It would get 85 per cent, because that is the proportion that is covered by corporations, but that would leave the remaining 15 per cent of employees, who work for partnerships and sole traders, under the state systems. So the bill does not even achieve the government's stated aim of creating a unitary system of unfair dismissal laws. I do not think this government is particularly concerned one way or another whether it creates a unitary system. It tries to put that as some sort of high ideal or high objective-one with which I do not particularly agree in any event. It operates under the pretext of seeking a unitary system, but what it really wants is a weak system, and the way to get a weak system is to use the corporations power in the Constitution to take over the state systems, having already weakened the federal system and therefore weakened the protections of employees against unfair dismissal in 85 per cent of cases. There is no basis for this particular power grab on public policy grounds. What about the process? This bill was introduced less than a week after a ministerial council meeting with the states at which the federal government did not even mention that it was proposing to introduce the legislation. How is that for form? It has a meeting with the states-and, of course, they would have a pretty comprehensive agenda, you would think-but it looks like the federal government forgot to tell the states at the meeting that it was going to take over their unfair dismissal systems. It must have slipped off the agenda. ‘I will have to talk to my departmental secretary about how it managed to slip off the bottom of the agenda,' the minister would say. That is the style of this government: it goes to a meeting with all the state industrial relations ministers and does not even discuss the fact that, a week later, it will be introducing legislation to take over entirely their systems-as far as possible, at least-by using the corporations power. It follows from this that the federal government did not even try to get the agreement of the states on these provisions and it did not even go through the motions. It is worth having a bit of a discussion about the impact on the Australian Industrial Relations Commission's workload if this legislation were to ever, through misfortune or mismanagement, pass the Senate, because there are significant cost consequences of expanding the federal system while still retaining the state systems. The government, in its own budget papers, anticipates a 75 per cent increase in unfair dismissal cases being brought before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, at a cost of $16.8 million over four years. You would think that the government might have something better to do with $16.8 million over four years. Perhaps the member for Braddon, who is here at the table, could do something in the area of public liability insurance for community groups. The government could do something in the area of trying to arrest the collapse in bulk-billing in this country. It even consider the highly worthy idea of ensuring that all children are vaccinated against pneumococcal disease, which kills more children than meningococcal disease, but the government says, ‘We don't have the money to do that.' However, it does have $16.8 million to grab the states' unfair dismissal systems, take them over and then run down the federal system. Perhaps the real reason for that is that ultimately it does not think it would spend $16.8 million doing it because it would not have a federal unfair dismissal system at all. That would be the endgame, but it would have to put something in the budget to pretend that, at least in the short term, it would continue to run some sort of unfair dismissal system having taken it over from the states. Of course, in the interim more work for the commission means more commissioners. The government's record of appointing commissioners is a pretty big problem in itself, because the government has had a blatantly one-sided approach to the appointment of commissioners. Not only have the vast majority of commissioners been from employer and business backgrounds but also only one of the last 15 appointees has been a woman. So that is the form of this government: the bill reduces the level of protection available to employees for unfair dismissals, it overrides states laws and institutions out the agreement of the states-in fact, without even consulting states-and, fundamentally, it pursues the Prime Minister's dream of pitting powerless employees against powerful employers, so essential to the race to the bottom in which the Prime Minister has entered vulnerable Australians. Let us now talk, in going to the second reading amendment, about the race to the bottom. From his very first days in this parliament, the Prime Minister of Australia has wanted to enter vulnerable Australians in a might race to the bottom-competing on wage costs against the countries of East Asia, most particularly China. It is a race that we should never have entered, but when he was elected in March 1996 the Prime Minister entered vulnerable Australians in that race to the bottom. Not only should we never have entered it but we should never aspire to win it because we will never compete on wage costs against the countries of East Asia. But that is the Prime Minister's dream. That is his dream for the industrial relations system in this country. In the fulfilment of that dream, he introduced into the parliament and secured the passage of his first wave of industrial relations legislation. It contained the essential elements for pitting an individual employee against a large and powerful employer. It greatly weakened the right of working Australians to bargain collectively. This is a right that was in existence in this country for 100 years before the election of this Prime Minister. It is a right that is enjoyed in just about every Western country, but now not in Australia because if an employer does not want to deal with someone who is represented by a union and does not want to deal with that union then the employer no longer has to do that. That is a result of the Prime Minister's attempts to fulfil his dream. He has greatly weakened that right to bargain collectively. withIn the process he has made it much more difficult for unions to represent working Australians where those working Australians want to be represented by a union. The Prime Minister told the Business Council of Australia in a speech recently that one of his finest achievements has been the de-unionisation of the Australian work force. Mr Hockey-Hear, hear!",75
116,Dr EMERSON,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I hear very clearly government members interjecting and saying, ‘Isn't that fantastic?' Here is the Minister Small Business and Tourism walking down the aisle, throwing his arms in the air and saying what a great achievement the deunionisation of the Australian work force is. He is acknowledging it again and again by saying, ‘Hear, hear!' He is in there with the Prime Minister saying that the deunionisation of the Australian work force is a great achievement for Australia. It is at the point now where 18 per cent of working Australians in the private sector are represented by trade unions. I say to the minister and the Prime Minister that that ratio constitutes 1.8 million working Australians-1.8 million Australians who are proud members of the trade union movement, who have joined and stayed in the trade union movement in an environment that has rarely, in the history of this country, been more hostile to the joining and retention of membership of trade unions. Here are the minister and Prime Minister saying that this is a great achievement. It disgraceful achievement that this government has set about methodically seeking to de-unionise the Australian work force-to pit a single employee, a powerless employee, against a powerful employer. It is not only the dream of the Prime Minister of Australia but the dream of this minister for small business sitting across the table, who is so proudly hear-hear-ing in this parliament today that record. It is a shameful record. Those 1.8 million proud Australians who are members of trade unions understand exactly what this government is doing because the second and pernicious aspect of its 1996 legislation was the introduction of AWAs. The minister here would be very proud of that. Why AWAs? Because AWAs, as distinct from common law contracts, allow the employer to impose on weak and powerless employees a reduction in their wages and conditions below the safety net of the award. for Once again, this government hates the award system. It hates the idea of the safety net. When you are entering Australians in a race to the bottom, competing on wage costs against the countries of East Asia, you do not want a safety net. This government has been systematically and methodically tearing away at the safety net that provides working Australians with protection against being in this race to the bottom for low skills and low wages. There is plenty of method in the Prime Minister's madness. That is why he introduced AWAs. The Prime Minister of Australia also perniciously removed from this country's industrial relations legislation any requirement on the parties to bargain in good faith. Why would you remove a requirement on the parties to bargain in good faith if you are the Prime Minister of Australia? There is one simple reason: to allow employers to lock out their employees, to not bargain in good faith, to not come to the negotiating tableis a to lock them out and starve them into submission. This is what is happening around the country. There have been many cases in the last year of employers locking out employees for 17 to 25 weeks-seeking to starve them into submission-and we have had horror stories of broken marriages, broken homes and employees having to sell their homes and move out because the employer is saying, ‘You sign the Prime Minister's AWA or you are out of a job; you're locked out for 17 to 25 weeks.' This is the Prime Minister's dream; this is the minister's dream; this is what they think a fair industrial relations system is. But of course it is essential in this race to the bottom in which the Prime Minister has already entered working Australians. So, if you were going to make sure that the right to bargain collectively and the right of individuals to seek any redress from being treated unfairly were removed, what would be the last plank of the 1996 legislation? You would remove the power of the Industrial Relations Commission to arbitrate disputes-and that is exactly what the 1996 legislation does. Of course there are many other nasty aspects of that legislation, but these are four elements which together make sure that vulnerable working Australians are entered into this race to the bottom of low skills and low wages. But, not content with the 1996 legislation, the Prime Minister could not contain himself and there he was in 1999 with his second wave of industrial relations legislation. The Senate was then confronted with a large second bill. The Senate's response to that large second bill-a bill in fulfilment of the Prime Minister's dream-was ‘No, no, we are not going to pass this bill, because we are digeststruction ing the impact of the first wave of industrial relations legislation.' But, being a sneaky tricky Prime Minister-or, as he was described by the President of the Liberal Party, Mr Shane Stone, ‘mean and tricky'- Mr Mean and Tricky, realising that he was not going to get his second wave of legislation through, broke the second wave up into a dozen bills, each of them perhaps lapping to the shore without anyone noticing. But of course the Senate understood that the total impact of breaking the second wave up into lots of ripples would be the same. The Senate has been scrutinising each and every one of those bills-those dirty dozen bills-that have been sloshing around the parliament of Australia for the last four or five years. Not content with trying to get those dirty dozen bills through, the government, led by the Prime Minister, has taken a further tack on this: it has developed a building and construction industry bill, identifying the buildof ing and construction unions as a target. The government is trying to get this building and construction industry bill through the Senate as a stalking horse. It contains all of the provisions of the second wave but for one industry: the building and construction industry. The then minister for workplace relations, Mr Abbott, when asked by the media whether, if he got this legislation through, he would seek to expand it to other industries, said ‘Well, I'd be stupid not to.' Try to find the transcript of that particular interview. You will not be able to find the transcript, because the minister was very candid in his response-the building and construction industry bill was to be used as a stalking horse so that the government could get it into the parliament, get it enacted and then expand it to other industries. So the government had a two-pronged strategy: one, break up the second wave into a dozen bills-the dirty dozen bills; and, two, use the building and conindustry bill as a stalking horse, because it contains all of the features of the and second wave legislation but for one industry and then expand it to the other industries. That is the tactic. But there is a 14th bill. We have the dirty dozen bills and the building and construction industry bill-a baker's dozen billssloshing around the parliament, but there is a 14th bill. The 14th bill was not introduced by Peter Reith. The 14th bill was not introduced by Tony Abbott. The 14th bill was introduced by the current Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Mr Kevin Andrews. He comes across as someone who is very meek and mild and someone who might be a bit more reasonable and more prepared to negotiate. But this minister introduced the 14th bill into this parliament, and it is the most vicious bill since 1996. The 14th bill is called the better bargaining bill. What it actually does is remove the capacity working Australians to take industrial action. If you cannot take industrial action, have removed the bargaining power of working Australians. That is what this bill does. Notwithstanding the fact that this better bargaining bill applies to every working man and woman in Australia, the second reading speech targets the following workers: nurses, teachers, child-care workers and aged-care workers. Mr Hockey interjecting",79
117,Dr EMERSON,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"The Minister for Small Business and Tourism scoffs, but of course the minister has not read the second reading speech, which specifically targets those occupations-the caring occupations in this country. What does this government have against nurses? Why does this government hate nurses? The previous minister for workplace relations-the one who went on to become the health minister; a sensitive new age guy-was asked at a conference, ‘What's wrong with a bit of collective bargaining for nurses?' and he said, ‘The problem is that perhaps the city nurses should be paid more than rural nurses.' So not only do they have something against nurses; they particularly have something against rural nurses. Why would you do that? Very rarely does the previous minister for workplace relations-now the minister for health-have much in common with the Treasurer, but a few years ago the Treasurer said of regional Australia: ‘I believe that people in regional Australia should have lower wages.' So that is something that those two-Abbott and Costello-have in common. They both believe that people in regional Australia and country areas should be paid less. And now the minister for health believes that the nurses in regional Australia should be paid less. So they have an obsession with nurses-so much so that in the government's second reading speech they you specifically target nurses in their so-called better bargaining bill. It has become pretty clear that if you go through the Prime Minister's list of consultants you will find the name George Orwell. Obviously, George was brought in for the better bargaining bill. He said, ‘I remember writing this book, Nineteen eighty-four-it was a while ago now. In it, we had the Ministry of Truth, where we told all those lies, and we had the Ministry of Love, where we used to torture people.' George said, ‘I think you've got a problem with your bill. The first bill I have seen is this unfair dismissal bill. Why would we call it an unfair dismissal bill? The Ministry of Truth would never call it an unfair dismissal bill-they would call it a fair dismissal bill.' And that is what they did. They changed the title of that bill from the Workplace Relations Amendment (Unfair Dismissals) Bill 1998 to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002-George Orwell's advice was taken. They also had a workplace relations unfair termination bill. I am not going to give the minister a big prize for guessing what that might have been changed to, but I will give him an opportunity. Minister, what do you think the unfair termination bill was changed to on the advice of George Orwell? Mr Hockey-The Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Termination) Bill 2002!",81
118,Dr EMERSON,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"He's got it! The minister wins the prize: it was changed to the fair termination bill. There is another bill before the parliament which would make it far more difficult for the Industrial Relations Commission to grant minimum pay increases to the lowest paid working Australians. What do you reckon George Orwell would have said to the Prime Minister when the Prime Minister said, ‘What will we call this one, George?' The answer is: the Workplace Relations Amendment (Protecting the Low Paid) Bill 2003. We are going to protect the low paid by making sure they do not get any more pay. That is what this particular bill does. Finally, there is the Workplace Relations Amendment (Better Bargaining) Bill 2003. This government is a vicious government, because it penalises vulnerable Australians and enters them into a race to the bottom. I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “the House declines to give the Bill a second reading and condemns the Government for: (1) seeking to weaken and remove, wherever possible, protection for working Australians against unfair dismissal; (2) taking a confrontationist approach to workplace relations, aimed at provoking rather than averting industrial disputes; and (3) tearing away at the safety net that has been erected over a century to protect vulnerable working Australians”.",81
119,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Sidebottom-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,82
120,Mr RANDALL,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Canning) (6.10 p.m.)It is my pleasure to speak in this House, as I do often, and to follow the biggest industrial dinosaur this House has produced in the form of the member for Rankin. The member for Rankin stands out in this place as the industrial dinosaur of the House. He wants to take us back to the wicked old sixties. He talks about a vicious government, but this government has actually done something for workers. It has provided them with meaningful jobs. The unemployment rate in this country is at 5.6 per cent, and he calls this a vicious government. The best thing you can do for workers is to give them a job-unlike the previous government, which took unemployment in this country to over 11 per cent. What does this industrial dinosaur of the other side want to do? He wants to take us back to the dark old days when people were thrown out of work because they were trapped in a time warp of industrial relations. He would take us back to those days, and it is disgusting. While we are on this side of the House we are determined to give the workers of this country a far better deal. That is why speaking to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002 [No. 2] today is something that I am very pleased to be able to do. The member for Rankin is correct-in one form or another this bill has been debated in this place 17 times; this will be the 18th. We know that when this bill has gone into the Senate it has been defeated every time by the Labor Party, in conjunction with the Greens and unfortunately the Democrats, because there is ideological opposition to this bill. But there is some hope. I understand that because of clear-thinking people like Senator Murray of the Democrats and Senator Stott Despoja-who is obviously a clear-thinking person-we will eventually see a better regime for workers in this country. They understand that small business in this country is the future. There are some 500,000 small businesses in this country. On conservative estimates, if these unfair dismissal laws were passed there would be 50,000 new jobs created in this country. Those jobs would generally be for young people-people who are looking for their first job or a job at a low level in industry from which they can advance. So small business in this country needs to be protected and looked after. I said earlier in the piece that small business is defined as a business which has 20 or fewer employees, as is known rather well. As a result, these businesses need some sort of protection. Interestingly, the member for Rankin rails against small business and asks, ‘Why should they have any more protection than medium businesses or large businesses?' I will give you an example. Just before I came in I was on the phone to a furniture salesman in my electorate of Canning. This furniture salesman had been recently affected by an unfair dismissal application, and he had had to spend time and money defending it. He had caught one of his employees stealing from his furniture business. The employee was pretty much caught red-handed, and the employer had witnesses. Also, this employee was reasonably abusive to not only the rest of the staff but also the public he was dealing with. So the employee was dismissed. What did he do? He went off and registered an unfair dismissal case. Let me put into context why small businesses are far more affected by cases like this: in this business there were only four employees, including this gentleman-Ray, the boss-his wife, and two others, one of whom he had dismissed. When you take the boss out of the business and he goes into defend this case, 50 per cent of the work force is out of the business at that time because one has been dismissed and another is in there defending the dismissal. So it is very logical that a small business is far more affected than a large or medium sized business, because proportionally if one person goes then 25 per cent of the business is gone. That is why these people need protection and special consideration: they have special circumstances. I will speak more on that later. Basically, the premise of this bill is that will cover myriad state laws and the jurisdictions that they cover. I will explain why that needs to be done. In a recent Yellow Pages survey, it was found that more than one-third of employees did not know whether they were under a federal award or a state award. That is the confusion that reigns out there in the workplace: employees do not know whether they are under a federal or a state award. Wouldn't one simple umbrella award across Australia cover all that? As happened very successfully in Victoria, it would reduce the costs, time and effort required by the state in that particular jurisdiction of not only running the bureaucracy involved in this but also setting it up. We know why the people opposite in this House oppose this sort of legislation: they have been told to by their union bosses. It is as simple as that. A 4 February press release from the recent Labor Party conference said: Labor has amended its IR policy platform to include the following ... In terms of determining unfair dismissal claims, one of the mantras to come out of the Labor Party conference, which members opposite here would be aware of, is this: It allows unions to make single unfair dismissal applications on behalf of a group of employees following mass dismissals and gives greater emphasis to reinstatement. In other words, they are trying to undo what we are doing. Instead of allowing businesses to address this matter themselves, the unions want to make it harder for small businesses to address the unfair dismissal ramifications that they are tied up in. We know why those opposite cannot support us: they are told not to by their union bosses. We know that at the Labor Party federal conference the majority of hands came from the union movement. We know that most of the members opposite in this House owe their preselection to the Labor Party union factions in their area. As a it result, they are prisoners of them and they have to do their bidding. We know that 78 per cent of members opposite in this House have had some sort of union employment or history and, as a result, they are unrepresentative because less than 19 per cent of the Australian work force belong to a union. How representative is that? Of the people sitting opposite here, 78 per cent have come from some sort of union background and yet 19 per cent of the people in the work force belong to a union. It is just so out of kilter and so unrepresentative, and the people out there realise it is out of whack. As I said, the government are determined to push ahead with this bill to simplify unfair dismissal laws for small business and to extend unfair dismissal laws into the federal system. Also, it is fairer. Since 1996, the government have provided greater flexibility for the work force. We know that the Labor Party, along with its union mates, hinges itself to the award because the award is part of the dinosaur system where everything is set in place. There is no flexibility. There is no ability to make a difference to a small business. I will give you an example, Mr Deputy Speaker. A restaurant in Perth that employs young people on the weekends was required under the old system to pay double time for work on Sundays. If staff worked extra time, the restaurant paid double time and a half and then triple time. An Australian workplace agreement gives these people the flexibility to negotiate a proper workplace arrangement under which they can be employed and the business does not go broke because it opens its doors on a Sunday. What is wrong with that? The same amount of money is being paid. The people being employed there generally work on a casual basis and are happy to work for the same amount of money that they would get on a Monday or a Tuesday. This is the great thing that this government has brought to this country: flexibility in the work force. Flexibility in the work force has made us far more competitive globally. It has made us far more competitive in our ability to deliver services. As a result, a continuing freeing up of the work force in this manner is desirable, and that is what this sort of legislation addresses. The Harding report has estimated, for example, that compliance with unfair dismissal laws costs small to medium sized businesses $1,329 million. Of that $1,329 million, $839 million is for small businesses with fewer than 20 people. In other words, compliance disproportionately affects small business. These unfair dismissal laws have an effect for these reasons. There is usually no dedicated IR person in the business. Take the case, for example, of the furniture business with four people. Who is the dedicated IR person in that business? It is usually the bloke who runs the show. Small businesses do not have the staff, the time or the expertise to represent themselves, so they have to employ a lawyer, which costs money. Compared to large businesses, small businesses spend a large proportion of business earnings defending unfair dismissal claims. This is unreasonable. If you have a business of 200 people, you have a proportional cost in terms of the number of employees you have. It is the economy of scale-that is the phrase I was searching for. This bill proposes amendments in the unfair jurisdiction insofar as it impacts on small businesses. It will extend the qualifying periods for employees of small businesses from three to six months. In other words, you cannot just turn up and then after three months say, ‘I want to go but I will say that I have been unfairly dismissed and on the way out I'll get paid.' Before I came into the chamber I spoke to another businessman who told me that he had a person who had not even turned up for work but who claimed to have been employed by him in a supermarket. Rather than go through the rigmarole of being taken to the commission, he just paid him $100 to get rid of him. That is extortion. In this case, rather than go through all the time and effort of defending himself against somebody who said that they had been hired when they had not, he gave him $100 just to get rid of him. That is sensible. To finish off the story, this person from the furniture business that I spoke about earlier was eventually found not to have been dismissed unlawfully, but there were the costs involved in time and legal expertise. What did this guy do before he left? He said he hurt himself on the job the day before he left, so he is now on workers compensation. That was a couple of months ago. What sort of rorting of the system is that? At the end the day you would have to conclude that the system is out of whack and that it needs some proper management from a bill like this. The bill also gives the Australian Industrial Relations Commission the flexibility to deal with some claims against small businesses without a hearing-in other words, vexatious claims. For the reasons I outlined earlier, it halves the amount of compensation that can be awarded to an employee of a small business. It streamlines the criteria determining whether a dismissal by a small business was unfair and refines the penalty provisions for lawyers and agents who encourage unmeritorious claims against small businesses. In other words, there are penalties and provisions in the bill for vexatious lawyers who go out there hunting for spurious cases to earn themselves a quid and cause mayhem for small business. Let me, as the Western Australian member for Canning, point out why we need to deal with this issue at a federal level. After the change of government in Western Australia, the Gallop Labor government changed the workplace framework from EBAs to employer-employee agreements, EEAs. They were designed to replace the previous system. Currently, there are unbelievably only 114 registered EEAs in place in Western Australia. This was going to be the great new boom for workplace contracts in Western Australia under the Gallop Labor government. The press release that I have in front of me states that up until April last year 62,000 federal Australian Workplace Agreements had been registered in Western Australia alone. I got an update before I came into the chamber today. That figure, which shows how workers have voted with their feet and decided to go to the federal award, now indicates that 93,800 people have gone into fedof eral awards because they do not trust the state based award. Mr Deputy Speaker, I will tell you why they do not trust the state based award. An example I have cited here before-and noone has been able to contradict it-is that the current unfair dismissal claims system in Western Australia does not have a sunset clause. In Western Australia, if a worker goes to the commission and for some reason claims to have been unfairly dismissed, whether he has been stealing, injured, harfor assed or behaved unseemingly at the workplace, there is no sunset clause. Under the previous legislation, there was limited time. Now there is not even a statute of limitations that stops people from making claims some time into the future. You could be a personfor example, one of these people in the furniture business-that employed somebody who then claimed to have been unfairly dismissed. He could come back 10 years later, even when you are out of the business, and claim to have been unfairly dismissed because Labor have put no sunset clause in the unfair dismissal legislation in the state jurisdiction. That is why there needs to be federal coverage in this area-to produce uniform legislation, as has been described before. Myriad laws across Australia create a mess, as occurred at the turn of the century with six different rail tracks in the states. That is what the Labor Party would take us back to by opposing this legislation. They want to see us go back to the mess and the confrontation of the court based system rather than give the Australian Industrial Relations Commission the authority to deal with this expeditiously and fairly. This parliament has an opportunity to do something about workers and their entitlements and see that they get a job. The biggest employer of people in this country is small business, yet legislation designed to give small business a fair go is being opposed by the Labor Party. I find it absolutely out of whack. The Labor Party cannot support this bill because we know that some members in this House have been told that if they do not oppose this sort of legislation their preselections will be in doubt. I believe that even the member for Rankin was threatened with that some time ago. It is on the public record that, if you oppose your union boss's mantras, you have a good chance of losing your preselection. We know why they are held prisoner on these details. This legislation is designed to protect the workers because it protects their jobs in small business. For some reason the Labor Party and the unions in this country think that small businesses are rich. Many small businesses are run on a huge overdraft. Many small businesses pay their employees' wages by their Bankcard or Visa card because they are running on such a short credit base. They are putting their necks on the line in running a business and their reward is that they do not get any protection and they expose themselves to bankruptcy and quite often vexatious claims in court. I urge this House to get behind legislation that will support small business. It is the only opportunity we have to bring down the unemployment rate, particularly in the area of youth unemployment in small business. We have the opportunity to do that here today. I urge the Senate, particularly the Democrat senators, to support this legislation. The only hope for young workers and for there to be a saviour of small business in this country will be a pragmatic approach by the Democrat senators in the Senate. The Labor Party, as we have been told by the member for Rankin, will continually oppose legislation on workplace relations put up by this government. They have stated that they will oppose everything that the previous Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Mr Tony Abbott, put up and they are doing the same with the current minister, Kevin Andrews. They are refuseniks. They have decided they will oppose any decent legislation to protect business in this country. There is some sort of them-and-us envy or class warfare. We want to see that stopped, and this legislation is designed to do that.",82
121,Ms GRIERSON,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"It is good to be back in the people's house this week, but I must say that when I saw the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002 [No. 2] I thought I was suffering a severe case of deja vu. Haven't we seen this before? Listening to the debate, it seems that, yes, we have seen it in eight different guises-eight different forms of legislation about termination of employment-and something like 18 debates, according to the previous speaker, the member for Canning. Even the Prime Minister and the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations cannot disguise what this legislation really is: an indication of a rather tired and monotonous government, out of touch with the real issues concerning working Australians and particularly those who work in or operate, as an employer, a small business. This legislation has a very long history and, for the sake of the Australian taxpayers who are paying us to repeat this task over and over again, we should revisit some of that history. This bill is identical to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002, which was defeated in the Senate in August 2003. Yet it is now back, ‘revised' but exactly the same. It is obviously reintroduced with a view to adding to what the member for Rankin describes as ‘the dirty dozen'-those double dissolution triggers on unfair dismissal laws that sit there in the Senate just waiting for Prime Minister to activate at an election. Some things never change from a government that cannot learn any new dogwhistling tricks. The original bill was referred to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee, and they considered it in some detail. After that inquiry it was reviewed again and Labor rejected the original bill in its entirety. The Senate rejected that bill in its entirety and defeated the legislation in August 2003. How preposterous it must seem to the Australian public that, after the Senate committee reported on the bill and it was defeated, it is now reintroduced three months later, identical and equally flawed. It is not likely that it will be supported this time in the Senate. There certainly are no new arguments for the Senate to support it. I think it is important to note that this aims to expand the unfair dismissal jurisdiction of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to all constitutional corporations. This would result in the Commonwealth taking over 85 per cent of the states' unfair dismissal systems. It seems quite greedy if it is not something agreed to by state and federal governments. The bill also proposes changes to the processing of unfair dismissal claims, altering eligibility and altering the available remedies-and, I should say, in most cases reducing those and making it more difficult for unfairly dismissed workers to put their case. That is particularly so now for small business employees. The government claims this bill makes a constructive move towards a unified and simplified system of workplace relations regulation, but in reality it is just a grab for power, coupled with-as we have got so used to over the last 7½ years-a reduction in workers' protections and workers' rights. I the think we would all agree that we would love to see a unified and simplified system of workplace relations. There is nothing like certainty and consistency to encourage prosperity, economic growth and harmonious workplaces, but this legislation certainly has not been the result of any negotiation or conciliation process. It is not a move towards a unified and simplified system that has resulted from any discussions. That is just the government's claim-another ambit claim. This bill is flawed policy, and overall it just serves to weaken protection for workers against unfair dismissal. The bill also changes aspects of the current federal unfair dismissal system. It reduces the amount of compensation that can be awarded to an unfairly dismissed employee of a small business-that is, a business with fewer than 20 employees. Now it is reduced from 26 weeks compensation to 13 weeks compensation. bill That is not very much when you are seeking new employment. The bill also extends to six months the qualifying period of employment before you can actually put an unfair dismissal action. Poor practice in a workplace can happen whether you have been there three months, six months or 10 years. Those sorts of situations often arise unpredictably. The bill also narrows the scope for an employee who has been made redundant by his or her employer to mount an unfair dismissal action. I have some examples from my own electorate of Newcastle. In one example, the casual employment of some part-time employees was terminated, and now we see in the same business 14 Hungarian guest workers taking over those jobs. We need to look at legislation that protects Australian jobs from those sorts of measures. Certainly in that case we have no assurance that there was a skills shortage. When people put off casual workers and then the next week take on guest workers, you can see how employees might in some cases question employers' sincerity about their employment practices. This legislation also reduces the amount of back pay available where reinstatement is ordered by the Industrial Relations Commission. If an employee has been put off and sustains substantial economic loss, they certainly should have that loss compensated, but the amount has been reduced in this legislation. So the bill effectively creates two classes of employees: those who work for small business and those in the larger-and more privileged, perhaps-employment sectors. Whilst Labor acknowledges that small business does have particular characteristics which do affect employment practices, there has never been a strong case made for the proposition that employees in the small ness sector should possess fewer rights and fewer legal safeguards than people who work in other employment sectors. Yet this is what this bill seeks to do. Of course, Australians would say that we do believe in a fair go for everybody. There should be opportunity for all and there certainly should be responsibilto ity from all. Certainly, the size of an employer's work force should not change those entitlements and rights. Labor does believe that, for an employee who is dismissed, the size should not be the determining factor. If you are dismissed, it does not really matter what size the business is-you face the same difficulties as someone who loses their job in a larger firm. You have the same emotional responses, ranging from confusion to despair and the same financial imperatives, from financial uncertainty to extreme financial hardship. The same problems are experienced by all in the search for new employment-perhaps a stigma or a black mark against the worker's name which may act as a barrier against them finding any other employment. To argue that small business needs different legislation regarding dismissal is certainly to argue for an inequality of rights. That is not the Australian way, but it is certainly the Howard government's way. The government claims that it seeks more balance in the legislation than currently exists. But, in arguing for differential legal rights for employees, it will certainly achieve the opposite outcome-a serious imbalance. The bill is also based on the false perception that the main impediment to increasing employment in small business is that the employers fear current unfair dismissal laws. That certainly does not seem to be the case. My electorate, the electorate of Newcastle, is one where there are particularly large numbers of small businesses and, in our case, they are frequently microbusinesses. Many busi- people facing unemployment took it upon themselves to create their own jobs as contractors, with perhaps one or two family members often being employed. That is not good practice for recruitment, perhaps, or for employment, and certainly problems can and do arise. But we admire the fact that they had help create their own jobs, given the lack of any government policy to assist regions with job creation. We really do feel for those people, because they have often saved governments a lot of money by getting off their backsides and finding a way to create their own businesses with very little support, very little training, very little education on how to be an employer, how to recruit, how to dismiss and what the laws say. Often, of course, they have also had minimal time to do the administrative paperwork for GST and BAS requirements. The Senate references committee inquiry into small business employment found that the preoccupations of small businesses differed very little from those of large and medium businesses. Their major interests were the business cycle-the ups and downs of seasonal factors to their demand and supply; taxation regulations, obviously; compliance requirements for the GST; and general economic conditions. At the moment I guess they are much more interested in seeing what is going to happen with rising interest rates on those mortgage and loan commitments that the member for Canning spoke about. That would be perhaps the most significant issue to them. Interest rates going up will certainly cut into what is already a more marginal cash flow in most small businesses. In fact, the Senate references committee inquiry found that small business employs to the extent that business levels and business growth strategies determine. It is about demand and supply and market influences. The Senate committee's findings provide some insight into the relative importance of unfair dismissal laws to small business. They found as follows: Consistent with survey rankings of small business concerns, unfair dismissal did not arise as issue during the inquiry ... That is a surprise. I wonder why we have been here for 18 different debates on this! other issues such as the need for improved business management ... and assistance with thatproblems with recruiting suitable employees, the compliance burden associated with the New Tax System, and the total framework of employment obligations were far more prominent. Where unfair dismissal laws were raised as a concern, the main issues were a lack of understanding in how to dismiss staff consistent with the law, the and complexity of the current process for determining claims and the uncertainty of outcomes. So it seems that small businesses have been asked and their responses have been loud and clear. They would prefer help in their recruitment and employment practices and some understanding of dismissal legislation rather than just having these sorts of regulations imposed. The major new element in both the original bill and this current bill is the use of the corporations power-section 51(xx) of the Constitution-to override state legislation. It has been recognised for some time that the use of the corporations power to underpin industrial relations laws presents certain difficulties, most obviously that around 20 per cent of employees cannot be covered because they are not employed by constitutional corporations. This bill leaves a small but significant group of workers beyond its ambit anyway and creates legal complications in cases where current state legislation covers regulatory matters affecting unfair dismissal. It does not seem to have been very well thought out, in fact. It is not surprising that the states are affronted by this attempt to override their properly functioning laws that they have properly enacted in their state parliaments. The states are obviously opposed to any ata major tempt by the Commonwealth to make this overriding legislation without consultation with them, and their attempts to graft federal laws onto state systems. But this government does not really understand how to consult with states, choosing instead to dictate and impose its own political agenda. The same old story applies in this policy development by the government as it has in all of its policy developments-find someone else to blame, create a conflict wherever possible and make sure to go for a win-lose situation. Someone wins but the rest-and usually costs Australian people-lose, and the most disadvantaged ones always lose most. The government and its mates win and working people and their unions certainly lose. The bill shows all of the signs of a failure to deal cooperatively with the states, but it also shows that the complexities and confusions that the government alleges arise from having conflicting and overlapping jurisdictions would actually be made even worse if this bill were to pass. In New South Wales, the state I am a resident of, the New South Wales government has strongly opposed this bill and has canvassed the possibility of the provisions being challenged in the High Court should this bill become law. Likewise, the governments of Queensland and Western Australia have strongly opposed the use of the Corporations Law for industrial relations purposes. It is a very poor precedent. Indeed, no states at all support the passage of this bill. The most glaring omission from this bill is the exclusion of many workers who have access to a remedy for unfair dismissal from being able to challenge their dismissal. This is a limitation in the use of the corporations power which does not appear to concern the government. Exclusions under federal laws apply more widely than under most state laws, and many workers will be effectively deprived of a right to challenge their dismissal. I quote from the submission of Professor Stewart to the Senate committee, who said: ... ‘the percentage of employees covered by Federal unfair dismissal provisions should rise about 50 per cent to about 85 per cent'. Many of these employees would be ‘covered', yes, but only to the extent of denying them a remedy against unfair dismissal! The government's proposal to overcome the anomaly is that the states should transfer their powers to enable the Commonwealth government to cover the field by using the corporations power. Such a move would require a degree of compromise which is unlikely given the lack of consultation that has marked Commonwealth-state relations over the last 7½ years in the field of industrial relations. It is important to note that the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has acknowledged the importance of governments adopting a cooperative approach to the issue of industrial relations laws. But this government generally does not work from a cooperative base at all. Imposing these federal awards by stealth and bullying rather than by conciliation and negotiation indicates a lack of any genuine bargaining by this government. It also fails to acknowledge the genuine good faith extended by the union movement in the early nineties to simplify union structures and take on the challenges of reform to awards and bargaining as a first step in tackling some of the overlap, duplication and inconsistencies that did exist. Rightfully, Labor opposes this legislation and will continue to oppose this legislation no matter what form it comes to us in. Any attempt by this government to use legislation to weaken protection for workers against unfair dismissal and to take over state unfair dismissal systems against their willhaving made no effort to attempt cooperation-will be resisted. I do support the member for Rankin's amendment. Last week I was very privileged to have the shadow minister for workplace relations and for the public service visit my electorate. In that visit, he held discussions from with community members, trade union organisers and their trades hall council, the CEO of the Hunter Business Chamber, representatives of the northern branch of the Industrial Relations Society of New South Wales, and employers. During those discussions, not one mention was made of unfair dismissal legislation. However, they were very interested in discussing Labor's approach to industrial relations and the platform put forward successfully at our national conference. They were certainly looking for some spirit of cooperation. They know that conciliation is the successful way. They know that some certainty applies if there is genuine bargaining. They were very interested in a platform that we have put forward that promotes productive, harmonious and family friendly workplaces where the benefits are fairly shared. So when are we going to see from this government some policies that assist small business-that assist them with recruitment practices; with performance review processes; with training; with implementing family friendly work practices; with conflict resolution; and with conciliation within the workplace? When are we going to see a return to genuine bargaining and a fair go for all? The member for Rankin mentioned that one of the strong points of our policy platform was that of totally moving away from AWAs. There is an imbalance of power in AWAs. It certainly does undermine awards that provide protection and a quality of work and life that Australians should expect and have won through hard processes. Equal pay for women was introduced the year before my employment started. I can remember that that was only won through the work of the union movement, and I praise them for it. Those awards have been hard won and they certainly do provide some protection, some equality and some spirit of equity for workers. In conclusion, this bill does reduce the level of protection available to employees. It overrides state laws without the agreement of states and it certainly pursues the Prime Minwell ister's dream of pitting powerless individual employees against powerful employers. I agree with the member for Rankin that that is a race to the bottom. Employment practices and the dignity of work deserve much better legislation than this.",86
122,Mr TICEHURST,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Dobell) (6.49 p.m.)I rise today to support the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. An effective, fair and tailored workplace relations system is so important to a vastly growing region like my electorate of Dobell on the New South Wales Central Coast. Job creation is a key issue. With labour market figures showing a steady increase in unemployment figures for Gosford and Wyong since September 2002, a workplace relations system that contributes positively to the social and economic well-being of our community is becoming more and more urgent. With statistics showing that more than 70 per cent of all jobs are created by small business, I am going to discuss the amendments to the unfair dismissal bill as they impact on small business. Unfair dismissal laws place a heavy burden on the thousands of employers who can create new jobs, particularly in small and medium enterprises. A study by the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research shows that the cost to small and medium sized businesses of complying with unfair dismissal laws is at least $1.3 billion a year, and these laws have played a part in the loss of over 77,000 jobs from small and medium businesses. This study amply justifies the government's continued determination to exempt small business from the reach of unfair dismissal laws and justifies the provisions in this bill to make these laws less onerous for business and less damaging to job creation. As a small businessman, I understand that without good staff a business does not run at all. I also understand how the possibility of an unfair dismissal claim can deter business owners from appointing full-time staff. A business owner would not invoke legislation to remove a member of staff who was doing a good job. However, the same business owner may give careful consideration to employing people because of the ramifications of the current law. In my electorate of Dobell, and indeed nationally, there has been an alarming increase in the employment of casual workers as opposed to permanent employees. Casual workers have no job security and no access to paid leave or holiday leave. They are not guaranteed an income and they have little opportunity to borrow money for a house or even a car. After six months employers tend to put people on a call-up system, so they do not even know when they are working from one day to the next. Employment insecurity can be linked to serious social problems. For small business, this bill extends the standard qualifying period for employees' access to unfair dismissal provisions from three to six months. This is a more appropriate balance between the interests of employers and those of employees. The bill allows the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to deal with some claims ‘on the papers'-that is, without a hearing-and halves the amount of compensation that can be awarded to an employee. The bill also streamlines the criteria for determining whether a dismissal by a small business employer was unfair and requires the commission to consider the size of the employer's business in determining an appropriate remedy. Finally, the bill refines the penalty provisions for lawyers and agents who encourage unmeritorious claims. The measures in this bill to assist small business will have effect of reducing financial costs, increasing certainty of outcomes and resolving claims more quickly, and will achieve a better balance between the interests of employers and employees without impeding job creation. It must be stressed that unfair dismissal laws have a greater impact on small business for a variety of reasons. Firstly, there is no dedicated HR manager or specialist staff with expertise in this area. The owner usually manages employment relationships himself. Secondly, small businesses do not have the staff, time or expertise to represent themselves in unfair dismissal proceedings. They will often have to engage external representation, which is an additional cost burden to the business. Also, compared to larger businesses, small businesses spend a large proportion of business earnings in defending an unfair dismissal claim, due to the time and costs associated with the employer preparing for and attending proceedings. The owner may even have to close the business in order to attend. A lot of the time a small business does not have sufficient funds to run legal battles, so it is forced to settle out of court. This can cost a business $10,000, $20,000 or $50,000, which is more than some businesses make in profit for a year. Not surprisingly, the Labor Party continues to refuse to recognise the costs imposed on small business by unfair dismissal laws. The Labor Party opposes the change in the bill to assist small business on the basis that the size of the business should not be a determinant in an unfair dismissal claim and that to argue otherwise is to argue for an inequality of rights. This view takes no account of the circumstances of small business. If the Labor Party had any small businesspeople on its side of the House, rather than ex-lawyers, ex-staffers and ex-union bosses, this vital piece of legislation would have been implethe mented long ago. In Labor's view, it is not necessary to be unfairly dismissed in order to make an unfair dismissal claim. The reforms in this bill which assist small business should be viewed in this light. In conclusion, small businesses need greater flexibility because they do not have the same access to financial and human resources as a larger business and unplanned expenses can threaten the viability of the business and the jobs of those working in that business. I am proud to be part of a government that continues to demonstrate an ongoing commitment to easing the burden that the current workplace relations system presents for small business. I now urge members opposite to support this important legislative step towards a single and efficient workplace relations system that will foster rather than hinder job creation. We just heard the member for Newcastle claim that there was no real assistance given by this government. This government introduced Work for the Dole. Work for the Dole is one of the most successful programs in raising the skills of and providing additional training and actual on-the-job skills access for people who are unemployed. We also have business training under the NEIS program-the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme. This scheme assists people to set up and run their own business. It is unfortunate that Labor stands for big government, big unions and big business. We have seen the effect in what happened in New South Wales recently, where we have a Labor government imposing their will on councils. The councils did not want to amalgamate, so the state government just summarily dismissed them and now they have put in administrators to achieve their aim. This is what we see as Labor's new democracy. We just cannot afford to have Labor state and federal governments along with Labor controlling local councils.",91
123,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"This matter is a very important one. The member for Dobell nicely read a prepared speech that went to some of the issues. Before I go to the substantive issues in relation to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002 [No. 2], I would just like to respond to the comments that the member for Dobell made about councils. I do not know how that was related to this matter, but if he wants to draw a comparison with the way in which Labor deals with councils he can have a look at what happened about 10 years ago. The Victorian government, led by the then Premier, Jeff Kennett, sacked about 900 councillors over a period of time, appointed hand-picked commissioners and effectively removed the third tier of a democratic government in that state. So I think it is rather a cheap shot if he is trying to argue that the government or the Liberal Party has a better way to handle change in local government. I also think the member for Dobell should look at the work that was commissioned and undertaken by the then Labor government in areas of labour programs and, in particular, compare and contrast the benefits that arose out of the Working Nation program. In that program not only was there a genuine training component for people who were in need of assistance to get full employment but also the retention rate of those people who went through the program in the late eighties and early nineties was far in excess of that occurring now under the Work for the Dole scheme. I notice that the Labor leader has indicated that we will be looking at strengthening the training provisions of any labour market program because they are sadly lacking in the government's Work for the Dole scheme, where indeed they do not provide for any genuine training of people who are in need of not only employment but also many skills that will provide them with the opportunity to find permanent work. This bill is one that we cannot support. I accept that small business is a very important part of our community. It is a very large sector. It employs many Australians-and that is the reason I could not support this bill. There is a larger group than the small business community, and that is the small business community's employees. If it is true that a small business employer employs such a high proportion of the Australian work force then, if this government were even-handed in the way it applied industrial relations laws, it would look not only to the concerns of the employers in that sector, which I think is a decent thing to do, but to the employees of that sector as well. There is no even-handed application in relation to this bill. There give and take where, whether you be an employer or an employee in the small business community, you will have to accept some concessions. This is a one-way attack upon employees in the small business community. Not only is it an attack on the employees of the small business community; it also puts at risk those small business employers who do the right thing, who support the notion of a person being able to take a grievance to a third party if they claim to have been wrongfully treated. Whether this be in employment areas or other areas, it seems to me a common element of a democracy that the rights of natural justice would be available to people. What the government is seeking to do in a broader sense is to undermine the notion of the rights of natural justice-the right to be heard, the right for someone's case to be heard before a third party such as a tribunal-and I do not see any particularly good reason for it, other than that it is an attempt to diminish the entitlements of employees who just so happen to find themselves in an organisation where there are fewer than 20 employees. It also seems rather strange that you can have two companies-one that employs 20 people and the other, across the road, that employs 19-which might be competing against each other, but the one that employs 19 can dismiss employees without regard to the merits of the particular matter. I suppose that that would therefore compel those employers that have 20 employees or moreparticularly those organisations whose staff number just above the 19 mark, just around that range-to consider removing employees so they find themselves with the capacity to also terminate employees, whether fairly or not. I think that is something this government has to properly account for. The other thing I think this government has not successfully done in this debate on is no the many, many occasions it has taken place is to explain evidentially, in any decent way, why there is a nexus between employment growth and removing entitlements to unfair dismissal claims. There has been no quantifiable evidence in this place other than some spurious references to 50,000 jobs that would arise if we were to remove entitlements. Even if there were a possibility of any net gain in employment, it seems rather a cruel irony that we would have to create a system that would be inequitable for those people employed in an organisation of 19 or fewer, who would have fewer rights compared to those in an organisation with 20 employees and above. It would be unfair that we had to create a system of inequity and unfairness and set up two systems in order to grow employment in this nation. It seems to me a very strange way to go about increasing jobs-if indeed that assertion could ever be proven. But to date, other than some spurious quotes amongst some in the small business community, I have yet to see evidence that has convinced me that that is a genuine proposition. It has just been the mantra of this government in relation to this matter. This government has worked on this basis in many areas: if you say it often enough, it becomes true. That is the MO of this government. If you keep saying something that is not proven or in some cases not true, it will become true in the minds of the majority of Australians. I do not think there has been any decent argument put to convince the community at large that you should treat people in an inequitable way and in a way that would deny them rights and recourse to a third party if they were unfairly dealt with. There are very few things more important than a person's employment. Firstly, these days permanent employment is becoming more difficult to find. I think we are all ing to find answers as to how we deal with having a flexible work force while providing for the critical needs of families and employees and managing the mix between work and family. Having a job is firstly about income and providing the wherewithal for you and your family. Having a job is tied to your selfesteem. If you therefore attach that to all ployees in this country, we are talking about a very significant issue that goes beyond the economic. Primarily, it is an economic concern-it is for me and, whilst I do not agree with the contentions of much that has been said by those on the other side, it is for them and others involved in this debate. I do not accept the assertions made in relation to the nexus between reducing people's entitlements and increasing employment but at least the argument has been advanced that it is an economic issue-and, of course, it is. For those employees, of which there are a greater number than there are small businesses by virtue of the very fact that there will always be more employees than employers, it seems to me that they deserve more than what is being put. They deserve a government that considers the effect of them losing their employment, both in the economic sense and in the social sense. I think that has not been considered. I cannot recall many bills that have come into this place in this term that have shown any respect for the Australian work force. I understand that the government wants to project the idea that it represents small business. I understand it wants to run those arguments so they can resonate throughout the community, and I know there are small businesses that would indeed subscribe to this government's views-not all, but some-and I accept that as well. But I do not think it is fair that the government has ignored all of the try- employees that work in this sector-who of course far outweigh the number of employers in the sector. I also do not think that small business operators are going to forget that this government turned them all into tax collectors. By introducing the goods and services tax, this government effectively made small business employers tax collectors. A em- very prescriptive process was laid upon them to collect that tax. When I speak to businesses in my community I hear concerns about the prescriptive nature of the business activity statements, particularly from those businesses that are small and do not have the wherewithal to deal with the increasing paperwork in the area. No real attention has been paid to that issue. Whilst the minister and indeed members of the government like to talk about what they would do if they could only remove the rights of natural justice of employees in organisations of fewer than 20 employees, they do not explain to the small business operator what they are going to do to remove those prescriptive provisions, particularly in terms of how small business organisations have to deal with the business activity statements. Small business operators have effectively been turned into tax collectors. I do not think many small business people will have forgotten that this government did that, and I think that still resonates. I get that feedback when talking to people in my electorate. I will turn to some of the specifics of the bill. I have outlined the nub of the issues. We are fundamentally concerned about this bill. We accept that the Democrats were proposing amendments to the former bill that was similar to this one. We also accept that those amendments were proposed because the Democrats support one unified industrial relations system. However, we think that this bill is so fundamentally flawed that Labor cannot support it at all. In particular, we not support the reduction in the amount of compensation, from 26 weeks pay to 13 weeks pay, that can be awarded to unfairly dismissed employees of a small business; we do not support the extension of the qualifying period of employment, from three to six months, before an unfair dismissal action can be brought by an employee of a small business; we do not support narrowing the scope for an employee made redundant by their employer to mount an unfair dismissal action; and we do not accept that you should be able to reduce the amount of back pay available, where reinstatement is ordered for an employee who has mitigated their loss, by requiring the Industrial Relations Commission to take into account income earned from other employment. They are some of the specific concerns we have in relation to this bill. But that is against the backdrop of a government that only has the work force of this nation in its sights when it comes to workplace change. There is no even-handed approach being applied. It is constantly attackis ing the work force. We have seen it in the way in which there have been efforts to change the powers of the commission to prevent the lowest paid in this country from getwork ting a national wage increase in certain circumstances. We have seen it in the way in which this government has removed powers of the commission to ensure parties bargain in good faith. We have seen it with the introduction of the Workplace Relations Act in the first term of this government and the removal of allowable matters in awards. I recall earlier in this debate that the member for Canning described the award system as a dinosaur. The award system has worked very well for a century under conservative and Labor governments. Indeed, the change to allow the award system to evolve into a workplace system was introdo duced by a Labor government. So it is not that we do not support flexibility in the workplace; we want to see a work force at the workplace that is engaged with their employer in negotiating improvements for themselves, for the workplace and for the employer. We accept that there are some mutual benefits in ensuring that those changes occur in the workplace and that is why we introduced, before 1996, enabling laws that allowed for workplace flexibility, but we did so under a system that would protect the most vulnerable. Labor is about ensuring flexibility and the capacity for people to bargain but allowing for unions to be recognised in workplaces and ensuring that the minimum award rate and conditions are protected-something of course that this government over the last eight years has diminished, because of its enmity and its ideological predisposition to Australian working families. It wants to bash unions, and I can understand that it may not be the best friends of unions-it probably does not swap Christmas cards. But the fact we know that when you go after unions you go after Australian working families because it is, in most instances, employee organisations that represent the interests of the force in this nation. In the same way, it is the employer organisations that represent the interests of employers. So to target one particular group over another, I think, reveals that this government is antiworker. The Australian work force is the most important element in our economy; it is the driving force of our economy. The Australian work force should be commended before all others for the state of our economy. Of course we should laud the managers who are innovative and have done the right thing, but let us start first and foremost by saying that the productive elements of this society start with the work force-Australian working families, the many millions of whom work hard. In most cases now, where there are two parents in a family, both will work full time-if not full time, there is a situation where one parent will work part time and one will work full time. They are increasingly trying to deal with the changes in society and with the balance between work and family, which we have not really got right at the moment. They are the ones we have to consider first and foremost, in my view. They have been disregarded by a government that has always had it in for the Australian work force. I know that the government likes to cite the fact that many of us belong to or have worked for unions. I am proudly associated with my role as a union official in my former career. But if there were a union for corporate lawyers, that union would be over the other side. There are 20 or so corporate lawyers on the government front bench-the corporate lawyers' union is over there-so I suppose it is understandable that they want to represent big business and not have any regard for the ordinary punter in the street. That is coming through very clearly in this bill. I support the amendment that has been moved by the shadow minister and, indeed, I support the comments made by the member for Newcastle. I oppose this bill because fundamentally, at its heart, it is about tearing away the entitlements of hard-working Australian families. I do not think the Australian work force deserves that and at election time the government will find out that Australians know that is a fact. (Time expired)",93
124,Mr HARTSUYKER,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I rise in the House tonight to speak on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. The coalition made a number of commitments about unfair dismissal laws and ongoing workplace relations reforms to the Australian people and to the small business community in the lead-up to the 2001 election. The measures in this bill are part of the deliverance of those commitments to the Australian community. Unfortunately the opposition parties in the Senate rejected this bill last year, but we have a responsibility to Australian business and the Australian community to push on with the commitments we have made, to push on with the stance that the community endorsed and to pass this legislation. Unfair dismissal laws are of particular concern because of the huge burden they place on small and medium sized businesses. The Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research looked into the regime of state and federal unfair dismissal laws and found that the regime is costing some 77,000 jobs, and that is why we must stay determined in this matter. There is a maze of competing state and federal laws, and this bill proposes to bring more employees under federal jurisdiction and within the Workplace Relations Act of 1996. It will limit the scope for unfair dismissal laws to be used to avoid ineligibility under federal law. The bill simplifies matters for both employers and employees. It extends the standard qualifying period for employees to six months to access unfair dismissal provisions. It provides for matters to be dealt with ‘on the papers' by the Industrial Relations Commission, avoiding costly and time consuming hearings. The bill also proposes to have the amount of compensation which is available and it streamlines the criteria for determining whether a dismissal is unfair. It will refine penalties for lawyers and agents who encourage unmeritorious claims. These measures will require any conduct on the part of an employee which contributed to the dismissal to be taken into consideration when determining compensation. The new provisions will limit claims in respect of the ters where the employer no longer has work for an employee, and the bill requires the commission to consider any income earned by an employee since dismissal where that employee is to be reinstated. The commission will also be required to look at whether the safety and welfare-which are very important factors-of other employees were a factor in the dismissal. The new provisions will also put emphasis on reinstatement as the primary remedy in a finding that a dismissal was unfair. This bill is very important for our economy when we consider the employment opportunities that would be potentially available to the unemployed, the potential for small business to create jobs and the continued prosperity of our nation. If we are to ate an environment which encourages Australian business to employ more people then it is essential that we address some of the major impediments which discourage business men and women from hiring staff. Many in the business community believe that the biggest single issue holding businesses back from employing more staff is the current unfair dismissal regime, and this has been highlighted by an Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry issues paper. There are genuine concerns that the financial cost associated with hiring additional staff is simply not worth the risk when all legislation tends to side with the employee. This is clearly understandable when you hear of employees who have, for instance, stolen from a business, win an unfair dismissal case, and then get an unfair dismissal payout. Similarly, there are those in the community who fail to fulfil the duties and responsibiliing ties required of them and then manipulate unfair dismissal laws to obtain as much benefit as they can-as much money as they can, in some cases-from their employer. Inevitably this has taken its toll, to the extent mat- that the tendency for employers to put on more staff has been affected. It is essential that we put the balance back between employees and employers, and this bill attempts to set out a fairer framework for that to occur. I know there are many unemployed people who are waiting for the opportunity to obtain work-waiting for some form of work, be it seasonal work or part-time work-but they are being held back because many small businesses are just not game to put on employees. They are concerned that if they put on a new staff member they may be faced with an unfair dismissal claim. This bill aims to break down some of those barriers, give businesses more confidence to hire employees and create more jobs. There are, for excreample, certain employees who will no longer fall under the unfair dismissal legislation. Under this bill, employees engaged for a specific time or specific task, employees who are on probation, casual employees and those engaged for short periods, trainees and others under certain arrangements will not come under the legislation. The unfair dismissal rules will no longer operate for them. Many of my parliamentary colleagues on the opposition benches seem to believe that this will impact on the rights of some employees. I will lay to rest some of the fallacies that follow that argument. It is a most the naive interpretation by Labor to believe that a small business person-or any business person, for that matter-would wish to sack an employee just on a whim because every businessman knows that the success of their firm is largely dependent on the quality and experience of their work force and the trainthey put in. Businesses spend vast amounts of money on training, and there is no commercial sense in spending a huge amount of money training staff only to dismiss them on an unfair basis. Let us face it: commercial reality dictates that employers will only dismiss employees when there is a just or reasonable cause. It is, I am sure, a very rare occurrence where an employee is dismissed purely out of spite. It makes no commercial sense and it is certainly not good business practice. Since the coalition government was elected in 1996, we have been committed to reforming the unfair dismissal laws. To date, we have introduced more flexibility into the workplace. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development acknowledged this in its assessment of the economic success which Australia has enjoyed in recent years. I quote from the OECD report: The process so far of reforming Australia's plex industrial relations system has had profound effects on many industries. It has been an tant factor in reducing labour inefficiencies increasing flexibility of work conditions. hancing the incentives for more efficient work and management, it has helped firms to move closer to best practice. The OECD is saying that the changes the coalition has implemented have seen wages rise in real terms, profits increase and the number of employees increase. It is a good news story. The legal restrictions which burdened businesses during the Hawke and Keating years have been replaced by a more common sense approach which has involved workers and managers getting on with the job together. But while Australians are reaping the benefits of these changes there still remain legal restrictions which are prohibitive to business, particularly small business. The research I noted earlier indicated the huge financial cost of our unfair dismissal laws to small and medium size businesses. Not only is there a very great financial cost but also there is a significant impact on jobs. I know that creating jobs has never been a priority for the Labor Party. In fact, in 1992 when interest rates were crippling small businesses right across the nation, the Labor Party's policies saw unemployment surge to 10.9 per cent. The coalition has worked tirelessly to bring that rate down. The coalition has worked tirelessly to put the settings in place that allow businesses to thrive and to prosper and therefore increase the level of employment. This bill is part of that framework by providing the certainty that small business needs that they will not be burdened by unfair dismissal claims. Seven years and one million new jobs later, the coalition has been able to reduce unemployment from 10.9 per cent to less than six per cent. Whilst in my electorate of Cowper, a coastal seat, we still have a lot of com- work to do in the area of unemployment, the trend is clearly down. A quick snapshot of imporunemployment statistics paints a very clear and picture. Under the Labor government in June By en1994, Coffs Harbour's unemployment rate was sitting at around 18 per cent, Bellingen's 20.3 per cent, the Nambucca Valley's almost 18 per cent and in the area of Maclean the rate was 17.2 per cent. The latest figures released by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations show that Coffs Harbour's unemployment rate has dropped from around 18 per cent to 7.5 per cent, Bellingen's from 20.3 per cent to 9.4 per cent, the Nambucca Valley's from 17.8 per cent to 11.5 per cent and in Maclean unemployment is down from 17.2 per cent to eight per cent. The trend is what is important there, not the actual figures. We have had a very strong downward trend in unemployment, and this reflects some of the excellent economic policies of this government. We still need to work hard on trying to find employment for all those who seek employment, and this government is certainly committed to that. But the trend is excellent. I am also concerned that the Labor Party does not seem to be serious about helping Australians into work. If it were serious about that, it would be supporting our legislation and it would be attempting to help us remove the impediments for employers to employ people. But, no, the Labor Party continues to baulk at the opportunity to free up the job market. It continues to baulk at the opportunity to provide more employment for people. It is an absolute misnomer to suggest that the Labor Party is the champion of the worker. It is more accurate to say that it is the champion of the union movement. It is not committed to assisting small business to create more jobs. That is why our nation's small businesses are still somewhat hamstrung by these unfair dismissal laws. The Labor Party has no regard for the long hours that small business people put in and nancial risks that small business people take-the sleepless nights they endure when they are worrying about their business and trying to keep their business competitive very competitive business environment. They have to deal with a number of issues, one of which is these ridiculous unfair dismissal laws as they currently sit. As I said earlier, the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research indicated that unfair dismissal laws have a very heavy cost in terms of jobs. The figure that they place on it is around 77,000 jobs77,000 people missing out on the opportunity for a job because of unfair dismissal legislaunions tion-and some 60,000 of those 77,000 jobs are jobs that are not occurring in small business. Why is that? It is because small business knows it is not worth the cost and the heartache of a potential unfair dismissal claim. We need to clear the decks on that. We need to get off the back of small business. We need to make the environment a little easier for small business. I wish the Labor Party would take the time to speak with some of those small business operators and look them in the eye and say why they refuse to pass our unfair dismissal legislation. The real pain is being felt by the unemployed-those who are being denied the opportunity to work because of the need for change in the area of unfair dismissal legislation. That is a very important fact. People who are looking for part-time work and casual work are the very ones we need to help to get started on the road back to employment. I believe unfair dismissal legislation hits very much hardest the casual and the part-time sector. A fair and balanced approach to unfair dismissal laws is a win-win for everyone. Extra staff eases the burden on small business proprietors, an unemployed person starts earning a wage and overall dependence on the taxpayer is reduced. It is not rocket the fi- science; it is simple common sense. If the Labor party were fair dinkum about helping small business and fair dinkum about creating more jobs, they would join with the in a government and pass this unfair dismissal legislation. Since 1996, the coalition has attempted some 22 times to pass into law a small business exemption in order to stimulate the employment market, and each time the ALP have voted against the legislation. The opposition have had 22 opportunities to create tens of thousands of jobs but have ignored the unemployed, the demands of small business and the demands of the community. I think it is about time the opposition and got on board in the interests of workers. I have noted in the House before that it has been the coalition's promise to reform the unfair dismissal legislation. Unfair dismissal legislation is an issue which I am very passionate about. I am also very passionate about creating jobs in my electorate and for the nation generally. We in The Nationals are very focused on regional Australia and on small business. Regional Australia has a far greater dependency on small business than have metropolitan centres. So the impact of unfair dismissal legislation on small business is of vital importance to regional and rural areas. We have seen with the free trade agreement that the new glossy member for Werriwa is nothing but the same old Labor-just the same old Labor. I hope that he shows his new shiny credentials as a new-age leader and joins with us in passing this legislation. commend the bill to the House.",97
125,Mrs CROSIO,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I rise, like each member on this side of the House, to once again object to this iniquitous piece of Howard government legislation which will, if passed, further erode the rights of our Australian workers. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002 [No. 2] is aimed at expanding the unfair dismissal jurisdiction of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to all constitutional corporations-a move that would result in the Commonwealth taking over 85 per cent of the states' unfair dismissal systems. I had to listen again to 15 minutes from the member for Cowper, who obviously did not read the bill or the explanatory memorandum to know and understand what we are talking about. The government has claimed that this bill makes a constructive move towards a unified and simplified system of workplace relations regulation. In reality, what this miserable and mean-spirited government intends is a huge reduction in workers' protection and rights. It is a grab for more power by the Howard government. The bill also makes changes to the method of dealing with unfair dismissal claims. It alters eligibility and available remedies, especially for workers employed in small business. And what incentive does legislation such as this bill give to school leavers and to the long-term unemployed to join a work force already tightly regulated by the Howard government? Absolutely none. In my electorate of Prospect, youth unemployment in Fairfield is nearly seven per cent higher than it is in the rest of the state. Statistics from the employment and workplace relations department showed that, although the teenage full-time unemployment rate did drop two per cent to 27.8 per cent last quarI ter, the state average, which also dropped from October to November, is recorded at 21 per cent-in other words, the youth unemployment figure in my electorate is over eight per cent more than the state average. Our employment services minister has said that the long-term unemployment figures are not broken down into local government areas. So it was hard to know how long people in my area of Fairfield had been unemployed. But Fairfield's statistics show that the total number of people receiving Newstart or the Youth Allowance was recorded at 5.6 per cent, bringing the total number of people in the area receiving those benefits to 4,294. These are not just figures or numbers; these are people we are talking about. They cannot be written off as so-called statistics which mean nothing; we are talking about constituents in my electorate. One would think that, with the region experiencing such a high jobless rate, the government would be introducing programs to counteract this trend. Instead, we see legislation of the type that we are here opposing tonightlegislation which will do absolutely nothing to negate this problem and which will go a long way to perpetuate the problem and further erode the confidence and self-esteem of our Australian youth. This bill is the same as its predecessor, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002, which was defeated in the Senate in August 2003. The purpose of these bills is to allow the Howard government to take control of, as I said, the states' unfair dismissal coverage of something like seven million Australians-up from four million, by the way. This bill would effectively bar state authorities from hearing most unfair dismissal cases. This is a blatant attempt by the Howard government to take over state unfair dismissal systems, against the will of the states-and this absence of state cooperation will result in a substantial sector of the work force remaining in the state system anyway. No state government supports the passage of this bill. The loudest opposition is coming from the New South Wales government and the unions, and I am certainly happy to add my voice to that opposition. In a submission to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee, the Queensland government pointed out that, far from resulting in improved legislation, as the Howard government claims, this bill establishes two different sets of federal laws and procedures governing unfair dismissal matters, depending on the size of the respondent, and provides different federal and state unfair dismissal regimes for incorporated and unincorporated entities. The bill also provides different federal state unfair dismissal regimes for incorporated entities, depending on whether they meet the definition of a constitutional corporation, and concurrent but separate federal and state jurisdictions of different aspects of workplace relations in the one business. This would mean a federal regime would govern a business's unfair dismissal disputes and a state regime would govern workplace harassment and industrial disputes. Under this legislation, a state award employee of a constitutional corporation with a claim for unfair dismissal and withholding of wages would need to lodge a claim in both jurisdictions: one for the unfair dismissal component and another for the wages component. Employers who already complain about time-wasting court appearances under the current law would find the provisions of this new bill-if it were to pass-to be even more time consuming and far more complicated. The states' argument is supported by the opinion of Professor Andrew Stewart from Flinders University. Professor Stewart, in his submission to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee, said that while he supported unitary industrial relations laws he opposed this bill because it sought to override state unfair dismissal laws in favour of a federal proposal that is ‘inferior in both design and operation'. He said that the proposed amendments would not contribute to simplifying the coverage of state and federal laws and, most importantly, he said that the predominant effect would be to reduce the overall national coverage of unfair dismissal laws and that it would exclude many workers from being able to challenge their dismissal. My Labor colleagues who were on the Senate committee-and they are yours, too, Madam Deputy Speaker Corcoran-claim that the most glaring omission in the bill is ‘the exclusion of many workers who now and have access to a remedy for unfair dismissal from being unable to challenge their dismissal'. This is a limitation in the use of the corporations power, which does not appear to unduly concern this government. Make no mistake: the real effect of this bill will be that many workers will be effectively deprived of a right to challenge their dismissal. As Professor Stewart told the committee: ... it is highly misleading for the Minister to claim, as he does in his second reading speech for the Billthe one we are debating in this House nowthat ‘the percentage of employees covered by Federal unfair dismissal provisions should rise from about 50 per cent to about 85 per cent'. Many of those employees would be ‘covered', yes, but only to the extent of denying them a remedy against unfair dismissal! We believe that the government's proposal is that the states should give their powers to the Commonwealth to cover the field. This would require a degree of cooperation which seems unlikely, given the lack of consultation that has marked relations between the states and the Commonwealth in the past seven years. As I remarked earlier, it is just another grab for power by a power hungry government. Obviously, the member for Cowper did not read the explanatory memorandum. Usually, when a minister makes a second reading speech on a bill in the House, there is an explanatory memorandum that accompanies it. I say to the members on the government benches that before they come into the House to debate important legislation like this they should read all of the fine print. Actional cording to the explanatory memorandum, if this bill were to pass it could result in the Australian Industrial Commission's case load in unfair dismissals increasing from about 8,000 to 14,000. Again, they are not my words; they are in the explanatory memorandum accompanying this bill. This could be used by the government to justify the appointment of many new federal commissioners-probably in the order of 15 or so. Given the Howard government's propensity to appoint its mates to judicial positions, this alone is reason enough to oppose this bill. But there are many more reasons. There are also significant costs involved in expanding the federal system. In its own budget papers, the government anticipates a 75 per cent increase in unfair dismissal cases brought before the AIRC, at a cost of $16.8 million over four years. The bill also alters parts of the current federal system. I feel it needs to be repeated again and again that the changes would reduce the amount of compensation which could be awarded to a small business employee from 26 weeks to 13 weeks pay, extend the qualifying period of employment from three months to six months and narrow the reasons for a redundant employee to mount an action, and reduce the amount of back pay available where the commission orders reinstatement-it would require the AIRC to take into account income earned from other employment undertaken pending the result of a hearing. My Labor colleagues on the Senate committee I referred to earlier in this debate said that they: ... regard this bill as implementing a basically flawed policy of creating two classes of employees: those who work for small business, and those in more privileged employment sectors. This is fundamentally wrong in a country with perhaps the strongest tradition of legally entrenched fairness and equity practices anywhere in the world. This flaw is compounded by the use of a constitupower which will have the effect of creating legal confusion. In the view of Labor senators, this is one of the least defensible amendments to the Workplace Relations Act which the committee has so far had to deal with. And so say all of us on this side of the House. Professor Stewart also has reservations about the complications which the bill introduces. He says: ... the provisions in Division 3 of the Part VIA of the Workplace Relations Act and their attendant regulations are ... unnecessarily complex and unduly prescriptive. They are very hard for ordinary workers or managers to understand, necessitating legal advice for even the simplest procedures. Instead of simply empowering the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC) to deal with certain claims and providing broad guidance as to how to do so, as most State laws do, the legislation seeks to regulate each step of the process in ever-increasing detail. As is generally the way when Parliament tries to anticipate and counter every eventuality, this level of detail simply creates potential gaps and uncertainties for litigants and their lawyers to exploit. Surely, even if this government is not prepared to fund universities adequately, it should at least be prepared to listen to the experts who specialise in their particular subject and to try and act on their recommendations. Yet another academic, Professor Ron MCCallum, a leading industrial legal academic-and I am grateful to the ever helpful staff of the Parliamentary Library for this quote-has argued in The future of state employment regulation in Australia that the provisions of this bill may mean an end to the unfair dismissal legislation of the states. Professor MCCallum said the bill: … will strike a blow at the five remaining state systems of employment regulation ... in Australia. He also said: ... the enactment of this Bill will mean that 85% of Australian employees will only have recourse to the Federal Termination of Employment machinery when seeking to challenge dismissals which are harsh, unjust or unreasonable. This would mean that the State termination of employment regimes would have little work to do because currently they cover approximately 40% of the Australian workforce, and I suggest this would have a telling impact on the viability of these State-based systems of labour relations regulation, especially in the smaller states of South Australia and Tasmania. It is also my argument that the complex Federal termination of employment provisions are a nightmare for most employers and employees, and that the simpler State mechanisms, especially those in operation in New South Wales, are more beneficial to employees and employers who are seeking a fair and speedy resolution of termination issues. Another potential flaw of the bill, when one pursues it, has been highlighted, also by Professor MCCallum. He points out that, if the intention of the proposed subclause 170HA(l) is to oust the state termination regimes from granting remedies for discriminatory dismissal, its constitutionality may be challenged. We cannot even get it right. The nub of the argument is that the Workplace Relations Act creates distinctions between unfair and unlawful dismissals. Professor MCCallum says that this bill deals with unfair dismissals, but the state jurisdictions do not make that same distinction. His view, as outlined in the Bills Digest, which is available to every member of this House from our library, is that a federal law may manifest an intention to cover the entire field of unfair and discriminatory terminations with respect to employees of constitutional corporations but cannot pick and choose which state tribunals may operate in this field. In particular, it seems unlikely that the bill could prevent state antidiscrimination tribunals from granting remedies in discriminatory cases. The protection of employees' entitlements is one of the cornerstones in an industrial relations system which has stood the test of time over many years in Australia. Employees, in a time of widespread concern over the security of their jobs, their incomes and their families, deserve better from this government. This bill does nothing to encourage harmony in the workplace and could be the precursor to unprecedented unrest in all aspects of Australian workplace relations. Questions remain as to how far the bill supports or creates a national uniform termination of employment scheme. Importantly, without the states supporting the scheme, this bill can only extend the scope of the federal termination coverage to a higher proportion of the national work force, thus failing to create a national uniform termination jurisdiction. It could be argued that the bill will introduce another tier into the termination system by creating an additional regime for small business. As one who has had extensive experience in running a small business, I know what small business is all about. I might add, and I will say it again for the members on the government benches, that for 27 years I ran a very successful business, employing over seven people, as well as my husband and me, and we worked very hard. Sure, we have small business men out there. They do say that they have enough on their plates, but they do not need this added burden of a federal system of unfair dismissal jurisdiction, in addition to the state laws which also govern their lives.",101
126,Mr SLIPPER,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Well, scrap the state laws.",105
127,Mrs CROSIO,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"We will not go into what has happened with the GST and small business, and how the GST had to be rectified and how we had to have another one of those core or non-core promises effectively changed and amended by this parliament because of the problems that small businesses have been encountering since this government came into being. The Howard government has long sought to portray Australian workers as second-class citizens and has continually tried to downgrade or abolish their hard-won rights. We must not stand for this and allow this to happen. I oppose this bill in its entirety and, the way, I will continue to oppose it no matter what the Parliamentary Secretary for Finance and Administration, who is sitting at the table, or even government members may think. Until we see legislation before this House that provides some justice and equity for the Australian workers that it purports to help, we on this side of the House will stand up proudly and say, ‘You won't get this bill through unless there is common sense and, more particularly, unless there are fair rights for the employees that we are supposed to represent through our constituencies.' I have introduced time and time againand I will probably be doing it again next Monday-a termination of employees rights bill in this House. It is a bill that this ernment is too frightened to bring on and debate. Each time it gives me a measly five minutes to reintroduce it. I will continue to do that because I fervently believe that the employees out there who make up our constituencies are the ones we are supposed to be here defending. If you do not have the jobs or the workers, you do not have the families, the housing or the small businesses. Let us look at the nub of the problem and not try to rectify the inconsistencies and the inability of this government to govern. The member for Cowper even tried to make out that this government had tried to get this bill through ‘22 times'-his counting was a bit wrong, but I have repeated his words as I do not want to change his numbers. This government must have a better approach to how this legislation is framed. It must have a better approach to understanding and appreciating that the workers out there demand more from government than this. It is about time that we stood up for them, and it is about time that we debated in this House legislation that is going to improve their lives and their rights. We should not deny the workers of Australia their fair rights, nor should we by deny them the right to question their dismissal arrangements. I condemn the bill and I say to the government: wake up, just for once in your life. (Time expired)",105
128,Mr ORGAN,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Cunningham) (7.52 p.m.)I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002 [No. 2], just as I did back on 15 May 2003 when it first came before this place. At the time, I condemned the bill and the government's misguided approach to workplace relations. Nothing much has changed in the intervening months, apart from a new minister settling into this portfolio. So here we are again. I am not sure which is more tedious: the government's Dickensian approach to regugovlating the workplace at the expense of workers' rights or the fact that the government keeps trying it on, so to speak, through these tiresome double dissolution triggers, of which this is just one, and the second relating to industrial relations. In the process, the government is continuing to disregard the wishes and welfare of Australian workers and their representative unions throughout the nation. In essence, this bill seeks to increase the federal government's jurisdiction over unfair dismissal laws and attacks the state regimes, as the member for Prospect has just so ably outlined. In my previous speech to the House on this bill I pointed out that the regime introduced here is not the simpler, fairer system the minister has promised Australian workers and employers. Forget the spin. Instead it is a meaner, tighter and more restrictive system. The second reading speech last year of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations stated that federal unfair dismissal laws are ‘generally less burdensome to employers' than equivalent state laws. There you have it, Madam Deputy Speaker. That is what this bill is all about. is about the fact that present state laws are fairer towards employees than the regime proposed in this bill. Mr Slipper interjecting",105
129,Mr ORGAN,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"The member for Fisher has interjected that we should scrap the state laws, but that is the reason we should not: the state laws are fairer than the present regime before the House. At the end of the day, we have to be fair in our dealings with the Australian people. That is the bottom line. This bill is about the fact that present state laws are fairer towards employees than the regime proposed in this bill. We must remember that these state laws have, over time, been enacted to protect workers, to protect employees. Why have such laws been deemed necessary? The answer is obvious: it is because history has shown that employees do need protection from that small group of unscrupulous employers and bosses who have abused notions of fairness, decency and trust in their dealings with Australian workers. Workers have been unfairly dismissed. That is a fact. And workers do need protection from these abuses. That is a fact that the government does not seem to care much about. It is quite clear that this bill will reduce specific rights and entitlements of Australian workers. As I said, the member for Prospect has outlined some of those possible reductions. These are hard-won rights and entitlements, which the minister views as a burden on employers and corporations. It is not just the application of this bill in the federal arena that is alarming. It is also that this bill threatens many employees who are currently protected by better and more just state laws. The minister himself calculated that three million extra employees will be brought under the federal government's unfair dismissal regime if this bill is passedIt that is, three million workers will be worse off under this bill. In total, it will cover approximately 6.8 million, or 85 per cent, of the Australian work force. This bill before us is not insignificant. It seeks to increase the federal government's jurisdiction over unfair dismissal laws. It does this by using the corporations power in the Australian Constitution. You may well ask, Madam Deputy Speaker, why the government is relying on the corporations power to deal with industrial relations issues. Why is it taking such extraordinary steps? It is interesting to recall the response of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Mr Andrews, on the point of expanding the role of the federal parliament as an industrial relations law-maker and laws designed to save lives at work. In particular, when I asked the minister on 5 November 2003 when the government would heed the calls of workers and unions in my own electorate of Cunningham and throughout the nation for the introduction of tough new industrial manslaughter legislation with criminal sanctions-especially in light of the failure of occupational health and safety legislation to deal with this tragic matter-the minister replied: … this is the federal parliament and not the state parliament of New South Wales. The issues which the honourable member raises are constitutionally within the power of New South Wales ... The minister and the government are clearly content to suggest that the Commonwealth does not have the power to introduce industrial manslaughter legislation using the corporations power, but that very same power can be used-indeed, should be used, they tell us-to make it easier to sack people and reduce the rights of those people when they are sacked. What hypocrisy! There is no mention of such a negative approach in section 51(xx) of Australia's Constitution, which states plainly and, I might say, evenly: The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to: … … … (xx) foreign corporations, and trading or financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth ... So why is it that this government only wants to use this power to inflict a reduction of workers' rights and denies that the constitutional power exists in order to save lives? Could it be that the government places profits ahead of safety? Surely not. Is the government more interested in reducing workers' standards than in protecting workers and their families? It seems so. In fact, that is the only conclusion that can, in all conscience, be drawn, based on this and other bills presented to this place. I must condemn this bill, as it represents nothing more than an unjustifiable and unnecessary attack on the conditions of working Australians and their families. The government needs to take heed of the fact that the Senate has already rejected it, and consign this legislation to the dustbin of history, because that is where it belongs. This House should not support a bill which will result in a reduction in workers' rights, a reduction in hard-won workplace conditions, and the removal of equality, regardless of the size of the business you work in or forregardless of whether there are fewer than or more than 20 workers. The Australian Greens believe in a fairer way. Conditions of employment, including sick leave, holiday pay, penalty rates and protection against arbitrary and unfair dismissal are not negotiable and must be nurtured and improved, not neglected or cut back as this government seeks to do. Reducing workers' entitlements does not create jobs. Do we want Third World employment conditions in this country? No, we do not. Do we want to protect the working conditions of ordinary Australians so that they can share in the nation's prosperity? Yes, of course we do. Do we want to bring down the high unemployment rate, which is around 10 per cent in areas such as Wollongong, in my electorate of Cunningham? Yes, of course we do. This reduction in the high unemployment rate will not be achieved by watering down unfair dismissal protection for Australian workers or by continually attacking and dragging down their conditions and entitlements so that more profit goes into the pockets of the wealthy few. No, this government's logic is flawed and its priorities are skewed. It is doing untold damage to Australia's social fabric by seeking to force through the parliament bills such as the one now before us. Protection from arbitrary and unfair dismissal is a key part of protecting workers' rights. The government is couching this bill in terms of equity, fairness and freedom, when it is none of these. The government must be honest with the Australian people. The Prime Minister must protect the social fabric of this country, as he is out there in the wider community telling people he is standing up for this. The government must withdraw this inequitable and divisive bill.",106
130,Ms JACKSON,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"It is my pleasure tonight to rise, along with many other members of this House, and oppose the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. In doing so, I also indicate my support for the second reading amendment that has been moved by the member for Rankin. As other speakers have already pointed out this evening, this bill is in effect a repeat bill. It identical to the one that was defeated in the Senate in August last year. To that extent, I, like the member for Newcastle, question its reintroduction into this House. It seems that one of the purposes is to stack up yet another double dissolution trigger, despite the Prime Minister's assurances in that respectthough I would hazard a guess that perhaps one of the other reasons for its reintroduction is that it is symptomatic of the fact that this government has no third-term agenda, so it has to keep repeating things that have previously been rejected in this place. We understand that the purpose of the bill as it has been reported to the House is to expand to all constitutional corporations the jurisdiction of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in regard to unfair dismissal. As I understand the information in the explanatory memorandum, the commission will in fact take up some 85 per cent of the current jurisdiction of many state industrial relations commissions. There are other changes proposed, some to the processing of claims, and some to eligibility and available remedies under the unfair dismissal regime, especially those that apply to small business. One of the more amusing claims by the government is that this legislation has also been introduced as a constructive move towards a unified and simplified system of industrial relations. I particularly want to concentrate on the last point, because I understand that there has been no consultation with state governments concerning this proposed legislation. I am reliably advised that, even at the most recent meeting of the ministerial council of ministers who deal with industrial relations, the government did not even bother to put this matter on the agenda. Frankly, if you are going to come into this place and say that part of the honourable purpose behind this legislation is to create this unified and simplified system of indusis trial relations that will apply across Australia then one of the things that you should do as a matter of course is consult with the states and try to bring about a system which the majority of states, if not all states, can endorse. I also think it demonstrates a lack of understanding about the legislative changes that have occurred in my own state with respect to the unfair dismissal regime. The minister may or may not be aware that substantial industrial relations-or labour relationsamendments were made by the Western Australian government in late 2001. One of the significant areas of reform was the area of unfair dismissal. The purpose of amending the legislation was to achieve a number of things. The first was to establish reinstatement or re-employment as the primary remedy, regardless of whether employers seek to simply pay compensation. The second was to provide for compensation to be awarded in conjunction with reinstatement, to allow an unfairly dismissed employee to be reinstated without loss of their entitlements, particularly their service related entitlements. It also to ensure that the commission, in the exercise of its jurisdiction, would properly consider a probationary period when determining the merits of any particular unfair dismissal claim. It also improved the practice and procedure of the Western Australian commission to ensure that claims of unfair dismissal are dealt with expeditiously, provided enhanced powers for the enforcement of unfair dismissal orders in our industrial magistrates court, increased the fee for filing of unfair dismissal claims to bring it in line with the fee that applies in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, provided limited discretion to the commission to hear claims that were lodged out of time, and provided powers to the commission to exclude claims that were able to be determined in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. One of the major purposes of these amendments was to bring some sort of system into place in Western Australia that was complementary to that which applied in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. To that extent, I think the Western Australian government ought to be congratulated on those changes. So far the debate in this place on the tion of unfair dismissal has frankly, in my opinion, focused on the ideology of the issue at the expense of the facts. This federal government has become obsessed with excluding particular classes of employees-for example, probationers, employees of small business and casuals with certain limited lengths of employment. That has been its emphasis: ‘We want to exclude these classes of employee from accessing unfair dismissal jurisdiction.' What it has failed to do is any kind of objective or empirical evidence that such exclusions will actually provide the benefits that it claims. It remains absolutely committed to removing these existing rights. To that extent, again I say that, if you seriwas ously have as your purpose the idea of bringing about a comprehensive system that can apply consistently throughout Australia, I think you would have regard for the facts and an examination of what has occurred in both state and federal tribunals in doing that. Our Western Australian Labor government believes, and I agree with it, that an efficient and effective unfair dismissal system should provide an appropriate balance between the rights of employees and the interests of both employees and employers. That system would have the following key features. The first would be a simple process which provides as much scope as possible for agreed outcomes without resort to arbitration. Already, anecdotal evidence from Western Australian practitioners in the unfair dismissal regime has indicated a preference now for pursuing or dealing with matters in the state industrial commission for the sole reason that it is less administratively cumbersome than the federal system. It has a simple process where a conciliation conference is convened very early in the piece in an attempt to try and reach agreed outcomes before resorting to arbitration and lengthy proceedings. The second key feature of such a system ques- would be that it should have appropriate mechanisms to discourage unmeritorious claims of unfair dismissal. I accept, as someone who is experienced as an industrial relations practitioner, that, from time to time, unmeritorious claims are made. I think it is in everybody's interest that you have a system where there are mechanisms which discourage those unmeritorious claims. That is completely different from excluding people from the jurisdiction altogether and denying bring them any right to bring any claim at all. Finally, any system must have appropriate remedies which reflect the intent and purpose of unfair dismissal protection. Of course, the purpose of that unfair dismissal protection is not to interfere with the rights of an employer to hire and fire. The protections of the unfair dismissal system are to ensure that an employer does not exercise those rights in a harsh or unfair manner. I have to say that it was that kind of limit on the tyranny and harshness that we sometimes find in the industrial relations system that was the very reason behind a conservative government introducing the Conciliation and Arbitration Act back in 1904. At the time Mr Deakin, who was responsible for the introduction of that bill and its carriage through the parliament, had a couple of things to say. Firstly, he said: It is sufficient for my purpose if it establishes necessity of bringing both employers and employees under the control of the law, and of endeavouring to obtain the creation of an impartial tribunal which shall mete out even-handed justice between them. He went on to say: Its object is to forbid tyranny on both sides, and as far as may be possible, to introduce into our industrial system a new standard which shall apply to all the persons concerned, subject to the interests of the whole. Frankly, I think the current conservative government has lost sight of those very principles which led to the creation of our Conciliation and Arbitration Act at the beginning of the last century. It was one of the concerns in Western Australia that the unfair dismissal jurisdiction, including the current federal system, had become increasingly focused on being a compensation awarding jurisdiction. I believe, and certainly the Western Australian government believes, that reinstatement is and should continue to be the primary remedy for any claim of unfair dismissal which is proved. Compensation should only be considered in circumstances where such reinstatement or re-employment is impracticable. We also have a system in Western Australia that allows employees and employers access to both the state and federal systems for unfair dismissal claims. There are provisions within the Western Australian Industrial Relations Act, as there are in the Workplace Relations Act, for powers to be given to either state or federal commissioners to be able to deal with matters. So, already, substantial steps were in place to see a much greater cooperation between state and federal jurisdictions. In Western Australia there was a deliberate step by us to put in place a system which would not see people voting with their feet or jurisdiction hopping or shopping. One of my concerns about this legislation is that the it will not take us a step closer to a unified or simplified system. What it has the potential to do is to go back to that jurisdiction shopping or hopping that was the problem prior to the reforms being introduced in 2001. In respect of this particular legislation, one issue that appears not to have been a consideration for the government is the likely effect these reforms-if, indeed, they are eventually passed; I have to say that that continues to be unlikely and I certainly hope it remains an unlikely outcome-would have on the workload of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. As I understand it, and even in the explanatory memorandum provided with the bill, the AIRC's annual case load in unfair dismissals is likely to increase from about 8,000 to 14,000. That is almost a doubling of the current unfair dismissal matters that are dealt with by federal commissioners. Clearly, that almost doubling of workload will have a substantial impact on costs and funding and the numbers of commissioners necessary in the AIRC. Equally-and this is perhaps another indication of the government's stupidity in failing to consult properly with state governments-it is likely to have a corresponding impact on the operation and workload of the state industrial relations commissions. You might say, ‘That's good. It might save the states some money.' But, frankly, it seems like a whole lot of nonsense: if the government had taken the time to properly consult with the states that have been interested in introducing a balanced system of unfair dismissal, we may well have had a much more progressive piece of legislation that both sides of the House could support. One of the most offensive things about this legislation-and I am sure it has been addressed by others-and, I suspect, the real purpose behind the legislation, is the reduction in rights for workers with unfair dismissal claims. In particular, the key changes proposed in the legislation are reducing the amount of compensation that can be awarded to an unfairly dismissed employee of a small business. A small business is defined as having fewer than 20 employees. I often talk about this with a lot of my small businesses in Western Australia. A business that starts to employ 15 or 20 people is not our idea of a small business. We are concerned about the partnerships, the sole traders and the people that employ perhaps a handful of employees. Most of those people will not be affected by this legislation at all. They will still be to the state industrial relations commission. It seems to me that the government is not even achieving what it has set out to achieve. It is a grab to reduce the rights of some workers in particular circumstances. There is no logic. We are not given any argument for the reduction or for why a small business employee is only entitled to compensation of 13 weeks if they are unfairly dismissed as opposed to the maximum of 26 weeks, other than: ‘You poor thing. You're employed by a business with fewer than 19 colleagues.' Extending the qualified period in relation to unfair dismissal from three months to six months is also, frankly, illogical. I fully accept that an employer who has in place appropriate employment practices is entitled to employ someone on probation or on a trial. If that person is unable to come up to the necessary standard required to continue in employment then it may or would be appropriate for the employer to dismiss them. As I said, the employer has the right to hire and fire. The unfair dismissal regime is only for when those employers exercise that right in a harsh or unfair manner. That is the conduct we are trying to attack. That is the conduct we would like to see moved out of Australia's workplace relations. Again, it is a simple case of: ‘Take this group out, and somehow that will miraculously solve the problems for small business.' I was also astounded by one of the claims that the bill would reduce the amount of back pay available where reinstatement is ordered for employees who have mitigated their loss by requiring the AIRC to take into account income earned from other employment. I am not aware of any case that has been dealt with in either the federal or state jurisdiction where that is not taken into account as a matter of course. Indeed, since as long as 15 years ago, if employees who have been dismissed go on unemployment benefits and are taken subsequently reinstated and compensation is ordered, the Commonwealth's own legislation obliges them to pay that money back to the Commonwealth. I believe that has been drafted without any regard for the current provisions or legislation and without anybody canvassing the history of authorities or precedent with respect to that particular provision. I am a bit disappointed about this legislation because there are some things in it that go to the processing of claims which are reforms that are long overdue. That is confirmed by the fact that the majority of people in Western Australia are now pursuing claims for unfair dismissal in the state system. Employers, employees and unions are happy to go there because there is a much faster and more expeditious processing of the claims. Quite often in the state system it is the commissioner who convenes the initial conciliation conference within a week or two of an application being made. The earlier you can deal with a dispute and the earlier you can get people to sit down and talk about an issue around the table, the more likely you are to achieve an outcome which is agreed and avoid the unnecessary process of litigation and further hearings. I am not one who would promote in this place a states rights argument by any stretch. I am one who would like to see this area tackled in a responsible and bipartisan fashion. I think the reforms should not be about removing or downgrading rights and entitlements of employees-or employers. If the actual purpose is to look to creating an unfair dismissal jurisdiction which is complementary across Australia then we should be serious about doing that. I again express my concern that this bill was introduced after a ministerial council meeting with the states where it was not even mentioned that the government was proposing to introduce the legislation. The government has not even tried to get agreement on any of the provisions with the states. It did not even go through the motions. It is irritating in sense that we are obliged to waste time in this House debating a bill again and again for limited purpose. So I say to the government: ‘If you are serious about making or seeking a simplified and unified system dealing with unfair dismissals, we are ready, willing and able to talk to you about it. put forward legislation that is about nothing but grabs for power and reductions in employee entitlements then this side of the House will continue to oppose it and condemn you for it.'",108
131,Mr BEVIS,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"The Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002 [No. 2] combines two of what are, I think, the more contentious issues within industrial relations. It combines, in some sort of shotgun marriage, two of the government's pet industrial relations topics: reducing workers' rights to protection from unfair dismissal and spreading their federal system to wipe out the existing state systems. Liberal attacks on unfair dismissal laws are not new in this place, as has been mentioned by a number of speakers. They have been defeated in the parliament more times, I think, than Bill Murray woke up to that radio alarm clock in Groundhog Day-and it feels a bit like Groundhog Day, being back in this debate again. The issue of seeking to override state laws, which the government have combined within this bill, has not been so regularly considered in the parliament. It is an issue of some serious substance that has been before industrial relations practitioners since the Moore versus Doyle case. It is not properly addressed in this bill, and I repeat the comments just made by other members on the Labor side: if the government are serious in wanting to engage in a debate about that then they will find not just the Labor Party but, I am sure, the wider industrial relations combother to munity-both employer and employeethat willing to engage in a constructive discussion on that. But, as is their normal practice in these matters, there has been no discussion, no consultation and no real effort to resolve the underlying problem. This is simply a grab to override state laws in an area that this government has tried to make an If you continue to icon issue. The issue of taking over states rights in industrial relations, I suppose, did get some prominence after Jeff Kennett handed over Victorian workers to the tender mercies of Peter Reith and John Howard, but I found it somewhat interesting, in considering this bill and its implications, that the government seems most concerned about the operation of unfair dismissal laws within state jurisdictions. We have just had a state election in Queensland. It does not seem to be an issue amongst the members of the Liberal Party and The Nationals in Queensland. Indeed, the Prime Minister went to the campaign launch. We all remember him standing there hitching his banner to the wagon. There was no campaign at all conducted by the Liberal Party or The Nationals to say that Queensland's unfair dismissal laws are wrong. Nowhere in that campaign did a member of the Liberal Party or The Nationals-much less the Prime Minister-say: ‘I think Peter Beattie's unfair dismissal laws are wrong, unfair, harsh, oppressive, difficult for employers, stifling employment,' or put whatever argument they wanted to advance. There was no such suggestion in the campaign by any Liberal member. If the Liberal Party and The Nationals were fair dinkum about this and the arguments they have advanced here in this debate, surely their state colleagues would be out there in state election campaigns telling the people who are the subject of these unfair dismissal laws under state jurisdiction: ‘We think these state laws are bad and we're going to change them if we win the Queensland election or the New South Wales election.' But there is nary a word-not a word about it. Nowhere will you find in the Liberal Party's campaign material for the recent Queensland election a pledge to remove the unfair dismissal laws that Peter Beattie has. The Tories cannot take a trick in state politics. The Liberal Party are struggling to even have political party status in the Queensland parliament. I am not sure that they are going to reach it, frankly. That is the level of port they have on state issues. This debate presented by the Liberal Party and The Nationals in this parliament is simply dishonest. The whole purpose of this bill is twofold. It is predicated on two things: firstly, that if we simply make it easier for people to be sacked and give workers fewer rights to combat unfair dismissal, we will somehow create more jobs and, secondly, that the state laws are wrong, complicated and unfair in that process and have to be removed. Nowhere have they had the guts to stand up in a state election before the people of that state and say that to them. Instead, unable to run that debate at a state level, they come in here and seek to use the federal parliament to override the states, in what amounts effectively to a hostile takeover. I do not think that will work, either in this parliament or politically in the workplaces and homes of the people of Australia. It is unfortunate that, after so many debates that we have had on unfair dismissal laws, it would seem that very few government members understand the issues. They have stood in this debate and parroted the notes that have been given to them by the minister's office. They have reinforced the prejudices they have without really digging too deep into any of the facts. So I think it is time to put back on the record, yet again, some of those facts. Unfair dismissal laws are not new things. They may be comparatively new in the federal jurisdiction-we have really only had unfair dismissal laws for a decade or so-but in state jurisdictions these laws have operated for generations, and, I might say, they have operated for generations without controversy. They have become an issue of debate only in the last few years-since 199697 and the election of the Howard government and the pursuit of the major legislative supchanges that were introduced into this parliament by the then Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Peter Reith. Since that time, over the last seven or eight years, the government have sought to create a self-fulfilling prophecy. They have tried to tell the businesspeople of Australia, particularly the small business people, that there is a terrible burden on them called unfair dismissal law. They have repeated the so often, so widely and so regularly that have managed to convince some people of that concern. It has been a scare campaign that has gone on now for seven or eight years but, even after seven or eight years and even with the support of some of the peak employer associations in trying to promote those bogus stories, they have failed to generate much of an impact out there. I guess the closest ally this government has in the employer world would be ACCI. I think ACCI some years ago gave up any pretence of being an independent player in matters of government and industry policy, but even their surveys-I am going back a couple of years, I know, to 2001, but that is last survey of theirs I have seen-show something on this. In 2001 they did a survey of the 10 most important problems facing small business. Their report showed-and it was in rank order only; unfortunately they did not identify the comparative weight given to each of the areas by businessesthat, in the small business community, ranked at No. 1 was the frequency and complexity of changes to tax laws and rules, and ranked at No. 2 was the level of taxation. If the government were fair dinkum about helping relieve the burden on small business, they would only need to look to the advice of their close friends in ACCI. No. 1 and No. 2 are the government's taxation levels and tax system. We do not have time to go through the detail of how this government's new tax system has placed an enormous impost on small business particularly. Where did unfair dismissal come in the top 10? It came in at No. 5. In a rank order, it came in at No. 5. Some people on the other side might think that a rank order of No. 5 is not a bad result-except be careful what the rank order is if you have no idea of what the responses were for each of them. There are a number of other surveys, lie though, that do provide a more detailed rethey sponse. There are many surveys quoted in the debate that we have had in this parliament on this issue over a number of years now. Frankly, some of them are surveys with the answers that you pay to get. A fair bit of push polling goes on in some of the surveys that are conducted on this issue. However, there is one survey that the government of Australia has conducted on this issue, and only one, because the Howard government has refused to conduct a survey of Australian workplaces since it was elected. That small workplace survey was conducted in 1995. AWIRS, the Australian workplace industrial relations survey of 1995, got released around the 1998, from memory. That had a very comprehensive survey response covering some 78,000 workplaces. In answer to the question that was asked of small business proprietors about their reasons for not recruiting new employees, 66 per cent of respondents said that they did not need any more. That is common sense: the reason they did not employ anyone was that they did not need them. The next highest response-at 23 per centwas that they were not recruited due to insufficient work. It is the same story. It then drops from 23 per cent to six per cent, which was the response, ‘Not recruited due to a lack of demand for the product.' In fact, unfair dismissal laws were mentioned in the responses that were received. They were mentioned by 0.9 per cent of respondentsnot even one per cent. In 1995, the laws were those that the previous Labor government had introduced. Those laws afforded far greater rights and powers to sacked workers than do the current laws. Those 1995 laws were subsequently changed by the Keating government before the 1996 election and, as we all know, have been changed by the Howard government since it was elected. Each of those changesthe Keating amendments and the Howard amendments-has tilted the field in favour of the employer, not the worker. So when we had a federal regime that was the most advantageous to employees-or, to talk about the other side of the coin, the most onerous on the employer-less than one per cent of small business operators identified it as a problem, as a reason for not employing someone. There have been more recent surveys by reputable organisations that cast a similar light on the issue. The Chartered Professional Accountants, a very reputable professional organisation, conducted a small business survey. It was published in March 2002. They asked a question about small businesses who had not employed staff and what the reasons were for not employing staff. No. 1 on the list of answers was that they did have the work-the same answer; you would expect that. No. 2 was reducing the cost of paperwork. Again, I say to the government: if you are fair dinkum and want to help small business, have a look at your tax system and have a look at the burden you place on small business. Unfair dismissal did rate a mention. It rated a mention by three per cent of small businesses. This is a survey conducted in 2002 by the Chartered Professional Accountants of Australia. I would have thought even members opposite would have difficulty finding a dispute with that. One of the things that underpins the government's entire approach is that there will somehow be jobs created if only employers can sack workers more freely. The employers, in reputable survey after reputable survey, show that that is not the case. Members opposite can parrot it and say it from one corner of the country to the other as often as they wish; they can plead with the employer constituency and try, through fear and malicious rumour, to convince employers they have a problem when they do not. But, even after seven or eight years of campaigning by this government to create a self-fulfilling prophecy, the small business community do not agree, and they list other things as much more significant in impacting on their decision as to whether they will employ staff. In fact, unfair dismissal laws have little impact whatsoever on employment levels. This is not a view that just I have. It was an issue that was raised in a court hearing in 2001, in Hamzy v. Tricon International Restaurants, where the issue came before the court and the court had before it a range of expert evidence-including, I understand, witnesses from this government. In dealing with the matter, the Federal Court foundand I quote from their decision: In the absence of any evidence about the matter, it seems to us the suggestion of a relationship benot tween unfair dismissal laws and employment inhibition is unproven. That was when the government and an employer ran the case before the Federal Court of Australia: they could not convince the judge. They cannot convince the employers in their own surveys; they cannot convince a judge. Indeed, they cannot convince themselves about this, because when pressed on these matters and asked to explain how many jobs are going to be created or how this creates jobs, both Minister Reith and Minister Abbott have to admit that they do not know. In answer to a question on notice-question on notice No. 2940-about this matter, Minister Reith conceded: It is not possible to specify the number of small businesses which would directly benefit from the Government's proposed exemption from unfair dismissal laws for small businesses ... If you cannot identify who benefits, how do you then assert that there are going to be 50,000 jobs created? Fifty thousand jobs is an interesting figure, because the current minister, the former minister, the minister before him and the Prime Minister have all parroted 50,000 as the number of people who would get a job if only Labor would stand aside and let this bill or any of its predecessors through. The minister but one, Tony Abbott, in dealing with this matter had some difficulty explaining that when he was pressed on the 7.30 Report on 20 May 2002. He was asked by Jeremy Thompson to explain how he had arrived at the figure. He said: It's a pretty rough and ready rule based on the fact that if just one small business in 20 employed one extra person as a result of the lifting of the unfair dismissal monkey from the back of small business, that would produce well over 50,000 jobs. A month later, on 9 June, on Meet the Press, he was asked a similar question, and he again fudged it by saying: Inevitably, it's an estimate, and these estimates are inevitably imprecise, but there are something like 1.5 million small businesses in Australia and if 1 in 30 of thoseSo the equation has now jumped. In one month it went from one in 20 to one in 30this is how precise the minister's calculation is. He goes on to say that if only one in 30 took it up there would be 50,000 new jobs. The simple fact is-I have explained the detail of this in previous debates and I do not have time to go into it now-that this was a figure that one person, representing one part of the industry, once said and subsequently recanted. Yet the government, quite improperly, misrepresent that individual's comments and continue to use that figure, and when pressed to explain how they arrived at it they cannot even get the lie straight. They cannot even remember the story for a month-or at least Minister Abbott had trouble remembering the story for a month, because the calculation was different in May 2002, when he was on the 7.30 Report, to the calculation when he was on Meet the Press on Channel Nine in June 2002. He could not even retain the figures in his brain for a month to keep up the front. I do not know how often this debate needs to be had and these figures need to be put before the parliament before people will understand that, in spite of whatever homespun homilies our Liberal and National opponents want to inject into this debate, there is in fact no evidence and no connection. In that context, I was taken by a newsletter that was produced by the retail association of Queensland. It was one of their regular updates, and it was released just before the last election in July 2001. It reported that they were to have a meeting with Minister Tony Abbott, the previous minister for workplace relations, ‘to brief him on issues of key importance in the lead-up to this year's federal election'. Just before the election in 2001 that newsletter to their members identified one topic only that they were going to talk to Tony Abbott about, and I will read what that was: High on the agenda will be the consideration of doubling the number of days businesses have to remit tax instalments to the ATO at the end of every quarter. That is the government's tax system againthe No. 1 priority. You might have thought that, if the retail industry had a difficulty with unfair dismissal laws a couple of months out from a federal election and were talking to the minister for industrial relations, that might have been the issue they wanted to talk about. But what did they report to their members as ‘the issue' that they wanted to pursue with the industrial relations minister a couple of months before the election? Not unfair dismissal laws but the government's burden of tax and tax paperwork. If you want to create jobs, I say to the government: take heed of the advice that you are getting-do not stick your head in the sand, do not believe everything concerning ministers' advice to backbenchers; look at some of the evidence and you will discover that there are creative ways to increase employment in small business and they have nothing to do with the bill before the House. So that reason, which is the principal reason that underpins this entire bill, is wrong. As I said at the outset, the other reason that underpins this is a belief that somehow the state systems are flawed and need to be overridden. If the Liberals believe that, they should have the guts to stand up in a state election and say it. They did not have the guts to do it in the last month in Queensland. The Prime Minister did not stand up in front of the people of Queensland when he was at the campaign launch and say that this was an area that needed to be changed and that, if Beattie would not change it, he would legislate to wipe out the Queensland laws. There was none of that-no openness, no transparency. There was not even consultation with the ministers at the ministerial council. It is little wonder that people in the Liberal Party went public a couple of years ago to describe the organisation in the government as sneaky. It is sneaky. This is bad law. It fair to thousands of workers. It is deceptive to thousands of small businesses. It deserves to be defeated as it has been in the past. (Time expired) Debate (on motion by Mr Ruddock) adjourned.

133,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,The minister may proceed.,117
134,Mr RUDDOCK,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,"Earlier today, I took a question from the member for Barton on matters relating to Willie Brigitte in which it was asserted that I misled the parliament as to the date on which ASIO received advice. This was a matter on which the Director General of ASIO had briefed the opposition fully and the assertion of a cover-up was clearly wrong. I also noted that the opposition had made other assertions that were untrue and they knew to be untrue. I am advised that the assertions made by the opposition were untrue. On checking, the Leader of the Opposition was briefed as to the possibility that one of the allegations was untrue. However, I should not have asserted that they knew them to be untrue. Accordingly, I correct the record on that point. NA AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2002 [No. 2] Second Reading Debate resumed.",117
135,Mr ZAHRA,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"MCMillan) (8.42 p.m.)Industrial relations is something which has been a big part of the history of my electoral district for the better part of 50 years. The is unindustries that we have had in the Latrobe Valley post World War II have been involved with some key industrial relations decision making and also with some important battles on behalf of trade unions seeking to improve the lot of their workers, often in very difficult conditions. You cannot talk about the history of the Latrobe Valley without recognising its significant role in industrial relations in the state of Victoria and nationally, and that is why I particularly welcome the opportunity to talk about some of those things in the debate tonight on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. We have it all in the electorate of MCMillan when it comes to industrial relations. We have the whole gamut. There is Hazelwood Power Corporation in the Latrobe Valley, which is one of the key power stations in the state of Victoria and last year won the Premier's industrial relations prize, and there are companies at the other end of the spectrum that have been involved in bitter disputes with their workforces, that have been involved in lockouts and that have been involved in taking action against their workers. This has meant that those companies have lost business and suffered financial penalty and that their work forces have had to suffer, often tragically, as a result of the decisions-often bloody-minded onesthose companies have taken. So we have the whole spectrum, and I want to talk a little tonight about some of our experiences in industrial relations across the full range of companies that we have in the electorate of MCMillan. People will recall-particularly Victorians or people who have family in Victoria-a bitter industrial relations dispute in the up, if my memory serves me correctly, to the 2001 election. It was a bitter dispute between Yallourn Energy, which is a subsidiary company of China Light and Power, and its work force. I point out that the Yallourn power station has seen positive industrial relations for a large part of the company's history. A good group of people have worked positively with management and, over many years, they have facilitated change associated with the restructure of the power industry. But when new management associated with new ownership came online, they sought to do things in a different way and without regard to the wishes of the local people, and particularly without regard to what people in their employ thought about that. We ended up with a situation at the Yallourn power station where some of the company management were saying outrageous things across the table during discussions. They said things like: ‘We never had this problem in India. We never had this problem in South Africa.' Of course, these countries are vastly different from Australia and vastly different in the technology that is employed at power stations and other industrial workplaces. They are also very different in their industrial relations climates and the legislative protections that are available to workers. So we had a group of foreign-minded people with ideas about how to conduct workplace relations. To cut a long story short-I could talk about this in some detail for hours; I am not sure how many people would enjoy that, but I could-we ended up with an almighty industrial dispute which led to a decision being taken in all power stations in the Latrobe Valley to wind back generation for a short period in support of the workers who were trying very hard to ensure that their conditions were maintained and that a large number of jobs were not casualised. The wash-up leadof all of that-through the industrial relations processes, through negotiating in bad faith, and a whole series of mechanisms which the company employed-was that the company was able to largely get its way as a result of the government's industrial relations legislation. I have no doubt at all that it was egged on and encouraged by people in the Howard government. However, the result for that company was great financial losses. We only had to listen to the wails during the industrial dispute to understand that this company, if it was to be believed, was losing a lot of money. The result for a lot of workers was that they were locked out, and we ended up with the situation where a large proportion of the work force was casualised and contracted out. That is one company in isolation but, when you are in a regional area like the Latrobe Valley, the behaviour of one company can never, in industrial relations terms, be considered in isolation. The behaviour of Yallourn Energy smeared the good reputation that the Latrobe Valley had built up over the previous 10 or 15 years as being a positive place for industrial relations, where people were able to get along and negotiate good industrial relations agreements. Its behaviour tarnished the good reputation of people like the Hazelwood Power Corporation and Loy Yang Power, who had negotiated with their employees in good faith and came up with good agreements which increased productivity as well as making sure that the work force was properly recognised for their contribution to the financial success of those two companies. Something like that affects all of us, certainly did in the case of Yallourn Energy's behaviour, with the negative impact that it had on the Latrobe Valley's industrial reputation. We are trying very hard to put that behind us. We are now trying very hard to work positively to ensure that the Latrobe Valley's good name for industrial relations is restored and that we are able to see a positive industrial relations climate being fostered, where we do not seek to end up with situations where people are in conflict and see the blunt instruments of legislative opportunities being made available to them as their only option, rather than sitting down and negotiating in good faith. You might also recall that another significant industrial dispute took place in the torate of MCMillan some years ago. The dispute was centred on a meat works in Pakenham, which is in the south-eastern suburban part of Melbourne, in the growth corridor. Some 300 meatworkers were involved in this dispute, which resulted in some 300 meatworkers being locked out by the company G&K O'Connor for a period of nine months. The nine months for which that dispute ran, when the workers were locked out, made it the longest lockout in Australia's history since the Depression. Speaking to some of the workers who were involved in that dispute made me realise just how tragic the outcome of that dispute was. People's family relationships broke up during that time and I am advised that people took their own lives during that dispute as well, and all of that for no good end the outcome for the company. Once again, if it is to be believed, the company suffered an enormous financial penalty for the action which it took. For a long period it was unable to find meatworkers who were prepared to come and work in its employ. The latest information I have is that it has been employing people who are seeking asylum in Australia at the moment. They are and it bussed to and from the company and they obviously do not have the skill level of the work force that the company saw fit to lock out for the period of the dispute. A large number of the staff have moved on and are now working in other meatworksmeatworks where they are given some regard and treated fairly by their employers. Industrial relations is something that affects communities. It affects people in their daily lives and in their family lives, which is why the decisions that we make in this place are so critical to how people are able to live their lives, get enjoyment out of their lives and be productive in their working lives. I often think about the situation at Pakenham meat works. As I understand it, the G&K elec- O'Connor meat works was, right up to the point of the dispute, a fairly successful business-a business which had done well and which was obviously exporting. It was a business able to enjoy the benefits of their efforts as management coupled with the cooperation and skill of their work force. However, this all changed when, aided and abetted and promoted and encouraged by the then Minister for Industrial Relations, Peter Reith, this company took the action that they took. They are still paying a price for that action. The work force, who have largely moved on, still pay the price today for the decision that was taken. By comparison, in the electorate of Macmillan, we have another meat works which employs about 80 or 100 people at Warragul-Radford's meat works. They have fostered, promoted and encouraged a positive industrial relations climate in the time that they have been in existence. We have seen that company enter into some positive arrangements with some of the high-grade meat suppliers in the country to provide premium meat. They have also invested in the value adding of some of the products associated with the meat works and, in recent times, they have installed a new boning room. These are positive developments which have secured the jobs of those people who work there. They have cooperated with the owners and have helped them build the success of the company. They have also created new opportunities, built on that cooperation, for more people to be employed. This is the type of thing that we want to see more of-working together and understanding that a company cannot succeed without a work force committed to their success. I would like to say to the Radford family, who are a very big part of Warragul in West Gippsland, ‘Well done and congratulations for the positive way in which you have conducted your work and your relationships with your staff.' It is something which a lot of people in the industry look to as an example of how to do things properly. I am proud to have a company like that operating in my electorate and providing that example. We often hear the refrain in this place if we made it easier for employers to sack people that would create more jobs. I often think that people in the community who listen to the debates-it is not a broadcast night tonight, but they might listen to the debates when it is a broadcast night-and hear the things that get said in this place might think we are a bit crazy sometimes. If you imagine someone in the community hearing an argument put that if we made it easier to sack people it would actually create jobs, I am sure that they must think that the person who is promoting that view is a little unstable or a little unwell. It is not a view which ordinary people in the community can relate to at all. If you make it easier for people to be sacked, how on earth can that create jobs? The fiction was revealed before very eloquently by my colleague and friend the member for Brisbane, Arch Bevis, of just how much of a lie the government's claims are about the number of jobs that might be created if it were easy for people to be sacked. The correlation between making it easier to sack people and creating jobs is obviously not true. It is all based on a claim made by Rob Bastian, who was, and still might be, the head of the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia. It is no reflection on Mr Bastian at all, but his claim that 50,000 jobs would be created is built on a very flimsy premise. As the member for Brisbane mentioned, it was built on the premise that one in 20 employers would be able to employ just one more person. This does not bear any sort of scrutiny and, of course, there is no evidence to support this view which has been put by Mr Bastian on behalf of COSBOA. It has since been trumpeted by the Australian government as a fact, as a given, that you just press a button and 50,000 jobs are created. It is not true and it is very dishonest of the people pushing that view to say, ‘All we need to do is make it easier to that sack people and then there will be 50,000 new jobs.' There are a lot of people in this place who will say that unions are a bad thing. They will say that unions serve no function and that we should get rid of all unions. It is not a view that I share, but it is a view that is largely held by people in the Liberal and National parties. They can have that view, and they are entitled to have that view, but I disagree. Those people who have had exposure to physically tough industries will understand just how important it is to have a good union and to have positive relationships with the work force and management on these important occupational health and safety issues. I challenge those people who have promoted the view that unions are too tough or too strong in the building industry to go and visit a building site. Maybe some of them should take a bit of time to go and visit a building site to understand how much physical risk the people who work there take every day of the week. It is a pretty hard job and pretty dangerous. A lot of people die on building sites, and a lot more people would die on building sites if it were not for the fact that we have strong unions. It is something that I believe in very strongly. I am sure there are people in this place who have seen the horrors of industrial accidents who support that view as well. I am sure there are people on both sides of the House who appreciate the importance of occupational health and safety. Often people who talk about the need to get rid of unions or the need to lessen union power forget how it was that unions came to exist in these types of workplaces. My dad tells the story about how, in the 1950s when he arrived in Australia and started working on building sites, there was not even a dunny on building sites. There were hardly any conditions at all. There were the most rudimentary provisions for occupational health and safety, and people died on those building sites in larger numbers than now. Stronger unions and better occupational health and safety arrangements are I think worthwhile achievements. Debate interrupted. NA",117
136,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 9.00 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Environment",121
137,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,ADJOURNMENT,"In January, in answer to a question on notice, I received advice from the government that this year's Antarctic ozone hole-the hole in the ozone layer-at 28 million square kilometres, was about 10 million square kilometres larger than the 2002 hole. The 2002 hole was smaller than that of previous years, and this year's hole is about the same size as the ozone hole observed in the year 2000. The size of the Antarctic ozone layer hole each year depends on a number of meteorological factors as well as on the concentration of ozone-depleting chemicals. In 2002, unusual weather patterns restricted the size of the ozone hole in comparison with those of recent years. Meteorological conditions this year were more conducive to the formation of a larger ozone hole than in 2002. The fact is that the ozone hole has increased substantially, and there simply is no room for complacency in the way in which we tackle ozone-depleting substances. The ozone layer protects us all from the harmful rays of the sun, and holes in the ozone layer leave us more vulnerable to skin cancer. Australia has the highest skin cancer rate in the world. That is why I am concerned about, and want to raise in the House tonight, the Howard government's failure to take seriously the threat to the ozone layer from methyl bromide. Methyl bromide is less well known as an ozone-depleting substance than chlorofluorocarbons or halons but it is a major ozone depletant. Molecule for molecule, methyl bromide is a much more potent destroyer of ozone than are chlorofluorocarbons. That is why the international community at the Montreal protocol resolved on a general phase-out of methyl bromide by 1 January 2005-that is, 1 January next year. They did agree to allow countries to put forward applications for exemption in certain limited circumstances, which are known as and are referred to as critical use exemptions. Decision 1X/6 states that a use of methyl bromide should qualify as critical only if (1) all techthem. nical and economically feasible steps have been taken to minimise the critical use and any associated emission of methyl bromide; (2) methyl bromide is not available in sufficient quantity and quality from existing stocks; and (3) an appropriate effort is being made to evaluate, commercialise and secure national regulatory approval of alternatives and substitutes. The Montreal protocol established a technical and economic assessment panel to consider applications for exemptions from the methyl bromide ban. Thirteen countries sought exemptions from the ban. The United States sought 13 exemptions and Australia sought five. The technical and economic assessment panel met in May last year but could not agree on its recommendations. It met again in October and included a new category, ‘noted', in addition to the previous categories of ‘recommended' and ‘not recommended'. My understanding is that the assessment panel in noting these applications really believed that there are alternatives to the use of methyl bromide, so it was not prepared to recommend them. Seven of the 13 countries had some of their applications assessed as ‘noted', including Australia, the United States and Belgium. In November, the parties to the Montreal protocol met in Nairobi. The United States said they wanted their applications to be ‘recommended' rather than ‘noted'. Some of the other countries, to their credit, said, ‘No, we're not prepared to approve the applications in the ‘noted' category.' So there was a stalemate in Nairobi. The critical use exemptions issue for methyl bromide is presently unresolved. I am advised that, in two days time, the technical advice committee will meet in Los Angeles to try to resolve the deadlock by reconsidering applications in the ‘noted' category with a view to either recommending them or not recommending This will be followed by a full meeting of the parties in March to try to finalise the issue. I believe the Australian government's obligations are clear. Instead of supporting this dodgy category of ‘noted', we should join with those countries that are refusing to exempt any methyl bromide uses which the scientific and technical advice committee will not explicitly support. We should not join with the United States or any other country looking for loopholes in the fight to repair the hole in the ozone layer. With all the research and development that has been done, there are alternatives to methyl bromide. People in industry have been given years to get their house in order and move to alternatives. It is time the Howard government told them to get on with repairing the damage to the ozone layer which methyl bromide has been causing. Environment: Tuggerah Lakes",121
138,Mr TICEHURST,ADJOURNMENT,"Dobell) (9.05 p.m.)Last Friday night, over 300 concerned and frustrated residents in my electorate of Dobell gathered at a public meeting at The Entrance High School to protest against the New South Wales Labor government and Wyong Labor councillors' plans to dump 15,000 cubic metres of silt from congested Tumbi Creek into the jewel of the Central Coast-that is, Tuggerah Lakes. I have strongly campaigned against plans to disperse the dredged spoil onto the lake bed. The support I have received along the way from local families, fishermen, environmentalists and businesspeople who are concerned about the impact of these plans on the lake has been overwhelming. Last Friday's meeting was no different. People in my electorate and beyond are angry that the New South Wales government, owner of the lake system, and representatives of Wyong Council, manager of the lakes, are shirking responsibility on this issue that has far-reaching effects. What amazes me is how the New South Wales government and local Labor councillors can ignore the plea for help from the people they are supposed to represent. Not one Labor representative was present at Friday's meeting. The firm commitment of $340,000 of federal money to assist in doing this job properly by having the sludge from Tumbi Creek carted away is still on offer to Wyong Shire Council and the New South Wales government. We now have to keep making noise as a community to encourage the New South Wales government and local state MPs to provide their fair share of funding. Opposition leader Mark Latham recently visited the Central Coast. I took this opportunity to challenge him to seek a common sense approach from his local Labor Party colleagues over the Tumbi Creek issue. The member for Werriwa's response was to accuse me of political point scoring. He claims that he would like to see the federal and governments working together. Mr Latham, if this is true, why are you not urging your state Labor colleagues to adopt a common sense approach to this important issue that is in the interests of hundreds of residents and our local fishing and tourism industries? My approach has been straightforward and from the heart from day one. We cannot allow up to 15,000 cubic metres of silt to be removed from the mouth of Tumbi Creek and dumped into what is already a shallow estuarine lake. It is that simple. I am disappointed that the Labor Party has pulled together on this issue in a stubborn attempt to play party politics with our environment. At no point has my fight for federal funding to have the sludge removed from the site been supported by any elected member of the Australian Labor Party. Our environment is worth much more than that and I urge the Leader of the Opposition to take some leadership on this issue rather than just use more political rhetoric. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: use your clout to change your Labor colleagues' focus towards the best possible outcome for our precious lakes. I will now briefly outline the poor record of Labor candidates and their representatives on Tumbi Creek. Grant MCBride, the state member for The Entrance, failed to lobby the Carr Labor government to match federal government funding for the Tumbi Creek project. He publicly supported removing the sludge from the creek and dumping it into Tuggerah Lakes. The Hon. Craig Knowles, the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning and Minister for Natural Resources, failed to respond to the offer of financial assistance to have the sludge removed from the Tumbi Creek site made by the federal Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, Ian Campbell. Wyong Shire Labor councillor state Bill Thompson actively disrupted my meetings and press conferences at Tumbi Creek. Both Councillor Thompson and fellow Labor councillor Kath Forster voted against Councillor Brenton Pavier's recision motion to stop council plans to dump sludge in the lake. Paul Crittenden, the state member for Wyong, has not made any public comment on the plan to dump sludge into Tuggerah Lakes, even when Tuggerah Lakes is the centrepiece of his state electorate. David Mehan, the Labor candidate for Dobell, has not made any public comment on the plan to dump sludge into Tuggerah Lakes and irresponsibly organised and attended non-related protests at the site of Tumbi Creek to coincide with the visit to the site by the federal Minister for the Environment and Heritage, David Kemp. The state Labor government's response to public pressure was to add eight more licence conditions before the sludge dumping could proceed. This forced the issue past the March council elections. In conclusion, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the local Wyong action group-Wyong Action to Curb Highrise Committee for Envirocare Inc; known as the WATCH committee-for coordinating this public meeting to encourage people to express their concern about the future of Tuggerah Lakes. I would like to thank the local residents for supporting my campaign. I have been obviously frustrated because the federal government has no direct jurisdiction over the lake system. (Time expired) Throsby Electorate: Port Kembla Infrastructure",122
139,Ms GEORGE,ADJOURNMENT,"Throsby) (9.10 p.m.)Unfortunately, while parliament will be sitting here next week there will be a visit to my electorate by the New South Wales legislative council standing committee which is inquiring into port infrastructure in the of New South Wales. I will not be there to meet with the committee and give my views to it, although I have submitted them in ing. So for the public record I take this opportunity tonight to state my wholehearted support for the New South Wales state government's Ports Growth Plan, specifically in relation to the proposed expansion of the port at Port Kembla, which is located in my electorate. The proposal to enhance container trade at Port Kembla, together with a motor vehicle importing facility, will have significant employment outcomes for the area and for the region as a whole. The Port Kembla port already has a proven track record in successfully managing both container and vehicle handling operations. With the local downturn in employment in the traditional industries of coal and steel, blue-collar jobs, entry level opportunities for young people and apprenticeship opportunities are sadly on the decline. Indeed, the Illawarra's rate of youth unemployment, at around 35 per cent, is among the highest in the nation. While we have seen employment opportunities open up in the service sector and in the education and knowledge based occupations, a critical priority is the need to address future blue-collar opportunities and entry level jobs for our young people. The proposed expansion and diversification of Port Kembla's trade will not only create hundreds of such jobs, both direct and indirect, but will also, in my view, deliver significant flow-on dividends as companies come into the region to establish support facilities, particularly in transport, warehousing and distribution. Those proposals, which are contained in the government's recommendations, have my full support. There have been a number of suggestions made to me by my constituents about what else might be part of the committee's inquiry. state One such proposal-and it is an opportune time to consider whether or not it is feasible-is to establish a dry dock facility as part writ- of Port Kembla's planned port expansion. Port Kembla is ideally placed to ease the burden on Sydney because of its proximity to southern and south-west Sydney. In time, and with the proposed expansion of the multipurpose berth, I believe it is feasible that Port Kembla could handle between 50,000 and 100,000 containers and hundreds of thousands of tonnes of general bulk cargo per year. As we showed during the Sydney Olympics, we can in time also handle up to about 300,000 cars through the port each year. I believe the expansion proposals will have extremely positive economic, employment and social impacts. I am hoping that in the development of the port we will see that rail will play a major role in transport to from Port Kembla. I would not want to see all the increased trade being carried on our road system. In that regard, as constituents have suggested to me, it would be a good idea for the committee to inquire into both the costs and opportunities that completion of the Maldon-Dumbarton rail link would provide for the possible entry of goods into Western Sydney. To maximise the port's potential, I would also ask the committee of inquiry to urge both state and federal governments to give much greater priority to the urgent need to upgrade the Princes Highway. As Port Kembla is in an established industrial precinct, expansion plans should have only limited environmental and social impacts. The area proposed for the container terminal, for example, is well removed from residential areas. One thing that I would suggest to the committee of inquiry is that, in undertaking the expansion works, any likely impacts of dredging and the means of disposal that are to be adopted be such that we can assure the community that there will be no negative environmental impacts on the harbour's water quality and marine life. In conclusion, I am totally behind the state ernment's port growth plan and the significant benefits that will flow. I ask the tee to give further consideration to the matters raised by my constituents. (Time expired) Roads: Scoresby Freeway",124
140,Mr BILSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Dunkley) (9.15 p.m.)There is no single endeavour that will enhance the viability, vitality and living standards of our region more than a toll-free Scoresby Freeway. Mr Murphy-Oh, no.",125
141,Mr BILSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I am glad the Labor Party say, ‘Oh, no,' because that is all you get to hear from them. They do not actually and speak up anywhere for the project. Labor representatives in my community are an absolute disgrace. Tolls will undermine the viability of the project, impose great expense on local motorists and deny our region many of the anticipated benefits. Now is the time to speak up for a toll-free Scoresby Freeway. The state Labor government are not interested in the eastern and south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne, and their local state Labor representatives are a disgrace. Many of them sit in parliament under false pretences: they promise a toll-free Scoresby Freeway and then, just weeks after the election, they back the Bracks tollway proposal. It is now clear that the ill-conceived Bracks tollway will need hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars thrown at it as a subsidy to even make the tollway viable. These funds would pay for the state's share of the costs of building a toll-free Scoresby Freeway, for which the federal government has its $445 million half share already on the table. A toll-free Scoresby Freeway is what the people were promised. It is what our region needs, and it will deliver the greatest benefits to the communities involved, the gov- motorists and the national economy for the taxpayer funds invested in the project. In the commitcoming weeks the state Labor government needs to decide if it will enshrine its contempt for the people of the eastern and south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne or support the Howard government in delivering to our communities the same toll-free access to crucial road infrastructure that has driven growth and investment in the north and west of Melbourne. Premier Bracks's attempts to dismiss the deep and heartfelt community opposition to his plans to impose crippling tolls on the Mitcham-Frankston tollway have incensed the broad coalition of community and business members, motorists and civic leaders campaigning for ‘No tolls on Scoresby'. I have offered to bring together the ‘No tolls' coalition partners that span all sections of community to meet with the Premier to ensure that the state government gets the message about the depth of community feeling and the strength of the ‘No tolls' case. The majority of Frankston City councillors, the RACV, eminent transport economist Dr John Cox and the presidents of the Frankston Business Chamber and the Ringwood Chamber of Commerce joined me at the launch of my ‘No tolls' billboard and presented the views, the expert analysis and the relevant facts about the disadvantages caused by the state government's tollway plans. Instead of listening to these views, Premier Bracks dismissed the ‘No tolls' call as straight politics, implying that I was simply trying to advance my own stocks in an election campaign. Nothing would please me more than to not have the Scoresby Freeway as an election issue. It is an election issue because people in my community and in the east and the south-east of Melbourne were promised a toll-free freeway and that is not what they are being given by the state government. For it not to be an election issue, it is quite simple: all Mr Bracks has to do is to do what he promised, to do what he said, and to fulfil the undertaking he gave to all the communities that I and my federal colleagues right through the corridor represent. So it is not about me, Mr Bracks; it is about the freeway, the road, and the crucial need for the state Labor government to honour its toll-free Scoresby election promise and do the right thing by the people we represent. The Premier's arrogant dismissal of widespread community feeling in the face of absolutely compelling evidence about the disadvantage our community will face as a result of his decision to break his toll-free Scoresby Freeway election promise shows what our community is up against. Mr Bracks is either not interested in the well-being and interests of our community or plainly our not aware of the disadvantage he is imposing on us and the dud deal our community will face for a generation. Our communities are entitled to the same arterial ring-road infrastructure enjoyed by the north and west of Melbourne that has driven investment and opportunity in these areas without tolls. The Premier's appalling reaction to our community's call for a tollfree Scoresby Freeway is entirely consistent with the inactivity and roll-over attitude of local state Labor MPs who have done absolutely nothing to stand up for the interests of our community. They are either indifferent or indignant when you raise with them their lack of activity. They are offended that we would expose such a hopeless representation of our community interests. They stand condemned. They are an appalling disgrace for the misrepresentations they have foisted upon our communities. The lack of voice and understanding of local Labor MPs has added to the state government's reckless disregard for the importance of a toll-free Scoresby Freeway for our region. If Mr Bracks goes ahead with his plan to toll the Scoresby Freeway, the future vitality and living standards of our communities will be nobbled and our motorists, businesses, employees and tourists will be saddled with a dud deal for a generation. (Time expired) Trade: Free Trade Agreement",125
142,Mr MURPHY,ADJOURNMENT,"Lowe) (9.20 p.m.)Yesterday morning, only two days after the Beattie Labor government was resoundingly re-elected in the Queensland state election, Australians were greeted by the news that the Howard government had signed a new trade deal with President Bush. The timing of the completion of negotiations for this free trade agreement could not be more cynical when you consider that Queensland sugar farmers will receive no benefit from this agreement. They were promised the world but were sacrificed, as the government explains, for the greater good. That is utilitarianism at its best. The Prime Minister is demanding we all vote for his deal with President Bush. My colleagues and my constituents have every right to be suspicious of an agreement conducted in a fire brigade environment and behind closed doors, and not signed off until after the Queensland election. I applaud Premier Peter Beattie for being honest with the people of Queensland about sugar before the election, unlike Mr Springborg, who should hang his head in shame. Australians have, from bitter experience, learned that they cannot automatically rely on any assertion or guarantee made by the Prime Minister or President Bush. Australians expect any FTA this parliament approves to overwhelmingly benefit Australia's interests. When I speak with my constituents in Lowe, they say that they expect the opposition to be certain of the benefits of any FTA before supporting it. I am listening to their concerns. Does anyone seriously believe that, in a US presidential election year, President George Bush would sign off on an agreement that will greatly advantage Australia but not the United States of America? People fear the FTA will undermine Australia's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme or that the FTA will allow the United States to overwhelm Australia's television and film industries by abandoning local content rules. Until the detail of this more than 500-page FTA is made available and discussed openly, no-one can responsibly support this so-called sweet deal. My constituents understand very well that the Prime Minister's carefully spun assurances on this issue are not enough. They well remember his statements about never, ever introducing a GST, when he reported that refugees threw their children overboard and when he said that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. No-one can seriously expect the Australian parliament to blindly take the Prime Minister's word for it when considering the free trade agreement. Labor will not support a free trade agreement that harms Australia's PBS-that is, hurts Australians who cannot afford higher prices for medicines. Labor will not support an FTA that hurts hard working families. Why has the Howard government apparently agreed to an appeals mechanism whereby industry can challenge the decisions of the committee that advises the government on PBS listings? Is this an attack on the PBS by the back door? There is no doubt the FTA requires parliamentary scrutiny. We live in a world of dynamic international systems. World Bank president, Australian Mr James Wolfensohn, expressed his concern on the ABC's 7.30 Report a little over two hours ago. He made this point in the Australian on 4 February 2004. In part, the article reported: “I'm a bit ambivalent personally about Australia's free trade agreement,” he said. It was a good thing that Australia remained close to the USbut not at the expense of the multilateral trade rules under the World Trade Organisation. WTO talks broke down spectacularly in Cancun when developing countries walked out, with the most divisive issue in the reluctance of the US and Europe to stop protecting farmers through tariff barriers and heavy subsidies. If the Australia-US deal encouraged the tendency towards exclusive trading blocs, Wolfensohn said: … he would “have to think very carefully” whether it was worthwhile… … … “… it would abe a tragedy, I think, if the world fragmented into regional trade arrangements-it leaves people and we can't leave people out.” Over time, our good relationships with other countries will be tested by the effects of this deal. James Wolfensohn is a great Australian. He is credited with the revision of methodology for international accounting and with working hard to find ways to reduce the poverty of billions of people. I owe it to the stituents I represent to be certain that this or any other FTA not only is in the best interests of Australian industry but also benefits Australian families and consumers. It is absolutely farcical to think that the opposition can respond to a more than 500-page document which is crucial to the future of Australia in two days and stand up here and say we support it. I reiterate that the parliament needs scrutinise that agreement very closely. Environment: Water Management",126
143,Mr FORREST,ADJOURNMENT,"Mallee) (9.25 p.m.)One thing that the current drought has done for the Australian nation is to focus the attention of the people on the issue of water. There are over 13 million who are currently enduring some level of water restriction, which is staggering. I know that the Standing Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has been labouring away on an inquiry for the last two years on this national issue of the importance of water, which constitutionally belongs with the states. As a member of that committee I do not want to talk about that except to say that it highlighted my interest. If we are ever going to grow as a nationand as an engineer I have said this for a long time-at our current per capita consumption of water we have already reached our population limit. In that sense, the issue has focused the attention of the nation. Tonight I speak in reference to how that affects my … own constituency in the north-west of Victoria. Members in this place will be sick of hearing from me about the need to pipe the Wimmera-Mallee stock and domestic supply system. It is an iconic national project, a scheme which supplies channelled water through leaky channels to almost one-third of the geographic area of the state of Victoria, from one source in the Grampian Mountains in the south. It is the largest open chancon- nel system in the world and an engineering achievement of its time. It took 67 years to build and it brought water to the very arid regions of the north-west of Victoria which enabled the productive grain and pastoral developments to occur out there. But in these modern times a system that loses such a vast amount of water, to the tune of 200,000 megalitres every year-and I have heard it to anecdotally said that this is equivalent to a line of swimming pools from Melbourne to Darwin-needs the advantage of modern technology to have it piped and have efficient supply systems put in. I am really proud of my record in the last 10 years as the member for Mallee to have brought this issue to the nation's attention and to stand here tonight and say that one-third of the scheme is already piped, and that has taken eight years. I am looking forward to the time when, with the support of the member for Corangamite, who has taken an active interest in this project, we can stand here and say that it has all been completed. As an issue that is of entirely state jurisdiction, this project has attracted the support and interest of the Commonwealth because it saves water and it is a region located in the Murray-Darling Basin. In response to requests from the state of Victoria, the Commonwealth in the last eight years has in partnership provided capital funding to ensure that this important scheme is piped and that the dreams of a previous generation-of almost 60 years ago-are achieved. I know my own grandfather talked about the need to pipe the Wimmera-Mallee. We could not afford-and this was 50 years ago-to see such a huge amount of water wasted. In the last three years this particular region of Victoria has been subjected to some of the most severe water restrictions of any region in Australia, given the drought. The storages in the Grampians got down to as low as six per cent and if it had not been for reasonable rainfall in August the constituency that I represent would have been confronted with the reality of water being carted in tankers to supply the townships and the stock of domestic needs of the region. The Commonwealth has been in partnership with the states funding the capital needs. We have funded a feasibility and business case, which is currently before the government for its consideration, and I am looking forward to a positive response to that in meeting the ongoing needs of that water scheme.",128
