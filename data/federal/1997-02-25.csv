2,Mr SPEAKER,HANSARD RECORD,"After question time yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Dobell asked a series of questions relating to the proof Hansard report of an answer given by the Prime Minister on 13 February 1997. I have checked on this matter and I am advised by the Secretary to the Department of the Parliayou mentary Reporting Staff that the words in question were omitted by the Hansard editor in accordance with Hansard style before the greens were sent to the Prime Minister's office. No request was made, directly or indirectly, to Hansard by the Prime Minister or his office before or after the greens were despatched. As all honourable members would be to aware, Hansard is the official edited report the proceedings of the House. It is not, mentioned yesterday, and never has been a involved verbatim transcript. The editing guidelines which Hansard follows provide for members' contributions to be reported substantially verbatim, with no unnecessary additions. Repetitions and redundancies are omitted obvious mistakes and false starts rected. However, nothing is left out which adds to the meaning of a speech or illustrates an argument. I have viewed the tape and am satisfied that the Hansard report reflects accurately the Prime Minister's response to the question.",13
3,Mr BEAZLEY,HANSARD RECORD,That may be the Hansard I style but did you not get it changed to the Prime Minister's style? It was a more accurate reflection of his attitude.,13
4,Mr SPEAKER,HANSARD RECORD,Order! NA Bougainville,13
5,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is ada press dressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Have you seen Sir Julius Chan's media release of yesterday in which he admitted having engaged the mercenaries Sandline International but only to give training to the PNG Defence Force, not to assassinate the leadership of the BRA? Did Sir Julius assert that Sandline International was engaged on the basis of options developed 'with international advice from both Australia and other countries, both from private and government sources'? Did Sir Julius refer to Australia as the 'country which endorsed the strategy in the first place' and did he claim that both you and Prime Minister Howard had been briefed by him to deal with what he described as 'sensationalist' media reports? Minister, do consider Sir Julius's assertions to be accurate and truthful? If you do not accept his account of the matter, what further measures will you now take to dissuade him from pursuing such a disastrous course of action?",13
6,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. As he rightly points out, Sir Julius Chan yesterday evening issued a press statement which I have had occasion read. We note that Sir Julius has responded of to our expressions of concern with a message as I that the foreign organisations in PNG are only in training activities. I can tell the honourable member that the message Sir Julius transmitted in his press release was similar to what he said to me and, I think I am right in saying, also to the Prime Minister and in the conversations we had with him about are corthese alleged activities. In any case, whatever the merits of using such organisations for that purpose may be, we remain of the view that we would be deeply concerned if it were to eventuate that their role extends to active operations on Bougainville or elsewhere. That position was, think, made crystal clear both privately and publicly to Sir Julius Chan, to other ministers of the Papua New Guinea government and to this House by both the Prime Minister and me yesterday. I do not really think we could put our position more clearly than that. I also note that the Papua New Guinea Minister for Foreign Affairs has also released statement during the course of today. He has made very similar points to the points made by Sir Julius Chan-that is, the Papua New Guinea government intends to use this company to help train Papua New Guinea soldiers, or words to that effect, and not as part of some operation on Bougainville. As I have said, we remain of the view that if it were to eventuate that mercenaries were to be used on Bougainville we would be deeply concerned about it, and we do not really want to add anything more today to what we said yesterday. I would make this point in relation to claims that Australia agreed somehow to mercenary training: Australia was not advised by Papua New Guinea of its intention to hire mercenary forces. Had we been so advised we would have strongly counselled against such a move and the House would have expected us to do that. The Department of Defence has not suggested at any stage that mercenaries have a role to play in Papua New Guinea's security. Immunisation",13
7,Ms WORTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Is the minister aware of concerns in the Australian community about the disastrous results of failing to fully immunise against childhood diseases such as measles, diphtheria and whooping cough? Is the minister aware that most Australian parents support childhood immunisation? How will the government give Australian children the greatest possible opportunity for protection against killer childhood diseases?",14
8,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. Childhilod infectious diseases are something that ll1-I:ly people believe have vanished. I am 40 yc,lrs old and I have had very little experience with these myself. Any parent younger than me would have not seen measles, german measles or whooping cough, hut they are still in the Australian community. Last year 4,000 children had whooping cough. Four died. Five hundred children had measles; 2,500 children had german measles. People forget what the results of these illnesses can be. Whooping cough can be very nasty. There are long. prolonged coughing spasms. The child g,hpS for breath. There can be vomiting. There can be convulsions. There can br rrn'-anent hrain damage. Epidemics of whooping cough are utterly preventable. Measles is not a trivial illness. One in every 25 children that gets measles will develop pneumonia. One in 2,000 will get inflammation of the brain. One in 2,500 will have permanent brain damage. One in 20,000 will die. Measles is utterly preventable. The government has decided that it is time we took this as seriously as possible. As such, I am pleased to inform honourable members that we will be instituting a series of radical and tough proposals that will lift Australia's immunisation rates to an acceptable level. Briefly, the components are designed to address different parts of the problem. You have got to look at young kids because even today no more than 70 per cent of children under two years are properly immunised in Australia. So we will be splitting the maternity allowance, increasing it slightly and paying it in two parts-one part at birth, the other part at 18 months linked to completed childhood immunisation. We will also be making child-care assistance and the childcare cash rebate dependent on completed immunisation. This will address older children. There are some parents who will conscientiously object. There are other parents who may not wish their children to be immunised because of medical reasons. As a father of young children and as a former medical practitioner, I understand these concerns but I do not agree with them. However, we will be allowing vehicles for conscientious objection and we will be allowing vehicles for children with medical contraindications. In the end, it will be just as much effort to not immunise your children as to immunise them. The other elements are that, if you want to have a look at what is different iii Australia from other countries, no-one has responsibility in Australia. We will be looking to make general practitioners responsible and tyin-- the better practice payment into outcomes of completed immunisation. Of children under six years of age, 93 per cent see GPs on average seven times a year, something that surprises mp.;t men and does not surprise many mothers. GPs are ideally placed to fill this role. We will also be attempting to stop a measles epidemic. These come fairly regularly. The next one is predicted in 1999. We will undertake a massive measles catch-up campaign to immunise as many adolescents as we can. No child is hurt by being immunised twice against measles. Many are hurt by not being immunised at all. Together with some other measures which I will detail to the House later, this will mean we do not have to as a country any longer tolerate the situation where our children are dying of utterly preventable illnesses. Small Business",14
9,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is a good initiative, Minister. I congratulate you on it. My question is, however, directed to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. Has the minister's attention been drawn to the latest Yellow Pages Australia small business survey, which shows huge disenchantment with the Howard government with 80 per cent of small businesses believing the Howard government's policies are either working against them or having no real impact, support for the government's policies during the course of the year, according to the survey, having halved from the position of last May? Given your continued ineffectiveness in delivering a response to the Bell report, when are you actually going to do something for small business, like pick up the legislation we have introduced in this place? Or are you going to compete with Amanda Vanstone for the failed minister French champagne prize?  Leader of the Opposition for his question. Indeed, it is about time the opposition looked beyond the press headlines and looked at the detail. In fact, this is an opposition that wants to talk down small business and make things bad for them. But let us look at the headline. The headline went on to say that 80 per cent of small business proprietors believe the Howard government policies are working against them. But if you look at the detail of the survey and go to that very point, you see the question: In what ways has the Howard government adversely affected small business? Answer: 80 per cent said they haven't affected small business. But let us look at the rest of the survey. The story gets better. On the question of sales and profits-read it-the text says: Around two-thirds of small business expect increased sales and increased profits in the next 12 months. While you are trying to talk down what we are doing, while you are trying to talk down small business, our initiatives are actually helping them. If you then go and have a look at the question of interest rates and at the impact of lower interest rates, something that my colleague the Treasurer has constantly referred to, you see that 57 per cent report that lower interest rates have either already improved their situation or will improve their situation in the next 12 months. This is an opposition that want to talk down small business, that want to find all the bad things about small business. They do not want to look at the positive things, the hopes and aspirations. In fact, if you look at the initiatives we have taken, we have planted the seed for a very great and prosperous crop to grow. We have set the seed so that small business can flourish, and what do you do? You in fact encourage them not to plant the crop.",15
10,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"From the same page, has the minister seen where it says, 'supportive, 20 per cent, works against, 22, no impact, 58'? Mr Reith-On a point of order, Mr Speaker: a supplementary question has to elucidate further the answer given. Mr Speaker, the minister has fully answered the question. In fact, the minister has so totally demolished the question that a supplementary question is clearly out of order.",15
11,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank both the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the House. The question, in so far as I could detect, was answered completely and there is no point of order. Extortion",15
12,Mr LIEBERMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice. It concerns the Arnott's extortion issue. Having regard to the huge losses caused to Amott's, the potential danger, unfortunately, to many Australians, and the loss of hundreds of jobs, will the Attorney-General agree to raise with all Attorneys-General the urgent need for severe penalties in the states and territories? Will the Attorney-General consider recommending that much stronger penalties be immediately int-oduced a.gainst extortionists such as those Involved In the Arnott's issue?",15
13,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Indi for his question. The threat to contaminate Arnott's biscuits highlights the need for appropriate offences to ensure this type of conduct is properly punished. There are extortion, endangerment or threat offences in the various jurisdictions which carry maximum penalties of up to 15 years imprisonment and which would, to varying degrees, apply to the type of conduct we have recently witnessed in relation to the Amott's threat. The Victorian Crimes Act 1958 provides a specific contamination offence with a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment and ACT law provides a maximum 20-year penalty for an offence of making demands accompanied by threats where the threat involves a threat to kill. I intend to take this matter up with my counterparts in the states and territories. Consultation with them is best achieved through existing expert committees established by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. The model criminal code officers committee is currently developing a report on non-fatal offences against the person and will in fact be meeting early in March to consider whether a specific contamination offence, such as that in the Victorian act, is necessary and whether existing penalties are adequate. Given the disruption and damage caused by the recent Amott's threat, I will ask the model criminal code officers committee to consider seriously whether a special offence with higher penalties should be included in the model criminal code. In that way, Australia may be able to achieve a uniform approach to this very damaging activity. Social Security Beneficiaries: CPI Calculations",16
14,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. I refer him to reports today that the Australian Bureau of Statistics is working on a new statistical measure of inflation to replace the existing consumer price index. Will the Treasurer guarantee that all social security beneficiaries, including families, pensioners and unemployed people, will not be made worse off by any change in the method of calculating the CPI? In particular, will he guarantee that if increases are less under any new measure than they would be under the existing CPI measure, the existing measure will continue to prevail?",16
15,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The ABS is considering revising its methodology in relation to the collection of information and the announcement of the consumer price index. It is doing that because around the world the discussion is going on as to what are the most appropriate measures of doing that. You would be aware, no doubt, that the US authorities have recently changed the way in which they calculate price movements in the United States. The reason why you try to improve your methodology all the time is so that you get the most accurate index. And once you get the most accurate index, you index to that index; that is the whole point. You would not come up with a new CPI and say, This is the proper measure of the way in which prices have moved but we will try to harness benefits to an improper method.' The sole reason for doing it is to ensure that you have the most accurate available figures, and that you index to the most accurate available figures, so that benefits move in line with prices. That is the sole object of it. I do not know whether the ABS will or will not come up with a new measure. It certainly was not initiated by me. Mr Gareth Evans-You'll stick it in your pocket, though, won't you?",16
16,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can assure you of one thing, and that is that, once we get the most accurate measure, we will use the accurate measure. Mr Gareth Evans-With all the reductions that entails, as in the US?",16
17,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And I would have thought that you would have us do no other thing. We will use the accurate measure. Mr Speaker, he really is getting himself worked up today. He must have picked up the changes in the US when he was at President Clinton's inauguration when he went over, no doubt, to look at the state of the US economy. Mr Crean-And what about Alan Greenspan?",17
18,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,17
19,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, we do like to see you amused! He came back and he asked the CEDA whether he could make an economic speech. I do not know why he keeps doing this to the CEDA. What has the CEDA ever done to you that you keep inviting yourself down to speak with them? And he came out with the opposition's economic analysis. It was the first sentence of the opposition's economic analysis to the CEDA. It went like this: 'The Australian economy mayor may not be on the verge of a pick-up.' It may be day or it may be night. It may be up or it may be down. We might be Liberal or we might be Labor. But the one thing you can be sure of is that you would not understand it. Anthrax",17
20,Mrs STONE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. As the minister is aware, there is currently an outbreak of anthrax, the stock disease, in the Goulburn Valley. This outbreak is of unusual duration and intensity. What is this government doing to ensure that both domestic and export markets are reassured of the safety of all products processed from this area?",17
21,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question and recognise the very real interest that she has in this matter. Australian meat and dairy products are produced under systems of world-class standards, which maximise both quality and safety for our customers-a matter that I have spoken on sometimes in this House. In the case of anthrax in a small area of northern Victoria, stringent controls have been implemented, including property quarantine and vaccination of cattle. It should be said that Australia has a national control system for animals which enjoys very strong respect across all of our export markets. This has been reinforced directly by senior Australian personnel to our key markets and supported by assurances from my colleague the Minister for Health and Family Services and me. Further to this, yesterday I released a joint statement with the Victorian Deputy Premier, Pat MCNamara, carrying endorsement from 10 leading industry and government authorities. There has been no perceptible impact on trade of dairy products, as a result of the careful and detailed processes followed by industry, the Victorian government and the Commonwealth government. I can assure the honourable member that the government is working closely with industry bodies to ensure that the trade is kept fully briefed and across all relevant issues. I commend the dedicated and effective work of all those involved, which has ensured that neither our export nor domestic markets have been closed. Austudy",17
22,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, are you aware that your Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, told the Senate yesterday that she apparently knew last year of the administrative bungle concerning Austudy? When precisely did she inform the Prime Minister of that fiasco? Was it before or after you gave her the bottle of French champagne? Did she blame her department at the time that she informed you of the debacle, before her public apology without responsibility-the new hallmark of the Howard government-or is it the case that the Prime Minister was rewarding her for annihilating the hopes of thousands of young Australians, including many from rural and regional Australia, who can no longer aspire to a tertiary education?",17
23,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Both the minister and me have already indicated to the Senate and to the House that the introduction of an actual means test-a principle, I might remind the Leader of the Opposition, which was employed by you when you were in governmentMr Beazley interjecting",17
24,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I repeat that what was adopted here was a principle which was endorsed by the Labor Party when it was in office. The minister has already indicated that there were administrative flaws. She has apologised and she is putting the thing right. Building Industry: Sick Leave,18
25,Mr MCARTHUR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Has the minister seen recent reports about a proposed portable sick leave scheme for the building industry in Victoria? What are the implications of such a scheme?,18
26,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Corangamite for his timely question. I am aware of discussions within certain quarters of the building industry in Victoria to the effect of the possibilities of implementing a portable sick leave scheme. I want to make it very clear that this federal government is opposed to such schemes, and we would call on those involved not to implement such a scheme. I would hope that, after consideration, the opposition would share that view, because it is consistent with the view that they themselves had in government and which is now the centrepiece of our industrial relations policy-that is, that trial relations in this country should be moving to a greater focus on the enterprise so pay and conditions are increasingly determined by agreement between employers and employees at the particular workplace. An industry run sick leave scheme would be a major backwards step for the building industry. I do welcome the rejection of this proposal and its consideration by the national council of Master Builders Australia at the weekend. Not only would such a scheme add to costs in the building industry-costs that would inevitably be passed on to customers of the industry, which in the long run is a cost to the whole community-but an industry sick leave scheme would be taking industrial relations precisely in the wrong direction. An enterprise focus does encourage more direct relationships between employers and employees and promotes innovation and greater competitiveness. An industry scheme would undermine all of these. It would, for example, prevent firms in the building industry from adopting some of the innovative arrangements in regard to sick leave that have been successfully implemented in many firms in other industries, such as uncapped sick leave, sick leave pooled on a team basis, et cetera, where those arrangements have been to the benefit of both employers and employees. A portable sick leave scheme, by diffusing responsibility for the cost impact of sick leave, would inevitably encourage rorting and would reduce the incentive to manage the incidence of sick leave effectively. In conclusion, I appreciate that the proponents of such a scheme would claim that it would be a voluntary arrangement. We all know from the history of such schemes in the building industry and in other parts of the Australian economy that what starts out as a voluntary arrangement ends up as a compulsory arrangement. It is not a good idea. We stand opposed to it and we call on those who are entertaining the idea to dismiss it. Dementia Counselling",18
27,Mr ANDREN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Family Services. Minister, are indusyou aware that the mid-plan report on the national action plan for dementia care noted that the vital importance of dementia counselling services, largely developed through state Alzheimer's associations? Are you aware that the report detailed the significant advantages of co-locating such counsellors with the aged care assessment teams? If you are aware of this, why is the government withdrawing funding for the five rural counsellors in New South Wales, including Orange and Dubbo, and expecting such services to be mainstreamed through the home and community care service, which is under-resourced and underskilled to carry out such a vital service for the increasing number of home based rural dementia patients?",18
28,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the member for Calare for his question. I am aware of that report. I will give the matter consideration and come back to the member with a more detailed report.,18
29,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice. The Attorney-General will be aware of the High Court's Teoh decision which decided that international treaty obligations could create procedural rights in domestic law. The Attorney-General will also be aware that the previous government made an executive statement in response to this and introduced legislation which lapsed with the calling of the last federal election. Can the Attorney-General advise the House what action his government intends to take in response to the Teoh decision?,19
30,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am pleased to advise the House that the government has decided to take further action in response to the decision of the High Court in the Teoh case. This action will take the form of an executive statement, to be issued today jointly by me and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the statement will be followed by legislation. Members will recall that the High Court held that the entry into a treaty by Australia gave rise to a legitimate expectation in administrative law that the executive government and its agencies would act in a manner consistent with the terms of the treaty even if those terms had not been incorporated in domestic law. This gave rise to a procedural right to be heard where an administrative decision maker proposed making a decision inconsistent with the expectation. However, the High Court made it clear that the legitimate expectation at administrative law could be set aside by the government either by legislation or by executive act. Those opposite will recall that the previous government issued an executive statement on 10 May 1995, which set aside, for the past and for the future, expectations based on entry into treaties. We followed this up with legislamatter? tion which lapsed on the calling of the last election. The executive statement to be issued today will reinforce this government's view that the Teoh doctrine detracts from the proper role of the parliament in passing legislation to give effect to treaties. The executive government undoubtedly has power to make Australia a party to a treaty, but it Treaties for the Australian parliaments to change Australian law to implement Australian obligations. Under this government, the parliament has a much greater role even in relation to the executive act of entering into a treaty-and I refer to the new treaty tabling procedures and to the consideration of all treaties by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, which is chaired by the member for Groom. The statement will be prospective. Administrative decisions between 10 May 1995 and the date of the new statement will continue to be covered by the 10 May 1995 statement made by the previous government. This is an issue on which previously there has been bipartisan support. I look forward to a continuation of it. Health Fund Premiums",19
31,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Is the minister aware of today's warning by the Australian Health Insurance Association that health funds would be applying for further significant premium increases early in the year? Does the minister intend to approve any second round increases to further erode the value of his failed health rebates package? Does the minister recall that last August the Prime Minister gave an 'absolute guarantee that any change in future will be as a result of a decision taken at a political level'? If so, how does the minister explain that his own department's submission to the Productivity Commission criticised the premium approval arrangements which the Prime Minister imposed on him? Did the minister read and approve this submission before it was lodged by his department with the Productivity Commission? If so, can the minister explain to the House whether he agrees with his own department or the Prime Minister on this",19
32,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There are about six questions there, but I will attempt to answer as many as I can remember. Obviously, I do not like seeing health fund premiums go up at all. As someone who actually has private health insurance, unlike the majority of people over there, I actually will be affected by them. is It is very interesting that members opposite are crying crocodile tears over the level of private health insurance premiums; the simple fact is that the level they are at today is largely because of the decisions you took in government. You abolished the government contribution to the reinsurance pool; you dropped the Medicare rebate for in-patient services from 85 per cent to 75 per cent; you abolished the Commonwealth bed day subsidy-and the net result of them, according to Access Economics, is that premiums are 39 per cent higher today than they would have been otherwise if you had not made those decisions. So you have no credibility on this issue whatsoever. As for the submission of my department, one of the terms of reference of the Productivity Commission was specificaIIy the most appropriate way of setting premiums. The Productivity Commission, in their draft report, did canvass alternative ways of doing it. The Prime Minister said in August-September last year that we would r-move the delegation that exists in the department and that premium increases would be oversighted by me, the Treasurer and the Prime Minister. We were merely responding to the Productivity Commission's suggestion that there might be other bodies. We did not criticise that. What we said was that PHIAC might be an appropriate body to do it. That is entirely consistent with what the terms of reference for the inquiry were.",19
33,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise to ask a supplementary question. Will the minister give us any indication as to whether he intends to approve any second round increases from funds that have already had increases?",20
34,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question has been dealt with. We will now move on. Mr Lee- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I was wondering whether you could clarify that for me. Are you saying the question was fully answered?",20
35,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am saying that the question has been dealt with to my satisfaction. Regional Forest Agreements,20
36,Mr CAUSLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Are you aware of the serious repercussions on small rural communities of the New South Wales government's recent forest decisions? Did these decisions comply with the adequate scientific and socio-economic studies as required under the national forest policy statement? Could the minister inform the House of the federal government's reaction to the New South Wales government's position?,20
37,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I know that he is very concerned about what is happening in many of his communities. The fact is that the New South Wales government has moved in very seriously pre-emptive ways to declare vast new areas of wilderness and national park ahead of the agreed joint Commonwealth procedures for this matter. The impact on communities in some areas has been little short of devastating: loss of morale, loss of jobs, loss of income. The impact on the community in general terms is huge, as many members will be weII aware. I want to make it plain at the outset that this government is not about wiping out rural communities and rural jobs. We want a quality based, rigorous, scientific process for determining what areas should be forested and what areas should be conserved in the future--one that properly, as part of the process, weights socio-economic factors. I make it quite plain to the House that the Commonwealth will use the comprehensive joint assessment processes, which are now beginning in most regions, to audit the decisions made by New South Wales last year, particularly its new wilderness areas declarations. The Prime Minister has already reserved the Commonwealth's right to come to different conclusions following the scientific assessments if they prove that the Carr government erred with its decisions last year. In this regard, we will be determined to attempt to negotiate balanced regional forest agreements in New South Wales that are based on sound science. We have seen a model in East Gippsland in Victoria-very well accepted by the Australian community, who recognise the quality of what we have done and the value to the community in terms of increased jobs at the same time as preserving conservation values. Our worry is that in New South Wales the Carr government will attempt to use its constitutional responsibility for land management to unilaterally impose its anti-country agenda on rural New South Wales, because that is what it has. We only have to look at the evidence right across Australia to see that-and you people over there ought to take some notice of it because it has a bit to do with why so few of you are from rural New South Wales. We will not be put in a position where the Commonwealth will be blamed for unsatisfactory outcomes. Communities like Gloucester, Bulahdelah, Wingham, Wauchope, Eden, Bombala, Dorrigo, Walcha and others will not be hung out to dry by the Commonwealth. We want a balanced outcome based on good science that recognises that the timber industry and the people and communities dependent on it for their livelihoods are important-just as forests are. Mr Kelvin Thomson-I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. Pursuant to standing order 321, the minister was clearly quoting from a document and I require it to be tabled.",20
38,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They are personal notes. threats Mr Kelvin Thomson-That does not fall outside the ambit of standing order 321, Mr Speaker. He was quoting from that document and I therefore request that it be tabled.",21
39,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Are the notes of a confidential and personal nature? Mr Anderson-Yes.,21
40,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The notes are confidential. Legal Aid,21
41,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, isn't true that in answer to a question on the Sunday program you denied that your ACTU government's decision to cut legal aid was being reviewed? Prime Minister, didn't you give this answer in ignorance of the fact your finance minister and the AttorneyACTU General had prepared a cabinet submission proposing just that? Prime Minister, isn't the continuation of the current crisis in legal due to your failure to be briefed on this subject prior to your appearance on the Sunday program and your inability to accept responsibility for that failure? Isn't the Western Australian Attorney-General, Mr Foss, also deadly accurate in his broadside on your government and the Attorney-General when he said today, 'I would have thought the duty was on you to fix up the mess you have caused'? Prime Minister, will you swallow your pride and let the submission go to cabinet?",21

At a meeting in Melbourne Mr Kelty apparently persuaded the executive that, if the government did not give an assurance that it would not lift from 55 to 60 the age at which "" orkers can that access their superannuati(', 'enefits, the would call a national;tnke. Can't you just imagine them sitting down and saying, 'Last year we had a riot. Whut. will we do this aid year? What about a national ""Kc'! But what are we going to call a national strike over? A proposal to lift the preservation age from 55 to 60.' I read about this in the Sydney Morning Herald, which said: The assistant secretary of the West Australian Trades and Labour Council, Ms Stephanie Mayman, reminded himMr Keltythat unions did not strike when the former Labor Treasurer ... announced a plan in 1992 ... So they are all siting down there, working out what they can do and they are going to have a national strike against a 1992 Labor policy! The article continues: Ms Mayman reflected the views of a number of ACTU executive members that striking would be inappropriate considering Labor's public position They were going to strike against their coalition partner over a 1992 policy! It goes on: In a forceful display, Mr Kelty argued that superannuation benefits were a basic entitlement I am reading from the Sydney Morning Herald.",21
52,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It must be right.,22
53,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It must be right if it is in the Sydney Morning Herald, as the Prime Minister says. The ACTU are like Keystone cops, trying to work up a national strike over a 1992 policy. So Mr Kelty had put on a forceful display, saying that these were basic entitlements. The article continues: He revealed that while Mr Dawkins had backed the idea of lifting the preservation age, he had gained a personal assurance at the time from the  proceed ... So here was another little Kirribilli conspiracy. Dawkins is up here announcing that they are going to lift the preservation age, and there is a side deal with Bill Kelty that it is not going to proceed. This is all back in 1992. I was absolutely flabbergasted by all this because the first I ever knew about this side deal Paul Keating had made not to raise the preservation age, which apparently justifies a national strike against a 1992 policy of a Labor government, was in pulling out 'Saving for our future' in the last budl!('t of the Labor Party released on 9 May J 995. - aid: At the same time the Government has foreshadowed that it will progressively increase the preservation age to age 60 by the 2025 ... So Bill not only did not tell John Dawkins but also he did not tell Ralph Willis, who announced the policy in 1995. So here we are: Bill has a side deal, the ACTU is going to strike against the 1992 policy and where is the ALP, the coalition partner of the ACTU? Where do you think the ALP would stand on this? We had a doorstop from the Leader of the Opposition on 20 February 1997. He was asked about this national strike. He said, 'I think if you can resolve any issue without strikes, you should. I think it is a silly thing for this government to be contemplating those changes to super.' A journalist said, 'Isn't the change from 55 to 60, wasn't that ALP policy in 19927' Mr Beazley said, 'We took a look at it and we didn't do it.' It was in your last budget. You announced it in your last budget in May 1995. This is a Keystone Cops operation. You have the monkey and the organgrinder. When the organ-grinder is the ACTU, where does that leave the monkey?

54,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Mr Reith-You can't look at him; he's down there.,22
55,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He cannot handle the pressure. Minister, on 28 November the Minister for Communications and the Arts told the Senate on your behalf that although your office lent support to the Airservices proposal for a fly-off involving PADS, 'the minister was in no way involved in the subsequent decision by Airservices to purchase PADS'. Yesterday you told the House that, other than some later correspondence between Airserviees and your office, your initial meeting with Mr Gruzman 'is the only involvement we have had in it'. You stated: Once Mr Gruzman brought the issue of this PADS equipment to me and demonstrated it to me here in Parliament House, the whole matter was referred to Airservices Australia. I partook in no other role. How then, Minister, do you explain the letter of 3 September 1996 from your senior adviser, John Wallis, to Airservices chairman, John Forsyth, in which he states: . . . in initial discussions with the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the Hon John Sharp MP, the Chief Executive Officer for that Company, Mr Laurie Gruzman QC, quoted the price per unit as $4,500. This figure was consistently quoted in subsequent discussions between Mr Gruzman and the Minister and myself. Doesn't this show that you were directly involved in the acquisition process?",22
56,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is no, it does not. What it does highlight is the fact that, when Gruzman demonstrated his equipment to Opposition members-In the foyer.",23
57,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In the foyer. In the course his sales pitch he mentioned on people from Airservices Australia contacted my senior adviser, who was present the time of that demonstration with Gruzman, and asked him what was the price that was mentioned by Mr Gruzman. He, turn, responded. The letter you have there there for you to see. You have read it out. have met Mr Gruzman only three times in life. The first time was in the foyer in the ministerial entrance when he demonstrated equipment, the second time was when he handed me a copy of a manual and the third time was when I met him at the Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators annual meeting late last year, at which I was the guest speaker and he was there in attendance. Those are the only occasions I have ever met with him. The only correspondence I personally have ever had with Mr Gruzman or his family was with Mr Anton Gruzman on 21 November, Defence Force. which I tabled yesterday. In that I clearly made it plain to Mr Gruzman that, if he \\ anted us to get involved-that is, me to involved-in anv of this business with PADS, tle was wasting: 'his time. He had to spend of his efforts with Airservices Australia. Mr Speaker, in a(lditiu:: to what I tabled yesterday I wi II table lurther correspondence between Mr Wallis, my senior adviser, and the Chairnl.ln ()f Airservices Australia and also a letter between Mr Forsyth. Chairman Airservices Australia, and me. I think when people have an opportunity to read that correspondence, as I hope the honourable member for Melbourne will do, they will find that everything I have said yesterday, all of the dealings I have had with regard to this matter regarding PADS, have all been designed to try to ensure that Australia and Australians have the best possible equipment necessary and available to help rescue those people lost at sea. Landmines",23
58,Mr TAYLOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer the Mr minister to his comments at last month's medisarmament conference in Geneva about further initiatives by the government in respect of antipersonnel landmines. Can the of minister inform the House of progress with the price. Later these initiatives?,23
59,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable at member for Groom for his question and Mr recognise his and many other members' concerns about the issue of landmines. The in government is making a progressive and is substantive contribution to the international I effort to address the problems caused by the my misuse of landmines. These problems, after all, are not just of theoretical concern. An his estimated 30,000 people will be killed or wounded by antipersonnel landmines in the coming year and that, I think, is something the House should reflect on. The Minister for Defence and I announced in April of last year that Australia would support a global ban on the production, stockpiling, use and transfer of antipersonnel landmines and Australia imposed a unilateral suspension on the operational use of landmines by the Australian In my address to the Conference on Disarmament on 30 January this year, to which get the honourable member referred, I called on that body, as the prime multilateral disarmaall ment negotiating forum, to begin work without delay on a treaty banning antipersonnel landmines, and Au,Lralia is one of 50 countries which participates in a meeting of proban states, the last of which was held in Ottawa in October. Australia \' a, also one of of 115 co-spomnrs of a pro-ban resolution initiated by the United States and adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in December last year. We are pursuing tighter restrictions on landmines through the amended protocol II of the inhumane weapons convention, currently of course the only legally binding international instrument which regulates the use and trade in landmines. Let me just conclude by saying that we are not only operating through international diplomacy to advance the cause of the ban of the use of antipersonnel landmines but also acting in a very practical way on the ground. We are committed to supporting measures to tackle the disaster caused by landmines with money. That is why on 30 January this year in Geneva I announced a contribution of $4 million over three years for mine clearance and rehabilitation work in Cambodia and Mozambique. This announcement comes on top of the $12 million de-mining program for Cambodia and Laos, which I announced on 5 May last year, in addition to the deployment of our army engineers to de-mining programs in Afghanistan, Mozambique, Angola and Cambodia. I am sure the House will agree that Australia has, in recent times, a proud record in its campaign to support a ban on the use of antipersonnel land mines but, more than that, we have used money to achieve practical, on the-ground results to rid countries particularly in our region of these pernicious and evil weapons. Precision Aerial Delivery System",23
60,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. I refer him again to claims that he had no involvement in the PADS fiasco after his initial meeting with Mr Gruzman. Is it a fact that on 3 September 1996 Mr Gruzman sent a detailed four-page letter to you about the process of Airservices acquisition of PADS? The letter begins: Dear Minister, Thanks for your call today. We respond to Mr WallIs' request that we provide a statement of facts ror you to consider. Minister, will you provide the House with all details of all your actions and meetings with Mr Gruzman and Airservices regarding PADS prior to your obvious attempt to distance yourself from PADS on November 21 because it had blown up in your face?",24
61,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the honourable member for Melbourne had been sensible enough to look at the package of stuff that I have just tabled in the House, he would have found that the letter he referred to and quoted from, from Mr Laurie Gruzman dated 3 September, was part of the package. Indeed, I shall refer to that letter from Mr Laurie Gruzman. It says: Dear Ministerhe then forgot to add in the title over it; it says 'PADS purchase-For Mr John Wallis'Thanks for your call today. Mr Speaker, you might be interested to know that, rather than Mr Gruzman calling me, as he implies in the first sentence, he did not call me-he is mistaken in his letter there-but called my senior adviser, Mr John Wallis. I have also included in that package of correspondence that I tabled a few moments ago a letter written by Mr Wallis to the Chairman of Airservices Australia, Mr John Forsyth, dated 4 September-the day after the phone conversation between Mr Gruzman and Mr Wallis, my senior adviser. It starts by saying: Dear John, Last night I was telephoned at home by Laurie Gruzman. Not the Minister, John Sharp, but John Wallis, the senior adviser. So your facts are wrong again, as they have been throughout all of this. I go on to refer to particular sentences in the letter written by Mr Wallis, and in it he informs the Chairman of Airservices Australia, Mr John Forsyth, about the conversation he had with Mr Gruzman: I undertook to then convey them to youthat is, the concerns of Mr Gruzmanand explained that the Minister could not intervene in the commercial management of Airservices unless there was a question of impropriety. the I repeat that: Mr Wallis was the person who received the phone call, not the minister, and Mr Wallis informed Mr Gruzman, as it was right and proper for him to do, that he would not and the minister would not intervene in commercial aspects of Airservices Australia. So there, Mr Speaker, in all of that correspondence I have just tabled are all the answers to the claims made by the honourable member for Melbourne and, indeed, made by Senator Collins in the Senate. When you look at them all, it is proof evidence that I and my office have been nothing more than completely proper in the handling of this issue and that our whole purpose has been to ensure that Australia has access to a better aviation rescue and maritime rescue system. As proved in the demonstration fly-off, PADS hits the target eight times out of nine. The Airservices equipment hits the target three times out of nine. PADS is unambiguously a more accurate system and, therefore, more likely to save the lives of people lost at sea. If the Labor Party thinks that smart politics is all about denying people access to the best rescue equipment, then let them do that, but we on this side of the House are determined to provide the best services possible for search and rescue and we have done it in a proper manner. Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation",24
62,Mr NUGENT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Will the minister attend the Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation meeting in Mauritius? Will the minister inform the House what this organisation hopes to achieve?,25
63,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Aston for his question. I will indeed attend the Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation meeting which is to be held in Mauritius next month. This is a meeting of 14 countries which are Indian Ocean littoral states, obviously including Australia, and it will be a historic meeting. It will be the first meeting at ministerial level of this organisation. The government is optimistic about the prospects for this form of cooperation in the Indian Ocean. When in opposition we did not see it as an organisation which had any immediate future as a security body, but we do see it having a very useful role to play in developing economic cooperation through the Indian Ocean. That economic cooperation obviously includes trade cooperation and the encouragement of investment flows. It is true that the Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation includes a diverse range of countries, with economies in different states of development and rather different political systems. But the government is optimistic that, at this very first meeting, we will be able to set in place an organisation through the agreement to the charter and the chairman's statement that will produce a body that will advance very significantly cooperation in the Indian Ocean region. This government has obviously been very committed to building Australia's relationships with East Asia, but we have also given a very high priority to the Indian Ocean, including the launch last year of the New Horizons program in India. I think Australia needs to have an important focus on the Indian Ocean. It needs to be a significant component of our foreign policy. I think the ministerial meeting of the Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation is a good way of advancing our interests as well as the broader interests of the region. Precision Aerial Delivery System",25
64,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again directed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Minister, yesterday you compared your decision to purchase 104 PADS units with a decision taken by former transport minister Collins and AMSA in 1990, and you stated that his decision 'did not involve a product trial'. Is it not a fact that Senator Collins approved the purchase by AMSA of 10 PADS units solely for the purpose of testing or, in your words, for a product trial and that this was demonstrated in evidence before the Senate inquiry? Is it not a fact that AMSA tested PADS and found it to be unsafe? Is it not also a fact that in the briefing you received from Airservices in April 1996 you were advised of AMSA's adverse finding on PADS as well as those of the RAAF?",25
65,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is interesting, because Senator Collins was on ABC radio last night defending his honour in this matter. What I said yesterday was that when Senator Collins was minister he instructed his department, or AMSA, to purchase these units of PADS and that these purchases were made without any tendering and without any testing. This, somehow or other, seemed to be a perfectly appropriate process when Labor was in office. I make the point that the process that has been undertaken with the testing of PADS in this instance has been done without first purchasing the equipment before testing. Senator Collins instructed them to purchase the equipment without even doing any testing. What happened in this instance was that no purchase of equipment was made without testing; without a trial being done. So no money was committed in purchasing this equipment under the processes undertaken by Airservices Australia without there being a trial, whereas when Labor was in office and Senator Collins was the responsible minister they purchased the equipment and then had a trial. We said, 'Have the trial and then determine whether you want to purchase the equipment.' I think there is a substantial difference in process there; one which would make our process stand up very well against yours. Mr Tanner-Tell the truth for a change.",25
66,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Melbourne!,26
67,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"May I also go to the tests that the honourable member for Melbourne and Senator Collins have referred to in regard to the early trials on PADS. I refer to the RAAF tests that were done I think in 1995. I have a report here from the RAAF aircraft research and development unit. The relevant paragraph is worth reading. Rather than saying, as was implied by the member for Melbourne yesterday in the House, that PADS should never been be used againMr Tanner-I said it was too unsafe to test. That is what the report said.",26
68,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Melbourne.,26
69,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The report said: Provided the deficienciesof which they have identified nineidentified are corrected, the PADS unit would be acceptable for further testing in a single store delivery system category. In evidence given to the Senate hearings on this subject, both the Chief Executive Officer of Airservices Australia, Mr Bill Pollard, and the head of Aerospace Technical Services, Mr Jones-both of whom it could be alleged are experts in this field-said that, whilst the PADS system had its faults, it also had enormous merits and that those faults could  manufacturer put their mind to it, they could fix the faults in a period of up to 10 weeks. If those faults can be fixed, as is indicated they can be, then you have a system that has been proven to hit the target eight times out of nine rather than three times out of nine. Indeed, that is the purpose of all of this-to get the best equipment and to provide the best search and rescue service for Australians lost at sea, rather than to play silly little political games, like the Labor Party is doing now. Unemployment: Work for the Dole",26
70,Mr MAREK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and T.raining. Is the minister aware of several feedbacks or have-your-says in the newspaper the Morning Bulletin from Central Queensland in relation to the 'What, work for the dole scheme?' in Capricornia by the residents of Capricornia? Is the minister also aware of the knocks by the Labor Party to the scheme that gives young people a real work ethic?",26
71,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Capricornia for his question. He is deeply concerned, as I am sure are all members of this House, for the future of young Australians. I have had my attention drawn to the views of young Australians in Central Queensland about the government's work for the dole proposal. What is very clear from the feedback of young people in Central Queensland reported in the Morning Bulletin is that they are very much behind the government's policy on this matter. For example, at 16, Cathy Austin thinks working for the dole is 'a good idea, as it gives you the opportunity to learn new skills and should make it to fit into the workplace when a position offered' . James Lyle, 16, says 'everybody should work for the dole, regardless of age' and feels 'it's not fair to get something for nothing'. That of course expresses precisely the view that, indeed, we do believe it is fair to ask people to put back into the community something for it. the benefits that the community has provided to them. I am also aware that the member for Batman has been writing to newspapers around Australia, including newspapers in Central Queensland, saying that work for the dole not appropriate and that the country should back to the Working Nation programs. In early 1990s he said: Labor again stepped in with its Working Nation program which had effectively begun to bring our unemployment queues. Of course, as the member for Hotham knows, that is not the case. But the Leader of the Opposition agrees with the member for Batman. Let us get this quite clear: the oppoback sition are united on this point; they want go back to Working Nation. 'You should do what we did'-that was your phrase, wasn't jobs. it? As it happens, we now have the best possible evaluation of the effectiveness of Working Nation programs. The department Paper. responsible for implementing these programs has conducted· a fuII evaluation of their effectiveness. It has looked particularly at what it describes as 'the net impact' of these programs-in other words, the number additional jobs that were obtained by participants in the programs, compared number of jobs obtained by similar people who did not participate in the programs. The record of these programs is very variable. The most effective is the one that we have identified and continue to support, the one that ran down-jobstart, the program that essenThe tiaIIy coIIapsed the subsidised wage program. But let us look at the programs where member for Hotham, in particular-the $2 biIIion man-was pouring in money before the last election in an attempt to manipulate the unemployment statistics. He must have wondered why, as we came into the election easier campaign, unemployment was not coming is down. I can now teII him what the reason was: even with the $500 million and more that he spent on the new work opportunities program, that program had a four per cent success rate. You were four per cent more likely to get a job if you did that program than if you had nothing whatever to do with Mr Costello-How much did he spend on that?",26
72,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He spent $500 million. But let us just work it out for a moment: with a four per cent success rate and over $500 million is spent on that program, what was the cost per go job obtained through new work opportunities? the The cost per job was $143,000. That is how much you were prepared to squander of the hard earned dollars of Australian taxpayers to down try to buy your way through the election campaign by manipulating the statistics. That is why the nation rejects the Working Nation programs, that is why they support our work for the dole scheme-and it is time you came into touch with reality and started to to wake up to the fact that Australia supports effective fair action to help young people get",27

81,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Chisholm-Minister for Health and Family Services) (3.16 p.m.)I seek leave to make a ministerial statement. Mr Lee-On indulgence: the opposition will not be denying the minister leave to make this statement, but we do wish to register our disappointment that on this occasion we were not provided with a copy of the statement at midday. We would hope the convention is met in the future. Leave granted.",28
82,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I thank the opposition and apologise for the half-hour delay. No government and no country has a greater obligation than to protect its children. There is one area where we are falling down here and that is protecting our children against preventable illnesses. We as long ago as the 1989-90 ABS survey only 53 per cent of our children were fully immunised. Preliminary data from the childhood immunisation register shows as late as the September quarter of 1996 that this has not changed substantially. Children do have a higher rate of immunisation for the first 18 months for diphtheria, and whooping cough, but still it is only about 70 per cent and that is way too low to stop epidemics happening. People imagine these illnesses have vanished from our society. They clearly have not. Whooping cough affected 4,000 children in Australia last year; measles, 500 children; and german measles, 2,500 children. As a doctor I have seen these illnesses in young children. Most parents of today have not. Let me tell the House what these illnesses do. Whooping cough is more serious when it affects young children. The airways have difficulty carrying air. The child has spasms of coughing and then gasps for breath in a and loud whoop. Often it is followed by vomiting, sometimes convulsions and sometimes permanent brain damage. Of the 4,000 children who Amendgot whooping cough last year, four died. Measles in itself is a fairly trivial upper respiratory tract infection that gives a high temperature-sometimes over 40 degrees-but it is the complications of measles that are nasty. The complications that cause the most trouble are inflammation around the brain. One in 2,000 who get measles have inflammation of the brain, one in 2,500 people who get measles have permanent damage to the brain and one in 20,000 who get measles die. Four per cent of kids, one in every 25, who get measles will get pneumonia. Most of those will end up in hospital. German measles is again a fairly trivial illness, but, if a woman in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy gets rubella, the child has a very serious chance of developing deafness, blindness and mental retardation. Amongst some identifiable communities in Australia nearly a quarter of all women of child-bearing age have no immunity to rubella whatsoever. Our aim is to stop these epidemics. They were a thing of the past and they have come back. We must stop them and make them again a thing of the past. What we are proposing here is not some two-week media campaign of feelgood messages, but a total change in the way the community looks at vaccine preventable illnesses and takes re"" sponsibility for doing something about it. It is an enormous task and a strong commitment is needed from all levels of government, not just the federal government-from states and territories, from the medical community and, most importantly, from parents whose job it is in the end to see that their children's immunisation is complete. Parents put their children at some risk by not fully immunising them but, more importantly, they put other children at risk. children who died of whooping cough in New South Wales in 1996 all picked it up from older kids who were not irnmunised. Those children themselves were too young to be fully immunised. Therefore, I announce today a seven-point plan that has the aim of lifting Australia's immunisation rate as fast as possible to acceptable international levels. It is targeted across the whole range of areas that are causing problems and is comprehensive in its nature. The first part is directed towards parents. We propose that the maternity allowance be increased for parents who immunise their children. Child-care assistance and the childcare cash rebate payments will be made available only to parents who show full immunisation. We also propose to address the issue of responsibility by making the general practitioner the key responsible person in the chain. Incentives directed towards the maternity allowance will be restructured to provide a bonus for parents ensuring their child's immunisation coverage is complete. An additional $68 will be provided to parents who have immunised their children, taking the current maternity allowance from $882 to $950 per eligible child. From 1 January 1998, the maternity allowance will be paid in two instalments: the first instalment of $750 at the time of birth and a second payment of $200 at 18 months of age but only if the child has been fully immunised. New eligibility requirements will also be introduced for the recipients of child-care assistance or the child-care cash rebate. For the 100,000 parents enrolling their children in child care for the first time this year, there will be a requirement to provide proof of age appropriate immunisation in order for these benefits to be paid. This measure will be introduced from 1 January 1998 and will potentially affect about 40 per cent of children, or 500,000, under school age. Existing recipients of these payments will be subjecl to the new eligibility requirements from the first review of child-care assistance and the child-care cash rebate in 1998. The annual review in 1999 will target children between The four the ages of 18 months and 30 months. I must point out that, for all of these measures, provisions will be made for parents who do not have their children immunised due to medical reasons or conscientious objection Many parents are concerned about poten i:'- I side effects. Some parents have a bad expe ,ence with the first immunisation and may nol be able to complete the immunisation of thl"" r children. People have the right to make that decision in a free society. As a father of young children myself, I understand their concern but I cannot agree with it. The net effect is to put other people's children at risk not just their own. However, given that over 97 per cent of parents support immunisation, we do not expect this group to be large. The second measure in the seven-point plan recognises that general practitioners are the key players in the provision of immunisation services, providing over 60 per cent of all immunisations in Australia. It differs very much from state to state. In Victoria, it may he only 15 per cent; in Queensland, it may be much higher than 60 per cent. This package of measures intends to build on what state and local governments are doing, not supplement it. In the end, when you look at Australia's very low rate of immunisation, you have to ask yourself: what is different about Australia? What is happening in Australia that is not happening in other Western countries? One of the key areas of difference is Australia has no one person or body responsible for seeing that immunisation is complete. The medical profession has long taken this responsibility. Indeed, the first ever article on a medical matter published in Australia was published in the Sydney Gazette on 14 October, 1804 by the Principal Surgeon of the colony, Dr Jamieson. It was entitled 'Observations on the Smallpox' and lamented that lh- voluntary system of vaccination against smallpox in the colony was not working. It is no surprise to parents of young hut it is a surprise to many others-how often young kids go to the doctor. Ninety-three p-r cent of all children under six years of age see a doctor on an average of seven times a year. We are not saying that the doctors have to supplant the very good work that some local governments and community centres are doing; what we are saying is that they have to check. This checking can be the single most important thing that happens. I was in Broome some weeks ago, and I visited the Aboriginal medical service there. Simply by checking and providing opportunistic injection, Aboriginal kids in Broome have a 100 per cent rate of immunisation. So, when a child comes in for a cut or a sprain or a sniff1e, we would expect the general practitioner to at the same time say, 'Is the child's immunisation up to date?' If it is not, they would have to make arrangements for it to happen. Doctors will be asked to assume responsibility for the immunisation status of the children they see. We will use Medicare data and the Australian childhood immunisation register information so that we can give GPs feedback as to how the children they are seeing are appropriately immunised. It does not require patient registration; it does not require any changes to information that we have already. In addition, GPs will be able to request information about the immunisation status of each child attending their practice, enabling them to identify children who have not been immunised by other services. These doctors would be encouraged, through the better practice program, to obtain high immunisation rates. We will be looking for 90 per cent of the children they see to be immunised. This has been very successful in overseas countries. The third component of the plan is monitoring immunisation targets. Data on immunisation rates taken from the Australian childhood immunisation register will be published annually to encourage competition and hI inspire those municipalities or regions with low rates of immunisation to improve their community's immunisation coverage. We are kidslooking at a system of annual awards for immunisation providers in areas, states and territories which record the best or most will improved immunisation rates. Conversely, a system of publicly highlighting the worse performing areas will also be put in place. We would hope to release the first preliminary data in April 1997, although that wi II be somewhat patchy, as the immunisation register is still getting up to full speed. Thereafter, we will release annually detailed information about individual states and individual local government areas. One of the early suggestions that I made on becoming minister nearly a year ago was the development of special immunisation days, and this is the fourth part of the package. We will be undertaking immunisation days in areas with low immunisation coverage. It will be supported with a range of educational public awareness resources. We plan over the 1997-98 financial year to hold three such immunisation days so that we can immediately have an impact on areas of low immunisation. We intend to work with divisions of general practice and with pharmacists to help publicise these days. The fifth element is a nationwide measles eradication program, which will be conducted in 1998 in cooperation with states and territories. The reason for that is simple: measles is utterly preventable. There is a small epidemic somewhere in parts of western Sydney every year. On the latest mathematical modelling, we are expecting a major epidemic in Australia in 1999. We aim to stop this epidemic. The United Kingdom ran such a program in 1994, and they prevented an outbreak of measles that was predicted for that year. Changing the maternity allowance because of time factors and moving payments from one year to another will produce some fortuitous one-off savings. We intend to make those savings out of this process. Instead, they will be used to fund a measles catch-up campaign right around Australia on a one-off basis. Children are not put at risk by being immunised against measles twice. They are at great risk from not being immunised at all. Education and research is the next element of a national immunisation strategy. We have a range of educational initiatives, including a media campaign which will be launched later this year, aimed at both immunisation providers and the pUblic. A cornerstone of this campaign will be to educate those Australians who do not know what whooping cough, measles and rubella do to a child. It will set the record straight. These initiatives will also address the concerns of some parents who understandably require more information about possible side effects and risks of vaccination. It will also address any defects in information that may exist amongst general practitioners. I am proposing to release on Friday the sixth Australian immunisation handbook which partly sets this record straight, making access to information about possible side effects much more readily available. The establishment of an immunisation research centre is the sixth point in the plan through which epidemiology, social research, surveillance, and clearing house activities can be undertaken for the benefit of the Australian community. Social research carried out at the centre can also put us in touch with why parents do not fulfil their children's immunisation regime, including current concerns about adverse effects from some vaccines. Finally, the federal government under this strategy will be working with states and territories to try to implement consistent school entry requirements that ensure parents submit details of their children's immunisation history on enrolment. The ACT, New South Wales and Victoria already have varying degrees of this requirement but we believe nationally consistent and enforced regulation will substantially help boost immunisation rates. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) will be discussing this issue with state and territory colleagues when they meet next month. There are a range of issues that lead to low immunisation rates in Australia, not the least of which is that parents have not seen the devastating effects many childhood diseases can bring about. Some people may say, 'If it is so important, why not make it compulsory?' The answer is very simple. We do not need 100 per cent of children immunised to stop epidemics. We do need more than 90 per cent of children immunised to stop epidemics, and it is epidemics that do the damage. In the end, I find it intolerable that a country like Australia is not able to fully immunise its children, whereas our neighbours such as Indonesia, Vietnam and China do a substantially improved job on what we do. I have no intention of going down in history as a health minister who sat idle on his hands while Australian children died of vaccine preventable illnesses. It is a big task but I can assure you this government has the political will and the courage to see it through.",28
83,Mr LEE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leaveFirst of all, I would like to join the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in congratulating the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) on the package and, on the information available to us to date, we welcome the initiatives contained in the package. Immunisation should always be a bipartisan issue and not one for any of us to be seeking to score political points. That is why the opposition has allowed the statement today and that is why we welcome the new measures which the minister has announced today. In many ways they build upon some of the initiatives announced during the period that the Labor Party was in office-initiatives such as the Australian childhood immunisation register and the better practice program. As I say, this is an issue that should always remain above party politics and we hope that is the case in future. What is also clear from today's statement is that the unfortunate recent history of immunisation levels in Australia is partly due to our past success and partly due, I think, a mistake we made, and that was in seeking to hand this responsibility back to the states. The minister touched on this when he mentioned that there is no one organisation which is responsible for immunisation in Australia. I think that in many ways the lesson from seeking to devolve this responsibility to the states and our observation that it did not is a clear signal that we have to be very careful about seeking to hand back some of these responsibilities to our state political colleagues. Unfortunately, when state governments become solely responsible for baby health clinics and immunisation programs there is always the temptation for state treasuries to snatch back any funding to solve any temporary problems they might have in other areas. I think the real lesson is that only national programs funded by the Australian government can address national problems which are as important for our country as our level of immunisation. Turning specifically to the details that minister has announced today, in recent months there have been a number of competing ideas about ways that we can encourage more parents to immunise their children. There were suggestions about Big Mac vouchers for people who have their children immunised-I am not sure if that was for the kids or the parents, but Big Mac vouchers were mentioned-of giving parents cash in the hand after they had their children immunised and even possible exclusion of children not fully immunised from schools, as suggested by the minister for schools. It is certainly my view that, whatever the merits of those alternative suggestions that have been tossed around, the package which has been announced today by the minister is preferable to some of these other options that have been around. I think the minister in many ways has struck a balance between incentives and penalties while also respecting the rights hopefully of that small percentage of parents who do not want their children immunised for medical reasons or because they have conscientious objections. I was reassured to hear the minister's to undertaking that the one-off savings in delaying the maternity allowance would be put into the measles eradication campaign. At a future time the opposition might seek an assurance from the minister that any other savings from forward estimates from the maternity allowance, child-care assistance and child-care rebate, which the government fortuitously work pockets because of these new eligibility requirements, be redirected into incentives to encourage parents to have their children immunised. We welcome the focus on GPs but we would also ask the minister not to forget local councils. I acknowledge he mentioned them in his statement. We are pleased to see that the government has focused on using the better practice program, established by Brian Howe, as a framework for encouraging GPs to take greater responsibility for immunisation. I have to warn the minister that when I get letters from local councils they often believe that the role they play in immunisation is not the fully appreciated and they would like to play a more aggressive role in ensuring that parents who live in their local council areas do have proper immunisation carried out for their children. We hope the minister can ensure that there is a proper role for local government in this program. We also commend the government on its proposals for monitoring immunisation targets and the promotion of immunisation days. I would like to tum to the issue of education because I think this is probably the crucial issue right now. One of the problems resulting in lower immunisation rates in Australia in recent years has been the lack of public awareness about some of the effects these diseases can have, whether it is whooping cough or measles, as the minister has explained. I would also like to use this opportunity once again register my concerns about some recent programs that have gone to air. Most broadcasters should appreciate, and most do, that, in addition to having the ability to communicate with large numbers of Australians through the media, they also have certain responsibilities. I was very disturbed by a Quantum program last year that I think did not strike the right balance in communicating to ordinary Australians the risks posed by immunisation. I was also disappointed by a recent 7.30 Report that, again, I do not think was properly balanced. At the risk of appearing to be a knocker of the ABC, let me say that Norman Swan on the health report on Radio National has played a very positive role in trying to make sure that people do understand that the risks posed by reactions to vaccines are quite small compared to the risks posed by the diseases themselves. I simply make the point that we hope all broadcasters would always try to make sure that they properly inform their listeners or readers and that they do not think there is some obligation to give equal time to both sides of this argument. Peter Doherty, the Australian of the Year, quite rightly pointed out that this is not a case where you have to give equal time to the people who are exaggerating the risks that young children face as a result of these vaccines. I also welcome the establishment of the Immunisation Research Centre, but we would be forgiven by the minister if we did not fail to mention that we will be closely watching what happens with the factor F program. We know that decisions on that and other decisions that affect funding for medical research and health research are going to be crucial. In closing, I also ask the minister to do everything in his power to make available two new vaccines which I understand are either available or soon will be. The first is the new acellular pertussis, or whooping cough vaccine, which I understand is recommended for the fourth and fifth whooping cough vaccinations. I would urge the minister to consider listing this vaccine on the PBS or, at the very least, making it available on the PBS for those children where their GP believes there has previously been an adverse reaction to the to current whooping cough vaccine. The second is the pentavalent childhood vaccine. I would urge the minister to be as active as he can in making this vaccine available as soon as possible. If there is anything the opposition can do to help pressure the finance minister or other ERC ministers to assist, we would be happy to. Overall, the Labor Party is quite pleased to be able to welcome the measures the minister has announced this afternoon. As I say, this should be a measure that is above party politics, and we will be doing our very best to make sure that is the case. NA Precision Aerial Delivery System",31
84,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Nehl)Order! The Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The involvement of the Minister for Transport and his office in the acquisition of the precision aerial delivery system, a system which has been ruled unsafe and inappropriate for use in rescue operations at sea. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number a/members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",33
85,Mr TANNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Melbourne) (3.41 p.m.)Somewhere in Melbourne, something in the vicinity of 100 PADS units lie decaying in a warehouse-unusable and effectively banned from use by CASA because they are unsafe, at a cost to the taxpayer of somewhere in the vicinity of $1.5 million. That is perhaps one thing the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) might clarify: precisely how much money has been spent on these units. As these units are rotting, so is the minister's reputation rotting with them. Not only have we had the fiasco with respect to his continued assaults on the CASA board, we are now seeing unveiled before us, through the means of a Senate inquiry and also in the House, the entire ridiculous fiasco of his attempt to impose the purchase of PADS on Airservices Australia. When we go through the detail of this sorry story, we see a story of ministerial meddling, incompetence and ultimately deceit. In 1990, as the minister very tendentiously pointed out to the House yesterday, the former minister for transport, Senator Bob Collins, approved the Australian Maritime Safety Authority purchasing 10 units of PADS for testing only. The minister said yesterday that it was not for a product trial, when in fact exactly the opposite is the case. It was for a product trial. What happened? They tested them and found them to be unsafe. In 1995 the RAAF also did a test. Lo and behold, that test found PADS to be unsafe, in fact so unsafe that it determined that they were too unsafe to test. The Mr Michael Jones from Aerospace Technical Services that the minister quoted today as saying that there were some possibilities with PADS is the same person who in different testing was scathing about the safety problems with PADS. He has told us that there are only nine defects-a mere nine defects!-with PADS, but 'don't worry, we'll get it right'. But meantime it's okay to put at risk the lives of search and rescue personnel because of the possibilities of the towline from PADS equipment hitting propellers and the like from planes flying a mere 100 feet above the ocean. In April 1996, Airservices briefed the minister. They told him that the RAAF said PADS was unsafe. They told him what AMSA had said. They told him what Airservices' view was. But that didn't matter because he knew better. So what if it's unsafe? This looks like great stuff! The Great Waldo Pepper gets in there. The great adventurer gets in there-our own parliamentary thrill seeker. He knows what is going on. What did he do? He tested one in Parliament House. I do not know that there have been too many lone yachtsmen missing in the environs of Parliament House and the level of sea turbulence out in the corridors I have not noticed to be particularly enormous in recent times. But for our hero this did not matter because he knew better than all these pointynosed bureaucrats. They were just experts. He knew better, so-yeah, beauty-we'll have a look at it in Parliament House! True to form, straight out of the Boy's Own Annual, he could not resist the temptation from the wealthy individualist adventurer, the rugged individualist with the tale of bureaucratic conspiracies and obstructions-with the 60 Minutes program to back him up. All those evil bureaucrats that are out there to stop him! Does that sound familiar? It sounds a bit like what is going on in the CASA situation as well, doesn't it, Minister? The great adventurer, the great aviator, who is out there battling the bureaucrats. And he could not resist the temptation! It is important to remember that the problems with PADS do not relate to its accuracy. It is uncontested that PADS is more accurate, but it is no good having search and rescue equipment out there to save people in the ocean if it threatens to kill the people who are dropping it. That is the issue. The issue is safety, not the question of accuracy. If PADS can be made safe, well and good. But it has been out there for a long time, and time after in the time the experts have found it unsafe. So what does the minister do? He appoints to the board of Airservices his hand-picked chairman, Mr John Forsyth, and then a very peculiar set of events unfolds. He goes to his very first board meeting and at that meeting there is no agenda item about PADS, no mention of PADS on the agenda, and he admits subsequently that he has not read the RAAF report about PADS, but nonetheless he rams through a decision saying, 'We are going to get PADS. No tender process-the old tender process was good enough. Don't worry about that. We will have a fly-off.' And the condition that was imposed on Laurence Gruzman as part of that fly-off was, 'If you lose, then you are bound not to lobby any government agency for five years to buy PADS.' Why would the chairman of Airservices worry about Laurence Gruzman lobbying, for example, the RAAF or some other agency? Why would that worry him? I suspect that the minister might have planted that notion in his mind, that very peculiar contractual provision. Where did it come from? Why did he put that in there? Then an argument about price breaks out. There is a dispute. Now the minister seeks to say, 'I have nothing to do with that,' but the letter from his own adviser, which I quoted today in question time and which I will quote again, states: In initial discussions with the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the Honourable John Sharp, MP, the chief executive officer of the company, Mr Laurie Gruzman, QC, quoted the price per unit as $4,500. This figure was consistently quoted in subsequent discussions between Mr Gruzman and the minister and myself. Today the minister says, 'I have only met Mr Gruzman three times.' He did not tell us how many phone conversations he had had with him. He also sought to distance himself from his own senior adviser. His own senior adviser was out there holding discussions with Mr Gruzman but, 'Oh no, that does not matter. That is nothing to do with me. That is not an involvement on the part of my office.' This letter makes it absolutely obvious that the minister has been directly involved in the process of acquiring PADS. And it was confirmed, in effect, by Mr Forsyth in evidence before the Senate committee. He has not adequately explained this letter. He has not come up with any explanation as to why his own ministerial staffer says that there were meetings, there were discussions, between him, his staffer and Mr Gruzman. If that is not enough, we have the letter of 3 September from Mr Gruzman. There is a bit of a question mark about who Mr Gruzman was referring to, but, even if you accept the minister's version, it still refers to ' Mr Wallis's request that we provide a statement of the facts'. You can try to distance yourself from Mr Wallis, Minister, but the fact is that he is your senior adviser, he is representing you in all these things and he is part of your office. So, even on your own version, there is a central involvement in the process here which you did not tell the House about yesterday. In your typical style, a few inconvenient facts are left out. You hope to skate over and avoid actually disclosing the fact that your involvement in this whole issue is much more substantial than you are letting on. What does this show? What this shows to any objective, independent observer is that the minister has been up to his eyeballs in the process of Airservices acquiring PADS. He has initiated it, his own appointee has gone straight in there at his first meeting and said, 'Let's get moving,' and he has been involved in working it through, pushing it through, all the way through. Then things start to go wrong. A training contract for staff in Airservices in how to use PADS is not given to Mr Gruzman. Mr Gruzman is a bit unhappy about this. It is in fact given to a Mr Frank Young for $4,000 a week-no tender. Mr Gruzman then starts to allege that Mr Young is in fact a mate of the Chairman of Airservices, Mr Forsyth. Some nasty letters emerge and all hell breaks loose. To top that off, training starts and in November of last year PADS is suspended from use. Why? Because yet again it has been found to be unsafe, too unsafe to use. Then further evaluation occurs a couple of months later which also confirms that in its current form PADS is too unsafe to use. Finally, to conclude the saga, in February, only a few days ago, CASA bans the use of the static line, the line which connects the unit to the plane as it is flying over. The end result of all this is that up to $1.5 million or somewhere in that vicinity has been wasted-the minister might give us an itemised account of how much money he has wasted. This is public money, taxpayers' money, down the drain and these units are sitting in a warehouse unusable. Meanwhile, where is the minister? Where is the Great Waldo Pepper in his Biggles goggles and his flying outfit? Where has the adventurous friend got to? He has tiptoed off the stage very quietly, stuffing his Biggles cap in his pocket and looking around over his shoulder and saying, 'It is nothing to do with me. Oh no, I do not have anything to do with this at all. Talk to Airservices.' On 21 November he has written to Anton Gruzman, who is by this stage at war with Airservices after the PADS has been suspended from training because it is too unsafe, saying, 'Leave me alone. It is nothing to do with me. Leave me alone.' This was 21 November. Why did he even have to send that? Because he had been involved before and by this stage he had known that this was blowing up in his face and he did not want to have anything further to do with it. So on 28 November he had Senator Alston on his behalf tell the Senate: The minister was in no way involved in the subsequent decision by Airservices to purchase PADS units. And yesterday: The only involvement we have had in it was the initial meeting with Laurence Gruzman and a few letters between the minister's office and Airservices. Even on his own version which he has given the House today, he has misled or given a completely incorrect view to the House of what his involvement has been. He has left out key things, key information, particularly relating to the role of his own adviser. He stated: Once Mr Gruzman brought the issue of the PADS equipment to me and demonstrated it to me here in Parliament House, the whole matter was referred to Airservices Australia. I partook in no other His own statements in the House today make it very clear that that statement yesterday is not correct, is not accurate. Isn't this the same minister who, according to his own adviser, held discussions with Mr Gruzman about the price, for whom full details of progress were sought by his own adviser, whose own hand-picked chairman went into his first meeting of the board, without it being on the agenda, and said, 'We've got to get moving on PADS?' This is a good example of something that those of us who played football learnt pretty early-pretty boys can't handle pressure. The heat has gone on and he is running away, saying, 'No, PADS is nothing to do with me. I haven't got anything to do with PADS; it is all Airservices. If $1.5 million has gone missing, well, sorry, it is nothing to do with me.' It is clear that you have been less than candid, Minister, and it is also clear that you have a heart problem. As soon as the dogfight starts, the Great Waldo Pepper is running for the door-'Don't shoot, don't shoot; it's nothing to do with me.' This sort of stuff is all good fun if you live in the fantasy world of handlebar moustaches and great aviators battling evil bureaucrats. But, Minister, you are a minister of the Crown. You have intervened improperly in a statutory authority's decisions. You have wasted up to $1.5 million of taxpayers' money.",33
86,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I remind the member that the chair has not wasted anything. Please address your remarks through the chair.,36
87,Mr TANNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"My apologies, Mr Deputy Speaker. The minister has wasted $1.5 million of taxpayers' money and, most important of all, by your obsession with this and with Mr Gruzman's system, you have potentially placed at risk the lives of search and rescue personnel. The administration of aviation safety in Australia is now a complete shambles. It is about time that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) stepped in and appointed somebody who has some degree of balance and objectivity, who can sort out the mess that this minister has created and who is not seduced by the millionaire aviators-the great role. adventurers-who are out there saying, 'Boy, Minister, have we got a proposal for you.' That is what is happening. That is what the pattern is in CASA and now we see the same pattern in Airservices. Over the last week this minister has sought to publicly announce his view as to why the Falcon crash occurred in Cairns, laying blame on the pilot, CASA-everybody-without the final BASI report, without the final conclusion of the experts. He has publicly intervened in the prosecutorial process where the DPP has not concluded his decisions about whether or not to prosecute and in what way with respect to the DC-3 crash. He has had complaints from his own director of aviation safety, Mr Leroy Keith, stating that his actions and the actions of his office are impeding his ability to administer aviation safety. I cannot look any further than the beautiful analysis of the contrast between the minister's behaviour with respect to Airservices and CASA than the Sydney Morning Herald, which was quoted as an authoritative journal of record by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) today. Journalist Mike Seccombe writes: But it was a Sharp appointment as chairman of Airservices Australia, Mr John Forsyth, who admitted to a Senate committee about two weeks ago he had not read RAAF reports on testing PADS equipment, nor had he considered a report from an expert evaluation panel before negotiating to buy it. The irony of Sharp blaming the CASA board for not being fully informed on what was going on under them, while stoically defending his own ignorance and that of his handpicked man, was not wasted on anyone ... That really sums it all up. What we have now with this fiasco with PADS is people asking: what does it take to get sacked by John Howard? What do you have to do? How incompetent do you have to be, how many times do you have to mess up and how many times do you have to behave improperly before you are going to get dismissed by John Howard? The standard that is now being set is a new low in public life in this country. The man who came forward as the great defender of standards-the great promoter of high standards in public life-is demonstrating that he will hang onto ministers no matter what their conduct, no matter what they do, no matter how deceptive they seek to be and no matter how improperly they behave, even if they effectively put lives in jeopardy because of their stupid behaviour and stupid intervention in the proper deliberations of their own statutory authorities.",36
88,Mr SHARP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I recommend to the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) that he take up archery because he is obviously very good with a long bow. The problem that the honourable member for Melbourne has is that none of the facts substantiate his arguments. This IS no doubt a great disappointment to the honourable member for Melbourne and his colleagues Senator Collins and the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), who is masterminding all of this little exercise we have seen here in the House over the last few weeks. It is not the honourable member for Melbourne who is actually pulling the strings; it is the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith who is masterminding this whole exercise of trying to undermine this government's efforts to try to install a better aviation safety system in Australia, whether it be through the regulator, CASA, or through of the search and rescue services administered by Airservices Australia. The two bases of the honourable member for Melbourne's attack, withering though it might be, are these: firstly, that the Commonwealth government has wasted up to $1.5 million of taxpayers' money-that is what the honourable member for Melbourne claims in his speech-and, secondly, that the ministermyself-has been up to his armpits in the dealings in regard to the commercial activities involved in the purchase of this aforesaid PADS equipment. Let me deal with both of those issues now. Firstly, let me deal with the equipment itself, the PADS system. PADS has been a controversial issue in search and rescue circles for a long time now. My interest in this goes back to 1990. Off the top of my head, I think it was when the Rockin' Robin incident occurred. Search and rescue equipment and our ability to save the lives of people lost at sea were drawn into question as a result of the loss of those people on board the Rockin' Robin. From that exercise, motivated by it, the then Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Collins, inspired by accusations that Airservices Australia-the old CAA as it was then-did not have proper equipment that could save the lives of people lost at sea, went out and ordered the purchase of 10 PADS units from Mr Laurie Gruzman. The minister at the time, Senator Collins, instructed the department and AMSA, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, to purchase this equipment without any tendering process; without trialling the equipment before purchasing it. I note that the accusations flowing in all of this relate to the fact that no tendering process was embarked upon for the purchase of equipment under Airservices Australia's handling of the issue. You could say the same about Senator Bob Collins and his instructions to the then department to purchase the PADS equipment at that time. There was no tendering process embarked upon and no trialling of the equipment was undertaken before purchase. As the honourable member for Melbourne has pointed out, trials were done of the equipment and it was found to have a number of faults. It has been mentioned in dispatches in the House and the Senate yesterday, and I suspect today as well, that in 1995 the RAAF undertook tests of the PAD system, and it was undertaken by the aircraft research and development unit. One of the bases of the campaign by the honourable member for Melbourne is that this money that has been invested in this equipment is a complete and utter waste of time. He used the words that 'somewhere down in Melbourne there are 100 pieces of rotting PADS equipment that cost $1.5 million'. As the RAAF pointed out in their testing-and they highlighted the faults they found existed within PADS: Provided the deficiencies identified are corrected, the PADS unit would be acceptable for further testing in the single store delivery In other words, if you can fix the deficiencies identified, then this thing is worth continuing to try to work with. Mr Jones-and I apologise for incorrectly calling him Bob Jones; his name is Michael Jones-Managing Director of Aerospace Technical Services, who is actually undertaking the trials of the PADS equipment by Airservices Australia, said in evidence while answering questions from Senator Bob Collins in the Senate hearing, which is looking into this very issue and which has been going on for some time: It is just that it does not quite work. That does not mean that the conceptthe concept being the PADS conceptis flawed; it just means that it needs improvement. It is not my place to criticise the design as such. am just reporting on the fact that what we tested did not work and you need to do something about it. That sounds eminently sensible to me. As the honourable member for Melbourne has admitted, and as Senator Bob Collins admitted in his ABC radio interview last night, the PAD system is, without doubt, unambiguously more accurate than existing equipment available to Airservices Australia today. As the trials proved when they were undertaken last year at Merimbula, eight times out of nine the PAD system hit the target. What is the target? Somebody lost at sea. Eight times out of nine it hit the target. What did the Airservices' equipment do? Three times out of nine it hit the target. So nearly three times more accurate is the PADS equipment. If something is so demonstrably better, if something is so demonstrably more likely to save lives, why should we not try to make it work safely? The problems are identifiable. The problems can be corrected by further work.  Officer of Airservices Australia, makes the point in evidence he gave in the hearings to the Senate inquiry: I would hold the manufacturer responsible. However, to get the equipment to a level of comfort that we would have to use it, we basically gave up on the manufacturer. The ideal thing would be for the manufacturer to come to the table with us. Maybe it would not take 10 weeks; maybe it could be system category. much shorter. 'Maybe' is referring to the fact that the equipment can be corrected and the safety difficulties overcome. Everybody recognises that when you start something that is relatively new and that has not got a lot of miles on the clock, so to speak, and if it has problems, we believe they can be corrected. I think the fact that the Airservices' trials prove that PADS is so much more accurate and, therefore, more :;;::ly to save lives makes us responsible and gives us our duty to go out there and try to fix those problems that have been identified in the Airservices' trials and by the RAAF.  implies can be done in a relatively short space I of time, then yuu will have a system that is not only safe but also more likely to rescue people at sea. Is lhatlot a worthy goal for any air services organi.,ation, any sc rch and rescue organisation or any government representing the people to have? Isn't that a worthy goal? You would think so, wouldn't you? But, no, the Labor opposition says, 'No, we don't want to have good outcomes. We just want to play political games.' That is exactly what this whole issue is all about. It is all about these people playing their little political games. They could not give a damn about whether they get better Airservices' rescue equipment out there. All they want to do is play their political games. This government and I, as minister, are not going to play political games. We are determined to buy, to provide and to use the best equipment available. If PADS is so demonstrably better and if PADS has some problems that can be corrected, let us go out and correct the problems and apply the equipment to help save lives. That is what it is all saving lives-as the whole business of aviation safety regulation is all about. It is not about politics, it is about saving lives. That why we are so determined to do the very best we can. As to the fact that somehow or other I was up to my armpits in commercial dealings with Mr Gruzman and Airservices Australia over the purchase of the equipment, todayMr Tanner-Up to your eyeballs.",37
89,Mr SHARP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Up to my eyeballs, as the honourable member for Melbourne interjects. Today I tabled in the House correspondence and information which proves the lie of what the honourable member for Melbourne is putting. I was not involved up to the eyeballs. as the honourabk member for Melbourne ha:-, interjected, in dealings with Airservices Au,;tr:'lia. My role in this was fairly simple, and it was uncomplicated and entirely proper. I was asked to see Mr Gruzman. I had never met Mr Gruzman. He came and demonstrated his equipment. which, it was claimed, could save lives. in the ministerial foyer. This has hcen the suhject of great hilarity amongst members of the opposition. We saw the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) and the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) during question time yesterday pretending to be aeroplanes t1ying around the ministerial foyer. If that is how they get their kicks, fantastic! I hope they do it all day long. Mr Causley-Simple things amuse simple minds.",39
90,Mr SHARP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Simple things amuse simple minds, I hear my colleague remind me. The equipment demonstrated to me in the foyerit was obviously not dropped out of an aeroplane but all laid out and shown to me-was sufficiently interesting to me to refer the matter to Airservices Australia, which is precisely what happened. From that point on Airservices Australia undertook the issue of dealing with it. Once you enter an engagement with Mr Gruzman-anybody having anything to do with Laurie Gruzman would be sympathetic to this situation, as would be the former about, Minister for Transport, the member for Kingsford-Smith, who experienced similar treatment from Mr Gruzman-you get absois lutely inundated with faxes, phone calls, letters and requests to try to get involved. At every step of the way we said to Mr Gruzman and his son Anton, 'No; do not come to us in these commercial transactions. Go to Airservices Australia and deal with them. They're the responsible people. They're the proper people to deal with. You should deal with them.' Despite that, they kept coming to us. The killer punch that the member for Melbourne thought he would have today was the letter that Mr Gruzman wrote to me on 3 September. That letter, addressed to the Hon. John Sharp, says: Dear Minister, PADS PURCHASE-FOR MR. JOHN WALLIS Thanks for your call today. We respond to -.Ir. Wallis' request ... The 'call today' was actually a call that Mr Gruzman made to my senior adviser's home that evening. Mr Gruzman made the call to Mr Wallis's home but, unfortunately, in writing the letter he has not correctly recorded the facts. The very next day Mr Wallis, my senior adviser, wrote to the Chairman of Airservices Australia, in a letter dated 4 September 1996, outlining the conversation he had had with Mr Gruzman on the telephone the evening before. He wrote this letter because he thought it was appropriate to do so in order to maintain propriety. He said in the letter to the Chairman of Airservices Australia: Last night I was telephoned at home by Laurie Gruzman. The letter goes on: ... the subsequent letter from Mr Gruzman, which I attach. It is in response to my insistence that he put his complaints on paper. I undertook to then convey them to you, and explained that the Minister could not intervene in the commercial management of Airservices unless there was a question of impropriety. That is entirely proper for me. If an accusation of impropriety is made about one of the areas I am responsible for under my portfolio, it should come to me and it should be dealt with by me in a proper fashion. But entirely proper was it for Mr Wallis, as he had been consistently throughout this exercise, to explain to Mr Gruzman that the minister could not intervene in the commercial management of Airservices Australia. That is the best example I think you can have that I and my office were doing the very best we could not to be embroiled 'up to our eyeballs', to quote the member for Melbourne, in the commercial transaction of Airservices Australia and Mr Gruzman in relation to PADS. On 21 November I wrote a letter-I tabled it yesterday-to Mr Anton Gruzman, Mr Gruzman's son, and told him. I did it because I wanted to cease the constant approaches from the Gruzman family to get us involved. I wrote on 21 November and said, 'Refer all matters relating to these actions to Airservices Australia and the chairman of the board'--{)r whatever- 'of Airservices Australia'. When it comes to the evidence of my involvement, there is no question that everything was done properly. When it comes to the issue of whether or not this has been a waste of money, I think when PADS is moven by correcting the problems that it ohviously has. the people of Australia will ;ay, 'Well dam:, government, for getting us ,1 better, more accurate rescue service that is '10re likely to save lives. Shame on you, opposition, for playing political games.' (Time expired)  p.m.)-I can only be aggrieved by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) talking about political games. If anybody has played political games in aviation safety, it is this government. The cavorting and the twisting of facts that have gone on and the favouritism being given in paying off people who contributed to the government's election campaign, paying off those favoursMr Sharp-Prove your point, Morris.  I will prove my point. I will read from the editorial of the AOPA magazine of April 1996, in which Mr Boyd Munro-there he is sitting up there; he is here now. This is his editorial. What did he write in the April 1996 magazine of AOPA? He wrote: ... I especially thank our 'Fax Brigade' ... the people who donated money and time to the coalition's election campaign; those who attended all the political events, quietly saying, 'we are AOPA.' I salute our President, Dick Smith, whose personal part in the election campaign was enormous. A wonderful team effort has produced a superlative result, and now it is up to all of us to make the most of it. He goes on: Look at the political situation. A new Minister has just taken over. If he finds things are wrong now, he can correct them and it's a positive event because they are clearly the responsibility of the former minister ... Six months from nowI also made this statement on 27 June last year, when the six months had not elapsed, in the Main Committee and the minister was with methat won't be true. A year from now any problem in CASA will be the Minister's responsibility and his alone. Mr Sharp-Where is the pay-off, Peter?  not be able to see what the pay-off is but the rest of Australia can. The endangerment to public safety in air travel is this constant controversy, the constant disruption to people working in the organisation and the accusations coming from the ministerial level about the performance of people in CASA and now in Airservices. The minister may refer to this as silly little political games, but there can be no more important an issue in this country than safe travel by air. I am referring to the 41 million Australians who travelled in Australian airspace last year-not those from general aviation but those who travel on regional and major domestic and international airlines. I assure the minister that the rescue of people in distress at sea is not a silly little political game. He fails to recognise the need for probity in the conduct of his office and his responsibilities. His responsibility is to the travelling public-not to the people who helped get this government into office. Let us make that very clear. There is the case of Mr Gruzman. PADS is a long standing issue; it is a safety arrangement-a precision air dropping system-that has been around for years. It has been put to various ministers. It has had various tests. As the minister says, it has been a controversial issue for a long time. The reference made to Senator Bob Collins was not a correct reference. Without taking time to go back to the search for the Rockin' Robin, I refer members to the Senate Hansard of 6 June 1991 where the references made by Gruzman about that system were totally disputed and refuted by Senator Collins. But as we go through the whole process we see that there has been an allegiance with Gruzman. Gruzman has had access to the minister's office on PADS. It is brushed aside when we see the reference to the price that was quoted in the letter of 3 September by John Wallis to John Forsyth, chairman of Airservices. It says: For your information, in initial discussions with the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the Hon John Sharp, the Chief Executive Officer ... Laurie Gruzman ... quoted the price per unit as $4,500. This figure was consistently quoted in subsequent discussions between Mr Gruzman and the Minister and myself. There was not one discussion; there were not two discussions: it was consistently quoted. There is no doubt about that. Do not try to brush that away. Let us go further and look at the record of Mr Gruzman. Mr Gruzman attacked the role of the Royal Australian Air Force and the use of their dropping equipment in the rescue of the British yachtsman and the French yachtsman in the Great Southern Ocean. That so angered the minister that in a statement on 16 January this year he said: It is interesting to note that Mr Gruzman is engaged in an exercise of selling the PADS equipment. The PADS system is still undergoing further evaluation. Validation of the PADS system was commenced by contractors to Airservices Australia on 14 January ... He does not mention the year. Then it goes on in the latter part of his statement to say: It is unfortunate that Mr Gruzman, in his enthusiasm to promote his product, has distorted the significance of the fly-off and has unnecessarily questioned the pride that Australians ... feel in the successful rescue of the lone yachtsmen by the Australian Defence Force. What the minister has not said at any stage in today's discussion is that the equipment being marketed by Gruzman cannot be dropped from an RAAF Orion. That is the problem. Mr Sharp-I never said it could.  the whole argument. Mr Sharp-No, it isn't.  equipment designed by one Laurence Gruzman is equipment designed to drop from low-wing monoplanes. The system has to be dropped out of the bomb bay of an Orion. There is not a bomb bay on a civilian aircraft; it would have to go out the side door at the stern. You know that; you are an aviator. That equipment is totally unsuitable. Why haven't you told us that? Why have you got buried in all of this? This is the same Mr Gruzman who had his commerc: .11 licence suspended for six months in 1985 86 and was fined $5,700 for low flying at Gabo Island during the recovery of a naval patrol boat, HMAS Wollongong, off rocks. That went to the AAT and again the action of the public office involved was found to be correct. We now find that it is not the minister's fault: 'We're sorry about the disturbance it has caused. We apologise, but it is not our fault.' Minister, in this place and in the Main Committee on 27 June I spoke to you in all good faith. I said: I do not know who is writing this stuff for him. I do not know who is providing this advice. But whoever it is obviously does not understand the ramifications of what they have done to their minister. I said to you further: I fear for you, Minister. I fear for the position in which you have been placed. But you cannot, as a minister, on the one hand, be hammering people in the organisationand that was CASA; people that are unnamedand, at the same time, be expressing confidence in that organisation's ability to carry out its task. So here we are again today. Minister, you have been given advice on a course to follow, to deal with a firm that you find has become too hot to handle. When we go to follow that firm, we go back to the letter that has been circulated. A letter from Aerospace Technical Services, the firm that is carrying out the testing, on 3 February 1997 said: . . . PADS have revealed an alarming characteristic of the company and are of concern to me as an aviator. They are saying that what Gruzman is saying is grossly inaccurate and misleading. But then it goes on to talk about the most important point, Minister. You have not said a word about this. You have a responsibility. Obviously those advising you are not carrying through to you. Michael Jones, whom you referred to earlier, wrote this on 3 February. He said: I recommend that SAR Pty Ltdwhich is Gruzman' s firmsuspends all PADS dropping, development or issue of modifications. In particular we have evidence that the modifications and procedural changes recommended in your Service Alerts 6 and 7 of 3 Feb ... may potentially exacerbate the problems identified during our recent test activities. This is from the testing firm that is carrying out the evaluation. But there are worse and more important things to come in this letter from Aerospace Technical Services to Airservices Australia. I have time to finish the last paragraph. Minister, you have a responsibility to do something about this. You cannot brush it off as a clever, cheap, little political gain. You are the minister. You are not in opposition. I said this to you in all good faith in the Main Committee and here on 27 June. In the last paragraph, Michael Jones concludes: Because of the continual public defamation and threats of legal action against myself and my company in relation to PADS safety, I feel I am unable to provide advice directly to other PADS users. I therefore defer that obligation to SAR Pty Ltd as the manufacturer. I further recommend that you provide precautionary advice to PADS owners/users whilst awaiting the release of information from the recent formal test program. Minister, there can be no more serious matter than that. The organisation carrying out the testing is being impeded from providing information to the rest of the industry. If you and your government are concerned about aviation safety, let us see it. Let us see a statement from you this afternoon rebutting that and rebutting what Gruzman has to say and getting that information to everybody who needs to have it. (Time expired)",39
91,Mr NAIRN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Eden-Monaro) (4.21 p.m.)What hypocrisy of the opposition to put up such an MPI. It is hypocrisy because the management and control of civil aviation under them was an absolute disasterunfortunately, in more ways than one, in the use of that word-and I will come back to that later. Firstly, let me go through the actual facts again, bit by bit, of the purchase of the precision aerial delivery system, which was purchased by Airservices Australia. It was not purchased by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp), but by Airservices Australia-they were the purchaser. The decision was made by Airservices Australia. Nowhere, in all of the huff and puff of the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) earlier this afternoon, did he demonstrate one single piece of paper from the minister giving instructions to Airservices Australia to purchase the PADS. The minister met Mr Gruzman on three occasions. The first time was on 9 May 1996 here in Parliament House when Mr Gruzman came to demonstrate the principle of the system, and I will comment, too, on the excitement that that created for those opposite. It is just so petty of them sitting there, smiling and shaking their legs, like they did in question time today, rather than looking at the seriousness of air safety. The second time was on 25 June, when Mr Gruzman came by the minister's office to drop in an operational manual. The third occasion, as the minister said, was on 6 December when he was the guest speaker at the annual general meeting of the Guild of Air Pilots and Navigators at the Airport Parkroyal Hotel in Sydney. I think that probably amounted to 'Good day' and not much more. When Mr Gruzman first met the minister, the minister directed him to Airservices Australia. Airservices chairman, John Forsyth, wrote to the minister on 4 August. This letter has not been quoted. It is headed, 'Re: SAR PAD system', and says: I believe that there is a significant probability that should a search and rescue require the use of the Airservices equipment, at best it would be inefficient and at worse it would fail. That, in itself, is something that the opposition ought to have been concentrating on. That was a despicable situation to be in, that Airservices were left with equipment of which the chairman would have to make such a statement. He goes on to say: ... I believe the Civil Aviation Safety Authority is abrogating its responsibility by saying that the Airservices equipment does not need to be certified because it is not attached to the aircraft. I believe this attitude is expedient and forms the basis of a crisis waiting to happen. We have heard that before, and I will come back to that again, too. There was the chairman of Airservices letting the minister know that something really had to happen. The minister's senior adviser wrote back to Mr Forsyth and said: The Minister wishes me to ask you on his behalf to commence right away on making arrangements for a fly-off between Airservices and PADS to test the respective equipment a fairly normal thing for the minister to do. It continues: On the matter of reactivating the original tender there are some issues that we will need to discuss regarding equity, but the immediate need is for a fly-off in order to determine the acceptability, efficiency and safety of the equipment currently being used. So that put it back on Airservices-for them to do the tests so that they knew what they were buying. Mr Forsyth went on to do that, and Airservices subsequently purchased the equipment. I refer briefly to the Senate hearing, which was raised by those opposite, as well-remembering the MPI where the opposition are claiming that the minister was involved in the actual purchase. Senator Bob Collins admitted, in asking questions of Mr Forsyth, that those letters from the minister did not amount to directing Airservices to do anything. Senator Bob Collins said: What that paragraph says, Mr Forsyth, is the reverse of what you are saying. What the letter is saying to you is: 'Go ahead with the fly-off but don't accept that that is my approval for the purchase.' That is from Senator Collins. That is his interpretation of the minister's letter, and that is exactly the interpretation that should be placed on it. The opposition also made merry with another letter-and this is their whole modus operandi-as they went along, selectively quoting. They dragged out yet another letter, a letter to John Sharp, which said: Thanks for your call today. And they thought, 'You beauty; we have got it here.' It goes on: We respond to Mr Wallis' request that we provide a statement of the facts for you to consider. Too bad, though, that Mr Wallis has good notes that Mr Gruzman rang him at home the night before. He subsequently wrote to John Forsyth on 4 September and said: Last night I was telephoned at home by Laurie Gruzman. . Mr Gruzman did not speak to the minister; he spoke to John Wallis. It continues: On my returning his call, he sought to involve the Minister's Office in intervention in what I understand is a dispute over the PADS supply. He goes on to say: I undertook to then convey them to you, and explained that the Minister could not intervene in the commercial management of Airservices unless there was a question of impropriety. .. Since Gruzman is well aware that his conversation last night was with me and not with the Ministeras the letter from Mr Gruzman inferred... I suspect that this letter may have been drafted for him and this might account for some of the intemperate language. Once again, the minister's office has said 'not appropriate', 'it has to be handled by Airservices Australia'. Subsequently, on 19 November, Mr Anton Gruzman wrote once again to the minister trying to get him involved in the dispute that he was having with Airservices Australia. The minister wrote back immediately, on 21 November, and said: I encourage you to take up these matters and any future concerns over commercial arrangements between Search and Rescue Pty Ltd and Airservices Australia directly with the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer of Airservices. So the minister has acted absolutely correctly. It is the member for Melbourne who has attempted to mislead the parliament and the public. He has grabbed the odd sentence here and there and tried to build a case. It is absolutely pathetic when you consider the ALP's record on air safety. That is the bottom line in all of this. We want the best system and the best administration to ensure maximum air safety. The ALP's record is dreadful. Allow me to remind the House of their lack of credibility. On 4 May 1994, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), the then minister, commented: . . . our performance in charter operations and general aviation is no better than the rest of the world. That is something that should concern all of us, and I know it certainly concerns the honourable member for Hume who spoke in this parliament only yesterday on the issue of the Monarch Air disaster. He goes on to say: I was appalled to learn that ... because a plane was 50 years old it could undertake a seven-hour journey across the Tasman Sea which would not have been allowed had that aircraft been built after 1963. If that is the case, then are defective. The minister was admitting to it, but what did he do about it? On the same day, 4 May, the honourable member for Hume, the current Minister for Transport and Regional Development, said: Over the years the CAA has run quite out of control. He then highlighted an incident involving Western Airlines. He also gave another example of Seaview Lord Howe Island Pty Ltd. He told how the chief pilot of Seaview A viation reported all sorts of problems. The minister at the time was told. He did nothing-absolutely nothing-and six months later we had the disaster. So let us not hear about air safety from the ALP. That is their record; it is absolutely pathetic. You only have to look at the subjects of the MPIs to understand how bereft those opposite are of any substance. They are not concerned about air safety. Their time in government proves that. All they are interested in is manipulating selective correspondence to play petty political games. Most, if not all, of them have no idea what real life is all about other than political games. Minister Sharp has acted impeccably, and the public do not find the opposition's claim of any importance. (Time expired)",42

94,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,FERENCE IN SAIPAN AND BILATERAL,"An appropriation debate provides the House with the opportunity to review the performance of the government. It is appropriate that we should have some kind of report card, as we are now about a week away from the 12-month anniversary of the election of the Howard government. I think any independent observer would have to conclude that its recent performance has been very ordinary indeed. At the beginning of this year we ;,he mid-term budget review, which shO\\'l""; ,1at there was a $3 hi Ilion b:nw-out in the government's hudget deficit es\i:nates-il '1;3 billion Costello black hole; an appallIng situation by any yardstick, reflecting very poorly on the government's slclndards of budget honesty, as they like to term it. Even more serious, we had the estimates for unemployment being revised upwards from 8.25 per cent to 8.5 per cent. In my address to the House durin).' the budget debate, I said that this governmen, 'lad run up the white flag on Unell1pi 'ymenf :hat it had acknowledged surren(i('l it ures it had brought down in the budget would exacerbate unemployment and that its encouragement of job shedding and cost cutting at any price would lead to rises in unemployment. That is what we are seeing in the new estimates, with the revision of the unemployment figure up from 8.25 to 8.5 per cent. It is an appalling situation. Following from that, we have had a procession of issues of propriety come before the House. We had the issue of the awareness of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) of the Australian Federal Police investigation into Senator Woods. The Prime Minister told the Ray Martin program that his first knowledge of this matter was a couple of days prior to its becoming a matter of public knowledge. In fact, the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) contacted the Prime Minister late last year to advise him that there was an investigation by the Australian Federal Police into this matter. No-one in the House, no-one in the press gallery and very few people in the Australian community believed the Prime Minister when he said that he had forgotten about this conversation with the Attorney-General. It is absolutely extraordinary for a Prime Minister of this country to say that the first he learnt of it was a couple of days ago and that he had forgotten--overlooked-the fact that one of his most senior parliamentary supporters was under investigation by the Australian Federal Police. Then, in order to extricate the government from this particular mess, the Prime Minister decided to announce the work for the dole program, something which they thought up on the spur of the moment; we hnd the Prime Minister advising Laurie Oakes on TV, 'Now we will have a work for the dole scheme.' The problem with that is not - l:luch the concept itself. I have to say that I have no problem witl, the idea of reciprocd' ohli--a­ tions. Imicel., the Labor government m i :';)duced programs for unemployed people which involved their having obligations to be involved in th 'se programs. If they refused ,,) participate those programs, they ran tlh risk of hay - their unemployment henefib trlt' 'icasbreached or 'iuspended for a time. However, this work for the dole scheme was a half-baked scheme thought up expressly to take the heat off the Prime Minister over his memory lapses concerning Senator Woods. That became clear in opposition questioning of the government when it was unable to tell the House to whom this work for the dole scheme would relate, what age groups would be involved, what length of unemployment would be involved and what kind of training would accompany it. No information was forthcoming. The latest we hear is that the scheme will apply to some 5,000 people-a laughable proposition in view of the great many Australians who are unemployed. If it is such a good scheme, why does it not apply to more people? Not only was the scheme shown to be in breach of coalition election promises that it would not introduce a work for the dole scheme, but also both Prime Minister Howard and education minister Kemp were caught out claiming that they had never ruled out work for the dole when, in fact, they had. For that, they had to be brought to account here in this Parliament. Then, at the time the government wanted to get its Telstra legislation through the Senate, we had the very unsatisfactory arrangements surrounding Senator Colston's staffing. It was revealed that Senator Colston's application for a substantial pay rise for one of his staffers was supported and approved by the Prime Minister, although at first the President of the Senate, Senator Reid, had opposed that pay rise. Her opposition is not surprising, considering that her own staff did not enjoy those same conditions. But, at a time when the government desperately wanted Senator Colston's vote to get the legislation for the partial privatisation of Telstra through the Senate, his staffer was able to get that pay flse. More recently, we have had the debate in this House concerning the conduct of transport minister Sharp. He has been shown to have been manipulating the members of the CASA board in an attempt to secure their resignation and removal. He has been shown to have enga-ed in inducements and in a variety of improper conduct, so much so that the Prime Minister had to race out of the parliament to get a legal opinion suggesting that his transport minister had not breached the Crimes Act. It was as serious as that-that it required a legal opinion, delivered in record time, on the express issue of whether or not the transport minister was in breach of the Crimes Act. This issue is said by the government to be about aviation safety. I certainly say to transport minister Sharp, who is presently considering the future of Essendon airport, an airport in my electorate, that if he is fair dinkum about aviation safety, he will move to relocate the operations of Essendon airportan airport with an appalling record of aviation safety, with planes crashing into houses and a procession of accidents and incidents as long as your arm. If this minister does not move to relocate those operations from Essendon airport, his credibility on the issue of aviation safety will be absolutely zero. It is little wonder then that the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) was able to say in debate that the expression 'Honest John', as applied to Prime Minister Howard, is an ironic one, much as Australians refer to redheads as 'Bluey' or big blokes as 'Tiny'. It is little wonder also that against that background we have seen for the first time the gap between the political parties closing. The recent Reuters poll trend showed the gap between the two parties on a two-party preferred basis as 6.7 per cent. This is the first time since the 2 March election that it has been a lesser gap than the gap at that t;'nc which was 7.2 per cent. Australians - ire . >,iJ\, confidence in the ability of this govemmen: to deal with the nation's economic problems-and, in particuLr, the problem of unemployment. We have also learnt recently that cabinet meetings are preoccupied with appointments. We have had the health minister take a recommendation to cabinet c:onccrning the appointment of Dr John Funder oniy to have it overturned by his cabinet colleagues. Then we have had the Minister for Primary Indus-tries and Energy (Mr Anderson) take a recommendation to cabinet concerning an extension of the period of appointment lIf John Kerin only to have that overturned by cabinet also. It is a pretty poor way of doing business and reflects a pretty poor set of preoccupations on the part of the cabinet. We also find that one year out from the election of the Howard government, a recent poll was taken asking Australians: do you feel you are more secure? That is a particularly important question, given that we have a Prime Minister who promised to make Australians more relaxed and comfortable. Those were his words: I want Australians to feel relaxed and comfortable. Yet one year out, when Australians are surveyed and asked that fundamental question, 'Do you feel you are more secure?' the majority say no. Then we look at specific areas of government performance and policy, and we find massive shortcomings. There is the legal aid crisis. The federal government has cut legal aid funding to the Legal Aid Commission by an amount in the order of $120 million. This amounts to a 25 per cent reduction in Commonwealth funding. What that meansand I have had this experience related to me by my constituents-is that people who are in the middle of their cases, for example family law cases, get told, 'Either you will have to settle your case or you will have to fund it yourself from here on in.' So at the door of the court, they are left high and dry through the withdrawal of legal aid funding, as a result of the cuts to the legal aid budget initiated hy this government. In the area of family law we have had some appalling cases develop. In the area of civil law, virtually no funding is available. Even in criminal law we are finding some most unsatisfactory situations, with the possibility that people who are charged with quite serious crimes may, in fact, go free because they cannot be provided with an adequate defence enabling them to receive a fair trial. That is a most unsatisfactory situation, and this government has to accept responsibility for it. In the area of education, we have had a massive drop-oIl' anJ decline in participation rates around the states. This commenced with the election of conservative governments. For example, in Victoria, from the time of the Kennett government's election, we had a government which had no commitment towards providing quality education and seeing students through to the end of VCE or secondary education. But this has been exacerbated by the election of a coalition government nationally. Therefore, one of Labor's great achievements-the boosting of that retention rate from one in three children completing secondary school at the time we were elected to over two in three completing secondary school at the time of the conclusion of our period in office-is now at risk. If you look at the area of health, the time that people have to wait for operations has been blowing out. Also, in my own state of Victoria the ambulance service has become quite unreliable. In the area of small business, bankruptcies are up, with the economy bumping along the bottom. Certainly the small businesses that I talk to in my electorate do not have any confidence that the economy is recovering, neither do they see any sign of recovery in terms of their own business performance and business outlook. What a low hurdle the government has been setting itself. It has been crowing about recent news and saying, 'Isn't this good about company profits?' The truth is that a lot of that increase in company profits is on the back of tax avoidance and job sheddingprecisely things we as a community do not want to see. So it is setting itself a very low hurdle. Finally, in the areas of leadership and Australia's role in the world, our profile in Asia, our relations with Europe and all these things that are so fundamental to our prosperity and our reputation, we find a government which has exhibited very poor standards. Our Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) does not have a high reputation internationally",46
95,Mr BRERETON,FERENCE IN SAIPAN AND BILATERAL,Very low.,48
96,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,FERENCE IN SAIPAN AND BILATERAL,"A very low reputation internationally, I am advised by the shadow minister. Australia's reputation internationally has declined and we have suffered accordingly. So there is a lack of leadership for Australia internationally, but nationally as well. The most appalling example of this is in the area of the republic. In a recent survey where most government MPs declined to express a view about whether they were for or against the republic, a number of MPs were asking the paper that conducted the survey, 'What is the position of the Prime Minister? How has he answered the survey?' What an appalling failure of leadership on the Prime Minister's part when even his own MPs have to ask the newspaper, 'How is Prime Minister answering this question?' On an issue as fundamental as the republic, we need some leadership from the Prime Minister and we are certainly not getting it. We have a government which is second rate, a government which has let down many of the people who showed great faith in it and a government which is simply not delivering on the expectations it generated whether in the area of employment, in the area of service standards or in the area of integrity, honesty, propriety and so on. I think it is not unrealistic for us to look towards a change of government in a single term. One of the elements of this has to be labour producing policies which enjoy community support and which are the right policies for Australia as we move into the 21st century. I want to spend the remaining few minutes saying something about what I think opposition policies ought to reflect. Certainly, we have to deal with the issue of privatisation and public ownership. That has been a difficult issue for us and a difficult issue for the Australian community broadly, but we have to make out the case for continued public ownership of those assets and enterprises which are in monopoly situations or where the market will not act to provide decent services for all Australians. So at a state level things like electricity, and water need to be kept in public ownership because they have essentially monopoly characteristics. At a national level, in the area of telecommunications, phone services, postal services and so on, the same things occur. In a privatised system, it is unlikely that the market will deliver a reasonable quality of service at an affordable price to all Australians. I think we also have to look at the issue of the increasing disparity of income between Australians. Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, I had the occasion to read one of your contributions to the parliament not so long ago on the issue of executive salaries. It does strike me as most unreasonable that ordinary wage and salary earners are expected to show restraint in their incomes-and ordinary wage and salary earners have shown great restraint in their incomes-when executive salaries continue to take off. There are some well known examples of this. For example, Peter Bartels' salary of $2.8 million has enjoyed a great deal of coverage at a time when Coles Myers' bottom line was not improving. Overall, the situation is most unsatisfactory. For example, average chief executive pay over the past five years has grown 57 per cent even without share options and fringe benefits. If you throw those in, it is estimated that most of the top 50 chief executives now earn around $35,000 a week, which is what the average wage earner earns in a year. The gap between chief executives and ordinary average workers is growing. Back in 1990, the chief executive's pay was some 36 times that of the average worker. Six years later, it is estimated to be 49 times greater and that does not include important things like share options and fringe benefits. I think we can look at the proposal which you advanced based on the fact that President Clinton had been able to get through the United States Congress a measure whereby any salaries in excess of $1 million a year were not accompanied by tax deduction for the amount in excess of $1 million. If a corporation thinks that its chief executive is worth $1 million, well and good, but they are not going to have the taxpayer subsidise gas salary rates of that kind. I think we can also look at revisiting the issue of progressive taxation applied to salaries of an appropriate kind. Going back a generation or two, we did have in Australia marginal tax rates of 60c in the dollar or even higher, but the levels at which they applied if indexed to today's figures would come in at, for example, $300,000 per annum-much greater salaries. I think that is where progressrise i ve taxation went wrong over the years. It increasingly started to apply to average incomes or not particularly high incomes. If you look at incomes of the order of $300,000 or $500,000, it is not unreasonable to think about reintroducing progressive taxation and increasing that top marginal rate. I also think we could consider looking at chief executive salaries and how they move when it comes to looking at how the wages and conditions of ordinary workers ought to move. We now have enterprise bargaining, company based pay rates and consideration of those pay rates, so why not look at how the chief executive salary has moved and say that that percentage increase is going to apply to wage earners within that particular company? That is the sort of thing the federal government has the capacity to do under the corporations power. I would imagine that some companies would seek to avoid that by restructuring their work force, but it is the kind of thing we have to consider. I also think we have to look at the breakdown of community life and the kind of isolation which is increasingly characteristic of our society. Among the great culprits are TV and media which cause people to cease being involved in community affairs and tend to keep us at home and isolated from each other. I think TV, as the culprit, ought to be asked to make a contribution towards improving standards of community participation by ensuring that these TV and radio companies are required to broadcast community announcements, are required to advertise meetings of community groups and so on. I also think TV plays a considerable role in generating and encouraging violence, so I think it ought to be made to playa role in countering violence. Areas such as protecting petrol franchisees or retail tenants, looking at our taxation system and looking at trusts, negative gearing and so on are all areas for the Labor Party to be involved in in policy development during 1997 as it becomes an alternative government at the next election. (Time expired)",48
97,Mrs CROSIO,FERENCE IN SAIPAN AND BILATERAL,"I today to speak about the appropriation bills. Listening to the previous speaker, the honourable member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson), I realised that it is a just a matter of days until we reach the first anniversary of the Howard government and how time flies even when you are not having fun. Today I would like to pre-empt all the newspaper articles which will undoubtedly appear over the next few weeks-in which our nation's journalists will make their own assessment of the government's first 12 months of office-with a little appraisal of my own. Specifically, I would like to do it with an eye to how the constituents of my electorate have benefited over this past yearthanks to the broken commitments, the insensitivity, the naivety and the poll-driven policies of the Howard government. For a number of reasons, the seat of Prospect has one of the highest rates of unemployment in metropolitan Australia, let alone Sydney. Without being melodramatic, for many of them the employment programs introduced by the former government were a light at the end of the tunnel. They were an opportunity for the long-term unemployed not only to keep their skills up or to obtain new ones but also to maintain or reignite their selfesteem. . For them to hear soon after the Howard government came to power that the labour programs, which had proved so successful in our area and throughout the rest of Australia, were to be gutted beyond recognition was a sickening initial blow. For them to then watch the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) of this country talk the economy and the job market down into the ground over those next few months-and at the same time wax lyrical about how their reforms to small business and industrial relations would provide real jobs some time in the vague future-was downright insulting. Let me give you a picture, Mr Deputy Speaker, of how deep these cuts were in my electorate. Between October 1996 and June 1997, the four skillshare centres in my electorate were given enough federal funding to look after 570 clients between them. In the previous financial year, one of these centres alone had catered for 760 people. Between the four of them they had looked after over 2,000. Remember, this attack has occurred in one of the worse areas of unemployment in metropolitan Australia. Over the last few weeks we have watched the government insult the intelligence of all Australians, not least the unemployed, with its half-baked and ill-conceived work for the dole scheme. It has robbed the unemployed of real training opportunities by gutting Working Nation. Now it has the temerity to try to replace it by throwing out a titbit of policy on the run-policy dreamt up not to solve the problems of youth unemployment but to solve a problem wrought by its own sloppy standards. We all know that if it were not for the Senator Woods fiasco, the Prime Minister would not have bothered releasing anything about work for the dole at all. It is not only the young people in Prospect who are feeling the unemployment pinch. While youth unemployment is, of course, a tragedy, there is an equally tragic situation facing the more mature unemployed members of our society. It is the fathers and the mothers in my electorate who are also being held back by the Howard government's attack on labour market programs. In some respects, their loss of self-esteem is even greater than that of our young people because, as we all know, it is traditionally the parents whose job it is to provide for the family, to work and bring money into the household. It is often the lack of job prospects for parents which puts pressure on families and causes the unrelenting stress which can lead to a family breakdown. In Prospect, social dislocation as a result of long-term unemployment is real, yet the Howard government is not doing anything real to combat it. I said in my response to the budget in September last year that unemployment would run unchecked in my community following the destruction of so many of our labour market programs and that, as a result, we would become divided and dislocated by the crippling social problems associated with long-term joblessness. Sure enough, just five months after making that prediction in this House, Fairfield, one of the major centres in my electorate, is suffering an unprecedented onslaught of crime-thanks in no small way to endemic and untreated unemployment. In broad daylight our streets have witnessed a spate of muggings, assaults and armed robberies-aIl inside the boundaries of the relatively small Fairfield central business district. This is just the beginning. By cutting the heart out of labour market programs in our area, the federal government cut out one of the beacons of hope to our long-term unemployed, and now the rest of us will pay dearly. I, along with many others, issued a warning when this government came to power that, while assisting the jobless may have been costly, not assisting them would be more so. What is happening in Fairfield at the moment is proof of that. Talking about crime, what has happened to legal aid in Prospect during the last year? On 1 July 1996, the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) gave the states a year's notice that Commonwealth legal aid funding would be slashed by $120 million over the next three years. In an area such as Prospect, with a large population of people from financially disadvantaged backgrounds, a robust legal aid system is an absolute necessity in guaranteeing people a fair trial with adequate legal representation-a basic civil right in AustralIa. In New South Wales, and in my electorate of Prospect, we have begun to appreciate just what it means to cut legal aid funding by such an enormous extent. As of 1 November, the New South Wales Legal Aid Commission could no longer afford to fund victims compensation matters, criminal committal hearings and second trials, where the first trial had been hung. It has placed caps of $80,000 on criminal trials and caps of $15,000 for each party in family matters where it is funding both parties to a dispute. In the future they will refuse to fund tenancy matters before the Residential Tenancies Tribunal, antidiscrimination actions and appeals arising from criminal cases in the local court. No doubt it will have to look and make some further unpleasant decisions in the future. It has been estimated that approximately 30,000 fewer people will be assisted in New South Wales because of these cuts. That is 30,000 people the Commonwealth of Australia is duty bound, by its ratification of a number of international treaties, to deliver equality before the law and unimpeded access to justice-obligations from which it is now reneging. Just as we will have to watch the social consequences of the cutting back of the labour programs in my electorate, we will have to bear witness to what happens when people who desperately need a secure legal safety net suddenly find themselves slipping through it. What did the rest of that year hold for my constituents? Well, next the government made a very quick pre-budget sortie against our higher education system. Unlike the young people in the Prime Minister's electorate or in the electorate of the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), the young people in my area have been traditionally disadvantaged when it comes to tertiary study. It was the Hawke and Keating governments which attempted to remedy this fact by establishing the University of Western Sydney. Each administration gave its full support to the concept of not only Austudy but a HECS system balanced evenly between the economic realities of providing higher education and an obligation to allow easy access to tertiary study for as many Australians as possible. To give you an idea of how important the university in our community is and how deprived of tertiary institutions Sydney's west has historically been, as of late last year some 58 per cent of the University of Western Sydney students were in fact the first ever in their families to attend university. The government's changes to Austudy and HECS have robbed the University of Western Sydney of a fine crop of bright young studentsyoung people who have now been deterred from university because of the towering financial burdens they and their families cannot and will not carry. We are seeing the first of a whole new generation from western Sydney who will never be able to gain university qualifications, unlike their more fortunate friends in other parts of Sydney, because of this government's higher education changes. In August of last year came the Howard government's first budget, complete with core and non-core promises, core and non-core honesty. What utter contempt the Prime Minister and the Treasurer displayed for the intelligence of the Australian people. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) said at the time, 'Would you take that from your kids?' Of course not. So why should we take that from this government? Changes to child care, in particular the abolition of the operational subsidy, have been a major concern in my electorate. I have 15 community based child-care centres in Prospect and each will now lose approximately $40,000 following the decision to abolish the subsidy. Recently on the front page of my local paper the director of one of these centres, Carolyn Murdoch from the Marlborough Street preschool in Smithfield, pointed out just how badly her centre will now be affected. Ms Murdoch said that at Marlborough Street there are currently 20 kids with disabilities requiring special attention ranging from speech problems to autism, attention deficit disorder, severe language disorders and developmental delays. In the past there have also been children at the centre with cerebral palsy and other physical disabilities. Now that the centre's operational subsidy is disappearing, how will Ms Murdoch offer the special care these children need, special care that the operational subsidy went a long way to providing? Ms Murdoch will have to decide. Will she increase the centre's charge to parents to make up for that loss? Many of the parents in my area cannot afford that extra $14 to $25 per child per week. Will she let staff go? If so, will the standard of special care for these kids deteriorate? What an abhorrent set of choices Ms Murdoch has to face or, more particularly, what an abhorrent set of choices the federal government has forced Ms Murdoch to face. The situation is similarly grim for the childcare centres in the adjoining Holroyd local government area, some of which are located in Prospect. Again, each of the four centres are losing $40,000 without the operational subsidy. Holroyd City Council has decided to make up for the shortfall by increasing its fees by roughly $20 per child per week come I July. Those who cannot afford it, and there are many, will just have to fall by the wayside. This government's budget has effectively compromised the level of standard offered to these kids, some of whom, as I have said, have serious special needs. How can the members opposite go along with this? How do they go back to their offices and electorates content in their job knowing this sort of thing is going on in their community? We have had the coalition parade its women members like they were prized heifers at the Easter Show, yet I have not heard a single one of them speak out about how these moves are affecting single mothers and families within their electorates. Why won't they stand up and be counted on this issue? When the government was not attacking child care in the budget it was attacking the elderly with its abolition of the Commonwealth dental health program and by allowing nursing home operators to charge anything upwards of $25,000 for a person to get a bed in one of their establishments. The Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) can stand at the dispatch box time and time again and repeat until she is blue in the face that nobody will be forced to sell their house for a nursing home bed but she has so far refused to point out where her bill actually stops this from occurring if you live neither with your spouse nor with a relative carer on a pension. The minister refuses to do this for the quite simple reason that her legislation does not exclude the houses of the single elderly from the entry payment assets test for nursing homes. The elderly people of Prospect are worried sick about this and they know who to blame. One of the things we have to remember is that 90 per cent of those people who are now going into nursing homes live by themselves. By budget's end, despite the family tax initiative hoax, families in my electorate were indeed worse off. An average household was out of pocket by approximately $4 a week and families dependent on unemployment benefits, of which there are many in Prospect, were out of pocket by almost $38 a week-a massive slug for the underprivileged. The next highlight of the year, particularly for the large proportion of people from ethnic backgrounds in my electorate-and I have one of the highest in Australia-was the Prime Minister's calculated and destructive inaction over the comments of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). Just 12 days after her maiden speech, the Prime Minister casually sauntered up to the Queensland Division of the Liberal Party's State Council and said: One of the great changes that have come over Australia in the last six months is that people do feel able to speak a little more freely and a little more openly about what they feel ... I think there has been that change and I think that's a very good thing. I hope it continues. That was our poll driven Prime Minister's code, directed at a middle Australia already convulsing from the acrimonious race debate for 'Good onya, Pauline'. I do not want to go over old ground but suffice to say that the Prime Minister's code had the required effect out my way. My office received a number of complaints from people from ethnic backgrounds who had been abused in the street and even spat on, and I find that disgraceful. Conversely, I received a number of ugly letters, some of them understandably anonymous, demanding I support the comments of the member for Oxley and congratulating the Prime Minister for his refusal to condemn that member's VIews. To the distress of Prospect's ethnic population, the Prime Minister's code had well and truly been deciphered and, even :hough the immigration storm has abated SI mcwhat, the shock waves are still reverbcr-lli ng through my community. The antagonisr:: fuelled by the Prime Minister's comments .- still being felt. Let us now tum to the go\nent' s form over Badgerys Creek in the past 12 months. Talk about up hill and down d-Le! Firstly, the government announced its deClO on to condu:t an EIS into Holsworthy. CI (, Che: minist':r proclaimed that Badgerys Creek was still the government's No.1 option. That was in May of last year. Next, the government ordered a stop to all work at the Badgerys Creek site, spending the $600 million of the airports development funding, plus the $218 million from the planned road system for the airport. Back to the Treasury that went to ease the budget woes. This was in June. Who knew what was happening? In July we were hit with the news that the government was looking at making Badgerys twice as big as planned for by the former government, with 360,000 movements and 30 million passengers per year rather than the 270,000 movements previously considered. Then in November we were shown two new layouts for the airport's runways, along with the previous proposal for consideration under the new Badgerys Creek EIS. To top it off, after all the chopping and changing and inconsistencies which have characterised this government's airport policy, we now know that the flight paths and runway configuration for both Badgerys Creek and Holsworthy conflict badly with the new flight paths recently announced for Kingsford Smith. Again I ask: who knows what is happening? The people of Prospect certainly do not, and the members on the government benches do not. It is the government's duty to provide leadership and clear decision making on this matter. Through its utter failure to provide anything even closely resembling that, it has created suspicion and uncertainty. Many people are thinking that maybe they are not being told the whole truth about this government's plans for Badgerys Creek. Clear and rational decision making has never been a hallmark of this government. Its first 12 months have been marked by political cowardice, impotent leadership and the Prime Minister's taste for creating social division. Benjamin Barber, the American political theorist, wrote in his book The conquest of politics: [""eral philosophy in democratic times: We are always juggling \vith other men's fates, whether intentionally or not, for our lives are always entwined with the lives of others in an ecology no less precariously balanced than nature's. Our delicate human ecosystem we call Australian society has been disturbed quite dramatically over the past year. I am sorry to say that it will be upset even more over the next two. The people of Prospect will hang on because they are fighters, but they will hurt nonetheless. If the Prime Minister cared, he would take a step back and see how much his government's policies are destined to split and divide my community and many other communities like it. Unfortunately, I doubt that he will. The only positive we have in the seat of Prospect is that they will neither forget nor forgive him for it. In Prospect, the Prime Minister's honeymoon, and that of the coalition government, is most definitely over.",50
98,Mr SERCOMBE,FERENCE IN SAIPAN AND BILATERAL,"I would like to use the opportunity for wide-ranging debate presented by the appropriation bills to talk about several aspects of manufacturing industry in Australia and refer specifically to a couple of industries. The fundamental importance of this issue, I think, was illus.trated the other day when the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) tabled the trade outcomes and outlook statement which, amongst other things, said: The data released today shows that over the past 10 years unprocessed primary exports fell from 53% to 38% of total Australian produce exports, while Elaborately Transformed Manufactures rose from 11% to 20%. That is a pretty stark illustration of the importance of manufacturing industry to this country in terms of adding value to this country's trade. Many members had the opportunity in the last sitting week to visit the display that was in the Great Hall, organised by the Textile Fashion Industry Association. That display showed the evolution in this country of a vital TCF industry, an industry which is committed to value adding and has developed a very significant export orientation. This is an industry that has over the last decade undergone massive change and restructuring. It is an industry of some $10 billion worth of production, 3,500 companies, 96,000 employees and $1 billion in exports. That compares with effectively no exports from that industry 10 years ago. Offsetting that, of course, is a $4.7 billion import bill in those industries. It is an industry that adds value not only in a physical sense to fabric but also through marketing, design, finance and service provision. It is an increasingly smart industry. I instance that by a new product that was displayed in the Great Hall the other week-a world first known as denim wool, being developed by a consortium of five companies in Australia, Bradmill being one of the leaders in that. It is a unique fabric which will make a huge impact on international markets-an Australian success story. Australia is committed to free trade by the year 2010. However, I believe the crucial issue for all sides of this chamber is the positioning of this country and crucial industries within this country in the lead-up to that. The question could well be asked: why should we be attempting to win a one-horse race in the next few years in relation to achieving those trade Iiberalisations that we are as a nation committed to? TCF is one of the largest areas of global trade in manufacturing. The latest figures I have show global trade valued at $340 billion in 1992. Just to put that into some sort of context, that is double the value of trade in iron and steel internationally. It is a rapidly growing area of international trade which will accelerate in coming years through a variety of factors, such as the phasing out of the multifibre arrangement. Australia, as I said before, needs to be positioning itself to take full advantage of that growth. We need an effective domestic base for the industry in Australia. We need to consolidate that domestic base and we need to remove barriers, where we can, to the export growth of our manufactures. Most of our competitors (>'lI1tinuc and \'.! d con1 inue to manage their TeF indust: ics and pruvld.: incentives in their own don Il:stic market-> lJJ Ii; ->e Au-tra1ia, most OECD countries, inciuLimg blocs such as the European C\lll,munity, maintain bilateral quutas and will maintain thcm for some l \lI1siJ::rablc tim-' into the future. ! \lI1dcrstand that the UK, for example, recently added eight extra quota categories to its quota system and the United States, as you would be aware, not so long ago in fact cut the quota levels for TCF imports from China. We are seeing a situation where throughout the world there are continuing distortions in the international operation of this industry. It is simply crazy for Australia to be engaging in unilateral disarmament in the role of the public sector in relation to this industry. The fundamental question is whether targets are going to be achieved by the year 2005. I think we need to note in that context that special safeguard provisions will continue to provide opportunities for short-term imposition of quotas-up to three years for sudden surges in imports-amongst some of our competitors, That is a situation that Australia does not have recourse to. The export orientation I have referred to in this industry has been very heavily influenced and underwritten by the import credit scheme that the former government introduced and which is now in the process of being phased out. It is intended to end by the year 2000. It seems to me absolutely fundamental for the positioning of a strong Australian TCF industry, an internationally competitive one, that it gets the opportunities to grow itself internationally. The industry has adopted a target of growing the $1 billion in exports it is currently achieving to some $3V2 billion over the next decade. If it is to achieve that, it needs either a continuation of the import credit scheme or some variation of it that achieves the same sorts of levels of support for the industry. Capital investment in the industry is already showing indications of winding down because of the continuing uncertainty in the industry about the level of government commitment to it, as reflected in schemes such as import credit. The importance of that sort of program in specific terms is indicated by a couple of very significant success stories in the industry. I referred earlier to Bradmill' a company that is based in the western suburbs of Melbourne and which is certainly developing a very significant export orientation towards We United States. Hong Kong, Fiji and other parts of the globe. It is a company which said in a recent media release: The Import Credit Scheme has allowed us to commit millions of dollars to our position as an important Australian manufacturer. The downgrading of the ICS and its eventual abolition is affecting us right now. We are facing the end of our ability to continue at the same scale, and to imagine further growth here. Another Australian success story is Churinga Designs. BRW, in its recent listing of Australia's 100 fastest growing companies, has included this company on its list. Something like 40 per cent of its total profit is export generated, which would have been inconceivable a decade ago, given the sorts of policy settings that were in place. Up until the point where, hopefully, our trading partners and other nations engage in reciprocal processes of trade liberalisation, it is madness for us to put at risk these sorts of success stories on the altar of some sort of economic rationalism-whatever expression one wants to use-in circumstances where we are doing that unilaterally. We need to maintain the level of support for industry and to ensure that tariff levels are protected up until the period when general liberalisation ought to occur. Just in case there is any doubt about what other countries may be doing in this respect, and given the fact that Australia would continue to be acting in accordance with its international obligations if some of these programs continued, I will quote a recent comment made by Mr Jan-Erik Sorenson, the director of the textiles division of the World Trade Organisation in Brussels: Full integration of textile and clothing into WTO rules may lawfully be postponed until the very end of the phaseout period (January I 2005) for a large proportion of the products which the ATCthe agreement on textiles and clothingcovers. At the Singapore ministerial conference of the World Trade Organisation, it was made abundantly clear that if Australia acts unilaterally it will be in fairly lonely company. Hong Kong's Secretary for Trade and Industry, Denise Yue, referring to problems in the performance of the A TC, made the following remarks: Since it came into force, said she, ""the trend thus far has been towards further restrictions, rather than relaxation of restraints"". The director of the Geneva based International Textiles and Clothing Bureau, Sanjoy Baghehi, stated: ""the spirit of the Agreement is not being followed, though legally there are no complaints to be made"". He said that the new US Rules of Origin and the EU's anti-dumping measures were new forms of trade restrictions against textiles and garments which had made the A TC 'meaningless' and that the new US Rules of Origin would wipe out the bedsheet industry in Bangladesh. Those are just a couple of comments from the many examples I could quote about the real environment in the world textile trade. They simply underline the silliness of Australia contemplating unilateral action. Let us look at other specific markets. I understand that Taiwan has tariffs of up to 20 per cent on TCF imports and a whole range of non-tariff barriers: import licensing is widespread, local content requirements apply to most imports and there are costly, complex registration procedures, quota restrictions and a variety of export subsidies. Malaysia has tariffs in the range of 10 to 30 per cent. It also has a range of non-tariff barriers: luxury taxes apply to imported TCF items and import licensing is widespread. There are also restrictive technical standards, registration procedures and quota restrictions. Once again, export subsidies are available. As I said before, any suggestion that Australia ought to be acting unilaterally really would put us at odds with what the reality is in the rest of the world. Another industry which has been subject to considerable debate-I do not intend to cover all the areas of debate that have already been before this House-is the car industry, a very significant manufacturing industry. It is one of the bases of manufacturing in Australia. It is a very different industry in its ownership and its structure from the TCF industry. Nonetheless, it is an industry which produces over $7 biIIion in vehicles and directly employs 45,000 people, with the automotive components industry employing more than 24,000 people with sales of over $5.4 billion. Very significantly, it is an industry which really exists in its current form because of commitment of the former government to It appropriate industry policy and appropriate policy designed to achieve export orientation in that industry. What sort of international environment does that industry face? If one looks at South Korea, for example, a country with a rapidly growing market share in Australia, according to the figures I have, South Korean imports a proportion of total value imported have liberalisation. grown from about two per cent in 1988 to nearly seven per cent in 1995. South Korea, which is widely regarded as a developed nation, maintains prohibitive barriers to our exports. That includes both tariff and nonof tariff barriers such as import charges, 60 cent local content requirements and the I understand that Indonesia has a most prohibitive set of trade restrictions in relation to importation of completed motor vehicles. It has tariffs of 125 per cent, with surcharges of 75 per cent and 60 per cent local content requirements. Japan, with no tariff barriers, industries. nonetheless, has an eight per cent limit on imports as a proportion of total vehicles. Taiwan, which I referred to in the context the discussion on TCF, has made some appropriate gestures towards Australia in faith recent times, agreeing to provide a market 2,000 vehicles, but nonetheless has a long way to go. We run the risk of driving the motor industry offshore. If the industry policy settings are who not right in Australia, there is a real chance that the parent companies could simply cease to invest in future models and could well and make those investment decisions in neighagainst bouring countries which provide a more welcoming policy context for them. The recent announcement of General Motors, example, to build a $750 million plant for the production of the Opel vehicle in Thailand, lends considerable support to that view. The bargain with. realities are that we run a substantial driving a core element of Australian manufacturing industry offshore if we simply do not get it right. The realities are, as I have illustrated, that That reciprocity in our own region and elsewhere with respect to protection of industry is not the obviously forthcoming in the current climate. is very much, and understandably, a matter of national pride for many newly developing nations to have their own car industry. I also refer to Mr Webber's minority report to the Productivity Commission's report, where he made particular reference to his suspicion that in due course automobile production may well be subject to clauses in relation to special as provisions within the context of general trade Against those sorts of backgrounds, I come back to my earlier point-that is, if this country wants a viable, strong manufacturing industry, for us to go down the path that some the proponents who seem to have the ear per of this government seem to want, we run the like. risk of not understanding the important lessons of the 1980s where we have in this country, through appropriate partnerships and appropriate policy development, achieved high value adding, world competitive, quality producing, export oriented manufacturing From time to time people write columns in newspapers about this debate. In this case of Alan Wood wrote an article in the Australian on 4 February headed 'Why we must keep the on tariffs'. I think somewhat inadvertentfor ly Mr Wood tends to give the game away here. He is talking in his article, amongst other things, about Australia not giving comfort to those people in ASEAN countries are opposed to liberalisation of their own trade. He writes: ""Why on earth would we want to give comfort succour to those within those countries arguing such unilateral action, by ourselves reverting to the view that the only reason to reduce tariffs is if somebody else does too ... for These are Mr Woods' words: It is particularly stupid to do so when we have already cut our tariffs and thus have little to risk of I repeat those words: It is particularly stupid to do so when we have already cut our tariffs and thus have little to bargain with. is precisely the point I am trying to make. It is particularly stupid for this country in the lead-up to, hopefully, a successful outcome in the first decade of the next century of generalised trade liberalisation to undergo a process of unilateral cuts, cuts where we simply do not have things to bargain with with some of the legitimately hard-nosed competitors we have to operate with in that international environment. This is a matter where I hope higher degrees of bipartisanship may be achieved because it is very much a matter that goes to the heart of the future of this country in relation to being able to provide a range of jobs across a diversity of industries for the people of this country into the next century.",54
99,Ms MACKLIN,FERENCE IN SAIPAN AND BILATERAL,"We are seeing a lot of clever analysis this week about the election of this government being a watershed event in Australian electoral history and representing a great change in voting patterns and trends that emerged to show the move of the so-called battlers from Labor to the Howard government. What I want to talk about today in this debate on the appropriation bills is that the treatment of these battlers since the election certainly does not show any sense of gratitude. It is the case that successive Labor governments designed and introduced programs to provide genuine assistance for those who are battling. Whether it is people on low wages, older Australians, the unemployed, single parents, the sick or the disabled-all have suffered severe cuts during this the first year of the Howard government. Some of these cuts have been delayed or disguised-such as the cuts to child care, which will not come into effect until April or July this year, no doubt in the hope of softening community reaction. But other things have been wiped out completely. The one I want to emphasise today is the total abolition of the Commonwealth dental program. We introduced this dental program in response to a direct need for assistance for many Australians, because it was acknowledged that there were a number of people in our community who had great need for dental care. It is strange that even the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has admitted in the House that the Commonwealth dental program was a good program, and he said that he regretted its passing. It is a pity then that he was not strong enough to stand up on behalf of Australians needing dental care against the economic rationalist agendas of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) so that people who need access to decent health care, particularly dental care, could get that covered. The Melbourne Age, in an editorial after the budget, described this as 'perhaps the cruellest and meanest cut in the federal budget'. It went on: It will inflict pain in a real sense, often excruciatingly so, on those least able to afford or to avoid or relieve the agony. The Age makes the point that the program was: . .. introduced in 1992 to augment woefully inadequate state financing of dental care for the poor, aged and jobless. The Director of Dental Services in Victoria has made the point that low income earners, before the introduction of the program, had sought dental treatment, because of its cost, only as a last resort when driven by severe pain. This meant that the treatment was usually an extraction. Earlier intervention would have required only fillings but, of course, they could not afford it. What Martin Dooland claimed was that the abolition of the program would add 70,000 people a year to waiting lists for treatment in Victoria alone. This is a point that has been strongly supported by the Victorian state Liberal Minister for Health, Rob Knowles, who has also predicted dire consequences as a result of losing more than 50 per cent of the Victorian dental health program that had previously been provided by the Commonwealth. He expects that waiting lists at the Melbourne dental hospital will blowout to more than four years as a result of this program's termination. The Victorian government department responsible for dental services has issued a pamphlet to explain what the cuts mean, titled 'Changes to public dental services'. It says: The Commonwealth Dental Health Program ... will cease on 31 December 1996 resulting in a loss of $13.5 million to Victoria in 1996-97 and $27.1 million in a full year. Service changes, in particular the introduction of patient copayments, are necessary to make up the loss of revenue from the Federal Government. So the Victorian government is making it absolutely clear where the responsibility lies for the large payments that now have to be made by people on health care cards and reliant on pensions who have no other alternatives but to go to community health centres or the dental hospital for their care. They now will have to pay large out-of-pocket costs to get essential dental care. In my electorate of Jagajaga, we are already seeing some of these dire predictions of the Victorian health minister being borne out. I have two excellent community health centres in my electorate. At the West Heidelberg Community Health Centre, waiting lists for treatment have jumped from 732 in November last year to 1,126 this month. So in a matter of a little over two months we have seen a huge increase in the number of people waiting for dental care. The same can be said about the Eltham Community Health Centre, but with even bigger numbers. Since the announcement of the end of the scheme, the waiting list has more than doubled, from 315 people to 648. As I said, the Victorian government is going to enable some sort of scheme to continue by making sure that people on pensions or health care cards pay significant up-front fees for their care. So what we are going to see at West Heidelberg and at Eltham is the following: a $20 up-front fee for emergency cases. So it does not matter how much pain you are in and how little money you have in your pocket; you will have to put $20 on the table before a dentist will see you. And other treatment will require 20 per cent of the amount of the cost of the treatment to be paid up-front, up to a maximum of $80, before a person can get essential dental care. For those particularly older people who need dentures, it will cost them $200 for a set of full dentures. It seems to me that this government has absolutely no idea that pensioners cannot pay these sorts of fees. They will go without essential treatment. They will have to have their teeth pulled out instead of getting them fixed. They will be unable to eat properly. They will not go out in public as a result of these very serious changes. I heard the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) trying to justify this change here in the House yesterday. The government has attempted to justify its action by claiming that much of the program was poorly located and going to the well-off. In fact, it was only for holders of health care cards, and most facilities were in community health centres like West Heidelberg or Eltham or in existing dentist clinics. Last October, in an effort to prevent the cessation of the program, representatives of 14 organisations who represent 800,000 older Australians wrote to the Minister for Health and Family Services-some of these organisations are not necessarily ones you would consider to be antagonistic towards the government: the Association of Independent Retirees, the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation, Council on the Ageing, National Seniors Association, the Returned Services League of Australia and a number of other organisations-letting him know that over half a million pensioners and health card holders had been treated under the dental health program. In their view the program had been a success. They said in their letter to the Minister for Health and Family Services: It has reduced waiting periods for public dental health treatment ... It has also demonstrated that we can have a program with a mix of Commonwealth and State funds which operates via both public and private dentists thereby offering people a choice of service providers. They also said in their letter: We are concerned that the abrupt cessation of Commonwealth funding without assurances from State Governments to take up this gap ... They are worried that there will be a great loss in the gains that had been made. What they did not know at that time was the state governments would put in place a system whereby very significant payments would come out of people's pockets to meet the shortfall that the Commonwealth had previously met. As a result of these changes, people who need dental health care will not be able to go to private dentists any more. They will have to queue up at either the dental hospital or community health centres like West Heidelberg and Eltham. A number of other significant changes in this budget have had very serious effects on older people. Once again, it is older people who are battling against the changes to their living standards that this government is seeking to make. The changes that are regularly raised with me relate to the increasing cost of prescriptions and hearing aids. One of the promises this government gave before the election was that it would not do anything to affect any of the concessional arrangements for pensioners. That promise has been broken time and again-in relation to the abolition of the dental program, in relation to the increase in the cost of prescriptions and in relation to the increase in the cost of hearing services, not to mention the massive problems that will result when the government's changes to nursing home funding are introduced. Compounding all of these attacks on the very vulnerable in our community has been the government's attitude to the unemployed. Lately that attitude has been displayed often in the House. We do not see any evidence from the government that it understands the crucial link between education, training and the ability to find employment. The government has completely axed training programs. The recent fiasco with Austudy has ensured that a large number of low income students will miss out on tertiary education this year. The mea culpa of the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) on this issue came a bit late for them because the places had been filled and they will not be able to get into university. La Trobe University is in my electorate, a large number of low income students live locally. We have had a constant stream of inquiries from students who have been devastated by the government's changes to Austudy. In the few days since the minister's unreserved apology to these students--of course, much too late as far as their educational opportunities are concerned-we have been trying to contact students to let them know, including through the media, that they should go back to the relevant office to have their circumstances looked at again. Local labour market training programs have also suffered severely. I see in the chamber my colleague the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins), whose electorate is adjacent to mine. I know he shares my great interest in an organisation called Mature Action, which is located in Greensborough and Heidelberg. That organisation provides valuable assistance to older unemployed people, who find it especially hard to find jobs. As a result of this government's attack on battlers in the over-50 age group who are trying to get back into the work force, Mature Action have had a 30 per cent cut in their budget. So much for being concerned about helping people back into the work force. There has also been a tightening of the eligibility criteria for those seeking assistance, which has made it twice as hard for those people who are over 50 and out of work and the disabled to access Mature Action's program-a very serious cut that belies the government's attention to battlers. Whether your focus is national or local, what is starkly obvious once you look at the details is that this government cares nothing for battlers. Whether it is the dental health program, helping mature aged people get back into the work force, helping people who are on hard times pay for their essential medicines or helping people who need hearing aids so they can afford them, this government has attacked each and everyone of these areas and people's living standards. The soul of the government has been replaced by polls. That is really what is driving this government-not the things that will help increase the living standards of battling Australians. They have been severely and attacked by this government. After one year of this Howard government, it is obvious-it is certainly the case in my electorate, particularly amongst those who need to use the services of the West Heidelberg Community Health Centre, the Eltham Community Health Centre or Mature Action-that we have a very mean-spirited, anti-battler government here in Canberra and one that we will continue to battle against to ensure that we can provide the services that people need.",58
100,Mr JENKINS,FERENCE IN SAIPAN AND BILATERAL,"It is very instructive in an important debate such as this on these appropriation bills where we are discussing a net increase of some $1.059 billion in expenditure that so far we have had only the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) and two members of the coalition opposite enter the debate and a speakers list dominated by members of the opposition who wish to get up and speak. One has to ask: what are the coalition members doing? One assumes that they are sitting in their rooms following the debate on TV and radio, wondering whether this is all there is to it, templating their navels, or perhaps suggesting what else there is to do. I say to those members opposite, especially those who are not executive members, that if they really want to discuss parliamentary standards what they have to understand is that they play a great role in this place as well. They play a great role in reviewing the excesses of executive government. If they are going to allow executive government to say to them, 'We've got a tight schedule. We've got problems in the way we've set our parliamentary schedule. Please don't speak on this important piece of legislation,' I say to think twice about that; do not let the executive dominate in that fashion. One of the underlying problems the coalition has is that of course there are a number of debates going on within its party room. Those who make decisions about the coalition's participation in the debates have decided that they are going to restrict the opportunities that enable some of those dissident members in their backbench to question the direction of this government. This is the 52nd week of the Howard conservative coalition government. It is a time when we can reflect on what has been done in that past year. By any estimation, this government has failed and continues to fail. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said that he wanted Australians to feel more relaxed and comfortable. His government has even failed to deliver on this most supine of all objectives. A poll published in the weekend newspapers showed that many people feel less secure than they did one year ago. Why do people feel less secure? One of the major reasons is that this government has failed to address the main problem that confronts us as a nation, and that is jobs. Worse still, since the election the government's policies have made the situation much worse in a number of respects. Recently we have had the Treasurer (Mr Costello) come forward and revise the budgetary estimates on unemployment from 8.25 per cent to 8.5 per cent. Madam Deputy Speaker Crosio, in your earlier contribution as the honourable member con- for Prospect you made the most succinct observation that not only is the overall level of unemployment a concern but the impact across regions is also a problem because it is impacting on regions in different ways. Like the electorate of Prospect, the Scullin electorate is within a region that is getting its disproportionate share of unemployment. The Scullin electorate is part of the northeastern region of Melbourne. Unemployment in this region is in crisis. Month after month unemployment in the region is stuck at an unacceptably high level of 12 per cent. There is no light at the end of the tunnel on those them: figures. For several months in a row this region has had the highest unemployment in Victoria. Going beyond that, the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), who represents an electorate in the north-western region. knows the impact of high unemployment in his region. Unemployment levels in the northeastern suburbs of Melbourne are now even higher than in the region in which his electorate is. Over 25,000 people in the region are unable to find work. Madam Deputy Speaker. try telling these people that everything is peachy because there is low inflation and interest rates are coming down. What they want to know is when this will lead tu J'> The most alarming thing of all IS i': people are being given no hope. The horizol' is bleak. The region will suffer further Ii .. creases in unemployment, for instance, if thL changes to automotive tariffs recommendeu by the Industry Commission are embracec The government needs to rule these out quickly not only so that the industry can dn forward planning but also so that those unemployed people and those people employed in these industries can be given hope. What we should be looking at, of course, is creating jobs that can be sustained, jobs that will stay around. The north-east region and in particular the High Street corridor are examples of market failure. The region is always last to recover and the first to suffer. There could be fewer compelling examples of the need-in fact the duty-of the government to be proactive in developing a regional strategy for employment and growth than this region. The region has great strengths. The metropolitan ring road has brought it closer to important transport nodes such as the airport and the docks. Remember, Madam Deputy Speaker, that the metropolitan ring road was embraced as part of the n<H'dnal highway strategy by Labor governments. They recognised that in connecting the Hume Highway to the Princes Highway there was great economic benefit because it brought together industries and those people who can work in the industries. Within the region there is a motivated. willing work force. There is significant tertiary educational infr:l,truuure-RMIT, with its Bundoora campus; Ll Trobe; the northern metro collc-e of TAFE; and. whilst it is outside the regio-, but in deference to the honourable member for Calwell. Kangan T AFE, which is a great success st(lry. There arLO companies prepared to be involved in export drives across diverse sectors ranging from food proc(:'ssing through to high quality textiles and engineering components. The examples of successful companies that have entered into not only export drives but also import replacement are great within the region, whether they be in diverse products such as chicken feet, which are a delicacy in Asia, for which companies are opening Asian markets, or even companies that are innovative enough to sell Melbourne water into Asian markets. Other companies which sell saw bits and high quality textiles are also success stories. The success of companies like this depends partly on the region continuing to get support and guidance from governments of all levels. What have we seen in the north-east of Melbourne from this government? A combination of indifference and contempt. There are a number of examples of this. In my electorate, land at J anefield was formerly used by the Department of Health and Community Services in Victoria for housing mainly intellectually disabled people. With the changes in policy, these people have been integrated and housed in the community and most of that land is excess to requirements. As part of the building better cities program, this land was earmarked to create an interesting development for employment opportunities and residential purposes. One of the ideas for this land was for an automotive technology precinct. This had the support of the Keating Labor government. It had the interest of the Kennett state Liberal government. it had the interest of the local authorities and it most definitely had the interest of RMIT for a local university. Things were proceeding in what ,lppeared to be a positive fashion, but since the change of government at the federal level things have gone very cool. I raised this matter with the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore). In his replv to me, he said: The fcderal GovcrnmCl:l recogni,e' that the Au,tralian automotive industry's competitive eJge ·.vil! rely on providing adv:lI1ceJ design and technoh)g) services for the Asi:l ! '.lcitic rcgion. In parallel with the activities beillg undertaken by the commercial intercsts on the dey elopment of a park, my department has been working on identifying and dn eloping the potential synergies that will deliver leading edge autnmoti \ c activ ities. These activities include research and development, design and engineering services, access to new technologies and techniques, testing and training. The minister acknowledges the merit of the project but then says that the government has some great doubt about the sustainability and the commitment of the industry to the project. To give credit to the minister, he went so far in his letter to me to admit that his response was not as enthusiastic as I had been seeking. In fact, he said: I know that you may find my response less enthusiastic than you were hoping for ... Whilst I thank the minister for his candour, I cannot accept the response. The region needs a boost and we are being told that it is the market that will determine whether the Janefield automotive development proceeds. As the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe) said earlier in this debate, one of the great success stories of the industry plan was the motor vehicle assembly plan. It has ensured that we have had an onshore industry in Australia, but it requires continuing support. We did not place enough emphasis in that original plan on all the companies and industries that are involved in the assembly of motor vehicles. The component factories and the factories that provide equipment to the assembly plants are all important aspects of this large industry. When it is apparent that the market is going to fail a region such as the north-eastern suburbs of Melbourne, we need the government to intervene to address the market failure. Of course, low inflation and low interest rates can be expected at some stage to create jobs, but without government involvement there is no mechanism to ensure that all Australians share in the opportunities created. That is what attracted me to the comments of the honourable member for Prospect when she spoke on behalf of her constituents. She said that they want to share in the prosperity that can be achieved if government and community and business work together. Without government involvement, there is no guarantee that the jobs will be sustainable. It is not only the regional distribution of the jobs but also the sustainability of the jobs. When the government was in opposition they railed on about real jobs. They said these were not real jobs. What is the definition of a real job? What is it that we are really trying to achieve? Surely, we are trying to achieve industries that will provide employment not only for this generation but for future generations. The government should be about creating sustainable jobs. Another example of indifference in the region from the government is the company Howe Leather. The appropriation bills that we are discussing today contain a grant of $5 million and a loan of $30 million to Howe Leather. As a watcher of the developments surrounding Howe Leather, never was public money being handed out more grudgingly than it appears to have been in this case. Before Christmas, we were assured that decisions would be made, but despite assurances to the contrary the Howe Leather work force was left to swing over the Christmas break. Then the announcement was made on New Year's Day in what seemed to be the quiet of night. Howe Leather is a first-rate company that has risen to the challenge of developing products for export markets. In 1988, seven per cent of Howe Leather's volume went in exports. In 1996, over 90 per cent of the volume of their business was in exports. At the same time as that increase has occurred, there has been a considerable growth in the business of Howe Leather. One of the first successes of Howe Leather was to become the largest supplier of leather-not just any old leather but quality leather-to BMW in Germany. They now provide export leather to Honda and Subaru in Japan. They have a contract with the US about which difficulties have been running for six months. But already that six-month period has given them a great deal of market credibility. It has attracted other inquiries from US manufacturers. In fact, Howe Leather have great hopes for further expansion. But they did not come forward just to seek a handout. They did not come forward with some mentality of business welfare. What they required to be able to get into markets was some assistance; a helping hand. TImt is all they were seeking. Their export drive is well over $80 million this year, which is a considerable amount. Howe Leather are very much an inspiration to the region. When there was a question mark over their ability to continue their drive into the United States, my concern was that any failure on their part would lead to an uneasiness amongst the business community in the region. They really required the full support of government, not the grudging support that they appear to be receiving in this bill. Howe Leather can continue to be an example to other businesses that are considering going into exporting. The attitude to lanefield and the treatment of Howe Leather are typical of the indifference with which the north-east region-the region within the electorate which I represent-has been treated by the government. The region continues to be treated with contempt. Early in the month, for example, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) announced the pathways program: a job program for school leavers. Despite the fact that the north-east region of Melbourne has, month after month, the highest level of unemployment in the state, the region was completely overlooked for funding under this program. It will surprise no-one familiar with the political geography of Melbourne that the lion's share of the services announced under this program has gone to the other side of the Yarra. During the 13 years of Labor governments, funding under programs was based according to need. It would appear, from the example of this pathways program, that we are going to go back to the bad old days. The coalition minister will simply throw money at marginal seats. When questioned about this, the response of the government as quoted in the local press is that the program is targeted at schools with a high level of vocational education programs. That is simply not good enough. It is a disgrace. Surely this program, which is to benefit young people getting into employment, should be targeted at schools that are within regions and communities where there are high levels of unemployment. It is the responsibility of government to ensure that the programs are targeted to the areas of highest need. The government must ensure that, when it tenders out employment assistance services later this year, those services are located where unemployed people are. I fear from this example that we are going to have the same sort of thing happening. The government must act to ensure that opportunities for sustainable jobs are open to all citizens of all regions. The market will ensure that by itself. The concern for the future of this nation is that the government has played all its ideological cards. It has pandered to the markets by excessive cuts in government spending. It has bashed welfare recipients and introduced pernicious new eligibility tests, some of which it now apologises for. It has attempted to give incentives to people to remain in private health insurance, but it has succeeded only in giving a huge boost to the coffers of the funds. As the shadow minister revealed at question time, there is now a further request for increases by the private health funds. The industrial relations system has been opened up to market anarchy. (Time expired)",61
101,Mr CAMPBELL,FERENCE IN SAIPAN AND BILATERAL,"I am grateful that the Appropriation Bill (No.3) 1996-97 and cognate bills enable me to range widely in my remarks. I would like to start off with the economic implications of the death of Deng Xiaoping in China. I believe there will be no economic implications from his death, but I believe that Deng Xiaoping's greatest contribution to China was to substantially reduce the cult of the individual. In that regard, I think he has done a tremendous job. He certainly had a turbulent history. Some of his actions were questionable but, overall, I do not think there is any doubt that Deng Xiaoping had a great commitment to China. It is my view that the responsibility of government is to govern for its citizens and for no-one else. There has been a lot of criticism of Deng Xiaoping for events surrounding Tiananmen Square. I was in China shortly after that occasion and talked a lot to the local people about it. It is absolute nonsense to believe that China could not have excluded the media had it wanted to. After all, Burma does this all the time. China encouraged the media to be at Tiananmen Square because it wanted to send a clear message to the world that China was going to be business as usual and that there would be no emulation of the chaos of eastern Europe. As a result of this, the Chinese knew they would be criticised by the West. It is interesting that the same countries that criticised not China poured in the capital to China, which was of course the end that China wanted. Unfortunately, I think a lot of those people who put their money into China will find out that China, unlike Australia, will make sure that it retains the great part of the cake. I give them all credit for that. In respect of foreign affairs, the large amount of revenue we give to New Guinea gives us an unchallenged position to influence New Guinea government policy. It is rather depressing, I think, to find the spokesperson for the Howard urban centralist government saying the same as the Beazley urban centralist opposition in urging the New Guinea government not to use or employ foreign mercenaries. The truth of the matter is that the problems in New Guinea are ongoing; they are sapping the very vitality of government. It is quite clear to the government there that those problems must be brought to a head. I would suspect that the use of troops who are probably amongst the best trained in the world, troops who have expertise in this area for a surgical operation, would be far less damaging to the population than employing the New Guinea army, which is basically a bunch of undisciplined thugs. I want to get to industry policy, which has been talked about a lot in this debate, and compare the performance of the Howard urban centralist government with that of the Beazley urban centralist opposition. The reality is that they are almost identical. We have been told about the need for industry. Neither of the parties mentioned have an industry policy which would see the establishment of import replacement industry-and without that there are no jobs in Australia, and it is simply nonsense to contend that there will be. The Hilmer report-instigated by that great advocate of Thatcherite economics, Paul Keating-is dogma that supports rational economics. Rational economics is a fraud being perpetuated on the world. It is a formula for the ascendancy of big business and will see the elimination of small business-and I believe that is exactly what it is intended to do. Hilmer says that small business must compete on a level playing field. If small business competes with big business, small business will lose. When that happens, there will be no control over the activities of big business. Let me give you a little insight into what has happened just recently. A company owned an abattoir at Lismore, and did very well with it. The opportunity to buy a bigger abattoir at Inverell came up, so it sold its Lismore property and went into the Inverell abattoir. The people who bought the Lismore abattoir went broke, and the company had to go back and repossess its property. It found that it could not get an export licence because the previous owners had run up a substantial bill with AQIS; AQIS and other charges amounted to $230,000. The company repossessing said, 'This is not our bill, this has nothing to do with us.' 'But we will not give you a licence,' said the government, 'until you pay your AQIS bill.' I cannot find this in the act or in the regulations. It is no more, in fact, than a ministerial edict. The minister says that his hands are tied because the Meat Exporters Advisory Council says, 'No, Mr Minister, you cannot give these people a licence, you will rock the boat.' The advisory council is made up overwhelmingly of foreign owned abattoirs and of course they do not want an Australian company competing in the foreign export business, in the export market. That is a bit tautological, I suppose; all exports are to foreigners. But here we are in this outrageous position: the cattle industry is in absolute crisis, we have export markets there, but this company cannot sell because of this absolute nonsense. Really, it is time that we as a nation questioned what we are doing. The irony is that AQIS are there at this very moment providing exactly the same services because this company is allowed to trade on the domestic market. Madam Deputy Speaker, can you imagine this happening in any other country in the world: having boards that are dominated by foreigners being able to stop a minister from acting in the interests of the country's companies? That is just one example. There are many others which I will not get a chance to go into in detail. Some time ago I was approached about a scheme for employing unemployed youth in Australia. It was a scheme that was providing an opportunity to take kids who were computer literate out of high schools and put them in contact with small business. I know that across Australia small business often has bought computers but does not know how to use them. If you could get small business to do even its wages and stock control inventory on computers, it would at least give them a chance to compete with the multinationals, with big business; small business does not have that skill. Here was a proposal to take these people into a central organisation and send them out to small business, who would buy the services of these kids on a daily basis. A lot of work had been done on this scheme; in terms of potential, it was the best scheme I had seen. I was tempted, I guess for political reasons, to keep the scheme to myself and promote it for my own benefit. I decided that the plight of unemployed youth was so great that the government should have the benefit of this opportunity and should act immediately. I took it to Minister Kemp's office and explained it to him; he was very enthusiastic. It was then transferred to Minister Vanstone. But this project has gone round and round in circles. Why is that? I suspect the reasons are very simple. Firstly, I do not believe DEETY A gives a damn about unemployment. Certainly, the Chief Minister of the territory does not because she sees it as the responsibility of the Commonwealth government and she will not spend any territory funds on this very good project. I also suspect that in the ranks of DEETY A you have a lot of Labor sycophants who are determined that there will be no reduction in youth unemployment because that would give a boost to the government. I think this is totally unacceptable. I think the inability of the government to further this project is appalling. It must show better leadership and get this project up and running-this project which over the next four or five years has the potential to employ literally thousands of unemployed youth. You have small business being very keen and you have people committed to employing these people-and the government cannot move. This takes me to the subject of what you need to start a new industry. There are three things you need. This does not seem to be understood by either of our urban centralist parties. For instance, suppose you were to start a business supplying equipment to the mining industry. The CSIRO says that we import $1.2 billion a year of mining equipment which we could make better or cheaper in Australia. To the mining industry, 'better' is the same as 'cheaper'. So there is certainly potential there. Just imagine, if the mining industry were getting $1.2 billion worth of equipment in Australia, it would have supporting it the work force involved in that. I say that the biggest threat to the mining industry is sovereign risk. If it had that work force, the Labor Party may be a little more sensitive to the problems raised by sovereign risk. What do you need? You need a large industry. In Australia we have some of the largest mining companies in the world; we have a large industry. You need a state-of-theart industry. Australia has without a doubt the best mining companies in the world. The other thing you need is government will-not massive government handouts, simply government will. And there is no sign of government will either in the previous Keating urban centralist government or the present Howard urban centralist government. The truth is that both those parties are the same; their policies are the same. This was brought home to me recently when I said to a member of the government who holds a very safe seat, 'Lou, what is the main difference between you and the opposition?' and he said, 'Industrial relations.' I said that surprises me because it was the Labor Party that brought in all this bargaining stuff and it was the Labor Party that commissioned Hilmer. I do not really see much difference at all. So I put the same question to a couple of my former Labor colleagues and they immediately said, 'Industrial relations,' which implies that industrial relations is the only difference between the two parties. I had to explain to those members that the reality is that there is no difference. There is difference in the rhetoric, but the reality is that there is no difference. Until we get a government that recognises the need for import replacement industry, we are going to see a continual reduction in manufacturing and a continual reduction in real jobs in Australia. I was in the Labor Party caucus when Paul Keating announced that the future lay in the service sector. 'Service sector' is politiprices. calspeak; it is code for 'tourism'. Tourism low paid jobs, part-time jobs and jobs women and kids; it is not jobs for blue-collar workers. So you have the blue-collar worker unemployed and his wife working part time, and then you wonder why his kids are out control. Do not tell me that the Labor Party does not recognise this. Maybe it does because who is the Labor Party these It certainly does not represent workers any more. I believe there are many things we can do, but they will not happen while we have this adherence to rational economics because, as I said earlier, rational economics is a fraud perpetrated on this world. If I were to say to you that the concept of the level playing field arises in the machinations of multinational business, mainly American, to take over world trade, the suggestion would be that I am some sort of zealot, some sort of anti-American or perhaps a communist. But I did not say it. Santamaria said it. And Santamaria is right. We had an example recently where the chairman of Woolworths said that when Woolworths will increase its turnover per cent and it will get this off small business because, as he said, 'Let us face it, small business has to go to bed some time.' I do think anyone has a need to buy a cabbage two 0' clock in the morning. I do not think that is necessary. We simply have to have some regulation in trading hours, otherwise small business in that very important retail sector will simply disappear. They are already at a big disadvantage. In supermarkets across the country, you find that the large store has its rent a percentage of its turnover and is treated very generously. Small business, on the other hand, is on a square metreage, always with inflation clauses, and the prices go up as their opportunity decreases. And you wonder why there is such a high fatality rate amongst small business. Simply, under the present system they do not have a chance. I can remember when I had business in Kalgoorlie that I called on every business in the town. I used to keep a very close tally on In fact, I used to do a price watch, is which was very effective until the government for of the day introduced a price watch which actually paid people to go and do it and then people lost interest in my voluntary effort. But the results of that price watch were that, of for a given basket of goods, it was always cheaper to shop at the Italian comer store than notit was to go to Coles or Woolworths. The days? differences were significant. Very often you would find the stuff on the shelf in the Italian store was cheaper than the specials in Coles and Woolworths. This does not refer to the national brands like Schweppes or Coca-Cola. At the time. I had the Schweppes agency in Kalgoorlie, Woolworths and Coles would regularly buy the stuff cheaper than I as the agent could get it. But for a lot of other stuff the prices in the small stores were cheaper than in the big stores and the reason was simple-they marked up 15 per cent; Coles, Woolworths and Franklins marked up 35 per cent minimum and they have large overheads. Given a decent go and an even break, small business can compete, but it cannot compete governments go to this penchant for by 12 deregulation a la Hilmer. To treat this historically, the Labor Party has always been comfortable with big businot ness and unions have always been comfortat able with big companies. There was a time when you saw the Liberal Party swept into office, starting from the days of Menzies's speech about the forgotten people. Those forgotten people were middle Australiasmall business people. Today they are truly forgotten because they are not represented by will the Liberal Party and certainly not by the based on Beazley urban centralist coalition. We now have in Australia disenfranchised elements of society. Let us look at them. You have farmers--certainly no longer represented by the National Party, certainly not by the minister. You have small business-represented by no-one. And you have workersdeserted by the Labor Party. I believe that this is a very powerful coalition. If it can get itself organised, it can sweep into power in this country, hopefully, before it is too latebefore the urban centralist coalitions and the urban centralist opposition have sold us all out to foreign interests. I want to talk about a couple of other industries. RFW, a company in Sydney, makes arguably the best large off-road vehicles in the world. It is in the electorate of Laurie Ferguson. The proprietor of that business speaks highly of the help he has had from Mr Ferguson. But he has had no help from this government or the previous government. He has seen his work force go from near on 100 down to six, and it will probably drop further. His vehicles are extremely good vehicles. He is generally competitive. But, when you have a tender process, the large companies can cut their prices. They do not care about the capital costs of the initial purchase. What keeps them in business is the ongoing service. They know that inertia is likely to keep them with repeat business. Any sensible government would be saying to the army, to emergency services and to airport firefighters-for specialised vehicles such as tank recovery vehicles-'This is the vehicle you will buy.' The cost is much cheaper to Australia when you take into account the clawback the government gets from taxation and the multiplier effect of employment. It is much cheaper to buy the Australian vehicle. But the previous government and the existing government have had this absolute penchant for putting everything out for tender. In closing, I want to draw attention to the consequences for people of this attitude. We decided that to make road construction efficient we would put it all out to tender. The Labor Party then realised they had made a mistake. The Labor Party tried to get contracts under $10 million so that they did not have to go out for tender. Unfortunately, they could not get that through the Senate because of the Democrats, who should be known, on performance, as the Hypocrats. The main roads departments in every state were very good at building roads. When we put them out of business, they would always come first or second in the tender process. If they came second, they lost the contract. You cannot keep a day force if you come second. Across most of the states they were employing a lot of Aboriginal people who could see a future. What we did is put those people, after 20 or 30 years in the main roads departments, out on the dole. They had been saying to their kids, 'Go to school. Get some education. You can be the foreman.' Now they say, 'Look, I worked for them for 20 years, and they threw me on the scrap heap. Go on the dole. Do not waste your time.' The social consequences of that were enormous. Did anybody ever stop to calculate that? Certainly the previous government did not, and I am sure this government has never given it a thought. (Time expired)",64

103,Mr MCMULLAN,FERENCE IN SAIPAN AND BILATERAL,"Speaker. The republican attitudes of the Speaker got me carried away. The appropriation bills provide us all with a vehicle for a wide-ranging debate. I have the pleasant opportunity to follow my friend the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), who certainly took advantage of that wide-ranging debate and made his usual very interesting contribution. I want to also take the opportunity to talk about issues to do with the economy and government expenditure. I want, in a sense, to refer to this bill by addressing issues which are not included in this bill but should beareas where government neglect or shortcomings of government policy are having an unfair impact on working Australians and where government broken promises are adversely affecting working men and women in Australia. Initially, I do not want to go to the grand sweeping visions that were discussed by the member for Kalgoorlie but to more local and immediate concerns. On a recent visit to Ballarat, in discussions with unionists and workers in that city, an issue was raised with me of which I was not until that time aware-although it flows from events in this parliament of which I was, of course, aware and participated in. The workers there and their representatives expressed concern about what appears to be a failure of the Howard government to provide adequate resources as a consequence of the handover of industrial relations responsibility from the Victorian government to the federal government. As members would be aware, the opposition cooperated with the government to facilitate the passage of legislation to enable this handover to take place on 1 January 1997. It was claimed to be one of the great revolutionary industrial relations reforms. At the time was very clear that it was a minor transition, possibly a temporary one, but nevertheless marginally welcome. Its benefits have been wildly exaggerated. I think it was significant only in terms of some short-term political advantage for the government in general and for Mr Reith in particular. I want to turn my attention to some serious administrative problems that seem to be arising from the manner of implementation of this change. I want to outline that in some detail. What it exemplifies is the approach of this government and this minister, in reading the market research, saying, 'What sort of reaction should we make to these circumstances?' Andrew Robb comes over and says, 'This is what you should say.' They invent another new policy. Then they think about its implications afterwards. Often it does lead them to get the basic politics, the basic vote winning of it on the day, quite right. But it means they do not pay enough attention to the governance issues associated with it. The obligation of government is not just to call press conferences and announce modest changes amidst overblown rhetoric; it is actually to administer and govern the country, and govern it well, and to provide the resources that functions which the government takes on require. In this instance, the Kennett government discharged its obligations for industrial relations and handed them over to the Commonwealth. It appears, and probably not unreasonably, that the Kennett government has said, 'We no longer have this industrial relations obligation. We are going to withdraw our industrial relations advisory staff' - what was called Wage line-at least from regional Victoria, probably altogether as far as the evidence I can establish indicates. There is no indication and nothing in these bills that says the Commonwealth is going to step in and fill that gap. The workers and the employers who depended in the past upon that advice appear likely to be denied access to that necessary information. I want to take the opportunity in my remarks after the dinner suspension to talk about some of the direct and immediate it implications of that for workers throughout Victoria. I have examples of particularly Western Victoria and Ballarat. I also want to talk about its implication for small business, who often rely on that sort of advice to ensure that they are meeting their proper obligations, and its implication for the whole question of the slashing of services to regional and rural Australia. Those are matters that I wish to return to in the time available to me after the dinner suspension. They are important issues, and there is absolutely no sign of this government giving them the attention they deserve.",68
104,Unknown,FERENCE IN SAIPAN AND BILATERAL,Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m.,69
105,Mr MCMULLAN,FERENCE IN SAIPAN AND BILATERAL,"Before the dinner suspension I was outlining a cause of serious concern to me: these bills fail in any way to remedy a concern expressed to me by workers and unions in western Victoria about the withdrawal of advisory services by the Victorian state government, understandably. I am not critical of the Victorian government because they have handed over the responsibility for their industrial relations to the Commonwealth. As a consequence, the Victorian government appear, on the evidence I have, to have given notice to their employees of Wage Line, the advisory service for workers and employers about their rights and obligations under awards, to conclude on 30 March of this year. But there is no sign of any action by this government, having taken the responsibility for this area of policy, to provide the resources to give advice to employers and to workers that they might need to be able to either, in the case of employers, discharge their obligation as they would wish to do to conform to the law or, in the case of workers, be assured that they are receiving their full entitlement. I have said nothing until this debate because I did hope that the supplementary estimates would show an appropriation that would provide extra money to meet this demand. At the moment, if I can give the example of Ballarat, there are currently three state employees with Wage Line available for workers in that part of Victoria to advise them of their rights and entitlements and also to advise employers how to discharge their responsibilities properly under the industrial laws which govern them. My understanding is that there are about seven such employees in the broader western Victorian region and at this stage the Commonwealth has no on the ground services in this whole region. There are two industrial inspectors in Geelong who have responsibility for this area. Everybody tells me those two officers are held in very high regard. They are very diligent, hard working officers but all the evidence is that they are already very busy. They are fully occupied responding particularly to the telephone concerns about existing federal matters in that broader region for which they are responsible. It is the responsibility of government-this government, any government-not just to pass laws, not just to sign agreements but to provide the resuurces to administer those agreements aud to make available to people affected by those agreements, particularly those in greatest need, ink:'; nation about their rights, their obligations and how they migL. most effectively discharge them or how they might most effectively enSUle they receive them. The failure of the Commonwealth govcmment to provide these resources means all workers in Victoria ironically, particularly those who are not members of unions for whom the government purports to be particularly concerned, will be placed at risk of 11' ,t gations HUY we:' I. achieving the conditions which are their righ; , because of a lack of information about their rights. It is also places responsible employers in Victoria, particularly small businesswhich do not have human resource departments, industrial officers and industrial relations departments-in the invidious position of potentially breaching the law in the wages and conditions they apply to their employees inadvertently due to the failure of the government to provide adequate advice and information. Once again, the information given to me while I was in the region was that it is not as if all government members are unconcerned about this. I am told that in a radio debate the member for MaBee (Mr Forrest) expressed his concern about this development also. If that is true-I have not seen a transcript of it but I am advised it is so-I congratulate him for that. I am pleased he has spoken up. I hope he raises it in the party room. I hope he is able to get some response from the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith), the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) or whoever is responsible for the failure of the government to provide these services throughout Victoria. There is a serious matter of principle involved in this issue that I am raising-that is, as well as governments having a proper obligation to ensure that they spend taxpayers' money wisely, frugally and appropriately, there is a converse obligation to ensure that resources are provided adequate to the tasks we take on. The Commonwealth has said, 'We will take responsibility for determining the industrial conditions of workers in Victoria.' That was a proper decision, a decision which we supported and facilitated. It ,arrieu with it a moral obligation to provide the r,-source, ,n ;Jable that function to be properly disch,1[ged. This bill says: 'wt till'), have done n,)thing. It may be that sumething will con:.: forward in the budget. I would be plea-.d, hut i i th.,t is the case it still creates the possibility of a dangerous hiatll, in which this information, this suppor\, ,; is ent dement of people to inforn:ation ahout their rights and their oblibe adequately discharged. :)() het '-: is .1 sen 1"":: - ltter (i I principle, and it is a matter which has the potential to have serious adverse consequences for working Victorians and for small business in Victoria. It is also an example of the withdrawal of services from regional Australia by this government. It was disturbing enough when the government broke their promise to maintain funding for regional development in Australia. We only found out after the election that was not a core promise. When we heard it-silly us !-we thought they meant it. Sadly for us the people of regional Australia thought they meant it because overwhelmingly they voted for the coalition. What did they get in return? They got all the proposals that relate to them repudiated. To heighten the concern, we had this abrogation of a promise raised to a point of high principle, or perhaps high farce, with the assertion, based on the report of the National Commission of Audit, that there is no Commonwealth responsibility for regional development in Australia. It was not the view this government purported to have before the election. It was not the view of the previous government; it is not the view of the opposition. This policy that there is no role for the Commonwealth in regional development is clearly a breach of political trust, but it ahrogation of political responsibility, social responsibility and economic responsibility. I do not know why those concerns do not motivate National Party members of this WlVernment in particular to raise their voices \, hdlalf of rc g I 11,.1 Australia, but c1earh they do not.

Ian., aovep,c consequences on the newer and the smaller universities. Where are they? In regional Australia. In the Ballarats, Bendigos, Townsvil1cs and Geelongs. Fine universities, oevelopin-- with great potential. Very important to the future of those CItIes, to young people growing up in those cities and to the parents of those young people. And they are put in jeopardy. Changes to public education are going to put the greatest pressure on the smallest schools. Where are they found? Predominantly in rural and regional areas. If I can make a forecast, changes to the policy that are likely to emerge from the Wallis inquiry, changes to the policy about banks and banking and the possibility of mergers and takeovers amongst the big six in Australia's financial markets, will put greater pressure on the provision of banking services in rural and regional Australia and banking jobs in rural and regional Australia. The first estimates I have seen suggest that if the mergers that are mooted are allowed to go ahead we are talking about the loss of 20,000 to 30,000 jobs in Australia, a substantial number in rural and regional Australia. This comes on top of the combined effects of Public Service cuts at the federal, state and local level, which have meant dramatic job losses throughout regional Australia. That has been particularly evident in regional Victoria, where the cuts of the Kennett government have been compounded by further cuts currently being made by the Howard government is an and by those that we see looming on the horizon in this year's budget. It used to be the case that when families, particularly working-cl as families, sought secure employment for llu:ir children they thought they would put them into the Public Service or into the bank. Thil 1U,·11OUt Australian history there were working class parents who breathed a sigh of r('lief that they had established a secure future ""or their children They had got them a job in th'lan]., T""::' had got them a job in the Public Serv J, ,;. TL current state of the Australian economy and the policies of this government mean that. even in those previously relatively secure to areas, there i, no such thing as job securit\ Job security is a thing uf the past in Australia. All we are getting put in its place are public relations stunts like an announcement, when you are in a bit of p0litical trouble, on 'he Sunday program 'hat you are going to have a work for the dole scheme-without any of the details thought out or without any of the resources being provided to ensure that it is an adequate scheme providing adequate job opportunities for Australians who this government is failing by breaking another election promise and abolishing labour market programs and putting nothing in their place. We have a lot of talk by this government about mutual obligation, about the obligation of people to provide some service in response to the support provided by taxpayers. When the term 'mutual obligation' first came into the discussion about this issue of the rights and responsibilities of people out of work, the mutual obligation was this: government had an obligation on behalf of society to provide real jobs or real training to every Australian, and in return for that those people who were otherwise unemployed had an obligation to accept those opportunities. That is mutual obligation. But to say 'We will at random find some of the unemployed and impose an obligation on them which is imposed on noone else' is simply political opportunism and unfairness. We create the absurd situation that of young people living in the same house receiving the same amount of money, because they are all on the dole, one might have to work 30 hours a week to discharge the dole obligation because of the job they get, another might have to work only 20 hours and another might get the same amount of money for doing no work at all. How does that conform to the Australian tradition of fairness? For all those reasons, these appropriation bills need to be condemned. They have failed to address the issue of unemployment, they have failed to address the issue of the rights and responsibilities of workers and employers in Victoria, and they have failed to provide the extra resources required for this nationally vitally important task.",69
106,Mr WILTON,FERENCE IN SAIPAN AND BILATERAL,"I rise to speak on these appropriation bills to again highlight to the House the ongoing concerns 'hose of us on this side have about the lack of any cogent debate on industry policy emanati ng from the other side. Those on the other side claimed, come 2 March last year, that they had a fire burning furiously in their bellies on industry policy matters. I have no doubt now that that fire has since died down to embers and those embers are fast turning to ashes. When it comes to industry policy, those in the coalition are really offering the parliament nothing in vision or ideas for the future of the industries of our great nation. They have sought to do little more than to slash and bum many of the far-sighted initiatives that Labor had sought to put in place on what is a very important matter. It is no wonder that last year Jeff Kennett was so derisory of this coalition government on industry policy matters. He said words to the effect that 'it does not have an industry policy' and that 'it was not fostering debate on what a decent industry policy outcome might be'. The Premier of Victoria-my state-had also put pressure on the government at that time to reverse its decision on R&D syndication. It did not. Jeff Kennett and industry generally do not want any further cuts to the range of industry based initiatives that were implemented by the three former Labor government. Industry wants a government that can demonstrate that it has an articulate vision for the long haul for the nation; a government that has the desire to push strongly for the enunciation of a clear industry policy with a statement of cogent objectives; a government that is committed to initiatives which will foster the growth of Australian industry, in particular the growth of Australian jobs and the growth of Australia's export markets; and a government which will correct the current account and budget deficit situations. These are all reasons why those of us on this side of the House have over the past 12 months opposed the cuts to the former government's industry based assistance initiatives. None of these cuts sought to ameliorate the tragic situation of growth falling to levels below that which is required to lower unemployment levels. The allocation of budget money for things such as R&D, which I have just mentioned, and bounties cannot be regarded as budget imposts, which I fear is the case with those on the other side. This money should be seen as an investment in higher growth and improved net export performance, resulting in development of our region and constituting an investment in job growth and therefore an investment in the future of our nation. It is not only Jeff Kennett who is calling for the development of what might vaguely resemble an industry policy. A range of mates of those on the other side have similarly called in the media over the past six or nine months for a more firm, cogent debate on what might constitute an industry policy. Among those groups I list the Australian Electrical and Electronic Manufacturing Association, the Australian Information Industries Association, the Heavy Engineering Manufacturers Association and the Metal Trades Industry Association. Community and business leaders such as Bert Evans and Frank Conroy from Howard Smith Industries and Bob Clifford from the fast catamaran manufacturer Incat in Tasmania have similarly been lamenting the government's complete lack of anything resembling industry policy. They have been scathing in their criticism of the government in this regard. Even the government's firm defenders, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, can do no more than suggest that the jury is out when it comes to matters of industry policy and whether the government has one. Well, the jury is not out because there is no industry policy. I am sure that the ACCI will at some stage have to acknowledge publicly that the government does not have an industry policy. The policies of the two major parties could not be further apart. These policies are like chalk and cheese. Labor acknowledges and fosters the role of government intervention in industry policy. In doing so, we acknowledge that the playing field, both domestically and internationally, is not level. Our policy is clearly about locking in jobs in existing industries and developing the potential for fostering employment growth in industriesthose which will become internationally competitive and those which also will advance to continue to adopt tighter regimes of world best practice. It is also, as I said before, about capitalising on all that our great nation has to offer. In proposing a more interventionist approach, Labor also recognises the limits of the market in fostering effective industry development in an unfettered way. As the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) has recently quite rightly said, our policy does not involve a dead hand of government approach. It is not about propping up industries that might well be deemed to be inefficient. It is, above all, about nurturing industry which, as I say, has the potential to become internationally competitive and to adopt world best practice. In saying that, it is also not about picking winners, another accusation that has been levelled at our policy in the past. It is simply about government support and backing for those industries and firms which are committed to the challenge which confronts them, those which are efficient but which for various reasons have difficulty competing or getting into overseas markets. Simultaneously, in proposing this activist, interventionist approach in regard to industry policy, we refute the policy of those agrarian socialists in the National Party opposite who in many comers of this parliament still proffer the protectionist outcome for Australian exports. When you consider that the Liberal Party has a predominantly free market approach, as opposed to the fundamentally protectionist based approach of the National Party, one wonders what sort of debates take place on this subject within the party room. I feel there is no vision coming from the government on the matter of industry policy because of the two competing ideologies of its component ingredients-the Liberal Party and the National Party. Labor is full of encouragement for the opening of international markets. We are going to do all that we can to ensure that the investment that the former Labor government made in such things as the Cairns Group, GAIT and APEC is not j-st frittered away and lost by the failure of this government to attend to the very benefits that those same organisations can provide. In reaffirming that the opposition is not just about picking winners, Labor's policy dictates an industry driven approach with government intervention rather than simply a top down and government driven approach to industry policy. This may well mean that the form of intervention we propose may well mean that different industries are treated differently or, indeed, different regions are treated differentmay ly. But, certainly, they will have applied to them an industry policy which gives them the opportunity to profit and potentially expand into international markets. What are some of these forms of assistance which might be offered under this interventionist umbrella? The first is one that I have just alluded to-the contrasting way in which the opposition and government apif proach GATT. Not only during its 13 years office did the then Labor government apelectorate. proach GATT with open arms, open hearts understand and open minds, saying, 'We want access for our agricultural products to your markets', when they turned around and said to us, 'We want access to your markets for our manufacronment tured goods', we clearly had a policy which enunciated the opportunity for those and other countries to compete in our own markets. During those many years that ministers trade emanated from the ranks of the National Party and they went overseas to discuss trade matters with our trading partners and simultaEPA neously asked for access to foreign marketsSharps naturally, in tum, those markets asked for access to our markets-the National Party dumbfounded because it never had a policy which afforded foreign countries and players the opportunity to access our markets. For first time, Labor has said that we are sure you can do that and has fostered competition of overseas nations within our own In the limited time available to me, I might just list some of the other forms of assistance journed. that a hands-on interventionist approach by government might facilitate. They include government leverage to foster the development of major projects, more efficiently using the leverage of government purchasing, the encouragement of innovation across industry sectors through support for school formation, research and development and, indeed, communication. They also include such things as better access to capital through instruments such as pooled development funds. For the first time. I am beginning to tum my mind to the impact of immigration on employment. I think that this parliament has to seriously address the fact that multiculturalism not be conveying upon the Australian community the benefits that people like myself might have been led to believe it did in recent years. I think there is certainly cause to re-evaluate levels of immigration at times of high unemployment such as those that we broad are experiencing currently. I welcome all those industries that I have just cited within the electorate of Isaacs. B-t I could just digress for a moment, there IS in one industry that is not welcome within my That is a sanitary landfill, which I as recently as today has raised the anger and the ire of the residents of Dandebut nong within my electorate. That landfill will allow, under the approval of the state EnviProtection Authority in Victoria, the dumping of Sydney's infectious waste in the Asian middle of the Isaacs electorate. Locals are concerned that the Victorian EPA has allowed Sydney hospitals to dispose for of medical waste, including anatomical and pharmaceutical waste, human tissue and body parts, in this part of the world. I fear that the has allowed the company, Integrated Disposal Systems, to continue processing waste from Sydney after the two-month was permit which, as successfully applied for, expires on 28 February. I will be approaching both the EPA and the company concerned the with a view to attempting to have that decithat sion overturned and that dump, which is unwanted within my electorate, relocated to markets. a more suitable environment.

107,Mr BRADFORD,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I am sure the Chief Government Whip could have spoken at length on that if he had needed to, but I have relieved him of that responsibility. I was speaking just prior to the adjournment debate last nightMs Macklin-We might have had a different point of view.",75
108,Mr BRADFORD,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"You have missed out on the opportunity to find out. Just before the adjournment debate last night, I was dealing with some of the remarks that the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) had made",75
109,Mr CADMAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,You were dealing with them very well indeed.,75
110,Mr BRADFORD,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I was, thank you, sir. I suggested that the first amendment he moved gave us some inkling of where the opposition might be heading in health policy. Earlier in the evening last night we had been entertained by the Four Corners program which gave us the impression that for the Labor Party it was back to basics and that they were starting with a clean slate, which I think, on reflection, was a pretty good idea. Last night we had an inkling that there was some direction to their health policy rather than them just criticising what this government is attempting to do. The facts are that when we came into office we inherited a huge mess from the former government in the health area-and not only in the health area. The previous Labor government had 13 years in government. In the last couple of years, the then Minister for Human Services and Health, the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), attempted to fiddle around with the edges of the system and impose some sort of bureaucratic solutions on the problem. But they still, as is shown in this amendment, seem to have an obsession with the solution of putting more money into the public system. That clearly was not going to fix the problem. What this government has done on a number of fronts is to attempt to address some of the fundamental causes of the problems in the health system. Some of the decisions which this government has taken have not been easy decisions to take. The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), to his great credit, has grappled with the situation where a number of doctors that were coming through were able to enter the system and tap into the Medicare system. That had to be addressed. But the former government failed to address it. There was also a need for doctors to be situated in rural and regional areas; the former government managed to wipe its hands of that problem.",75
111,Mr CADMAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,They probably hate farmers.,75
112,Mr BRADFORD,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"They obviously did not have a great understanding of what was needed in rural areas. The only criticism of what we propose that came out last night in the member for Dobell's speech was that more money should be put into the public system. But that would not have solved the problem. The problem basically was and is that we have a private system and a public system running in parallel. The former government tried as hard as it could the private system. It did not do that overtly and it did not actually say that it was setting out to do that, but everything it did actually had that effect. At the end of the day, Labor actively sought to destroy private health insurance. The big bang premium increases, as they were called, that were implemented from 1986-88 were, in large part, the direct result of Labor's removing two important supports from private cover-the Commonwealth's bed day subsidy for private hospital beds and the Commonwealth's contribution to the private health reinsurance pool, which helped funds average their risks. That ran counter not only to the assumptions they made when they established Medicare but also to the statements they made, the rhetoric we heard, about Medicare--that is, that government assistance to private health insurance would continue so that the private sector would continue to complement the Medicare structure. But that did not happen. What we saw from the Labor government was only one attempt after another to, essentially, strangle the private system. Perhaps that should not be surprising, because, after all, the Labor Party does not have a great affection for, or belief in, or understanding of the private sector. In fact, most of its solutions to problems when it was in government-and they started to come out in some of the comments the member for Dobell made last night-were government imposed bureaucratic solutions. The Labor Party seemed to believe that the public sector or government had the solution and that government imposed bureaucratic solutions to the problems were the way to go. We on this side of the House have a totally different philosophy . We believe that the solution to the problem is to support the private sector and to encourage people to move into or stay in private health insurance. This legislation will enable that to proceed. What we are doing is applying what is a very basic principle. The most basic principle we can apply in this area is that those who can afford to pay should do so and those who to kill off cannot should be assisted. The present system allows and in some respects even encourages those who can afford to pay to avoid doing so. The effect of that in the system we inherited has quite clearly been that those who are disadvantaged are disadvantaged further. To translate that into where the tyre meets the road type of language, it simply means there were queues for hospital beds for a lot of different types of surgical procedures and the people on the end of those long queues were being held up by people who could afford to pay for private health insurance, which would enable them not to be in that queue. There is something very ironic about that: the system that the former government imposed on us had the simple effect of further disadvantaging the most disadvantaged people in our society. That, I think, was clear. So our starting point when we came into government was fixing up that mess. I will be frank about this: I believe this solution will work, but only time will tell. Some of us on this side-the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) may allude to this; he is obviously an expert in this area-cannot say for certain that this is the solution to the problems, but we believe it is and we believe that getting people into private health insurance and helping them stay in it will be an important ingredient of the solution to the problems that have existed in the public system. Many of us can remember-you do not have to be too old; the chief whip would remember and I just remember",76
113,Mr CADMAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,The minister at the table.,76
114,Mr BRADFORD,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"And the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser), who is at the table, might remember this-just how good health care was in this country before the Labor Party stepped into 'fix' it even though it was not broken at the time. But that has never worried Labor governments. In fact, it seems to me that if something was not broken that was a very good reason for them to try to fix it. But the point is that, now that it is broken, they want to criticise our attempts to fix it. Last night we did not hear from the member for Dobell any real constructive criticism of our plans to fix it. We did not hear any debate about why encouraging people to take out health insurance is not going to work. All we heard was this bleating about the need to put more money into the public sector. That is what they did. That did not work. We have come in with a new plan. I have admitted that only time will tell whether or not it will but we believe it will. Let us not just hear blatant criticism about what we propose but some constructive reasons why-the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) can usually make a reasonable contribution in this place; when she follows me in this debate let me hear from her some of these reasons-what we propose will not work. We did not hear that from the member for Dobell last night. If people want evidence of the fact that the system is broken now, they only have to go to their local public hospital, as I do on the Gold Coast. There are twoto three-year waiting lists for some types of surgery. They are quaintly called non-life threatening or non-essential surgery. I think I alluded to the fact last night that, if people need a hip replacement or a knee reconstruction and they are immobilised by virtue of that necessity and they are in pain, that may not be life threatening for them but it certainly is dramatically affecting the quality of their life. As I say, the solution seems to us to be relati vely simple but the Labor Party, because it has total philosophical blinkers on when it comes to anything that might support or encourage the private sector, do not seem to be able to come to grips with the fact that people getting out of the queues in the public system and into the private system, if they can ,tliOrd it-let me underline that: if they can afford it-has to be, even to a fairly simple-minded person, a reasonable solution to the problem. There are two prongs to this legislation. It provides both a carrot and a stick. The carrot is the relatively generous incentives for people to take out or to remain in private health insurance. I think we have determined a direction. I think we can go further; I hope we can. In the end, there is a very good case for making private health insurance premiums tax deductible or for rebating them in full. We obviously could not afford to do that. When we came to office we were faced with the famous $8 billion Beazley black hole, so there were some severe constraints. Nevertheless, we have direction. Despite the increases in health insurance premiums-the timing of work, which, we have admitted, was unfortunate, but we remind the Labor Party when they criticise us that they approved every single request for increases in insurance premiums while they were in office; they averaged 12 per cent per year over that time-people will be better off by virtue of our plans. The stick in this legislation is the simple and I think totally acceptable and reasonable proposition that those who can afford to take out private health insurance should be encouraged-I hesitate to use the word 'forced' because I think, philosophically, people need to have choice-to do so. We are giving them some encouragement to take out private health insurance by virtue of this legislation. Ms Macklin-It is called an extra taxencouragement.",76
115,Mr BRADFORD,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The irony of this-let me remind the member for Jagajaga of this because she might like to reflect on it when she speaks-is that the former Prime Minister made a virtue of the fact that he did not have private health insurance. He was earning a very substantial salary but he made a point of telling us on more than one occasion that he did not need private health insurance. If he had needed hospital treatment he would have been at St Vincents Hospital, a private hospital",77
116,Dr NELSON,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,He was.,77
117,Mr BRADFORD,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Yes, he was-or some equivalent. He would not have been waiting for admission outside the doors of the RPA. He could afford private health insurance but in the end he was an example, an archetype if you like, of a person who should have had it. So I was disappointed by the contribution that the shadow minister, the member for Dobell, made last night because it really did not, other than in a rather obtuse way, shed any light at all on the way the Labor Party might be heading. All we heard was criticism based on the premise that we should be putting more money into the public system. They did that for 13 years-I suppose it was not enough money in the end-but that did not solve the problem. We have approached the problem in a practical and sensible way, and I believe this legislation is an important ingredient in the solution to the problems in the health system that this country finds itself with.",77
118,Ms MACKLIN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I am very pleased to rise tonight to support my colleague the member for Dobell (Mr Lee), particularly with regard to the tenor of the amendments that he moved last night. What seems to escape the member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) is that the public actually strongly supports Medicare. I was under the impression that the Liberal Party did, too, now, having opposed Medicare for the last 20 years and during the Fraser years trying-and successfully too-to destroy Medibank. I was under the impression that your Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) had come to the realisation that the public was strongly committed to Medicare and wanted to see a viable""trong public h'rital system. Obviou\ly this has not filtered d, wn to the member for MCPhers011. This legislation is an attempt to encourage people to retain or obtain-and it is important to talk about both-private health insurance by providing them with means tc,ted subsidies, the size of which varies according to hath income and family status. As the member for Dohell said last night, we will not he blocking the legislation because we do not want to stop contributors recei ving these payments, which were announced bcfm,' the election. I have to say, however. :hat AII<:!ralpremium ians have been sold a pUT' \\;tl rhi, "",""icy. They believed that they were going to get some support for their private health insurance as a result of this subsidy. But, of course, we already know that is not the case. I also want to take the opportunity to point out that the legislation is flawed in concept and will not achieve its objective of halting the drift away from private health insurance. This change did begin with the advent of Medicare in 1984. Since then, more and more people have voted with their feet in favour of Medicare. The government likes to put it in a negative way. I am very proud to say that we are very pleased that people put it in a positive way-that they support Medicare, that they understand what lies behind Medicare and that they want public hospitals strengthened. What the government still does not seem to understand, even though on the surface of it the government has said that it supports Medicare, is that Medicare is supposed to offer universal health insurance, so people are supposed to feel comfortable with universal health insurance. They are not supposed to feel guilty that they rely on the public system. That is what Medicare offers them and that is what the government offered them before the election, that it would strongly support Medicare. A more likely effect of this legislation of course is going to be the underpinning of rises in the premiums for private health insurance, and we have already seen significant evidence of this fact. Some funds have already raised their prices in anticipation of the introduction of subsidies. So individual consumers are not going to be any better off and the taxpayer will have to pay the extra costs. These latest price rises are :Jart of an established pattern which has . ,'Ii private health insurance premiums rise al 3V2 timethe CPT rate of inflation since i llqO. The effect of rising premiums has in turn h(""-?l to cause-not surprisingly-lower risk members to drop out of health funds at a greater rate than higher - lsk members. resulting in higher eosts forlrance companies and further !-S. The Industry Commission pointed out just before Christmas that evel i without increasing premiums the savings to Medicare will fall considerably short of the costs of the rebate-yet more evidence of the problems conceptually with this policy. These measures do absolutely nothing to address one of the major causes of the decline in private health insurance, which of course is the high out-of-pocket costs for medical treatment provided in hospitals to privately insured individuals. Existing private health arrangements and entitlements are very complex and variable, and that leaves consumers unsure about the benefits of their insurance. None of these concerns is addressed by this legislation, nor does this legislation do anything to reduce the cost of health care in the private hospital sector which in tum is driving up the costs of private health insurance. It is also likely that any impact of the subsidy will be to assist people who are already privately insured rather than to encourage into private insurance those who now rely on Medicare, this of course being the government's objective. You have to think about it for only a minute, which is about the length of time Australian families will give this policy. A family is not going to pay $2,000 per annum to get a small subsidy of $450 per annum. They would rather know that if they needed to get into a public hospital they could do so. You only have to listen to the member for MCPherson to realise that what he wants to do, and I fear what the rest of the government wants to do, is go back to the time before Medicare. This government, like all Liberal governments through time past, wants private health to reign. Various estimates have been given 'I the likely increase in private health coverage as a result of the subsidies provided in this legislation. They range from two per cent, the department's estimate-a two per cent increase for $1.7 billion of taxpayers' money to five per cent, the Industry Commission's estimate. That is hardly a major achievement, particularly in view of the suhstantial cost$1.7 billion. This is a huge sum and it is far greater than the amount the government estimates will be obtained through the Medicare surcharge, which I will talk about in a minute. It contrasts with the government's slash and bum approach to health and community services generally which was introduced in the last budget. There is no doubt that this money could have been much more effectively used and directly used to help people who need operations in public hospitals if it had been directed straight to public hospitals. What we know, now that we have seen the full detail of the budget, is that the $1.7 billion comes from this government's slashing of public hospital funding by $800 million, destroying the Commonwealth dental program and increasing the costs of essential medicines, and all this is going to go to a few people basically to protect them against further increases in private health insurance. I doubt that it will have any effect in encouraging people back into private health insurance. Dr Nelson interjecting",78
119,Ms MACKLIN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The member for Bradfield seems to think that this is surprising. Go and have a talk to some of your families, because they are certainly saying to me, 'We are not going to fork out $1,500 net to get private health insurance; we don't have it.' They are the facts of the matter and that is why it won't work. Mr Martin-Not families in his electorate.",79
120,Ms MACKLIN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Maybe not in his electorate, but certainly in mine. It also fails to appreciate either the complexity of the i, ,u,', or the extent to which changes in ll:le :'':1')1. the public sector, impact on the other, th, private sector. It is a very simplistic solution to a very complex prohkm and, in my view, doomed to fail. We are also talking about the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill, which is going to see a one per cent Medicare levy surcharge on individuals with taxable illl;omes above $50,000 per year and families WIth a combined income greater than $100,000 per year who do not have private health insurance. In the case of families, it appears that each individual member will be required to have private health insurance before the family call qualify for exemption. This measure will cost affected individuals an additional $500 per year and affected families an additional $1,000 per year. First of all, it goes against one of the government's core promises, which is that there would be 'no new taxes'. This is a new tax if ever I have seen one. The government failed to mention this proposal before the election. I do not suppose you could go into an election saying 'no new taxes, but we will have an increase in the Medicare levy for some'. The important issue is this: this legislation will drive high income earners away from Medicare, thus undermining the universality of Medicare and weakening support for it among an important group who will no longer have a vested interest in seeing a strong public system. What we see from this government is a very short-sighted view of what social justice means. They think-and on first blush, it might seem to be reasonable-that to charge those who are wealthier more makes a lot of sense. But when you are talking about access to health care or access to nursing home care, what is important is that, no matter what your individual circumstancesno matter how wealthy or poor you arewhen you get to the front door of the hospital you are going to be treated as equally as the next person. What you arc going to see with this legislation is the first of many steps from this government that will undermine Medicare. This is the first step that undermines the universality of Medicare. Once the principle is openly accepted that Medicare is only intended to serve a section of the community, not all Australians, then it will be easy to define that group more and more narrowly so that in the end Medicare becomes a residual program for those who cannot afford private health cover. Inevitably, the public system will provide second-rate care while those who can afford it receive the best treatment available in private hospitals. It is but a further extension of the move already under way in aged care and elsewhere where care is increasingly to be provided not on the basis of need but on the basis of a person's ability to pay. Many people will remember what it was like to line up at outpatient clinics before Medicare, before Medibank. What you had to do was prove that you were poor enough to get public hospital care. We do not support any move back to that system. We do not think that you should have to prove that you are poor just to get the charity of the taxpayer. That is not what Medicare is about. Medicare, as I said-and I will reiterate-is about making sure that when it comes to health care we are treated as equals. We do not want to move back to a system that sees a second-rate, demeaning system for those on low incomes and good quality care for those who can afford private health insurance-and get the taxpayer subsidy. This government is introducing this legislation in an attempt to control public health costs by driving more people into the private sector. That is the government's argument; it is certainly not mine. It is a policy doomed to failure because it does nothing to address the major contributor to increasing health costs, both in the public and the private sectors. Costs are largely, as the member for Bradfield I am sure understands, supply driven, for example by the supply of new treatments rather than demand driven by patients. The proposal to introduce an additional Medicare levy is in my view ideologically driven. It is a further attack on the public health system that is being undermined by previous initiatives of the federal government and its state government allies, especially in relation to public hospitals. We have seen massive cuts to public hospitals in Victoria and a consequent undermining of the community's faith in our public hospitals. In my own electorate of Jagajaga, where we have an outstanding public hospital, the Austin Repatriation Medical Centre, people are waiting for 15 hours on trolleys to get into beds and infection control is threatened-not because the public hospital system is no good or because the staff are no good-they are all excellent-but because of huge budget cuts that have been implemented by Liberal governments at a federal and state level. This government would see our private health system strengthened at the expense of the public system. It attacks our public system because of its cost. It is a fallacy to assume that private health care is cheaper than public health care. I hope that those opposite one day actually look at this issue. It is a fallacy. Let us have a look at a couple of figures. In 1995 health services expenditure in Australia, with a predominantly public system, was 8.4 per cent of GDP. In Britain, with an even larger public sector, it was 6.9 per cent. In the United States of America, with a predominantly private system, it was 14V2 per cent. If anything is going to send that country broke, it will be its private health system. Millions of its citizens have no health insurance and health care costs are the single greatest cause of bankruptcy. It is no wonder that Hillary Clinton said on her recent visit to Australia that America has a lot to learn from Australia's public health system. What she did not know was that this government intends to destroy it. Before Medicare was introduced in 1984, we had almost two million Australians with no health cover at all and many others who were underinsured. It is incumbent upon all of us--everyone in this House-to make sure that there is no move in this parliament that encourages a recurrence of that disgraceful situation. Were that to happen, Australian people would not forgive us. They would certainly not forgive a government that went to them saying that they supported Medicare but, on the anniversary of their first year in office, began the destruction of Medicare. The government should know that Medicare is one of the most valued Commonwealth programs. It is not without its problems-I am very well aware of that-but this legislation will not address them. It will signify the first attack on a system that has served us well for 12 years; a system that all Australians are justifiably proud of. That is why you went to the election supporting Medicare. I want to finish by quoting from a letter that I received this week from a Victorian resident on this subject. She wrote the letter on the bus on the way home from work because she was so incensed about what the government is doing. She said: I put it to you that the Australian people are showing-for example in their persistent refusal to be prodded and bribed with private health, being committed to Medicare and public hospitals-that they do recognise some things we should all join together to pay for-and benefit from. And that, of course, more than anything, is Medicare. Medicare is something that we need to fight to maintain. We need to fight to ensure that the public hospital system is strong enough to cope with the demands upon it. Spending $1.7 billion on private health subsidies and ensuring that wealthy people have an incentive to leave the public system will only see this government putting the first nail in the coffin of Medicare.",79
121,Dr NELSON,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Bradfield) (9.03 p.m.)After listening to the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) and previous speakers on the other side, I am reminded of why I am here, of why, in particular, I am on this side of the House, not the other, and of why I will never be on that side. The history of health care policy in Australia, when written, will recaIl that the 1996 federal election and these bills will be very much a turning point. In the same way that the coalition parties have come to a sustained commitment to Medicare, so too during last year's election with the ALP finally offering belated financial support for private health insurance did what I describe as the Berlin wall finally come down. It is worth reminding the member for Jagajaga what the Labor Party's pre-election commitments were. They were to offer some financial assistance to people for private health insurance. My personal journey to now being a member of a government that both politically and financially supports affordable access to private health care has been signposted with some memorable experiences. For 25 years, the ideologues of the Labor Party have consistently sought to undermine private health care either deliberately or through wilful neglect. In doing so, however, they have ignored both the wishes and the needs of their own traditional constituency: decent hard working blue-collar men and women and their families who recognise, whether rightly or wrongly, that the Australian health care system has evolved from a strong health insurance ethic and egalitarian principles. In recent years, against all that is sane, Australia and I personally have been told by a succession of Labor Party health representatives that access and equity would be threatened in some way-as we have just heardby financial support for private health insurance. Whilst these same people have driven the social justice truck over the health policy for 13 years, those who have suffered most have been the very people that they purport to represent. I speak not only as someone who has some experience of medical politics and health policy but also as someone who has stood in the middle of a housing commission area in an unit with elderly people at 3 0' clock in morning on many occasions when they have woken to find that they have had a stroke or have suffered some similar medical crisis, knowing that I will send them to the public hospital and that, after six or seven hours in the department of emergency medicine, they will be sent home and told that there is no bed. I ask those on the other side to consider how they would feel. It is all very well for those of us who have some income and some resources to use a parachute and pay cash to go into the private sector if we can, but I cannot tell you how much comfort people get, particularly elderly people, from knowing that if they will not be admitted into a public hospital there is a place for them if they have and can afford private health insurance. When the member for Jagajaga was conducting what was known as the Macklin review-euphemistically known at the time as the national health strategy-I attended a meeting in Hobart where she said that she envisaged people with private health insurance would be using it to insure for a private room. In other words, in her view it would have no significant future in terms of Australia's health care system. Brian Howe is a man whom I admired at least for his vision, even though I was totally opposed to it. He was at least committed to the health area. In April 1992 Brian Howe said: Private health insurance makes an insignificant contribution to health financing. Yet at the time it was raising $3 billion a year, which was half a billion dollars more than was raised by the Medicare levy. On 13 October 1992 Brian Howe, the then Labor health minister, said to me, 'Brendan, don't bother telling me what you think the government ought to do; if you want to change anything this government's doing, you'll have to change the government.' During the 1993 federal election the then  the time to be worth something like $5 million-told Australians from the Royal Adelaide Hospital that they 'don't need private health insurance', that they 'are the wasting their money' and 'Medicare can cater for all their needs'. On the same day in Hobart a pensioner patient of mine who worked as a volunteer cleaner in the office of the then Senator Michael Tate, having heard this, said to me, 'I go without food to pay for it' - and that is what they are ignoring on that side. Whether these people are right or wrong, they are committed very much to a health insurance ethic. They are low income people and they want to get timely access and quality care when they need it-not when some government bureaucrat tells them that they should not. Graham Richardson, whom I consider to be the best Labor health minister with whom we dealt in the period of the previous government, recognised the need to support private health insurance. He supported the Medicare surcharge for high income earners. When he suggested that the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating, take out private health insurance, he almost had his head chopped off. I recall reading in the newspapers at Christmas 1995 of the Whitlams, Hawkes, Keatings and other luminaries of the Labor Party being in-patients in a major private hospital in Australia-and of that I am not critical, it is admirable that they have chosen to use that system. But the real hypocrisy, what really grates on me, is that those people then go out and hypocritically say to low income battlers who do not have a choice, 'We're not going to help you pay for private health insurance; we're not going to do a damn thing to help you.' That is what really gets stuck in my craw. Then we had Carmen Lawrence, the member for Fremantle. She said to me, at my first meeting with her when I was the President of the Australian Medical Association, 'People are wasting their money having private health insurance; they ought to do what I do.' I then inquired what this might be. The then minister said that she paid cash. Again, I am not critical of that. But what I am critical of is the hypocrisy of then saying to low income people who have no choice that they have no choice but to use the public hospital system. What I want to hear during this debate is whether the ALP, when back in government-should that time arrive-would withdraw the financial assistance that this package will deliver to low income Australians. I want to make sure also whether the opposition, if they were to come into government-and they should be saying this now-would reduce the Medicare levy surcharge that we are imposing on high income earners. When Graham Richardson went to the Labor Party New South Wales council meeting in July 1993, he argued for a Medicare surcharge on high income earners. He was given short shrift, and I suspect that that, amongst other reasons, is possibly why he is no longer here. In health, as in education, it is cheaper to help somebody to help themselves and their family than it is for the government to provide for everybody. No matter how noble the intentions of the member for Jagajaga and many good people on the other side of the chamber, it is a utopian dream to think that the government can provide for everybody. If you are running a soup kitchen and you cannot see the end of the queue, the first thing you do is to go down there and find out who ought not be there. If you can pull a couple of $100,000 to $150,000 a year income earners out of it-many of whom, as we have heard this evening, would be my constituents-by having them make a greater contribution to Medicare if they do not have private health insurance-how that undermines Medicare is beyond me. The viability of Medicare is in no way threatened by assisting or encouraging Australians to use the private sector, nor is it threatened by compelling higher income earners to make a greater contribution to Medicare if they do not have private health insurance. Graham Richardson again said publicly-I remember him saying to me-at a health insurance association dinner in Launceston in, I think, December 1993, 'The Labor Party has never believed in flat taxes.' Yet that is exactly what the Medicare levy is. Now we have a coalition government that is actually proposing to increase the Medicare levy for higher income people. I challenge anyone on that side to tell me that $100,000 a year is not a high income. In this regard it is worth recalling, as I say, what Graham Richardson was trying to persuade the Labor Party to accept four years ago. Again, had they accepted his advice at the time, perhaps there would be at least a few more on the other side at this stage; if not, they might be somewhere else. Why do Australians want private health insurance? If you look at surveys, for example, about 85 per cent of people consistently say that they believe the government ought to help them to have private health insurance. The only thing that rates higher than that is capital punishment, I understand. They want private health insurance not just to avoid waiting lists for hip replacements, knee replacements and things like that. They want private health insurance because they are working women, and they want to go into hospital to have their laparoscopies, or whatever needs to be done, when it fits in with their work program. They are pensioners who want to avoid a situation where they cannot get admitted into a public hospital, as I said earlier, when they believe they need to be there. In 1983, when Labor came to power, 65.8 per cent of the population was covered. At the end of the September quarter last year, it was 33.5 per cent. It is worth noting that between the June and September quarters last year we had a 0.1 per cent decline in coverage, which was the lowest rate of decline in six years. The expectation of this package has already had an effect on breaking the reduction in private health insurance coverage. In terms of looking at the cost-the $1.7 billion over the three years-it is not just a question of whether it is a three per cent increase, as John Deeble has said, or whether it is a five per cent increase, as the productivity commission estimates; it is also a question of the numbers who do not drop out. If we had lost over the next three years, for example, another four percentage points, you would be adding at least another $400 million to $500 million a year to the costs of providing health care in an exacerbating cycle. Private health insurance contributes about $4 billion a year and it underwrites the treatment of about 30 per cent of all in-patient hospital care in Australia. Given that the Commonwealth's commitment to public hospitals via the Medicare agreements is at $5.6 billion, this is a significant sum of money. Amongst those contributors are 850,000 people over the age of 65, half a million people earning less than $20,000 a year and a million families earning less than $40,000 a year. I hope those people get a copy of the Hansard of the address from the member for Jagajaga and distribute it all over the country like confetti. I think many people on our side ought to do that so the working people you purport to represent can see what you are actually saying in this chamber. About 27 per cent of the population earning over $50,000 a year do not have private health insurance and 16.3 per cent of those earning more than $70,000 a year do not have private health insurance. If they do not want to take out private health insurance, at $50,000 a year they pay an extra $500 and at $100,000 a year they pay an extra $1,000 and they pay it into the Medicare system, they pay it to help make a greater contribution than a low income person to the provision of publicly funded services. The recent political debate about private health insurance premium increases which led to the Productivity Commission review of the regulatory environment and cost pressures on funds would be laughable if it were not so serious. The funds need to maintain their reserves at at least two months if they are to maintain liquidity. At the time of the announcement, about a quarter of the funds in Australia were below minimum reserves. An annual increase under Labor was around 12 per cent. In fact, the Prices Surveillance Authority in its July 1993 report told us that the 26 per cent increase in the cost of private health insurance premiums since 1987 was directly due to the policies of the previous government. To the low income people, to the battling families of Australia, I say listen to this. The cost pressures on the private health insurance funds fall into six generic groups. The first is the shifting of costs onto funds by both the federal and the state governments. The previous government stopped its contribution to the reinsurance pool between 1983 and 1988. That added $220 million to the cost of private health insurance today. It put prosthesis onto basic tables and it abolished the private bed day subsidy in October 1986. That added another $235 million to the cost of private health insurance premiums. In 1987 the funds were required to cover a quarter of the Medicare benefit schedule fee. That added another $216 million in today's dollars to the cost of private health insurance. They then effectively over the last five years transferred patients from public to private hospitals. Remember the rhetoric in Victoria, for example, about the doctors treating privately insured patients in public hospitals and how outrageous this was and we had to get these privately insured patients out of public hospitals. Damn the fact that they had paid their Medicare levy, that they had paid their taxes, then they had paid private health insurance and gone to use a public bed that they had paid for twice-ignore that. Now we have had all sorts of measures, including the Medicare agreement signed by Brian Howe late in 1992-93, which actually forced the public hospitals run by the states to get privately insured patients out. Having more of those privately insured patients treated in private hospitals substantially increased the costs of private health insurance premiums because the cost of the bed is about double what it is in the public hospital. But keep in mind that the consumer had already paid for it twice. We then had the Medicare agreements. Still we are running under those agreements a $160 million a year program to give states rewards for increasing the number of public hospital beds in the state and reducing the number of privately insured beds in their public hospitals. If they had too many privately insured patients treated in public hospitals, they are actually penalised. That kind of logic, ladies and gentlemen of Australia, is contributing to the price that you are paying for private health insurance. The other issue of great rhetoric which we get is that about doctors fees and uninsurable gaps. What people ought to understand is that you can only insure through law to the level of the Medicare benefit schedule. That schedule of fees has increased since 1985 by 38 per cent-in contrast, average weekly earnings have increased by 75 per cent, the consumer price index has increased by 73 per cent and the AMA schedule of fees has increased by 75 per cent. The Department of Health and Family Services itself in its submission to the Senate inquiry reviewing the Lawrence reforms in 1995 said that the average gap payment is $79.50. Two-thirds of people nominating a reason why they drop out of private health insurance say that it is the cost of the premium. The second cost pressure on the funds and the premiums is the fact that they are now marketing no-gaps products. Clearly, if you are marketing a product without any gaps, it is more expensive. We have got raised patient expectations and the ageing of Australia, particularly the fund membership-14 per cent of those in private health insurance now are over the age of 65; in 1992, it was 10.2 per cent. Those people over 65 account for $1.3 billion of the claims, which is about a third of the industry's outlays. The elderly have relatively more health problems, which is not surprising. For example, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare finds that women over the age of 75 use 57 times more hospital services than girls between the ages of one and 14. The next cost pressures are the loss of low claiming members for obvious reasons and the change in private hospital case mix. We now have private hospitals that provide emergency departments, intensive care units and all of the rest. That reminds me of when I was in London last week on a political exchange. The best thing the member for Jagajaga could say about Australia's health care system, consistent with what Labor health spokespersons over the last decade in this country have said, was that we have kept costs to about 8'12 per cent of GDP and how wonderful it is the way things have been run in the national health service in Britain. When I was in Britain a woman died on a wasting list for cardiac bypass surgery because there was not an ICU bed available for her. Yes, we know these things have happened in recent years in Australia, too. But do you know how many of those they have in Britain? Two a day. When I went to a fund holding general practice, for example, three months away from the end of their financial year they were over budget and they did not have enough money to pay the hospital, which itself was £14 million over budget, to get patients on their lists treated. They had to ring the specialists in the hospital and instruct them not to operate on the patients. So the administrator of the general practice, a non-medical person, was ringing the local hospital and saying, 'Please don't operate on Mrs Smith, we can't afford it.' The final cost pressure on the funds is the failure of the funds themselves to achieve management cost savings. That is an internal issue with which they will have to deal. In conclusion, this is an equitable measure. It is long overdue. It is a three-year program which commits, as we have heard, $1.7 billion over three years. I suspcc- that at the end of that three years the govc;-nment of the day will need to review the manlier in which it provides financial assistance i. ow income Australians. What this is all about is 'Jropping up the public sector as much as the nrivate sector. It is about giving low income l,eople a better chance of getting timely au t'· s. when they choose and when they need it, and getting high income people-some of whom, frankly, I feel have been bludging on the system; I have seen one too many people jump out of a Jaguar and into a public hospital queue not to say that-to make a greater contribution to public health care provision if they do not want private health insurance. Frankly, I think it is disappointing, if not disgraceful, that the Labor Party should be so opposed to this.",81
122,Mr MARTIN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Cunningham) (9.23 p.m.)It is with some pleasure tonight that I rise to speak in this debate on health insurance, following my very learned colleague the honourable member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson). Quite obviously his background-as a medical practitioner and the years that he spent as the President of the AMA-does equip him well to argue a persuasive case, particularly for the views that he holds as far as his government is concerned. I listened with great interest to his comments and also the exchange that occurred with my colleague the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) who clearly has, on a number of particular points that have been raised, a different point of view. I think that says something about our political process at the moment on issues such as this. At the end of it all, the Labor Party has taken great pride and pleasure in having seen a universal health care system put in place in this country running, as it does, so effectively in ensuring that everyone has coverage. Yet at the same time. I hope that the honourable member for Bradfield would at least concede that in the course of those 13 years when we were in government there was also an attempt made. I accept with varying degrees of success-to see that the private health industry had a role in that total concept. Where I tend to diverge from the comments that he made is in respect of low income earners and the expectations that they have about the medical system dlId what is available to them. particularly in hospitals, and the role that some private hospitals subsequently play in that respect. The hill s we are debati 'J - toni rrivate insurant:· lI1ccnliv-:. - i""; the increase lu th·.: Medicare levy. In tenm ,1 the latter one, the member for Bradfield pointed out that this is a measure which largely will impact on higher income earners-an argument which my former colleague Graham Richardson, as the Minister for Health, put forward as one which would probably could sustain argument. I do remember being involved in debates on this issue at that time in the caucus and in other committees of the Labor Party. We are in opposition now, but I have to say I came down on the side of Graham Richardson at the time. It was not to be. We know that is the case, but at the time it was. Nevertheless, the concern that we have is more a political issue in that the government did come into office promising no increases in taxes or existing taxes. The increase to the Medicare levy for the gun buyback was not a problem. There was 100 per cent support across the chamber. We have said that. We stood up in this place and paid due credit to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for the decisive action he took on that particular occasion. There was also not a problem in increasing the Medicare levy. I guess we do have that concern that a commitment given in an area-notwithstanding the arguments I know that my friend the member for Bradfield would raise as to the purpose of it-does clearly stand out as a broken promise. This also comes back to the whole issue of the funding mechanism for the public health system. I spent a very short time as a member of a health board in the Illawarra. Unfortunately, it was not long enough for me to gain a total appreciation of the difficulties faced in that system in New South Wales at the time, with a health board that was relevant to only one hospital: that is, Wollongong hospital. Since that time in New South Wales there has been a move to the area health system. In the case of Illawarra, the Illawarra area health service has been established, and a number of different campuses of that health system are in operation. As a consequence of that, we have seen particular hospitals in the Illawarra develop, and continue to develop, with parght deal with ticular specialities. For example, if you are in need of orthopaedic surgery, Port Kembla hospital is the hospital you go to. You do not go to Bulli hospital. If you are in need of specialist psychiatric services, there are hospitals at Port Kembla and Shellharbour. There are acute psychiatric units there. In fact, my wife is the nurse unit manager of the unit at Shellharbour. I know there are pressures in the health system within our own district as a result of cutbacks in funds to the health system over a period of time. Of course, this was something which Premier Bob Carr commented upon recently and which the Prime Minister, in fact, attacked the Premier of New South Wales over in calling for a fuller inquiry into hospital funding, and rightly so. I do not think even the member for Bradfield can deny the fact that in the last budget there have been cuts for medical services and for hospitals across Australia. I would have thought that, if we in this place are concerned about ensuring what I consider to be one of the most vexing problems facing any government at federal level or state level-that is, adequate funding for the health ""ystem and the sort of health service we want-we have to give consideration to funding cuts of the order that have been put in place by the government-something like S 1.7 billion in cuts over the coming three years. I think that sends the wrong sort of message. If you talk about the battlers and about low income people-let us define them as such-I would have thought that it is to their great advantage to know with some certainty that hospital beds in various hospitals-whether it be in the Illawarra, North Sydney or in the western suburbs of Melbourne-will be available. Because of the pressures that have he en applied to area health services in New South Wales, Victoria or wherever, we find t lJ,. administrators of those particular facilities arl' faced with the cost imperatives. That is Ill' hottom line. \\'hat "" t',:; ea-;,:-t wa· for administrators to meet lhat commilmc:::' It h to do-e hospital beds and reduce serVlCCS. I would think that is onc of the most glaring prohlems we, as legis ...ltors, are confroI1lcd with:i the h\lspital system. Unoer the hann:. r of social justice, I would argue, as I am sure my colleagues on this side of the House would argue, that to meet those problems requires a greater recognition of the need for increased resources coming from the Commonwealth for disbursement to the states. That is not to say that there has to be a changed management style within the states themselves. That is probably right, and they are addressing that. I think my colleague the member for Bradfield would recognise himself that these days the way in which people are treated in hospitals is completely different from the way they were treated years ago. In the past, if you went in for an appendicectomy you were there for a week or so and received topnotch care and all the rest of it. These days you are in for a couple of days and then you recuperate at home because of demand for the equipment or the costs that apply in hospital systems and so on-the' bottom line the administrators at the area health service say they have to meet. To some extent there is probably nothing wrong with that. It is a change in attitude that we are going to have to see and that may come in time, I think, in Australia-you go in for operations and you are probably best to recuperate in your own home environment rather than by necessity in a hospital. But when you compare low income earners' accessibility to the hospital system to higher income earners' accessibility, my own view is that those who are least able to afford it should be the ones who have access. There are some examples which we have seen in recent times, which are just a comparative analysis to some extent, of how that does work effectively. I am not sure if the honourable member-I am sorry, Madam Deputy Speaker; I am addressing a lot of my remarks to the member for Bradfield hecause naturally I followed him and he made a very strong contribution in defence of the government's position-is aware of a comparative article, a special investigation, in the Sunday Telegraph uf 2 February this year. There were two people who went into hospital for exactly the same operation. One had private health insur dtlCe aLu it cost lllln $6,000 extra. He is trying to find the money-he is saving up to borrow-to pay off some of the biIls that stiIl keep coming in. Yet another gentleman ended up paying $9.60 for the same operation, which was the gap between the consultation fee and the Medicare rebate. I know my friend will argue that that clearly is an example of disparities in the system and how there has to be a better rationalisation with private health insurance and Medicare and so on. But it also demonstrates that people who have been contributing-in the case of the second gentleman who ended up paying $9.60-to private health insurance have decided to opt out because they do not feel they are getting a lot of benefit from that. I know a lot of families, for example, take private health insurance because they know they can get the additional benefits for denture work, glasses and all the rest of it, but a lot of those families are starting to opt out as weIl, particularly those on higher incomes. People say, 'How many times a year do I go to a doctor? It has dropped substantiaIly. What are my chances of having to go into hospital this year? Not that great.' If they are relatively high income earners then they say, 'What is the point of having health insurance at all because if I do need it I am able to access funds to meet my commitments, my payments, for it?' To some extent, I suppose, this is a strong argument why private health insurers are finding some difficulties in maintaining their membership levels, although I did note the honourable member for Bradfield made some comment about how that dropout rate has tended to stabilise now. It will be interesting to see the measurement of that in the next couple of months. Take NIB, for example. I had a number of phone caIls to my electorate office recently about NIB because the Newcastle area and certainly the Wollongong area has a fairly high number of people who are a members of that health fund. NIB boosted their health insurance by about 29 per cent, I think, in one fell swoop. Some people now find that for basic hospital coverage and extended benefits they are paying nearly $50 a week to be in a private health insurance fund. I do not care if people happen to live in the battlers' area of Bellambi or in the high income areas of Mount Pleasant in Wollongong; they are going to look at that amount and say, 'That is $50 a week I could be spending on something else.' I think we as a parliament-and I say that in a more generic sense-should be looking at ways in which people on low incomes have a real opportunity to have some certainty that if they go into hospital they know they are going to get the best possible care without the enormous cost burden that perhaps they feel taking out private health insurance will become. Yet, at the same time, I am persuaded by some of the comments, because, as I have said, I am not going back on anything I did not say years ago when Graham Richardson put forward a similar proposition about those on higher incomes perhaps meeting a greater share of that burden. I also find it interesting that, notwithstanding people having private health insurance, when they go into some of those private hospitals they still get hit with other fees and charges-bed day charges or anaesthetists charges. Sure, people who have got private health insurance get the benefit of Medicare rebates and their private health insurance for the cost of being in there-for the beds and the specialists that tum up and they pay the difference-but they suddenly get hit with these other charges and say, 'Hang on. I really thought that was why I was paying private health insurance.' I think there is a lack of understanding about some of those issues as well within the broader Australian context. The member for Bradfield referred to his own personal experiences in dealing with people who were ill and pensioners who were suffering difficulties being put into hospitals and then being shuffled off because there were no beds available and so on. Honestly, I have to say that my own personal experiences certainly did not affect me in a similar way. A couple of my kids suffered problems. In fact, my youngest suffered problems at birth. She got the absolute best care from the best paediatric person in Wollongong-who was a leading paediatrician anyway-irrespective of whether we were medically insured, whether we were just in Medicare or whatever. There were the circumstances at the time of the birth and the problems that occurred later, the transfer to Sydney Children's Hospital, having to send three weeks up there, intensive care and all the rest of it, and the bills that came in were minimal. Yet the best care was made available to my daughter. I suppose to some extent that is the sort of system those of us in this place-not just on our side-would want to be able to say is available. I see a sly grin on the face of my friend the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), because he knows that at the end of the day there is always going to be a cost involved in that and somebody ends up having to pay. But that is where the line sort of gets drawn down the middle of this chamber. We would say that there should perhaps be a better emphasis placed by the government of the day on funding for the hospitals. We would also recognise that the private health providers have a role in that, particularly in the private health system. It is a question of how best you strike that balance. I think some of the issues raised in this place by people on both sides are worthy of consideration. I did take note of the comments of the member for Bradfield that in three years time there will again be a need for a very clear and concise appreciation of the circumstances in the health system. I am sure the government of the day will very much have to do that. We would hope it is us, my friend, I have to say. Notwithstanding that I think the health system, as I have said, is the biggest issue in Australia at the present time-how you get that balance right-I would like to think we might be able to do that. Notwithstanding that, I think the comments made so far in the course of this debate have been very useful. I would hope the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) finds them useful. I will conclude by looking at another article in the Sunday Telegraph. You can see that I read the Sunday Telegraph regularly. This article by Peter Rees is headed 'Radical care plan pushed'. It talks about a similar system in the UK. I know that the member for Bradfield mentioned that he was in the UK last year. The article states that in Britain the National Health Service now gives GPs buying budgets which allows them to buy hospital services on a competitive basis. I would like to know what 'a competitive basis' actually means. I would not like to think that Allan Fels is going to have to get involved in something like this. I would like to think that at the end of the day the patient's care and welfare is paramount in this, that we are not talking about rational economists getting into the health care system and suggesting that the bottom line is the only thing that matters. I notice that the Australian Medical Association bitterly attacked the proposal-and well they should. I hope the member for Bradfield made some comments to those people who followed him in the very important role he played in that organisation. I think there are some issues here that need some very clear and concise consideration. I think the member for Jagajaga and the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) have expressed the Labor Party's concerns about many of these issues. Mr Kelvin Thomson-Very well.",86
123,Mr MARTIN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Indeed, they did that very well. I have listened with some interest to other contributors during this debate. I look forward to discussing these matters in coming years.",89
124,Mr TUCKEY,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"In opening my remarks, I refer to the remarks of the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin). Of course your baby child got the absolute best care. Medicare is extremely good with dealing with emergencies. But if, by some unfortunate miracle, that child of yours was transported tomorrow to the age of 65 and had cataracts or a degenerative hip: nope, sorry, come back next year. That is the problem. Medicare is very good at looking after young, nonclaiming people. That is why they have faith in it. That is the great problem. I also want to address the circumstances of the great myth that the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) threw in about the US system. We all know what the problem with the US system is. It's called litigation. Unfortunately, it's raising its ugly head here. It is not the specific cost of litigation. There are state authorities now in America who have capped settlements, that have stopped the amount of money that can be granted by way of litigation, and their health administration costs have fallen. Why? Because doctors are no longer forced to take absolutely stupid procedures to defend themselves against a rapacious legal system. I think it is a great pity that we see this surfacing here in Australia. If a doctor is negligent, let us look at his qualifications and at his licence to practise. But why just have massive settlements, usually for people that are dead or about to die, when they are a direct charge on the rest of the community? The entire community pays. During the life of Medicare, membership of private health insurance has fallen from over 70 per cent to approximately 33 per cent. The level of health expenditure in the federal budget has risen in nominal terms from $3 billion to $19.4 billion. That $19.4 billion is best compared with a couple of other eggs in the nest-education and defence. Pre Medicare $3 billion was allocated for health, $31f2 billion for education and $4 billion for defence. In this current budget $19.4 billion is allocated for health, $11 billion for education and $10 billion for defence. As I pointed out in this House the other day, one wonders why education finds itself under-resourced. The cuckoo has got into the nest and it is that very large chick that is consuming all the resources and other segments of our expenditure, and the services government provides find themselves missing out. Those who are abdicating the private health care that brought that crash in membership are the young and healthy who simply do not need the benefits private health insurance provides while Medicare provides for their emergency type treatment. That is all the young generally require, and I have just made that point to the member for Cunningham. The result, of course, is a massive escalation in premiums to the elderly to the point where many who paid for private health cover all their non-claiming working lives now find they cannot afford to retain their cover when they need it most desperately. Why do they need it? I was shadow minister for health about 10 years ago and I attended a major conference at the time in Sydney where the keynote speaker was a New Zealand health administrator, Dame Dorothy Fraser, who had been knighted for her services to the public hospital system. One of the remarks she made has stuck in my memory; it is burnt there. She said words to the effect that there were 50,000 New Zealanders on their public hospital waiting lists. Waiting lists, she said, were the means by which they rationed the public hospital system. She went on, having made that admission, to complain about the administration of waiting lists. She saw them as quite appropriate, but she was very critical of the fact that if you knew your way through the system you could get promoted up the waiting list. I endorse entirely her criticism in that regard. The point has been made by previous speakers about how the previous Prime Minister boasted that he did not have private health insurance. When you are as important as a Prime Minister or, as occurred in his life, a Treasurer, why would you be worried about a waiting list? You do not even have to pick up the phone. You are automatically promoted up that waiting list. If your wife has a problem, such as gallstones, you suddenly find the specialist saying, 'Well, Mrs So-and-So, I suggest you attend the So-and-So hospital on a certain date. I'll be operating that day.' Of course, when the booking comes in, the administrators there immediately say: 'Oh, it's the Prime Minister's wife' or 'It's the Treasurer's wife' or 'It's the Minister for Health's children.' They are not going to be told to come back. We see that sort of elitism in totalitarian and communist countries. I spoke to a member of parliament who once broke his tooth in China and went to Mao Zedong's private dental clinic which, he said, was the best equipped he had ever seen in the world. But, of course, out in the villages they would have knocked the tooth out with a chisel. So there is a difference, and it is a form of elitism that arises out of socialism. But the measures before us tonight are designed to do something to correct the situation of this collapse in private health insurance. I have got to say that they will probably do little more than stop the collapse. I hope that they achieve that. I am not confident that they will increase the membership, although there is a possibility of that occurring in a very desirable area, that is, the well-off young, who are also addressed by this measure by way of the penalty. Fortunately, the assistance of the rebate might be the reason that some of those people I have already mentioned, the elderly who are finding private health insurance unaffordable, will be able to stay in there and get the benefits of access to a hospital when they need it. That is the most important aspect of private health insurance. I hope these measures will delay what I have been predicting-and I predicted 10 years ago as shadow minister-will be the total collapse of our private health insurance system if certain measures are not taken to address the fundamental problem that exists in the system we have today. There is no doubt that the Australian people think that Medicare is good. I must admit that they do not always get asked the right questions in surveys, but from a political viewpoint-and we have made promises accordingly-we are going to continue to support the Medicare concept, notwithstanding that in my view it is fundamentally flawed. The fundamental flaw in what we chose to do in Australia is that we have been trying to run a private health insurance system in parallel with a public health insurance one. That represents no difficulty at all in insuring someone's house. It can bum down under construction; it can bum down when it is 100 years old. Demand for health services are totally age related. Consequently, people have learnt in the life of Medicare to forum shop. As I have pointed out to the member for Cunningham, you can rely substantially on Medicare while you are young and basically healthy because the types of demands you put on the health system, the types of illnesses that arise, are emergency style affairs-even childbirth. Nobody can say, 'Come back next year to have your baby.' So the system accommodates that. I am pleased that it does and I think it does it adequately. But, because of cost pressures and because of what Dame Dorothy Fraser said about rationing hospital services by use of waiting lists, as soon as we get to that position of so called elective surgery-you might be blind and you might not be able to see but, of course, you are not going to die-the political process just slows down those sorts of services to save money. To put it simply, to guarantee equity in a market where claims are so predictable, all the money that is available to service that industry must go into one pot, not two as we have now. That means you either have a national health socialised type medical scheme or a total private health insurance one. The cost of the first proposal can be easily measured by reference to our current budget. If health outlays now stand at around $19.4 billion, in a budget of approximately $120 billion it is reasonable to say that the cost of a total system-that is, a national health system-would be, say, $25 billion or 20 per cent of the budget. As a direct charge, if we just sent every typical family in Australia an account-and this is something that should be remembered about the current $19.4 billionthat would be about $5,000 per typical family. Of course, if we chose to fund it in that fashion, we would have to send every typical family an annual account for $6,000 a year, because that is what it is costing. The alternative is to revert to a total private health system for health administration and for government to restrict its role to providing adequate, if not generous, subsidies to those whose financial capacity could not guarantee them equal access to high quality health care. Having considered those matters, I came to that conclusion 10 years ago and wrote a policy for our party that applied those principles. I think it will be illuminating for this House to look at how the costs were worked out. The first thing we did was throw out this stupid premise of community rating-a flat premium charge for all. It is great, it sounds wonderful, and when people have a choice it is nice to say that the young should pay for the elderly, but all the evidence shows that they refuse to do so. They are not paying, so why have a flat rate structure? Why not set a premium that they just might pay and take half? It would surely help. After a lot of actuarial advice 10 years ago-this is very illuminating as far as I am concerned in terms of the real cost relativities because of age-we struck a premium for those aged between 0 and 18 years of $6.70 per week per child. We then went to the group aged between 18 and 60 and the fee was $9 a week. For people over 60, the premium was $26 a week, actuarially calculated. Most elderly people, even at that time, could not afford that amount, and it would be higher today. At that time we were sitting on a Medicare cost of $7.2 billion. So we said that we would pay the $6.70 for every kid in the country, irrespective of the wealth of their parents or anything else. We would pay 100 per cent of the cost. We said that we would pay the $26 a week to every aged pensioner. Many of those people just outside the pension system could not afford $26 a week, so we took their numbers and applied a budget figure of $20 a week for all of those people on an average but means tested basis. We then looked at the social security numbers for the unemployedall those people in that middle age group who did not have an income. When we added up all that cost, we only got to $4.2 billion. We had put every pensioner in Australia in 100 per cent private health cover-none of this business that was mentioned earlier that if you pay extra you get everything. They got top cover--everythingand they paid nothing; and no queues. We were able to give all those other elderly people help at an average of $20 a week. With the $3 billion odd we had left over we could refund the Medicare levy, which was just over $2 billion at the time, and we had about $800 million left to address some of the poverty traps that might arise in some of those groupings. We came to the conclusion that the only people who were going to pay were those in employment who were somewhere between the ages of 18 and 60. There were no problems. There was private health cover for all and no 6,000 public servants to administer the scheme. You literally reprogrammed the social security computers. That did not happen. It never became our official policy because people were scared of it. The national interest was never considered. The rights of Australians to have equal access to the health system and no queues were never considered. It came back to the political consequences of trying to change this popular system, and nobody had the courage to do it. I do not blame them in many ways. The tragedy of our present political process-I have raised this same issue on taxation here time and time again-is that we both sit on each side of this place and we never want to talk about the national interest. We want to know how we get re-elected and how we defeat the other side. It is the tragedy of democracy. It is a great pity that on some of these great important issues we cannot sit down together and say, 'What is the better outcome?' I want to close because I did promise my whip that I would try to finish a bit ahead of 20 minutes, although nobody else seems to be paying much attention. When I went off with that policy that put all this money into the hands of our established private insurers-the ones who are whingeing and moaning now through Russell Schneider-they sent Russell Schneider into this parliament to kill off the idea. They did not want all that business. They were much more comfortable sitting on the side blaming the government for all their own mistakes. I do not think they have changed very much, but they are now watching their businesses collapse, as I warned them they would. I think that private health insurance is almost irretrievable. It would be a great tragedy for the community if that happens. These are the issues. As I said, I am not here to criticise the initiatives, because they are initiatives that are going in the right direction. I just have a grave fear that the system has a momentum of its own and we will not be able to afford it and we will all be obliged, either side of politics, to follow the advice of Dame Dorothy Fraser and continue to ration the services available by ever increasing queues. It will be queues for the elderly, not the young and healthy.",89
125,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) spoke very little about this private health insurance bill and talked about the Liberal health policy that never was. Perhaps that is not surprising, given that the bill before the House is an absolute shocker. It is called the Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill, and there are other pieces of legislation that we are debating cognately, but it really ought to be called the 'How to hose $1. 7 billion up against the wall bill'. One day they will do a textbook on this called 'How to blow big money' from the party which likes to tell us how strongly they are opposed to wasting taxpayers' money. The worse of it is that we have to go along with this legislation because, in effect, the money has already been spent and the premiums have already gone up. We are standing here at the scene of a disaster without any alternative. The tragedy of this bill is that the money that we are voting to spend to prop up private health insurance has already gone. It has been illuminating to listen to some the members opposite, such as the member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford), who have given the game away in terms of how the Liberal Party really sees Medicare and public health. The member for MCPherson referred to just how good health care was in this country before Labor stepped into fix it and now it is broken. What a lot of nonsense! Before Labor came to office back in 1983 some two million families were without health insurance of any kind. So, for them, illness, accidents and sickness were not just a source of physical hardship; they were a source of financial catastrophe. With Medicare we were able to introduce a health system which became the envy of many countries. Many countries sent representatives to Australia to study our system and to see how it could be applied to their own system of health care. Honourable members opposite, over the course of those 13 years. came to publicly support Medicare. They had always said they were opposed to it, but they changed their tune and said to the electorate, 'It's all right to vote us in. We support Medicare. We are committed to Medicare. We won't do away with it. It's quite safe.' But now in the House their true colours are revealed as they come out and say things like, 'We had a perfectly good health system before you got in.' The system of health insurance under the Fraser government was changed on six or seven occasions. We had Medibank mark 2, mark 3 and mark 4, and eventually it was sliced into oblivion. As I said before, two million families were without health insurance of any kind at the time of the change of government. The other point I want to make is that members opposite have said that the Labor Party approved each private health insurance rise. But the point is that we did not spend this kind of money on private health insurance incentives because we knew this would not work-and it has not worked. No sooner did the budget come down with these measures than the health insurance funds stepped in and said, 'We'll take that, thank you very much. We'll have that ourselves.' As a result, we have seen it being totally ineffective if: preventing the fall in private health insurance. of Just a week ago, figures showed a further fall in private health insurance from 33.5 per cent to 33.2 per cent, indicating that the 'great private health insurance initiative' has fal1ej before it has even begun-strangled at birth. In the last few months, private -,ealth insurance contributors around the country have received letters from their funds 'Jutlining premium increases, making them aware of the government's proposed incentives. The people who are dropping out now are doing so in full knowledge of the government's private health insurance plan. Similarlv th ' government's own Productivity Commi-;,' 'lj inquiry described the incentives as inefficic-,. Essentially, these figures have revealed tha.l the $1. 7 billion spent has been a waste. ! t would have been infinitely better for heal! i1 objectives for the community to spend thiS money directly on reducing public hOSfllt:J\ waiting lists. That would have been the way to go. This package of health insurance incentives was at the centre of the coalition's health policy. There were really two parts to the health policy: a series of promises about keeping Medicare, which are progressively being broken, and the $1.7 billion package for private health insurance. That private health insurance package is a policy based on ignorance and prejudice against public health and threatens long-term damage to the Medicare system. I think the government has to be condemned for breaking a key election promise not to cut public funding to pay for private subsidies and because it is inefficient and a waste of scarce health dollars. If you go back to A Healthy Future, the coalition's health policy, it contained this promise: The incentive will not be funded fJ .Jm the public hospital system or health grant;, It! t!,c States. than the $50 million which will be Il'allocated from the Better Practice Program, the incentive will be funded entirely from savings outside the Health and Human Services portfolio. But, if you have a look at the budget, that undertaking has been completely broken. Within months of that promise, the coalition government had slashed grants to the states by $1.5 billion over three years. which represented a cut of around $<;00 million to the states' health funding, which comprises approximately one-thIrd of health expenditllfe. They have made direct funding cuts to public hospitals of more than $300 million over fuur years and have made other massive cuts to he-llth policy totalling more than $3 billion over four years. Australians who believed that the coalition would protect the foundations of our health system were absolutely betrayed. If you think the federal government's record on health care is bad, the state governmentscertainly, in Victoria-are much worse. The member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) referred to massive cuts in the public hospital system in Victoria. One of the things that has occurred in Victoria is that the Burwood hospital has been closed. I asked the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) in questions on notice whether his attention had been drawn by the Victorian government to that closure. He said: I am aware from media reports of the closure ... I have not yet been officially advised of this for the purposes of Schedule A of the Medicare Agreements. So the state government has not even bothered to tell the minister that the Burwood and District Community Hospital has closed, which is extraordinary given that that hospital is in the minister's own electorate. I further asked the minister whether he was able to provide departmental advice on the efficiency of Burwood hospital and on how many people were treated in 1996. He wrote back and said, 'No.' I then asked the minister whether he supported the decision to close Burwood hospital in his electorate. He said: The Commonwealth does not have a position as to the Victorian Government's decision to close Burwood Hospital. This is entirely a state matter. Finally, I asked whether the minister had Other made representations to the Victorian government following its decision to close the Burwood hospital. His answer was: I have had discussions with the Victorian Minister for Health regarding the closure of Burwood Hospital. As this was a private discussion it would not be proper for me to release details. What kind of secret society is this? We ask questions on notice in order to get information from ministers. The minister says, 'I've had a conversation with the Victorian healt!, minister, but I can't tdl you Wh:lt I said and I can't tell you what he said.' The question in the minds of penpk in the minister's electorate is: did the minister stand up for his electorate or didn'the? In either event, Burwood hospital is to be closed. If the state government has a poor record in terms of its management of public hospitals and its commitment to public hospitals, its obsession with a private health system over a universally available public health system is even worse when it is extended to the ambulance system. We had, just a fortnight ago, the most extraordinary announcement that Victoria is to have a new private ambulance system, which will be set up in Melbourne and available only to patients who can afford to pay an annual subscription fee of more than $1,000. The company, Meditrack, is proposing to have up to 23 mobile intensive care units exclusively for subscribers needing emergency transportation to hospital. That creates a second ambulance service which will be available only to the rich while everyone else has to wait, often far too long, for an ambulance. The Meditrack prospectus says that Meditrack subscribers 'will receive medical treatment far quicker than a person using alternative emergency services'. The private system is in fact seeking to attract customers by highlighting delays in the public ambulance system and in public hospital emergency departments under the Kennett government. The prospectus states: No longer will subscribers be forced to wait for appropriate ambulance resources, to be shuttled between hospitals which are on 'casualty bypass' due to lack of resources. It further says: Currently the general public is a ""victim"" of ""crisis medicine"" where they feel they are depersonalised by the level of treatment and care given . . . delay in treatment and advice is exponentially increased as patients wait longer because of the need to travel to medical centres or await the arrival of a state based ambulance service. What a damning indictment. That is bad enough but it gets worse. I was astonished to learn that Mr Grant Griffiths, one of the promoters of Meditrack, was appointed a director while he was the Chief Executive Officer of Intergraph. Intergraph is the company to which the Kennett government had given the contract to run the computer-aided dispatch system for the public ambulance service. Mr Griffiths hecame a director of Meditrack in March last year while he was Chief Executive Officer of Intergraph and was meant to be running an efficient ambulance dispatch service for the public ambulance service. It has now emerged that, at the time Intergraph was the subject of public debate about long ambulance delays, Mr Griffiths was setting up a private company which would compete with the metropolitan ambulance service and which would obtain business precisely because of the very delays in ambulance response times for which Mr Griffiths was responsible. There are also massive conflicts of interests involving two other men who became direcwith tors of Meditrack while they were in senior management positions with Intergraph. Back in February last year, Mr Shane Tyrrell and Mr David Lindell were appointed directors of Meditrack Australia Pty Ltd. At that time Mr Tyrrell was Executive Director of Sales and Marketing for Intergraph and Mr Lindell was on the executive management team of Intergraph. In September 1996 the directors of Meditrack, including Mr Griffiths, issued a document seeking subscribers for 20 million shares in Meditrack. That document makes numerous references to the long delays in the public ambulance and hospitals systems. It is outrageous that the head of Intergraph, who has a responsibility to reduce ambulance delays, has been setting up his own private company which could attract customers dissatisfied with the public system and the Kennett government has lost control of the ambulance system because of its ideological obsession with privatisation . Returning to the private health insurance companies: I have had many complaints from my constituents about the rises in premiums which those companies have engaged in since the government's announcement of this private health insurance incentive. The most recent of these complaints comes from a Mr Ron Harrison of Brunswick who has pointed out to me his concern that Medibank Private and to some extent Australian Unity, his own health insurance fund, have been engaging in misleading advertising. For example, he makes reference to the TV ad by Medibank Private which talks about treating different categories of families differently and says that they are aware of the status of different families, that they do not all have a mum and dad and two kids. But the legislation concerning community rating does not permit health funds to charge people less on the basis that, for example, they have no children. When we examine the things being offered by these funds in different packages, we find that, yes, people can elect to forgo cover for obstetrics but, besides forgoing cover for obstetrics, they can also lose cover for cardiac surgery and many other things that people subscriptions to private health insurance companies regard as important and necessary. In addition, I think in both plans-Medibank Private and Australian Unity-there is a $55 daily surcharge. So, in fact, the as are misleading and these sorts of options are not really practical for people in the same situation as Mr Harrison. I am concerned that these rates will not encourage additional people to take out private health insurance. They will not courage low income earners to do so unless they can find the other 80 per cent of the premium. It is, in my view, a cruel hoax to portray this policy as helping the majority low income earners when it is funded to services on which they rely and offers them rebates which they cannot afford to get. As I indicated before, the rebate has already been swallowed up by massive premium note increases. In August, HBA in Victoria anway. nounced an increase of six per cent and Australian Unity an increase of 8.6 per cent. As we all know, after these increases occurbeds red, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) vened and set up the Productivity Commission inquiry, a new approval process, in ministration which he is to take personal responsibility for future increases. Unfortunately, the funds have paid no attention to the Prime Minister's plaintive calls, and the total ineffectiveness of his intervention was demonstrated by the growing increases throughout the remainder of 1996. Manchester Unity announced increases 17lh per Gent shortly afterwards; HBA in WA, South Australia and the Northern Territory announced premium increases of around per cent in October; and, in November, Australia's largest funds, Medibank Private and MBF, announced increases of 12.9 per cent and 15 per cent respectively. Medibank Private's published figure, as just said, was 12.9 per cent. But in Victoriabroken and I know this from quite a few of my constituents-the actual increases were much higher and went as high as 23 per cent. So have, against this background, figures which show that people are continuing to drop despite the fact that they know about the incentives. Last quarter over 150,000 dropped out of private health insurance, and of course they were aware of the governLiberal ment's initiatives prior to making that deciputting sion. So they have dropped out with a full knowledge of the government's incentive. It would seem that the government has abandoned its earlier target of 40 per cent coverage. So we have a piece of legislation before us which has proven to be totally ineffective. It enhas also been shown by the government's own Industry Commission inquiry to be inefficient. The commission criticised the net budgetary cost of the incentive as likely to be of quite large, and that is the inquiry that the by cuts Prime Minister set up. The minister has endeavoured to defend the public hospital cuts which he has made by attacking cost shifting by the states. But we that this ignores cost shifting the other We note that hospitals have been forced by conservative state government cutbacks to cost shift in order to protect staff and keep open and that the further cutting of interfunding will only make things worse. I further express the concern that the adof these incentives will be difficult for the public and for the officials at the Health Insurance Commission and the tax office. Members of the public have to indicate their own annual income and then complete a IS-page form. That is scarcely likely to be an efficient arrangement and I think it will be difficult for staff at the tax office and at the of Health Insurance Commission. In the remaining minute or so that I have I want to make a couple of observations about nine the other bills before the House-the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill (No.2) and the Taxation Laws Amendment (Private Health Insurance Incentives) Bill. It first needs to be said that the Medicare levy I surcharge represents yet another coalition promise. The government promised no new and no increased taxes. This is the second increase in the Medicare levy and, we although the opposition supports the gun buyback scheme, this does highlight the out duplicity of the government making such promises prior to the election and then renegpeople ing on them afterwards. r and many other Labor candidates had our opposite numbers writing to us, out media releases and the like saying, 'I swear on a stack of bibles' or 'I sign an oath in blood that I'm not going to vote for any tax increases.' Of course in the case of my Liberal opponent that is not relevant here, but Liberal MPs were saying that sort of thing prior to the election. Now we get an increase in the Medicare levy. I further make the point that there was a vast difference, firstly, between this proposal and the proposal previously put forward by Graham Richardson in the first place and, secondly, between the coalition and Labor. We had promised at the last election an additional $150 million for public hospital funding. What the coalition has done is to cut public hospital funding by $800 million. (Time expired)",93
126,Dr SOUTHCOTT,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) seems to be a bit confused when it comes to the Medicare levy. He does not mind if it is used to support the gun buyback scheme. But, if it is used to encourage people on high incomes to take out private health insurance, he is opposed to it. He is facing sort of contradiction that Graham Richardson was talking about in an article in the Bulletin earlier this year. When he talks about the premium rises over the last year, it is worth remembering that over the last 13 years Labor had 174 requests for premium rises for private health insurance and they did not refuse one. It is said that the private health incentives aren't coming in until 1 July, but the premium rises show that they are not going to work. The premium rises are more related to the environment that has been set up over the last 13 years; they are more related to the decisions that were made by the previous government. It is worth noting, though, that it appears there is some anticipation of the incentives coming in on 1 July. In the September quarter we saw that the dropout in private health insurance had fallen to 0.1 per cent. Over the last 12 months the dropout has fallen to one per cent, compared with the average two per cent dropout that we saw every year for 13 years under Labor. So it appears that people are anticipating that they will be able to get those incentives from 1 July onwards. If you look at the trend over the last couple of quarters, you see that the rate of dropout has definitely slowed down. When Medicare was established in 1984 it was designed to stand side by side with a strong private health care system. In 1983, when Labor were first elected, 65 per cent of Australians were covered by private health insurance. But by 1996, when Labor lost government, private health cover had fallen to 34 per cent. During the 13 years of Labor, Commonwealth government actions directly contributed to the increases in premiums, which directly contributed to that fallout in coverage with private health insurance. The abolition of the Commonwealth's bed day subsidy for private hospital beds and the removal of the Commonwealth's contribution to the private health reinsurance pool led to an explosion in premiums in 1986-88 of up to 40 per cent. As well as those two struts for private health insurance being removed, Labor changed the Medicare rebate for in-patients from 85 per cent to 75 per cent. In 1993 the the Medicare agreements gave the states every incentive to increase public patient throughput at the expense of private patients, thereby pushing private patients into private hospitals with increased cost to the insurance funds. Access Economics estimates that those four policy decisions contributed 39 per cent to the cost of premiums or added $846 million to the cost of insurance. Without those four decisions, hospital premiums for a family would be $30 a month lower. Putting it another way: on average under Labor premiums rose by about 12 per cent per year. So those four policy decisions contributed to 31,4 years of premium rises over the 13 years of Labor. Some of those premium rises were due to technological change, ageing contributors and higher utilisation, but a lot of it was due to the previous government removing support from the private sector. That rise in costs has set up a vicious cycle whereby the young and healthy assess their own risks and drop out of the funds and the ageing and higher risk people remain in the funds, which contributes to the higher premiums-and so it goes on. Also, as premiums rise, there is a group of people-mainly affluent, but not all-who decide to selfinsure. They decide that, rather than paying their annual premium, if they do fall sick they would still like the access and quality that the private sector affords, but they will pay it out of their own pocket. That is the sort of thing that the previous Prime Minister and the previous health minister used to do-they could. The government's private health incentives will break this vicious cycle by encouraging singles, couples and families on low to moderate incomes, to stay in the funds-the carrot-and making high income earners take out health insurance-the stick. Although you cannot draw too much from one quarter, as I said the September quarter figures show that the haemorrhage from private health insurance has now dropped to a trickle-the drop out being only 0.1 per cent for the quarter compared with the average 0.5 per cent which we have seen over Labor's 13 years. It has been estimated that a two per cent drop in private health cover costs this nation the equivalent of 325,000 bed days. That is the equivalent of two teaching hospitals. The haemorrhaging of members from the funds has put pressure on the public health care system. Five million Australians will be eligible for the incentives offered by the Howard government in last year's budget; in fact, many Australians may not be aware that they will eligible on 1 July to receive the incentives. For example, 700,000 Australians-many of them pensioners or retirees on fixed incomes-holding private health insurance on annual incomes of less than $20,000 will receive those incentives. There is a perception out there from many that because they do not pay tax they will not be eligible for the incentives-but they will receive them. The incentives will be available in full simply by registering with their health fund-by completing a statutory declaration saying that they believe that they are eligible for the incentives. The incentives will be available for those people as cheaper premiums reduced by the equivalent amount of the incentive that would have been paid. So those who do not pay tax will be eligible to receive the incentives. Others will have the choice of receiving the incentives either as a cheaper premium or as a tax rebate. After 1 July a family on a low to moderate income with private health cover will be $450 better off. That will represent a 20 per cent reduction in the average premiums for a family. Paul Keating in the 1993 election campaign said that people did not need private health insurance. That is where he was coming from. He said that Medicare would be enough. It is worth looking back at some of the comments of Graham Richardson. In an article in the Bulletin of 27 August last year, he said: During my time as a cabinet minister in the Hawke and Keating governments, I didn't lose too many battles in cabinet or caucus. As health minister I sponsored a number of measures to stop the drift from private health insurance which was increasing sharply at the time. I steered a package through the cabinet but resigned before I could sell it to the caucus. Practically the whole package died when I left as the Labor Party had always been a bit biased against private health insurance, and without a sponsor any proposal to help the industry was doomed. One idea I had which had no chance of ever being accepted by my caucus or cabinet colleagues was to charge an increased Medicare levy for highincome earners who refused to take out private insurance. I was never comfortable with the thought of wealthy people elbowing battlers out of queues in public hospitals. ""A crisis in public hospitals would occur within 10 years"" was what they used to say three years ago. With public hospitals now unable to provide beds for emergency cases and some people dying because of it, with casualty and emergency wards overflowing and rejecting in some cases as many as 70% of those who come seeking assistance, with bed numbers being cut across the country, there is just a suggestion that the crisis might be looming a little earlier. Despite those concerns, there were those in the party who thought any suggestion that public hospitals were not being adequately funded amounted either to cowardice in being unable to face up to funding cutsI wonder where the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) was during all this timeor treason for daring to suggest anything could be wrong with Medicare. There was also the classic line that if the wealthy paid more than the poor, the concept of ""universality"" within the Medicare system would be torn apart. Everyone has to lose some battles but I wish I had won this one. Now the Liberal Party is putting forward the same idea. Even the thought that the Liberals are prepared to make the rich pay more when the Labor Party would not is enough to scare the hell out of me. The previous government thought that incentives for private health insurance were not necessary. Their response was Carmen Lawrence's managed care legislation. That legislation was introduced in May 1995 and since then we have seen a continuing decline in private health insurance membership. Carmen Lawrence's managed care legislation did not achieve its aim of stemming the haemorrhage from",97
127,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,Mr Nehl}-The member for Fremantle is the way you refer to that lady you are talking about.,99
128,Dr SOUTHCOTT,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The managed care legislation of the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) did not achieve its aim of stemming the haemorrhage from private health cover. It increased the amounts the funds pay out. What we need is to not only encourage young, fit and healthy people back into private health insurance but also keep the people who are already there, the people who have been hanging on-those who are on incomes of $20,000 should just hang in there: the incentives kick in on 1 July-and offer them the greater access, choice and quality available in the private sector. During the 1996 federal election campaign, Graham Richardson also said: Unfortunately, Labor aren't recognising the big problem. It is still a huge problem ... that people are deserting private health insurance at the rate they are. It isn't a problem any of you will worry about tomorrow, but in 10 years time it will be huge. As we all know, Richardson retired three years ago. Labor still has an ideological antagonism to private health insurance. Keating had the big picture but he was blind to the big problem. I support the government's incentives to stem the haemorrhage in private health insurance. I note that the ALP also supports this measure. Debate interrupted. NA",99
129,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being approximately 10.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Flood Works Funds",99
130,Mrs CROSIO,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to bring to the attention of this House a matter that I view very gravely: that is, something like $1.15 million of taxpayers' cheques are missing in this country. I was first notified by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Ronaldson) on 19 February that Minister Sharp had approved a one-off grant to Fairfield City Council under the state government controlled New South Wales flood plain management program for flood mitigation work. The letter failed to say how much money had been granted. On Friday, 21 February my office contacted the parliamentary secretary's office, but I was unable to find out how much money was granted. I then had my office contact the office of Kim Yeadon, the New South Wales Minister for Land and Water Conservation, to find out the amount of money that had been granted. An adviser of Mr Yeadon told my staff member that the sum of $750,000 had been allocated by the federal government to Fairfield City Council for flood works. I then decided to contact Fairfield City Council to confirm that $750,000 was the correct figure. Fairfield City Council expressed complete ignorance of being even offered any cheque. They had heard from sources that some funds may be made available in the future, but they had no idea funds had been officially approved, nor could they confirm that $750,000 was the amount involved. As I said, my staff then contacted Michael Ronaldson's office to confirm that $750,000 was indeed the figure made available. I was told to call back on Monday and that they would be able to tell me then. On Monday we contacted the parliamentary secretary's office on two separate occasions to ascertain whether $750,000 was the figure approved for the grant. Messages were taken both times and no-one returned our calls. Following the failure of the parliamentary secretary's office to return my inquiries, I continued investigations through Kim Yeadon's office in the state of New South Wales. An adviser in Mr Yeadon's office put me onto a staff member in the Department of Land and Water Conservation who was able to confirm that $750,000 was the figure approved by Minister Sharp for flood works by Fairfield City Council, but he offered much more information. The gentleman at the department told my staff member and confirmed in a telephone conversation with me later today that the federal minister had approved five one-off cheques for flood works in New South Wales: one for the Gosford region for the amount $500,000; one for the Parramatta area for amount of $1 million; one for the Wollonthe gong area for the amount of $100,000; one for the Campbelltown region for the sum of $400,000; and the $750,000 for Fairfield Council. Each cheque had been made out to the New South Wales state government, of the five cheques only three have made their way to the relevant department. Two-and I can only put it politely-have gone missing: the cheques for the Fairfield and Campbellexpenses town councils. When I asked how two cheques for a combined total of almost $1.15 million had gone missing, I was told that, instead making the cheques immediately available to the department to allocate to the various local government bodies responsible for carrying out the flood work, the federal minister, John Sharp, had given all five cheques to separate Liberal MPs or senators for them to decide when and where it would suit them to present the cheques. As each cheque was made out to the New South Wales state government, each local government authority, upon the presentation of this cheque by either a Liberal MP or senator, I assume, would then have to send that cheque back to the relevant state depart- grants. ment. Only then would the department be able to make funds available to send back to the council so it could commence its flood work. This goes completely against established practice. As I mentioned earlier, three cheques have so far been returned to the department in New South Wales; two have not. Nor have they been presented to the respective local government authorities responsible for carrying out the flood work. One can only assume that both cheques are still in the possession of two federal Liberal politicians. During the day, someone from the parliamentary secretary's office, whom I do not wish to name but who has been very helpful, finally returned our calls and confirmed that $750,000 was the figure allocated to Fairfield City Council. But he could not say how or when they would ever get their cheque. Where are the two cheques? In relation to of the cheque approved for flood work by the Fairfield City Council-which interests me most as their local federal MP-I understand that the Liberal duty senator responsible for the area is none other than Senator Bob City Woods. Was Senator Woods given the cheque by Minister Sharp to present to Fairfield City yet Council before he encountered problems leading to his resignation? If he is in receipt of the cheque, what has he done with it? Is it a contribution to a fighting fund for his legal perhaps? Where is the cheque meant for flood work in the Campbelltown area? Does the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) have it? When is he going to hand it over? of Has the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) been informed of that situation or was he, like me, kept in the dark? In relation to flood works of this magnitude, it sometimes takes a year following the grant of federal funding before any construction can take place. I believe the minister's tawdry scheme is delaying work which could actually save lives should our areas be affected by severe floods. I find it surprising that this money has even been allocated; we were informed it had stopped in the last budget. It is only after persistent representation that we have finally been able to obtain these one-off I also found it extraordinary-and this is what started my investigation over the last four days-that no amount of money was listed on Mr Ronaldson's correspondence, especially after ringing Fairfield City Council mainly to congratulate them and being told, 'I don't know what you're talking about.' I say to Minister Sharp, to his parliamentary secretary and, most importantly, to this government: it is taxpayers' money that has been approved. Front up with it. Pay up so that council can get on with the job. Weekend Markets: Effect on Small",99
131,Mr TONY SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"Last Friday a husband and wife who have been running a small business for a long, long time in my electorate of Dickson, particularly in the Pine Rivers area, came to see me about the proliferation of Sunday markets and Saturday markets, a matter about which I think there is genuine concern. They have been trading for a long number of years in a pottery business. Business is very difficult and very tight at the moment. Basically, they are making ends meet and that is about all. Through inquiries that they have made in recent times, they have established that businesses like theirs which are trading legitimately from premises are paying due regard to occupational health and safety regulations, workers compensation, rental and all of those things that people in business have to meet. What they have observed from their investigations is that people who are in the market industry, if I can put it that way, do not have those same concerns and do not have those same overheads, pay a minimal charge for occupying a market site and are able, because of the nature of the cash economy on market day, to reap a very healthy reward for their work. There is nothing wrong with that, provided that they observe the taxation regulations in this country. We all know that it is absolutely essential for the people with businesses of that nature-that is, those Sunday market type businesses which are great things for Australians to enjoy, and we do all enjoy them-and carrying out the particular activities which associated with them to also fulfil their responsibilities under the Income Tax Assessment Act. The information from roy constituents who are in this area of small business is that there is little, if any, supervision activities of people in these sorts of market day activities. Also, from their inquiries they have informed me that the sort of income people make from one day in a business similar to theirs is in excess of that which they can take in a week, without the overheads and the attendant costs of wages and so forth that I have mentioned before. Business It is important-and they remind me of this-that, in having some sort of due regard for small business, as my party of course does, we ensure that there is a fair and level playing field for all. Where it is the case that there is this sort of activity going on, we must ensure in my view that there is fair and adequate supervision by the income tax authorities of those carrying out those market day activities. The suggestion that they have made, which I think is a good one, is for everybody who goes into those markets to be required to register, with the form having to be submitted to the taxation authorities. A person who has not registered, who has not provided proof that they are registered, would immediately lose the capacity to trade. They also could be liable to a penalty for trading without having a signed registered form, and a number perhaps to go with it. As well as that, I am told that sometimes you get tourists into these places and that the moment a video camera is produced these people duck for cover. There is obviously a serious situation here. The tax authorities must follow this through. They must ensure that there is a level playing field so that all businesses, particularly businesses like these of my constituents, are able to flourish and trade on a fair and equitable basis. It is important for us to ensure that this situation does not continue in the manner in which it has been existing until now. Essendon Airport",101
132,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to expose the latest furphies, the are four fabulous furphies, being pedalled by the Essendon Airport Chamber of Commerce in their attempt to defend the continued existence of that unsafe and out-of-date airport. The first furphy is: some day we will make of the money. It sounds a bit like the Spectrum song, Some day I'll have money. They say, 'If you leave us there, we're going to tum a profit sooner or later.' If you look at the FAC's latest report, they lost $1.114 million dollars, and that does not even include interest. Going back over the years, I estimate that their losses in interest or their failure to repay interest since 1988 has been $21lh million. Add to that another $$9 million in actual losses, and since 1988 they have lost $30 million. It is laughable. They have a piece of land bigger than Melbourne's CBD and they say, 'Well, let us keep it, we'll only make a small loss.' The second furphy is the air ambulance furphy. The air ambulance provides an important community service. But to say that it has to continue out of Essendon airport is false for a number of reasons. The Victorian air ambulance comprises five to six Titan propeller aircraft operated by Southern Australia Airlines, in tum owned by Qantas, which has all the necessary facilities at Melbourne airport, Tullamarine. Its counterpart in New South Wales, the air ambulance, a larger service, has operated out of Mascot for many years without accident. The air ambulance flights there are given priority, and the Victorian Titan aircraft are compatible with Tullamarine operational requirements. While the New South Wales service has never had an accident at Mascot, a Victorian air ambulance crashed under powerlines on the northern perimeter of Essendon airport back in 1986 killing everyone on board. There are too many ha:r.ards around Essendon airport. which i- a tully built-up residential area. Melbourne airport has a fire and rescue service; Essendon airport (!Pes not. Melbourne airport has a 24-hour contIol tower sen icc , Essendon airport does not. The third furphy is the Tullamaril.,; chaos furphy. To this end, a reckless and bogus experiment was conducted by one of the flying schools a few weeks ago where they said, 'We flew eight light planes into the Tullamarine airport and to land them there was chaos.' If I were to park a semitrailer across the Tullamarine Freeway and use the resultant traffic jam as evidence that Cilylink and tolls would not work, that would be dismissed-and rightly so-as just a stunt. In any event, of the eight aircraft involved, only three, I understand, were suitable types for relocation to Melbourne airport if Essendon were to close-the three twin-engine aircraft. The other five were single-engine aircraft; they were not entitled to push for clearance, as claimed, because they were not RPT aircraft. But, despite that, it appears that six of the eight aircraft did get a landing clearance and landed during the stated period. Those involved in that so-called test run not only attempted disruption at Melbourne airport by inflicting the eight light pistonengine aircraft into the flow of jet traffic during a peak period but also issued grossly misleading press releases to hoodwink the public-and their actions are entirely irresponsible. The fourth furphy is the noise over Essendon furphy and the claim that, if Essendon were to close, that space would become used by the TuIIamarine jets. Melbourne airport's aircraft take off to the south and tum right not because of Essendon airport but because Melbourne airport noise abatement procedures require that they take off over the less populous non-urban areas west and north of the airport. Also, the vast majority of airport takeoffs are headed for destinations west or north of Melbourne, except those heading south to Tasmania or Antarctica. Why on earth is an aircraft going to tum left to the east over densely populated areas for no purpose? So this is a furphy also. Finally. it is disgraceful that Senator MCGauran should say that this is an issue for the Nati(mal Party-'Oh, we've had a had result in Gi·-""!aprl West, so we've got to do something a, . - l our constituency.'

133,Ms GAMBARO,ADJOURNMENT,"Petrie) (10.45 p.m.)Recently a woman was found dead in a house in the Brisbane suburbs. There is nothing unusual about that in itself; people are found dead in their homes every day of the year. The problem in this case is that she had been dead for a whole year. Her neighbours did not know and no-one bothered to check. An elderly woman is sitting on her balcony in Bracken Ridge one day on a beautiful Brisbane sunny day. She waves and smiles to the nice men in their large deli very van. The house next door has an ordinary couple living in it. People come and go all hours of the day and night and there are always lots of visitors. The couple next door have never bothered to introduce themselves to her. 'They must be moving,' she thinks. Not so; they are being robbed of all their worldly possessions and she has just waved to the robbers. Tonight I would like to address the subject of loneliness-a phenomenon, a social conscience or a disease: a mind-set that there is nobody out there to care, no-one out there to call or to talk to. Loneliness can threaten lives and can pull a person out of society to an extent that they are forgotten. In my own electorate of Petrie, I am saddened by people of all ages who talk to me md say that they have not seen their familiefor years. Older people worry why their chi dren or grandchildren will not call them (.' visit them. I have heard stories of doctors' w;: ""rooms filled with lonely people who ju., want someone to talk to. The old trip to the corner store where everyone knew your name is long gone. People now go to large, impersonal supermarkets where they arc just a ',tatistic or thcy arc p.:l'asured as part of sh p f1r; 'g centre tnffic !low, S:udents are graduating from our schools without any real social skills. There are some people out there who think that talking to the (>Ider generation is a waste of time. I visited nursing homes long before I became a federal member. I would often ask the residents how often they were visited by their families. 'Christmas and my birthday' was the common Loneliness response. Two visits a year from family and they thought that was really terrific. How sad it is that society has deteriorated to this point. I mourn the loss of the extended family and the wonderful qualities that younger generations are missing from not mixing with our elders. We are building those fences higher and higher around us-barriers to the outside world where communication channels are being siphoned. Our society is changing. The socialisation of computers, the Internet and technology are keeping our children indoors far longer these days. It is absolutely astounding the number of people who spend hours speaking to someone on the other side of the world through the computer screen just because they are lonely at home. Love on the Internet has become the superhighway reality, which has brought its own social consequences. The Courier-Mail on Saturday, 22 February reported that a Roy Morgan study of 700 students at Victoria's University of Technology found that, while students look forward to having fun and socialising at university, most of them found campus life depressing and lonely and did not make any real significant friendships. Families these days are being challenged more and more. Marriage breakups, lone parents, youth homelessness and suicide are increasing in our neighbourhoods and our streets. More people these day, arc choosing not to marry. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, nearly 10 per (2nt of men and 12 per cent of women are liVing alone. Not onI is this having SOCial consequen l-S l,::t ;. "" having consequences on our econom; , ho"" ing and residential patterns. Even food retailers are catering more and more to that singles market. pacLlging everything from the sandwiches to lasagne in a tasty meal for one', A consultative committee on ageing recen' Iy produced a discussion paper. It indicated that people who lived alone spent 80 per cent of their time by themselves. It alsp indicated that the average time spent alone increases as we grow older. Although people recognise the value of social contacts, they elect to be independent. What we are seeing here effectively is the whole role of the family as we know it being turned upside down. Areas such as home and community care and those who volunteer their time to visit older people must be supported and congratulated for what often is quite a thankless task. I believe there is a real challenge out there not only for the people of Petrie but for all Australians. Speak to your neighbours. Go out of your way to be part of your community. Keep in touch with family and friends. Break down those barriers which are becoming quite often the schisms in our society. GK Tucker Settlement Assistance for Carers",103
134,Mr WILTON,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to express my concern for some 200 elderly people who reside in the GK Tucker Settlement run by the Brotherhood of St Laurence in the heart of my electorate of Isaacs. The GK Tucker Settlement has been run by the brotherhood for some 61 years and it provides accommodation for some 200 elderly people of lower income status. As an expression of my desire to ameliorate their plight and their fears in regard to nursing home charges, I implore the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) to again rethink the government's decision in this regard. The Director of Community Services at the GK Tucker Settlement, Ms Lesley Dredge, believes 'a rise in entry contributions to the settlement will impact on low income people and only people with means will be able to buy their way back into the settlement'. She said, 'It's really moving back to a system that supports people who have their own means.' The GK Tucker Settlement, one of the first retirement villages in Australia, provides lIldepcndent housing in a community atmos.lhcrc for finallcially disadvantaged elderly .lCOple. There is a hostel on the premises, Yhich provides some 50 beds for frail people and has always been subsidised by the federal ,!overnment. Currently, 86 per cent of the residents are deemed low income, but Ms Dredge has said, 'We'll move to 100 per cent financially disadvantaged as soon as we are able.' Ms Dredge said that the settlement was one of the last of its kind in Australia and she is concerned that the low income elderly people will not have access to those levels. Mr Ben Bennett, who has been a resident of the settlement for eight years, said that there is security there and residents are kept acti ve, safe and secure in the environment that the settlement nurtures and provides. Mr Bennett said that he feels useful and it is like a family environment at the settlement. Mr Bennett has recently published a book about the settlement, providing an historical record of the years between 1935 and 1995. In the limited time available, there is a second matter that I wish to draw to the attention of the Minister for Family Services. It concerns a constituent who recently approached me on Saturday morning at one of my mobile offices at a local shopping centre. She drew my attention to her plight. She and her husband are caring for her 79-year-old disabled mother at home. Her mother is rated as a nursing home No.5 classification, which is the most serious in terms of needing care and continuous attention. The aged lady in question was recently released from hospital. Her daughter and sonin-law were faced with the option of either placing her in a government subsidised nursing home or caring for her at their own home. For a range of reasons, including that the lady in question retains all her faculties, it was decided that she be cared for at home. Clearly the federal government benefits from this decision, as it is not forced to subsidise yet another nursing home occupant in a nursing home environment. Despite the fact that the carers receive the domiciliary nursing care benefit of $57.10 per fortnight-which helps to offset the cost of linkage care payments-a significant range of costs continues to be incurred by the carers. They are normally ineligible for anything other than assistance of that kind; that is, the domiciliary nursing care benefit of $57.10 per fortnight. I request that, in light of the fact that such carers are saving the federal government money, the minister investigates the possibility of introducing an allowance for carers in this difficult situation. I have written to the minister to that effect. Ozanam House",104
135,Mr ENTSCH,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to bring to the attention of the House the wonderful contribution to my community of Cairns by the St Vincent's community services and, in particular, Ozanam House. Ozanam House was established over 40 years ago and caters for the needs of the poor and destitute in the Cairns community through the provision of services which include a meals service, temporary drop-in centre, 10 beds for short-term accommodation for single men, four units for crisis accommodation for families, outreach support and emergency relief. At this point I would like to pay special tribute to the Manager of Ozanam House, Ann de Loryn, and a cook, Louise Maull. Both have given over 10 years of service to this most worthy organisation. Given the challenges and dramas and human misery they are forced to confront on a daily basis, I commend them. Their strength of character and goodwill have given much to the Cairns community. I will give the House an indication of the magnitude of the services provided by Ozanam House. In the 1995-96 year, there were 50,122 meals served, 25,000 clients accessed their drop-in centre and shower and bathroom facilities,S, 100 obtained emergency relief assistance, 51 men were accommodated for an average stay of 12 weeks-of which 18 were referred from prisons or psychiatric units-and 59 individuals accessed the emergency accommodation with an average stay of 10 weeks. Many of these were from domestic violence situations. This massive workload has been increasing annually at an alarming rate without anywhere near a reasonable proportional increase in resources. Until the beginning of this year, St Vincent's community services was funded to employ 4.5 persons, and they had to rely heavily on 27 volunteers-none of whom are professionally qualified to deal with this crisis situation, to carry out this magnificent work. Since the beginning of this year, the demands on the centre have continued to grow. In the past three months, 12,808 meals have been provided, 4,290 have accessed the dropin centre and shower facilities, 28 men and five families have accessed crisis accommodation and 1,056 people have been assisted with emergency relief. Many of the clientele have major alcohol and drug abuse problems, while many others suffer from serious mental conditionsvictims of previous governments' policies to deinstitutionalise mental health patients without providing adequate safety nets within the broader community. It is a sad indictment of our present society. It is little wonder, given these facts, that the number of serious incidents requiring police and ambulance attention is continuing to escalate. In the past three months, the lives of volunteers and staff have been threatened on numerous occasions. They have had two drug and alcohol related epileptic seizures, six serious incidents of medical complications through drug and alcohol abuse, one attempted suicide and, sadly, recently one successful suicide. As a result, the volunteer levels have now been reduced to 13. Many of them are, in fact, clients of Ozanam House and their degree of assistance is not dependable. Sadly, St Vincent's community services is now faced with having to drastically reduce provision of services in an effort to survive. I was pleased today to hear that the Queensland government has offered some relief in the form of a grant of $17,000 to St Vincent's for their weekend meals to continue, br', this is not enough. We as a government kve an obligation to look after those less fortunate in our community. What is needed urgently at Ozanam House is additional resources, in particular for qualified people, as this is far too great an imposition on charity workers. I therefore plead with my government to acknowledge the desperate situation currently facing Ozanam House and request that additional resources be made available immediately to ensure the long-term future of this worthy establishment. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.59 p.m. NA The following notices were given: Mr Moore to present a bill for an Act the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation 1991.

The reference to the MUA, and its alleged compensation situation, disturbs me. It is reached an historic agreement that modified government and current Minister for Transport been so critical. Our former government was also the minister was very quick to leap up and say, have only been in office a few months and Of course, the reality is that the minister the work of BHP and the MU A that produced Tuesday, 25 February 1997 there that the MUA was attacked for having rorts or to fulfil its promise. and unfair position to adopt. It is true that have taken some time and have not born fruit to tango in these situations. To be fair to both is very easy to say about one individual, That is this person should not be getting whatever.' It is hard to draw a line which has person does not get compensation while, at the off a number of people who should get difficulties that exist. I am still hopeful there, they will be addressed by cooperation. I do not think this has been sufficiently mentioned in passing-is that life at sea is represented injured workers in the building and workers in the manufacturing and metal of the injuries, the nature of the risks and the in their employment, in spite of the major that have occurred, are still very much those other very dangerous industries I have the port of Melbourne having a look around and Isn't it nice,' is very different when it is out over the decks and there is very heavy equipment The compensation issues are certainly serious injuries do happen and there are very dangerous activity. I think it is important that has with respect to the Maritime Union not an unjust description from the member me about this attitude is that it actually some worthwhile achievements in these areas. of more sophisticated options where it non-activity or inactivity with respect to the worth noting that BHP and the Maritime Union the trans-Tasman agreement, of which the current and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) have critical of it. When that agreement occurred, 'Look what we've done; isn't it fantastic. We already we've reformed the trans-Tasman.' had virtually nothing to do with it. It was really that agreement. The minister was there to run NA Tuesday, 25 February 1997 on the ground and grab the premiership cup is something that the government should learn in these difficult circumstances to reach agreement. that are reached is not a good way to go about it. Finally, and this applies right across the narrow perspective with respect to transport Transport is a cost on other industries and that minister, who obviously has a close affinity of miners and farmers, that is an understandable attitude. What it fails to acknowledge is that substantial exporters. Qantas exports an enormous amount Qantas. It is our third biggest single exporter. flag shipping industry, we would have a substantial We have a situation where these sorts of jobs-for many thousands of Australians. I think efficiency, costs to other industries and the a minute-that we do not lose sight of the fact our economy. I would urge the government, industry, to keep all of those things in I hope that the government intends to compensation and rehabilitation legislation modernised a very antiquated and outdated tonight is, I think, another stage in finetuning not properly addressed at that time.",110
