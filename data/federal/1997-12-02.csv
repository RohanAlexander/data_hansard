2,Mr MCLACHLAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-Today I am releasing the unclassified version of a strategic review endorsed by the government entitled Australia's Strategic Policy. In light of the review's findings, I am also announcing initiatives to develop or enhance key military capabilities. Soon after coming to office I asked the Defence organisation to conduct a classified review of our strategic circumstances and the military capability decisions arising from that assessment to shape the Australian Defence Force to 2020 and beyond. Australian governments have regularly conducted such high level reviews, the most recent one being in 1993, which contributed to the previous government's 1994 Defence white paper. As would be expected in the Defence policy area, this review is an evolutionary document both in the way it assesses regional trends and in the proposals put forward for force development. I expect this evolution of strategic thinking will continue. Key policy areas That said, Australia's Strategic Policy details a number of highly important policy differences. Unlike previous strategic reviews, this document takes a crucial step beyond simply describing our strategic environment to detailing a rigorous set of priorities for force development. The review details a maritime focus for the defence of Australia and its vital interests, and a approach to Defence equipment acquisition. It moves Defence policy away from a narrow focus on responding to low-level contingency scenarios. It stresses instead our capacity to defend Australia in a wide range of circumstances by focusing on our maritime approaches. Further, the document outlines a policy supporting an enhanced level of strategic cooperation with Asia-Pacific countries. It recognises more clearly than past reviews the inextricable link between Australia's security and the security of our region. Finally, the review places a heavy emphasis on the Defence For<,:e's teGhnological skills. This document directs the ADF to the forefront of the revoll.ltion in military affairs. This is essential, given the general increase in military capabilities in the Asia-Pacific. The challenge ahead The strategic review was not an exercise in hunting for threats. It identifies no immediate threat to Australia. It confirms that Australia is one of the more secure countries in the world. But defence planning is about the long term. The review analyses the potential for developmepts to, cause security problems in the future, unlike our largely benign environment today. ' In the past Australia benefited from being the most developed economy in our region, holding the most advanced military equipment and weapons. In some defence areas, that is no longer the case. To stay confident in our ability to defend 'Au$tralia, we must be mo.re efficient and smarter in using resources. Develo.pments in techno.Io.gy are wo.rking to our advantage. They are giving a greater capacity to. watch our maritime approaches and offer high precision in the way we apply force in those approaches. A secure country in a secure region The focus of our policy remains on o.ur ability to defend Australia. Australia's strategic interests do not begin and end at o.ur shoreline.· It woyld be a serious mistake to think we could adopt a 'fortress Australia' strategy in the event of a deterioration of regional stabIlity. We cannot be secure in an logical, structured insecure region. In the 1980s our predecessors argued that forces developed for the defence of Australia might also be called upon to operate beyond our shores to protect regional and global strategic interests. Indeed, the Labor government with coalition backing authorised a number of these deployments to the Gulf War, as well as peacekeeping in Somalia and Cambodia. But Labor's 1994 Defence white paper did not recognise how changing strategic circumstances were changing the levels of demand which could be put on our forces in such operations. We can no longer assume that forces able to meet low-level contingencies in the defence of Australia will be sufficient to handle conflict beyond our territory. We must make sure that the forces we develop for our own defence do indeed give options for handling crises in which vital interests may be threatened. Wherever they are called to operate, our forces must have capacity to survive against-and defeatmodem weapons. Such weapons are being acquired in our region and will become standard capabilities for regional armed forces. The government, therefore, rejects the argument that we must choose between a defence force to defend Australia and one able within realistic limitations to operate overseas. The Defence Force must be able to do both. The issue Austrplia faces is how to build a defence force able to ensure the security of the country and able to contribute to the security of our region. So the review concludes that, while the core of our planning will be on the capabilities needed to defeat attacks on Australia, we will choose capabilities suited to a wider range of tasks. Our aim is to promote a secure country in a secure region. We will not deploy forces ill-equipped for the task. We want to avoid last minute scrambles to bring our forces up to scratch. This review sets Defence on a path exploiting our national strengths-our high education standards, our scientific and research base, access to technology through the US alliance and our proven ability to perform in tough military situations. Impact of regional economic growth Let me address in detail some of the issues covered in the strategic review. Two key factors are shaping Australia's strategic environment; East Asian economic growth and its implications for arms modernisation programs and the changing strategic relativities between the region's major powers. To quote the foreign and trade policy paper, In the National Interest, changing 'relativities of power and influence which flow from the economic rise of East Asia will profoundly influence Australia's foreign and trade policy over the next fifteen years'. Notwithstanding the recent currency crisis in some regional countries, that long-term judgment holds. Even if there is only moderate economic growth, if defence spending is constant as a proportion of GDP, some regional countries could have doubled defence spending by the 2010. Regional defence spending is not a threat to Australia. Countries have a legitimate right to modernise their forces. However, that military modernisation, in the event of conflict, could have an impact on its scale and intensity. That leads me to the second key factor shaping our security environmentchanging strategic relativities. Changing strategic relativities In the 1970s and 1980s, we defined our region of primary strategic interest as South East Asia, the South-West Pacific and the eastern reaches of the Indian Ocean. Today, tensions in North-East Asia-for example, on the Korean peninsula-have flow-on effects in South-East Asia much more directly than was the case in the 1970s and 1980s. We cannot allow our thinking to be influenced by artificial boundaries. This strategic review reemphasises the importance of North-East Asia to our own security. A key issue is the prospect of increased strategic competition between the region's major powers. The end of the Cold War and economic growth has changed the strategic balance in Asia. Underlying any consideration our of changing relativities is the role of the United States. A continuing US strategic engagement and presence in East Asia is vital to regional security. China is emerging as a powerful economic force in our region, with a desire to play a more influential role; We do not see China as a threat to Australia. We and the region want China to be outward looking, prosperous and cohesive-helping to build a stable and cooperative Asia-Pacific. The relationship between the United States and China will be fundamental to stability in the future. The good management of that relationship is essential. We welcome the recent commitment to developing a strategic partnership by President Clinton and President Jiang Zemin. Strategic policy fundamentals The strategic review does not attempt to predict future military conflicts. Rather, it assesses the enduring features of our strategic environment and the long-term trends likely to affect that environment. The review articulates our key strategic interests as follows: avoiding destabilising strategic competition between the region's major powers, preventing the emergence of a region dominated by any power or powers who . might wish to damage Australia's interests, keeping South-East Asia-especially, maritime South-East Asia-free from destabilising disputes, working with neighbours to strengthen their security, thereby preventing the intrusion foreign military forces which might attack Australia, and preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in our region. Naturally, these priorities must be kept under constant scrutiny and be re-evaluated in the light of strategic developments. We consider that there are three basic tasks which the ADF could be required to perform: defeating attacks on Australia, defending our regional interests, and supporting a global security environment which discourages interstate aggression. Our highest priority remains defeating attacks on Australia. Policy imperatives Possessing the forces we need to defeat any realistic scale of attack on our territory is basis of our wider defence posture. Maintaining this level of military capability is very relevant to how we are perceived by our neighbours and allies. We aim to be self reliant in defending our territory, without relying on the combat forces of other countries. But there will be continued close contact with allies for non-combat support, including intelligence and resupply in a crisis. A potential aggressor would have to cross our air and sea approaches and, having launched an attack, sustain their forces across this gap. Our strategic geography dictates that we should plan to defeat attackers in those approaches, before they reach our territory. New strategies In recent years, Australian defence planning placed too much emphasis on reactive operations-especially what have been called 'low-level contingencies'. Relying on reactive options runs the risk that any crisis would be prolonged. They place little pressure on an adversary to cease attacking or threatening Australia, and concede the initiative to an adversary over the pace and duration of the crisis. Pro-active operations in the defence of of Australia could enable us to take the military initiative, put pressure on an adversary to cease hostilities and provide confidence that Australian lives and property would be protected. In defending Australia, pro-active military operations targeted against an aggressor's forces in our maritime approaches would seek to pressure those forces before they were able to lodge on our territory. This approach recognises the fact that Australia would have already suffered a major strategic blow if it ever became necessary to fight an attacker on our own soil. In reviewing our military strategy for defeating attacks on Australia, the government will, therefore, give higher priority to maritime forces-that is, air and naval forces able to operate in our northern sea approaches. Moreover, the key future technologies for maritime operations involve enhanced surveillance and information gathering capabilities, the as well as the ability to command and control military forces engaged in operations. These technologies are elements of 'knowledge warfare' , an area where Australia has significant national potential, which we will seek to maximise as a national strategic priority. Relations with friends and allies We have also reviewed our priorities for our international security and defence relationships. Our alliance with the United States is our most important strategic relationship. Longstanding defence links with most of the countries in South-East Asia and the South-West Pacific also lay the foundation for further cooperation. We are working to develop a shared commitment to regional peace and stability among as many Asia-Pacific states as possible. But while our ties with our neighbours in South East Asia and the South-West Pacific are of enormous strategic importance, the fact is that the region's strategic centre of gravity is North-East Asia. So we are increasing our links with NorthEast Asia, particularly with Japan and China. We share many strategic interests with Japan and have already instituted regular political military talks, complemented by modest military-to-military links such as intelligence exchanges. We have also an increasing dialogue with China and evolving defence contacts. Multilateral structures such as APEC and the ASEAN Regional Forum, ARF, are a useful complement to bilateral ties, providing a very valuable forum for security dialogue. Capability implications In terms of military capability implications, a key issue is the benchmark against which we measure our own capabilities. The acquisition of high-technology defence capabilities throughout the Asia-Pacific means we cannot take for granted that our forces will keep their technological edge. To maintain our relative strategic position, our forces must measure up to two key benchmarks: first, we must have the capability to deny our air and sea approaches to any credible force, and second, we must maintain a very strong regional presence as a maritime power. The discipline this imposes on how we shape our forces leads to some tough policy choices. These involve making decisions on the balance of resource allocations between land, air and naval forces; between current preparedness and future capability; between the scale of forces immediately deployable and the time they can be kept in the field. Few countries, however, have as clear-cut a strategic focus as Australia when it comes to making these choices. Our geography dictates a maritime focus for defence. One of the most important outcomes of this review is that we have followed through the logic of our own strategic analysis. Priority one: the knowledge edge I said earlier that this review puts the Defence Force at the forefront of the revolution in military affairs. That is because our highest capability priority is the 'knowledge edge' - exploiting information technology so that we can use our relatively small forces to maximum effect. We are giving priority to investments in three elements of the knowledge edge-intelligence, command systems and surveillance. It is a major challenge to integrate these elements into a unified system giving commanders a complete picture of the battlefield, and enhancing their control of our forces-and doing that in real time, 24 hours a day. The knowledge edge is the area which, more than any other capability, can be the decisive factor in combat, especially when it is combined with the high capabilities of our defence personnel. The government has approved a number of projects to enhance ADF knowledge edge capabilities, including: airborne early warning and control aircraft, enhanced satellite communications, an advanced secure military messaging system, an Army battlefield command support system, and an automated command support system for joint operations. Priority two: maritime capabilities Our second priority relates to developing military capabilities to defeat threats in our maritime approaches. We are developing a mix of air, surface and sub-surface forces to create a formidable barrier to any hostile ships and aircraft in our maritime approaches. Air superiority is a decisive capability. Australia faces a difficult set of choices over the next decade about our future fighter aircraft capabilities. My department is examining options on the balance of emphasis we should put between upgrading the sensors and combat systems of the FAlS and acquiring new aircraft. It is likely that a major upgrade of the FAlS will be required-whatever the outcome of these studies-as an interim step in modernising our air capabilities. These decisions are for a later day-and, I might add, a later budget context. We are also looking at upgrading our air-toshort-range air refuelling capability. As foreshadowed in the last budget, we will upgrade the survivability, maintenance and habitability of our guided missile frigates. That includes upgrading their radar systems, communications equipment, anti-submarine and mineavoidance sonars and an improved defensive missile system. We will enhance the surface strike and underwater defence capabilities of our ANZAC ships, including the acquisition of anti-ship missiles for the ANZAC's new helicopters. We plan to expand and enhance our submarine capabilities, including by the acquisition of more capable torpedoes and a mining capability. And we will begin work on enhancing the current Collins class design to provide data to guide decisIon making on future enhancements of the class, or the possible acquisition of additional submarines should that be deemed necessary. This process will build on the strengths of the Collins, taking full advantage of new technological developments. We have a continuing requirement to conduct patrol and enforcement operations now carried out by the Fremantle class patrol boats. The offshore patrol vessel had originaltives, ly been designated for these tasks. Following Malaysia's decision not to award its OPV contract to Tenix, our judgment is that the scale of investment required only OPV is not appropriate for the performance of primarily peacetime patrol tasks. We will extend the life of the Fremantle class boats for as long as economical, followed by replacement with a boat for similar purposes. Priority three: strike capability Our third priority is strike, that is, the ability to operate proactively against enemy forces in the defence of Australia and our interests. Our plan is to maintain the FIll in service until 2015 to 2020; to expand the operational fleet by upgrading our existing F111Gs; and to acquire long-range stand-off weapons as well as improving the electronic warfare and air-defence suppression capabilities of the FIlls. By stand-off weapons, we mean something with greater range than the weapons already being acquired. But we are not proposing very long-range weapons, such as the Tomahawk land attack cruise missile. We do not require this weapon to meet current strategic circumstances. Priority four: defeating threats on Australian territory Our fourth priority is land capabilities to defeat threats on Australian territory. Our priorities are to develop: highly-mobile joint task forces; a limited amphibious capability; improved land surveillance equipment; aerial fire support and reconnaissance helicopters additional light armoured vehicles for reconnaissance and troop lift, and; special force elements will receive added attention to improve counter-terrorist and other capabilities. Land forces remain an essential part of our military capability. Indeed, this government has given a great deal of attention to the restructuring of the Army following the critical Defence self-assessment of capabilities in the Army 21 review. Army capabilities will therefore increase as a result of these initiawith the land force taking a larger share of the capital equipment budget than in recent years. for an AustralianPriority focus Together, the enhanced military capabilities I have outlined-and the rigorous set of priorities against which they have been developed-will give us the most modem, capable force in our immediate region. This force relies on highly skilled personnel using high technology and modern equipment to achieve mobility, hitting power and flexibility, exploiting information technology to attain maximum effect from relatively small forces. These initiatives will bring a comprehensive enhancement of the military capabilities of the ADF over the coming decade, enabling the force to meet the key benchmarks I mentioned earlier. We will upgrade all our major combat ships and aircraft, restructure and re-equip the land force and invest heavily in technology to promote the knowledge edge. Of course, such capabilities don't come cheaply. Over recent years, we have spent Some $2.2 billion annually on investment in new equipment. The defence reform program will, over the next three years, realise a oneoff saving of $500 million and mature annual savings of between $900 and $1,000 million. Current defence spending levels will allow us-with the savings from the reform program-to substantially modernise our existing defence platforms like the surface fleet, to acquire airborne early-warning aircraft and to give the Army greater mobility. However, the current budget does not make it possible for us in the medium term to contemplate developing major new capabilities in the form of new fighter aircraft, or a new surface combatant should government decide that such acquisitions were needed. In determining the need for future equipment capabilities and levels of spending, the government will monitor developments in Australia's strategic circumstances as well as the Defence organisation's progress in implementing the reform program. Conclusions . Australia is one of the more secure countries in the world. But that has not always been the case. Circumstances could arise which would reduce our security from armed attack. While we do not expect those circumstances to occur, strategic policy-in developing assessments of our future environmentneeds to take a long view. In taking this long view, we recognise that the ADF is the guarantor of Australia's sovereignty. We have a natural advantage in the strengths and abilities of the young people who join the ADF. This review ensures that these people will be equipped and trained in the best way possible. Australia IS Strategic Policy provides the planning, ensuring that the Defence Force is capable of meeting this most fundamental of challenges. I present the following papers: Australia's Strategic Policy-Report and Ministerial Statement, 2 December 1997.",13
3,Mr BEVIS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"-'-by leave-Much of the content contained in the strategic review analysis 1997 the opposition would agree with. Given that the parameters are clearly those adopted by the former Labor government, that is not surprising. I want to make refer.ence to a number of aspects of the timing of this document and some related issues before I get into the detail of the strategic review itself. The timing of the presentation of this statement is quite significant. It comes after some 18 months in office of this government. It comes after massive restructure and dislocation of the defence forces without any plan as to what the task was that Australia's security required. In fact, it is this document that provides those parameters and that guidance. It is akin to somebody deciding to select the instruments for an orchestra and then, having picked out the instruments, finding out what it is they have to play with those instruments. That is the process that this government has followed in putting the cart before the horse. It is a point that I have made in a number of other debates. Given the time constraints, I do not propose to go into it in great detail here. Nevertheless, it is a fundamental weakness in the defence posture of this government which, belatedly, is now being rectified by the announcement of the strategic review 1997. This document should have been before the parliament 12 months ago. In fact, 12 months ago we were told that we would get this document some time this year. By the middle of this year we were told, without a document having materialised, that it would be presented in the spring session of parliament. Minister, you havejust made it. The originally scheduled sitting dates for this parliament concluded last Friday. This is the additional week of sitting to tidy up outstanding business. Having given an undertaken to get it into parliament this year in the spring session, you have made it by two days. You have to wonder about the timing of this document-not so much what caused the delay. Although I could speculate on that, I will not. If this were a document that the government was on top of and was proud of, why would you try to bury it? Why would you introduce it into the parliament two days before the parliament gets up, at a time when the parliament and the public are clearly focused on debating Wik, when it is so close to Christmas that public attention is on everything else but this issue? You have presented this document. in parliament in the last couple of days in the hope of burying it so that it avoids any serious scrutiny-and you do it on a day when the attention of most people in Canberra is on something else; a cricket match just down the road at Manuka. I would have thought the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan), as a former cricketer, would not have picked this hour to make his statement. He has had 12 months to do this. Even if you say that he has had only the last six months to do it, he has picked the one hour that clashes with the Prime Minister's cricket match. I wonder about. the minister's judgment on that. Over the last few days as this has drawn closer, and as everyone expected there had to be an announcement before the end of the year, there have been the customary leaks. The leak that I thought was most revealing was the one that appeared in today's Canberra Times in the Ian MCPhedran article: Despite the security benefits of globalisation, Asia-Pacific region faces a number of military uncertainties . . . So far so good. I have to say that it is fairly reminiscent of a speech I recently re-read of the former Minister for Defence, Robert Ray, when he introduced the strategic review 1993. The startling thing about that statement is that it was not made by the defence minister; it was made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer. Let me repeat that statement. The foreign minister said yesterday: . Despite the security benefits of globalisation, the Asia-Pacific region faces a number of military uncertainties . . . Minister, there is one thing that concerns me more than the handling of the defence portfolio that you and your junior minister portray: that is, the prospect of the foreign minister trying to handle it. The sooner the defence debate is back in the hands of the defence department and the Minister for Defence, the better. There is, however, some comfort to be taken from the fact that strategic review 1997 follows the basis of Defending Australia 1994-the white paper of the previous government-and the former strategic review of 1993 put out by the former government. It is pleasing because it means the minister has drawn back from some of his more cavalier, adventurous and ill-informed statements that he was prone to make during the last 12 to 18 months. That is a characteristic for which he has become somewhat famous or infamous. I guess the summation of that was fairly well put by his friendly journalist, Brian Toohey, in the Australian Financial Review in June of this year, when Brian Toohey said in his article: For MCLachlan, no danger can be overlooked, no response ruled out, no matter how remote from Australian shores. At least, that is the message when he speaks in public without a formal text But there is another MCLachlan, the one who reads out more restrained, officially prepared statements. The upshot is that an already complicated policy making task has become even more difficult. I have to say that I am pleased to see that the more balanced, restrained, officially prepared the statements have surfaced in the official document released today and in the minister's statement to the parliament. Those documents, though, do bear a serious resemblance to the work of the former government. I think it is worth just reading a couple of sections to identify the comparison and, thankfully, to recognise the tum in attitude of the Minister for Defence over the course of the last few months as he has had to come to sign off on this critical document. In his foreword to the strategic review, he says: The security of Australia is, and should always remain, the paramount concern of our national strategic policy ... But obviously, developments in our region determine the possibility of Australia coming under military threat. And, of course, it does. In Defending Australia, the white paper from 1994, the former government said: Our highest Defence priority is therefore to build, maintain and support forces for the defence of Australia. It went on and said: Our approach to the defence of Australia emphasises understanding our strategic environment and guarding our sea and air approaches. It requires capabilities which can deny our approaches to an adversary, as well as capabilities to defeat incursions onto our territory. It therefore goes beyond our shores to include a range of direct interests which are important to our defence. There are clear similarities between the two documents. One of the characteristics that has marked the efforts of the Minister for Defence during the Howard government's period in office is that he has taken every opportunity to try to distinguish himself from what was a very good record under the former government, under former Ministers Ray and Beazley, for a long period of time. Last year he endeavoured to distinguish himself and his government quite desperately by referring to a 'different level of contact and association' with the Americans as part of our defence and security arrangements. That of course was a nonsense, and no serious commentator took a different view. I might say that the Americans certainly did not take a different view, and that is a view made plain by the Americans themselves. Here today we have the same rhetoric being peddled by the minister in an effort to lay some distinguishing marks on our strategic analysis that he would claim as his or the Howard government's. Probably the area in which he sought to do that the most-apart from talking about the former policy being confined to our shores, which clearly it was not, given the extract I have just read from the 1994 white paper-was when he made some comment about a difference in attitude as to low level contingencies. The minister might be forgiven for this because he came to the portfolio without any background involvement in defence and, therefore, may not have read the 1986 or 1987 papers-or maybe he did not read the 1993 and 1994 papers. But, had he read those papers, he would know that the 1987 paper of the former Labor government said that it envisages escalation, including: ... use of our strike and interdiction capabilities including the conduct of operations against a base that an adversary was using for his attacks on us and against his infrastructure. That is page 31 of the 1987 white paper, Minister. The simple fact of life is that your efforts today to distinguish your policy from that of the former government are a fairly flimsy attempt to wrap yourself in some kudos which you and this government do not deserve when it comes to defence strategic thinking. I just want to make that clear for those who get the opportunity to read the document, although it was not mentioned in the minister's speech. I will mention quickly a couple of the comments that were made in the former strategic review. I guess most notably there is the question of Korea, which has been distinguished by the minister in his statements-a subject. I want to come back to. In the 1993 white paper, without the benefit of information of the last four years, the former government said: Key uncertainties in North-East Asia over the decade include the relationship between Japan and China and the prospect of a reunified Korea. A unified Korea is a clear possibility over the next decade and would constitute a new and dynamic element in the North-East Asian strategic environment, which may have complex consequences for the strategic balance in the region.",18
4,Mr CADMAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,It's true.,20
5,Mr BEVIS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"As the parliamentary secretary kindly interrupts, it was true-and that was the statement made by the former Labor government. The point I am making very clearly is that, try as he might to distinguish his policy announcement today as some new direction, nonetheless it is the case that it is quite properly a reiteration of the basic principles identified by the former Labor government under two former distinguished ministers. And it is something of a pity that the minister could not bring himself to acknowledge any of that. If time permitted, I would quite happily read into the Hansard relevant sections dealing with China, South-East Asia and our partnership arrangements in the region. But given the limitations of time, I will not do that. I tum now to some of the specific measures that were contained in the minister's statement and in the document that he has released today. The minister has correctly referred the need for a proactive role in our maritime approaches. In his speech he said: In defending Australia, proactive military ations targeted against an aggressor's forces in our maritime approaches, would seek to pressure those forces before they were able to lodge on our territory. That is absolutely correct. Minister, that precisely why you should be giving a comtable. mitment to acquire Collins submarines 7 and 8; that is precisely the role which they would play. It is a proactive military operation targeted at an aggressor's forces cult for an aggressor to counter or to doubleguess. It is that role which the Collins submathere rines have demonstrated they are able to do, and do very well. The statement, of course, gives no commitment to doing that. In fact, the statement made by the minister said that they were looking at future enhancements 'or the possible acquisition of additional submavessel rines should that be deemed necessary' - two qualifications in the one paragraph on whether or not they want to go ahead with submarines 7 and 8. Yet, a few pages earlier, they are saying how important it is to ensure that are able to command the sea-air gap and how important it is that we are able to ensure aggressor's thoughts could not our capabilities-precisely what submarines 7 and 8 are about, Minister. The pity of it is that, as each month goes by, the unit cost of submarines 7 and 8 inches up. The time lines for the government to make a decision are fast running out, and the minister is aware of this. The statement strategic review released today might have been appropriate if the paper had been printed last year. But it was not; it was printed at the end of 1997. If a decision on submarines 7 and 8 is not taken by this government in the course of the next few months, then that will ensure the unit cost is dramatically higher. Also, if we wait much into 1998 before taking a decision, what we will see is a degradation of the skills in Australian shipbuilding and in rnanagement to the point where we will have to pay money to reacquire the skills that exist today. There is no efficiency of operation in doing that. to The ambiguous statements given by the minister on the Collins class submarines will give no comfort whatsoever to those strategists who believe, as the opposition does, operthat that is a very important acquisition. I notice that the minister's statement to the House also makes reference to offshore patrol vessels. I simply reiterate that the demise of is the offshore patrol vessel program is regretThat it was stabbed in the back is an absolute disgrace. The extent to which the life of Fremantle class boats is able to be extended is very doubtful if they are to do the job that is diffirequired of them. I take it {rom the minister's comments that is an intention to extend the life of the Fremantles beyond that which was previously anticipated. I simply say that that is a pretty ambitious goal if we are going to expect the Fremantle class boats to do the job they are required to do. Given that the offshore 'patrol program was scuttled from within the government, as much as by anything outside of the country, it is important for the government to accept some responsibility for a replacement craft, and it should be sooner we rather than later. The prospect of extending the Fremantles' operational life and expecting an them to do the role required is asking a lotdouble-guess probably too much. I tum to some aspects of the document that I think are important. Emphasis on the knowledge edge, referred to by the minister, clearly has a bipartisan view, and it is a view that ran through previous strategic reviews and white papers. Things such as airborne early warning in the aircraft are important. Mr MCLachlan interjecting",20
6,Mr BEVIS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"The minister says that we did not do that. I am glad you interrupted me, Minister, because it gives me an opportunity to point out-I repeat: having come to the portfolio without any background, you should at least read these documents-what the previous government said in the 1994 white paper about early warning aircraft. We said: Defence has continued to monitor developments in airborne early warning and control technology to identify an affordable option which meets Australia's needs. We made a couple of other comments and then said that there was a study, planned for completion in 1995, to define the technical characteristics and costs of options and their potential contribution to wider Australian Defence Force surveillance, command and control arrangements-already done and fed into the system. It went on to say: Subsequently, a suitable airborne system should be acquired by about 2000. I would have thought that was pretty much on track with what you were proposing to do. Thank you for the interjection. We have a commitment-a shared one-to AEWACs. It is an important acquisition, as is the reference to other knowledge based technologiessatellites, army battlefield command. I was a little surprised to note that JORN was omitted from the list of information gathering and knowledge edge pieces of equipment, particularly after the attack on it which the minister mounted earlier last week in question time. The minister at some stage might like to clarify his view about the JORN program, given that he took a few cheap shots at it last week, or at least endeavoured to take a few cheap shots at me and Kim Beazley via the JORN. He might like to make a clear statement about his commitment to JORN. If he does not have a commitment to JORN, then he should make it plain. In fact, the statements the minister made about the cost overrun had nothing to do with the defence budget whatsoever. He well knows that. So did everyone else who was listening. The knowledge edge, important and priority one though it is, as agreed on both sides of the parliament, is of little benefit-in fact, it is of no use-if we do not have the capability to exploit it. The minister referred, quite rightly, with the support of the opposition and in line with previous white papers, to the importance of command of the sea-air gap. Air superiority is fundamental in addressing that equation. Without air superiority, our capacity to dominate the air-sea gap is in serious doubt. In the next five years, Australia will face the unprecedented situation where our frontline aircraft will be inferior to others in the region. That has not been a position that Australia has had to deal with in the past. We will confront that on already determined acquisitions within the next five years. That is not something which either side of the parliament would want to see occur or would tolerate. Defence of the air-sea gap requires air dominance, and we should ensure that we maintain that edge. I note the minister's comments about the FA18 upgrade. There is no doubt that the FA18 upgrade was an attractive proposition. It was widely supported only a year or two ago. But I think that is no longer the case. I think that now there is a different set of variables in the equation that requires a reconsideration of this matter by the government. An upgrade of the FA18 fleet that will cost somewhere in the order of $4 billion to $5 billion and which will still produce an aircraft which is inferior to others in the region has to be questioned. We have to ask whether or not that $5 billion could not be applied more sensibly and more usefully to other aspects of the Defence Force. The option of acquiring a squadron of new generation multi-role aircraft, which has been raised in some circles recently, and doing that at an early date, is a viable option which I expect would become far more cost effective than the FA18 fleet upgrade. I urge the government to give careful and close consideration to that alternative to the proposed upgrade. There is at least one other optionthat is, an upgrade to a small part of the FAl8 fleet together with the acquisition of what has been referred to as the 'silver bullet option' of a small number, possibly a squadron, of new generation multi-role aircraft. I think that option deserves close scrutiny. It should be one that is undertaken on a bipartisan basis. Everyone in this chamber who takes any interest whatsoever in defence matters would agree with the importance of maintaining an air superiority and a capacity to ensure the air-sea gap is not able to transgressed against our wishes. At the end of the day, words in parliament about these things are fine, but what happens on the ground is a different matter. Over course of the last year, in rhetoric and the talk of resources going to the sharp end, we have seen distressing signs of the opposite occurring. We have even had tained troops writing· to the Army newspaper comof plaining that they have not got bullets to use for their training exercises. There was a letter the from a corporal in the Army newspaper in being September this year, which said: Recently the heavy-weapons platoon of my unit was allocated its 84mm MDFSW ammunition for the next training year and we were informed that the grand total of live rounds was zero due to budget cuts. He went on: Already our unit is a year in arrears for qualifying its 84mm crews from last year's basic course and obviously there are none for this year's basic course. Here you have a soldier who was so desperate that he was writing to the Army newspaper to say: 'We do not have an allocation of ammunition for this type of weapon. The allocation is zero.' What is worse, they did not have enough last year to train the people to get the certification. They are a year behind and they will be two years behind by the time the next election comes and we are elected to clean up the mess. This problem is not unique to that regiment. It is widespread. The answer from army authorities to that soldier's letter to the editor said: There are significant restrictions on the allocation of full-effect 84mm rounds. It went on: The frustration expressed by the author is understood as are the other potential problems caused by ammunition cutbacks. What a sorry state of affairs on the ground. It is all well and good to talk about the tail to teeth ratio, it is all well and good to grab a press release and say 'This is my new policy and new direction' and it is fine to stand here in parliament and talk about it. But when the troops out there do not have any bullets, it is . not real flash. It is not just happening in Holsbe worthy, where that letter came from; it is happening in other parts of the country as well. I got a letter from RSL representatives who were invited to go to Shoalwater Bay to the observe some exercises there. The RSL subspite of the fine branch wrote: During my visit to Shoal water Bay I was led to believe that the ammunition available for a SusFire Machine Gun Course was less than 50% that required by the ammunition scales for the achievement of the necessary skills. Either the ammunition scales are grossly over estimated or in alternative less than half the necessary skills are achieved due to ammunition shortages. I was also amazed to hear that ammunition for the 84mm Medium Anti-Tank Weapon ... is in desperately short supply and that it may well be there is not a single high explosive round for those weapons available for use in Australia. I find this quite alarming. And I am sure the sub-branch did find it quite alarming. That was in central Queensland. I had four quite independent and separate sources of information explaining the same dilemma,and they ran to shortages of a whole range of ammunition, including 5.6mm Steyr operational ammo. If I need to remind the House, that is ammunition for the basic weapon that everyone in the defence forces is equipped with, so there is a shortage of bullets for our basic rifle. I have a list that includes 7.62 mm machine gun and 105mm tank ammunition, but I will not go through the rest here. The point is that the minister has stood here today and put forward a strategic review, the basis of which is supported by the opposition. It conceptually follows the parameters and the rationale laid down over some years, and I think wisely so. It is a matter of some serious regret that, in the process of doing that, the minister has sought to claim some proprietary ownership of a whole range of ideas that clearly are not his or this government's. It is also a matter of some regret that, in the process of doing that in his speech, he decided to misrepresent the position adopted by the former Labor government in respect of a number of issues, some of which I have mentioned. There are serious shortages of equipment that need to be addressed. I note the minister's comments about the budget and like him I look forward to the report of the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on the question of budget requirements for defence. I hope that is a serious report which the parliament as a whole will take seriously. Beyond that, I simply urge the minister to revisit the question of the FA 18 upgrade and the Collins class submarines, both of which are critically important issues for the air-sea gap between us and our neighbours. Motion (by Mr Cadman) proposed: That the House take note of the papers. Debate (on motion by Mr Stephen Smith) adjourned. NA (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 1 December, on motion by Mr Reith: That the bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Martin moved by way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: (1) is of the opinion that the Government's response to the report of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology entitled 'Finding a balance: Towards fair trading in Australia' does not reflect the intent or recommendations of the Committee; (2) recommends the Bill be amended to incorporate the recommendations of the Committee; (3) considers the Government's response is inadequate and its rhetoric does not match either its election commitments or the committee's findings; and (4) calls on the Government members of the Committee, namely the honourable Members for Bendigo, MCEwen, Paterson, Cowan, Mallee, Petrie, Canning, Aston and Lowe to support the Opposition's amendments which reflect the recommendations in the Committee's report"".",22
7,Mr ROCHER,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"The Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997 is part of a package of measures announced by the government on 30 September 1997 to give small businesses protection in their commercial dealings with larger corporations. The root cause of the disadvantages addressed by the measures is an inequality of bargaining power between the parties. On 26 June 1996, the then Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, the  House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology-to become known in this context as the Reid committee-a reference to examine and make recommendations about business conduct arising out of commercial dealings between firms. The government's package is a response in the light of its election commitments and it is done with the assistance of the Reid committee report and leadership. The Reid committee conducted hearings, received submissions and gave its report entitled Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia to the then minister in May 1997. The committee concluded that unfair conduct by big business towards small business was a major concern of small businesses. The chairman of the committee, the member for Bendigo, the Hon. Bruce Reid, said in the foreword to the report that after a detailed investigation the committee found that that concern was justified and should be addressed urgently. To that end, the committee recommended a number of specific measures, including legislation, to induce behavioural change on the part of so-called big business towards smaller businesses and to provide unfairly treated small businesses with adequate means of redress. The Reid committee's recommendations 'covered seven areas of reform: legislative protection against unfair conduct, a proactive role for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission in promoting compliance with the proposed new unfair conduct laws, retail tenancy, franchising, misuse of market power, small business finance, and access to justice and education. We cannot assess the value and the limitasees, tion of the government's package unless we know what the government means by the tenn 'small business'. The Reid committee had originally defined a small business as being independently owned and managed, closely controlled by the owners who also contribute most if not all of the operating capital, and having the principal decision making functions resting with the owners or managers. The Reid committee also said that the definition contemplated non-manufacturing businesses employing fewer than 20 people and manufacturing organisations employing fewer than 100 people. The government's package is also a response to the committee's report and I am advised by the office of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) that the government is therefore targeting businesses as defined in the report. In response to the recommendation that ACCC be more proactive in the area of unfair business conduct, the government is proposing low cost alternative dispute resolution mechapractice nisms. The government will direct the ACCC to initiate test cases under the new unfair conduct provision in the bill currently before the House and will provide an additional $480,000 each year for that purpose. The government's package also includes a requirement for the ACCC to include at least one full-time commissioner experienced in small business and in the setting up of a codes of conduct enforcement unit within the ACCC. With the retail tenancy recommendation, the government says it will negotiate with the peak representatives of retail tenants, the Australian Retailers Association, and retail landlords, the Property Council of Australia, on standards for tenancy reform. In addition, the government notes that the passing of this bill would protect a retail tenant from unconcentral scionable conduct by a landlord. The government has opted for a strengthened franchising code of practice. The code will be mandatory, however, with key elements such as pre-contractual disclosure underpinned by the Trade Practices Act. The government intends to establish a nine-member franchising policy council, with a balance of representation from franchisors and franchiwhose first target will be to create the code. Tl1e minister announced that the government would give specific attention to strengthening the position of small business franchisees in the oil industry, with particular reference to unfair conduct issues. The code will be monitored by the codes enforcement unit, which will be part of the ACCC. In his ministerial statement the minister said that the government has a strong preference for alternative dispute resolution mechanisms in the franchising code in order to minimise litigation and legal costs and to more quickly resolve disputes. On misuse of market power, the government has accepted the recommendations and says it will consult with the state and territory governments and then introduce legislation to enable the ACCC to take representative the actions on behalf of small businesses. The government has agreed that the banking industry ombudsman and the banking code of should be extended from unincorporated small businesses to include incorporated small bu-inesses. Curiously, the minister says in his statement that the government will: . . . invite immediate consultation on an appropriate definition of small business for these purposes. Perhaps someone will tell me before this debate is over what is wrong with the definition the government uses for the rest of the package. Again, the minister notes that the unconscionable conduct provision in this bill will provide protection for businesses from unfair dealing by financial institutions. An information and awareness campaign targeting both starting and existing businesses is a final element of the package. I tum to the bill itself, which is clearly a plank of the government's fair trading package. As the minister has said, the bill is based on the principle that small business operators are entitled to legal protection against unfair business conduct, comparable with that protection which other consumers already have against corporations. The purpose of the bill is twofold. The is to prohibit contravention of mandatory and voluntary industry codes and to provide a range of sanctions under the Trade Practices Act. The second is to prohibit soccalled unconscionable conduct between corporations and persons, with the exception of listed public companies and transactions that exceed $1 million.",24
8,Mr SPEAKER,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Order! It being 3 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order lOlA. The debate may be resumed at a later hour and the member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA",26
9,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I inform the House that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) will be absent from question time for the remainder of this week. He is en route to Ottawa, Canada, to sign the landmines treaty. The Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) will act as foreign minister and therefore answer questions on his behalf. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) has left Canberra to assess bush fire damage in north-west New South Wales, including in his own electorate. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) will answer questions on his behalf. I take the opportunity-and I know I speak for all members-to convey our gratitude and sense of support and empathy with all of those who are presently fighting bushfires either in New South Wales or elsewhere. It is a time of great difficulty and work in fighting these fires in defence of the livelihoods and property of Australians is greatly appreciated by all members of the House. NA Literacy Standards",26
10,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Why does the minister's literacy benchmark allow students to repeatedly make spelling mistakes, thereby encouraging them to be satisfied with an inadequate first literacy standard? Will the minister now improve his benchmark, especially given today's announcement by his colleague Mr Phil Gude that the Kennett government will reject the Commonwealth's literacy standard because it is 'shoddy' and 'not tough enough'?",26
11,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is amazing to see the Labor Party returning to this debate on literacy. Of course, having let young people in this country down over 13 years, they are now scurrying around on the edges of a very important national debate hoping to collect a few crumbs on the way. Let me make it very clear: the national benchmark that the Commonwealth is supporting has been developed by a benchmarking task force comprising all the states and territories. It is a benchmark which has been developed in close consultation with Australia's leading literacy experts and it is a benchmark which parents have indicated very wide support for. It is a significant lift in standards over the standards which have been applied by the states in their basic skills tests up to this time. Let me say that I am aware of Mr Gude's remarks. If Mr Gude is now saying that the standards of literacy are too low and need to be raised, then this is, from the Commonwealth's point of view, a most encouraging sign, particularly for the children of Victoria. I am sure his commitment to raising standards will be welcomed by the parents of those Victorian school students who have known for quite some time that literacy standards have their magnificent been too low. Mr Gude does seem to have changed his tune somewhat from his statement a couple of months ago in September when he criticised the Commonwealth for wanting to have a benchmark which was too high. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth is now pleased that Mr Gude has come to the point of view that we must have a benchmark that is a high benchmark. I am hoping that that will lead to his agreement to a process that will set a benchmark which, if he wants, is even higher. The benchmark that the Commonwealth is supporting-the national benchmark-is a high benchmark which previously he had thought was too high. Mr Latham-Will you allow spelling mistakes? Mr Crean-What about spelling mistakes?",26
12,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me just make the point, Mr Speaker, that these are the people on the other side of the House who for 13 years did nothing to address the literacy standards in this country. One of the major reasons why we now have so many young people in this country who cannot get jobs, who are long term unemployed, is that employers find that they do not have the basic literacy or numeracy skills. The Commonwealth and the states will be meeting at the end of next week and I am very confident that out of that meeting there will come a national commitment to ensure that literacy standards in this country are at last raised. Nursing Homes",27
13,Mr ANTHONY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, my question is addressed to the Minister for Family Services. Can the minister advise the House of the government's nursing home arrangements and the effect they are likely to have on the nation's elderly?",27
14,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Richmond. He, like many of his colleagues, is concerned about making sure that we have policies to deal with the needs and the care of the elderly, both now and into the future, in this country. Detailed consideration has been undertaken by my colleagues. Indeed, late yesterday I confirmed some arrangements to enhance the care capacity of providers and also to make sure that we focus attention on the needs of those residents now and into the future. Yesterday I announced that the cap on the accommodation charge as people go into nursing homes is $4,380 and that that contribution will go greatly towards addressing the capital shortfall and the crisis that we inherited because of the incapacity of the Labor Party to deal with these issues during the 13 years they had stewardship of policy in this area. Indeed, if you take that figure forward for 10 years it is about $1.4 billion and reaches what is known as the Gregory 1994 benchmark. In addition, I announced yesterday that we want to front-end load the need to upgrade nursing homes, and additional funds of $20 million are going to be provided-in addition to the $10 million capital that is already there-for a restructuring program in the nursing homes. We need to make sure that we address this matter. We accept that there is urgency. Many of us have had stories related to us about the inadequacy of many of the nursing homes and that simply must be addressed. Decency requires that that be so, so we have made that decision to proceed with that additional capital-a very significant amount which will be used in a short period of time to address those particular problems. That will enable us, in a national restructuring project to be worked with the industry, to ensure that those issues are addressed. Further, I addressed the issue yesterday of the exemption of the family home, extending the assets test free period from two years, which was Labor's period, to five years for those people who are using their home to generate income to meet the accommodation charge. Not only does it not affect their pension but also will it not be taken into account for the purposes of the asset test for assessment of pension during the period that they are in that nursing home. What that effectively does is enable us to say and to guarantee that the family home will not in any way be required to be sold to meet these accommodation charges, which was the outrageous scare campaign run by the Labor Party. I even saw it mentioned yesterday in the PM program when the shadow minister said that the assets test had not been a featureMs Macklin-Will the fees rise again? Mr Randall- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member for Jagajaga is interjecting out of her seat.",27
15,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. Resume yours.,27
16,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Swan for his assistance, but I did not even notice the interjections. As I was saying, the issue of the family home has been used for a scare campaign. It is quite apparent that the Labor Party will do anything to get a vote. If it includes scaring to win a vote, they will pursue that. They have no plan. They have no principles. They have no ideas. Their policy, which was issued the other day, had no ideas. It relies on going back to the taxpayers to address these issues. We have carefully considered these issues, as people know. We have varied policy in the name of addressing the long-term needs of the residents in nursing homes in this country. That needs to be the priority of government. That is the priority that we have addressed. We have put in place a long-term plan. I have announced the development of a national ageing policy for Australia. It will be the first time a government has done this. It addresses those two fundamental problems I have talked about previously: the increasing number of aged in our community and also dealing with the crisis and the shortfall in capital that the Labor Party left this country with. They are matters that must be addressed. They must be addressed in a partnership between industry and those who are entering nursing homes. That is the only way to go forward. The taxpayers continue their contribution-$2.6 billion in this year alone. That is a fair policy. order. That is what we are about. Youth Allowance",27
17,Mr QUICK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Minister, what advice have you had from your department about the number of students returning to school as a result of the introduction of the youth allowance, particularly in areas of high unemployment, such as Mount Druitt, Campbelltown, Logan and Bundaberg? Has this advice included an assessment of the extra funds required by these schools? If so, what is your strategy to meet the need?",28
18,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The youth allowance is, of course, one of the very important initiatives of this government to give a very positive message to young people that they should not think that their future is assured if they drop out of school and go onto the dole. What this government believes is that young people should be back in school when they are 16year-olds and 17-year-olds, investing in their future by continuing with their education and training. The common youth allowance will provide the incentives for young people to do precisely this. Let me say several things about the common youth allowance, because it is obvious that the Labor Party is again walking into one of these dead ends that the Leader of the Opposition likes to lead them into. The common youth allowance is not a savings measure. It provides additional support to young Australians for their study and training.",28
19,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. We have moved well beyond the question of the policy. We are now asking questions about the number of students returning to school as a result of the introduction of the youth allowance. What advice has the minister received in that regard and has it included an assessment of the extra funds required next year by those schools? It is a pretty straightforward, factual question. It does not seek a general rage about the policy. If he has not the figures, tell him to sit down.",28
20,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of,28
21,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The students, in fact, will be the very big winners under the government's youth allowance, because, for the first time, rent assistance will be available to some 78,000 students who previously have been unable to gain this assistance.",28
22,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It was a very highly specific question. We have moved on beyond the policy. We now want to know what its effects are. What are the assessments of the number of students returning to school as a result of the policy, and what is the cost going to be?",28
23,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no point of order. The minister is addressing the thrust of the question and embracing a large number of students, some of whom will live in the member for Franklin's electorate.",28
24,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is very important to set the context of this, because the government has provided the resources that will particularly cater to the needs of these young students who are returning to university and to school. We anticipate that over the full year there could be some 27,000 additional students in schools around Australia, and the government has allocated $187 million to encourage the development in schools of vocational education and training courses which will particularly meet the needs of these students. The common youth allowance is one of the most important initiatives for young people that this country has seen for a very long time. It will ensure that the young people whose interests were betrayed by the Labor government and who were given the message by the Leader of the Opposition and those behind him that it was all right to drop out of school and go on the dole, even though that doomed many of those young people to long term unemployment, will now get a positive message and positive opportunities to build their lives for the future. Native Title",28
25,Mrs STONE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister advise the House how Labor's proposed amendments to the government's Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 will create greater uncertainty and unworkability in solving the issue of co-existence between farmers, the mining industry and the Aboriginal community?",29
26,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have to say in response to the honourable member for Murray that the reply of the Leader of the Opposition last night was a metaphor of Labor's confusion on this issue. What the Leader of the Opposition completely failed to do was to address the nub of the issue. The nub of the issue is that the decision of the High Court of Australia in the Wik case totally changed the whole basis on which Labor's Native Title Act had been written. The failure of the Leader of the Opposition to address that issue of course is consistent with the approach that the Labor Party have taken to all of the problems that they left behind when they were ejected from office in March of last year. They left us with a $lOY2 billion deficit and then tried to stop us fixing it. They left us with an unworkable Native Title Act and now they are trying to prevent the government from fixing that problem. The Leader of the Opposition completely ignored the fundamental reality that the Native Title Act, as it now stands, was written on the basis that native title claims could be made only over vacant crown land. That is the nub of the problem. That is the nub of the issue that has to b,e addressed, and it is something that has been addressed directly by the government and it is something that has been completely ignored by the Australian Labor Party. In the context of the Leader of the Opposition's address, I came across a very interesting article this morning. I commend a reading of that article to all honourable members. It is a very fine article by Mr Terry MCCrann in the Melbourne Herald-Sun. He is a very fine journalist whose articles I often read. It has a very intriguing headline. It says, 'Stop press: Beazley backs Howard's Wik plan'. It really is very interesting, Mr Speaker. It goes on to say: Kim Beazley went on national television last night and made a strong case for much of what is in John Howard's lO-point plan on native title. Presumably, that was not ... his intention. No, I do not think it was the Leader of the Opposition's intention. He said: Beazley said native title could only be claimed over land which had not already been exclusively granted to someone else-""your ordinary freehold title and most forms of leasehold are absolutely immune from native title claims"". Fine. MCCrann goes on: Then presumably Beazley and the Labor Party will support the government putting this in the legislation. But do they? No. They make the case; but then when it actually comes to the vote they say, 'No.' They left us with a deficit; but when it comes to fixing up the problem they actually say, 'No.' He says: Fine. Then presumably Beazley and the Labor Party will support the government putting this in the legislation. Assuming of course that Kim has cleared this with his intellectual and emotional masters, GarethGareth and Cheryl. It does raise the very intriguing piece of political analysis: to what extent has the Leader of the Opposition's position on native title changed after Cheryl Kernot became a member of the Australian Labor Party? To what extent was there a deal done between the Australian Labor Party and Cheryl Kernot on the issue of native title before she joined? But, as I said a moment ago, the Labor Party are being utterly consistent on this. They left us with a deficit problem and they tried to stop us fixing it up. They left us with a native title problem and they are doing their best to try to stop us fixing it up. Can I say in response to the honourable member for Murray that the only plan that will deliver not only certainty and fairness and justice but also a proper sense of balance between the competing interests in this very difficult issue is the plan that is enshrined in the government's amendment bill. Of the many ironies that are thrown up by this debate, none is stronger than the consequences of the Labor Party's insistence that the right to negotiate in the existing Native Title Act be left unaltered by the amendment bill, because that has two consequences. The first consequence it has is to prevent effect being given to the spirit of the Wik decision, because if you leave a right to negotiate there you cannot possibly give effect to the spirit of the Wik decision. The second consequence is that you are conferring a right on native title claimants that you are not conferring on pastoralists. So apparently in relation to a mining claim it is perfectly all right for a right to negotiate to be available to native title claimants but it is not all right for it to be available to pastoralists. There is no equity, there is no fairness and there is no justice in that outcome. It is but one example of the fact that the Labor Party not only left us with the native title mess but also are stubbornly trying to stop us fixing the problem, duplicating the conduct they adopted in relation to the $lOYz billion deficit they left behind in March 1996. Technical and Further Education",29
27,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. On 8 June the minister set a target of 100,000 new TAPE places for each of the next five years. Can he now reaffirm that target?",30
28,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, you can tell Christmas is coming. The Commonwealth set itself one goal in relation to negotiation with the states over the new ANTA agreement, and that goal was to ensure that growth in student places would continue next year and that that growth would come about as a result of improved efficiencies in the system. After a lengthy national debate on this question, I am pleased to say that the Commonwealth has met with the states and territories and the state ministers have signed off on the new ANTA agreement, committing themselves to grow their systems through efficiencies. The Commonwealth, in the course of this debate, has drawn attention to the fact that the Australian National Training Authority has provided an analysis which shows that the potential number of new places in the system which could be obtained through efficiencies is well over 100,000. Mr Latham-So is that your target? It was in June.",30
29,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have just simply drawn the attention of the states to the fact that there is very significant opportunity for these efficiency gains-and no more is that the case than in New South Wales, the member for Werriwa's own state. The Commonwealth is determined to expand opportunities for education and training for all young Australians. We have revived the apprenticeship system. There are some 55,000 more places in TAPE this year than there were last year. There are 17,000 more undergraduates in Australia's universities this year than there were last year. Traineeships are rising rapidly, with a 44 per cent increase over the previous year. Whether young people are leaving school before the end of year 12, whether they are completing year 12 and going on to further training in TAFE or whether they are going on to university, this government is committed to their futures; and that provides a very dramatic contrast to the failures of the previous government. Native Title",30
30,Mr ENTSCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister. Given the enormous economic value of the fishing industry in my electorate of Leichhardt, could the minister explain how Labor's proposed amendments to the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 would impact on the growing exports in Australia's commercial fishing industry? Could the minister also explain the consequences for Australia's agricultural exports if state and territory governments do not have management control of Australia's water resources as proposed under Labor's amendments?",31
31,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question. One of the most confusing proposals Labor have put forward in response to the government's amendments to the Native Title Act is the proposal to extend the current onshore right to negotiate regime to the intertidal zone. What Labor left out of their proposal is any provision to deal with a grant or renewal of existing commercial fishing rights over this zone. Worse still, the Labor amendments would not even allow governments to renew existing fishing licences in the intertidal zone. Obviously, this would have drastic consequences for the commercial fishing industry, an industry worth about $1.3 billion in exports for Australia and many jobs right around Australia. Fishing in the intertidal zone makes up a very significant proportion of the Australian fish catch. There are numerous fisheries based entirely on these reserves. It is just crazy to undermine their operational certainty in this way. But that is what your amendments do. It is a clear example of the unworkable nature of your approach to the native title issue and your total disregard for a major export industry. It gets worse. If you then tum to the question of inland water, including water used for fishing operations, aquafishing farms and the like, you find that Labor's amendment would prevent state and territory governments issuing new water licences and would cast doubt on the renewal of existing permits and licences. This, in the driest continent; this, notwithstanding the fair process our legislation provides for native title to be determined, but for the operation to go ahead in the meantime and compensation to be paid. Farmers CQuld be required to negotiate with native title claimants every time they wish to take water from either surface or underground water resources. Even minor administrative procedures, such as the renewal of an amateur fishing licence, could be caught in Labor's amendments to our fair legislation. I say to the member for Leichhardt and to those generally interested in our export industries, to produce the top quality seasonal product that is demanded in today's export markets, irrigators must have ready access to water. They must have certainty of arrangements imposed and agreed to by authorities, most of them at the state level. Delay is not just an inconvenience in the issue of water and the provision of irrigation water; it is a threat to the continuation of their export business. Labor seems to think you can tum irrigation taps on and off and not pay a price. Of course, you cannot and, in the whole process, they are ignoring the fact that our legislation quite fairly provides that where there is a dispute on this native title you put it to one side, you allow the operation to proceed, you determine the native title and then you pay fair compensation. What could be more sensible? In conclusion, what are we on about in respect of Wik? The coalition is surging ahead, providing for certainty, for jobs and for fair process with regard to native title. What are you on about? You are on about stalemate on Wik and mining; you are on about stalemate with regard to pastoral leases; you are on about stalemate with regard to control and permanent issue with regard to water; and, sadly, you are even on about stalemate with regard to the perfectly reasonable proposal of the government to take out some sound insurance on the matter of freehold. For that you ought to be condemned. Native Title",31

I might say that there are certain remarks made by certain people in public life in Australia when the best response is to ignore them. Literacy Standards,32
43,Mr DONDAS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. The federal government's national literacy survey highlighted the serious educational disadvantage facing indigenous students. Could the minister inform the House of the action the government is taking to address this issue and improve educational opportunities for indigenous students?",32
44,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for the Northern Territory for his question. There is no doubt that one of the most serious equity issues facing Australia today is the severe educational disadvantage faced by the country's 140,000 indigenous students. This was highlighted by the results of the recent national literacy survey, which showed that on average 76 per cent of indigenous students could not read or write at an adequate standard. The results of 13 years of Labor Party government are that indigenous students are the most disadvantaged young people in Australia. Whether we look at their education, their housing or their health, we find a record of abysmal failure repeated over 13 yearsempty rhetoric, confected moral outrage over certain issues and no record of achievement whatever.. The coalition recognises the special needs of these students and their parents, and is committed to ensuring that their educational disadvantages are effectively addressed and, over time, overcome. We recognise in particular that this is not an area where easy solutions can be found. There are important cultural issues that arise, and it is very important that the full support of parents and communities be enlisted to ensure that students are given every encouragement to attend school and to continue on with their education. The government has increased funding for indigenous students by some $80 million over the next three years through the indigenous education strategic initiatives program. This program provides funding for preschools, schools, training colleges and TAFE. Total funding for this vital program is now $335 million over this period. One of the initiatives that proud of is the fact that this government has recognised that there is a special role for English as a second language teaching for many young Aboriginal students in remote communities who do not have English as their first language. We have been used to providing ESL instruction for the children of newly arrived migrants in Australia. It is equally appropriate for the many young indigenous students, and the government has for the first time allocated $6.2 million to ensure that these indigenous students in remote communities and in central Australia get access. Mr Crean-This is not the first time. We had a program in place.",32
45,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You never had a program of this kind in place. The Commonwealth also recognises the vital role of parents in providing support for their children's education, particularly in the special relationship between fathers and young males on the brink of manhood. The government is providing $19.4 million for the very successful Aboriginal student support and parent awareness program. This money will assist some 4,000 communities supporting 97,000 children. This government has listened to Aboriginal parents and communities. We have set out to address issues which parents and communities have been saying for a long time need to be addressed. It is the objective and purpose of this government to lift the standards of indigenous education with consistent effort, and we are determined that that effort will continue. Apprenticeships",33
46,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to directed to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Can the minister confirm his own department's projections that apprenticeship numbers will be about 2,000 lower in the first full year of the Howard government and that the rate of growth in traineeships is now just 30 per cent, as against 117 per cent in the last year of Labor? How can the minister continue to claim apprenticeship numbers and the rate of growth in traineeships continue to increase dramatically? This is about facts and the truth I am particularly for a change.",33
47,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We know that the festive season is coming when the Labor Party makes a gift of a question from the member for Batman. He gets one out of every 97 questions in this House. I notice that his question strike rate through the tactics committee has dropped quite dramat!cally. Mr Martin Ferguson- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. It goes to the issue of relevance and the strike rate of this government on traineeship and apprenticeship numbers, their fa:nures and facts.",33
48,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister was about to address the thrust of the question.,33
49,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was just commenting on some important numeracy issues for the member for Batman. In relation to traineeships and apprenticeships, those on that side of the House are playing high risk politics at the moment. That side of the House bringing forward any reference to the apprenticeship and traineeship numbers almost beggars belief. This is the party that had apprenticeship and trainees hip numbers in 1995, their last full year of government, at their lowest level for three decades. They virtually set out to destroy the apprenticeship system to depriveMr Crean-No, we didn't.",33
50,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You did set out virtually to destroy the apprenticeship system. You even tried to remove the word 'apprenticeship' from the national statistics. Mr Crean-Oh, rubbish!",33
51,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You did. So there are only apprenticeship and traineeship numbers available. The member for Batman needs a little tutoring in basic mathematics because the simple point is that, if you start from a very low base, you can get some quite big percentage increases with very little real increases indeed. But this government is committed to giving young people opportunities to build up their skills in the workplace, and there has been a dramatic increase in the number of young people going through the traineeship system. Numbers have now risen to some 56,000, a 44 per cent increase on the previous year. I am pleased to say-and members of the House, including those on the other side of the House, will be very happy to hear this as it is good news for all Australians-that numbers this year are rising even more rapidly than last year. We are seeing traineeship numbers some 30 per cent above where they were at the same time in the last financial year. What we are seeing from this government's commitment to young Australians is a tremendous expansion in opportunities for precisely those young people who were disadvantaged by the failures of the previous government. I would suggest that over the long Christmas break the member for Batman goes away and tries to work out how to get a few decent questions through the tactics committee and perhaps works on some basic mathematics. Native Title",33
52,Mr KATTER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister. Has the Deputy Prime Minister seen reports that an injunction has been sought as part of a native title claim over the Ernest Henry mine at Cloncurry in North Queensland. Is the Deputy Prime Minister further aware that this seeks to restrain the mining at Ernest Henry and also seeks to stop the miners from staying on the leases? Is he also aware that it places some 200 jobs at Cloncurry in immediate jeopardy and furtherjeopardises $300 million a year of national income? In light of fact that, some of the people involved are very decent people working under forces oyer which they have no control, would not this sad incident prove again the necessity for defining legislation?",34
53,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Kennedy for his question. I am aware that the Ernest Henry mine at Cloncurry is in his electorate. These reports concern me greatly. I confirm that I have seen those reports. They constitute implications that really will go to the heart of not only Australia's export efforts but also what is a fair go for Australian Aboriginal workers in and around Cloncurry-IOO of them-who were involved in the construction of the mine, and many of them are involved in the onward operation of the mine. Just before question time. I received a report that there was deep-seated anger around the mine this day, including amongst the Aboriginal people, that this claim had come forth given the fact that the Koutha Aboriginal Development Corporation had reached a range of agreements-including, a transport contract involving several millions of dollars with the Ernest Henry mine operators-so that there would be a very sensible interface, job improvement and career opportunity for Aboriginal people in and around the Ernest Henry mine. It is a classic example of the sort of sovereign risk that is now by degrees permissible under the 1993 Native Title Act that we had to deal with when we came to government. That is why the Prime Minister and the coalition government are determined to push on with its fair and balanced response to the Wik court decision. In case members do not know, this is an actual mine already in production. Mining started in August. The Prime Minister went to Cloncurry earlier this year. I, and others, have witnessed a spirit of renewal and stayed in a bright new motel that was just established in that area. It reflected the type of hope and activity which was unfolding. Yet, all of that is now being placed in jeopardy by a claim of one group of Aboriginals against another and against the Ernest Henry mine. It is expected to generate about $4.6 billion in gross revenue over its planned 15 year life, about $400 million in salaries, $600 million in government taxes and royalties and billions of dollars of export income. Those jobs, that revenue and that export income are now under real risk from this legal action, which is challenging the validity of the grants of the mining title for the project. It is a test casethe first such case of this particular kind that I am aware of-under titles issued under the Native Title Act and which were gazetted. What is deeply disturbing about this case is that the claimants are seeking an injunction against Ernest Henry mine which could restrain the company from occupying the land and using it for mining. In other words, they want the mine shut down now-causing a total loss of the jobs involved and a loss of the export income involved. What we provide for in our legislation is that there may well be Mr Martin-You want to shut them out.",34
54,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, this is working through.",35
55,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What about Charlie Perkins?,35
56,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You mention Charlie Perkins. I simply say that I have a great deal of respect for Charlie Perkins's work with regard to Alcoota, but I am not aware of his involvement with this particular mine. Mr Crean-Why didn't you ask me before? I could have told you.",35
57,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"But the Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Warwick Parer, may well be. The renewal of operating pastoral leases could also be challenged. If a series of test cases shut down the operation of leasehold, it will rip the heart out of regional Australia-as I am sure the member for Kennedy is aware. It is precisely for these reasons that the government seeks amendments to Labor's flawed legislation so that these matters can be considered to one side and-if in fact there was to be native title found-compensation paid. But the mining operation would go on, the jobs would be retained and the export income would be generated. Mr Melham interjecting",35

62,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I just want to remind the House that the Leader of the Opposition warned last night of the risk of going back to: . . . the endless complications in the courts. He further said: That's in absolutely nobody's interest, and certainly not in our national interest. I say again to the Leader of the Opposition: you have a chance to provide real leadership on this issue. You, as things stand, are for stalemate and gridlock; we are for fair process, jobs and a future vision for the Cloncurries of this world. Green Corps Program Mr ALB4NESE-My question is to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Given that 87,000 young Australians are jobless, why is the Australian Trust for Conservation Volunteers, which runs the Green Corps program, advising participants who are in work to register as unemployed in order to qualify for financial assistance to participate in Green Corps? What action has the minister taken to stop Green Corps managers encouraging people to falsely register as unemployed thereby rorting the system? Shouldn't young people who are really unemployed be the priority for participating in publicly funded Green Corps projects?",35
63,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Indeed Christmas is coming! It is obvious that, despite the fact the member for Grayndler has been sitting there question time after question time, he has never understood the nature of the Green Corps. It is a program for both unemployed young people and those who are not unemployed. There are many young people in Green Corps who are setting aside their university course for six months or a year to go into Green Corps so that they can",35
64,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, well done!",35
65,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition is cynical about that. 'Well done,' he says, ironically, as if somehow or other a young person who wants to make a commitment to rebuilding this country's environment is to be sneered at. Mr Crean-They are mostly employed people, in government seats.",35
66,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for of case-by-case fights Hotham!,35
67,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We know the member for Batman's attitude. He says that Green Corps is a con. Here we have got an opportunity for . 3,500 young Australians to commit themselves to rebuilding this country's environment and to make a contribution to lifting their skills in environmental management, and what we are seeing from many of the young people who go through the Green Corps is that they are continuing on in the environmental area. They have decided to make careers in the area because they see that there is a genuine commitment on this side of the House to restoring Australia's environment. That is, of course, why there is a $1 billion Natural Heritage Trust which will be made available from the proceeds of the highly successful Telstra float. It is why this governic ment is committed to giving young people these sorts of opportunities. I do not know whether anything in particular is being said by the Green Corps managers to young people. I do not take that at face value. Those facts are not substantiated. Green Corps is both for unemployed young people and for young people who are not unemployed but want to make a commitment to the environment. Mr Albanese-On a point of order, given the minister's request for proof, I seek leave to table the letter from the Australian Trust for Conservation Volunteers which exposes this rort.

72,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Prospect will join him. You are warned.,36
73,Mr REID,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is the business world becoming increasingly confident in its outlook for the future?,36
74,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In reply to the honourable member for Bendigo, as Australia moves towards the New Year the signs are unmistakable that the domestic economy is growing strongly. Despite the attempts of the Labor Party not only to stop the process of economrenewal but also to talk the Australian economy down, the signs are that domestic economic growth is gathering pace. The member for Bendigo asks me about the attitude of the business community. I draw the attention of those sitting opposite who would seek to talk down the Australian economy to the latest statement issued by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry as a result of a survey that was carried out by that chamber, bearing in mind that the chamber is the most representative of all of the business organisations in Australia. This is what it had to say: These results provide confinnation that the actions taken by the government to lower the deficit through cuts to expenditure are paying dividends. Rather than slowing activity, these structural shifts have improved our economic fundamentals and restored competitiveness. They have given the economy an underlying strength it has not had for many years. One can say several things about the New Year. One can say that the economy domestically will continue to grow in 1998. One can also say that, if the Labor Party had retained office in 1996, the opposite would have been the case because the prescriptions the Labor Party implemented when they were in power-prescriptions by their obstruction-and that they urged upon us after the election would have produced an entirely different result, not only so far as economic growth is concerned but also so far as the level of confidence in the Australian business community is concerned. Can I remind the House that GDP growth increased from an annualised rate of 2.5 per cent over the second half of 1996 to around four per cent over the first half of 1997. Investment expectations are consistent with the budget forecast of eight per cent. Retail trade rose by 3.1 per cent-that is real retail trade-in the September quarter and that was the largest quarterly increase since the series Australia. began. Company profits have risen by a strong 5.8 per cent in the September quarter to be nine per cent higher than a year ago. Trend building approvals grew by 11.3 per cent through the year and home loan interest rates of 6.7 per cent are at the lowest level since 1970, compared with the peak of 17 per cent in 1989 when the former government was in power. Probably the greatest demonstration of the wisdom of the economic policies of my government and the ill wisdom of the alternative prescriptions urged by the Labor Party are the way in which the Australian economy has been able to withstand the impact of financial turbulence in our part of the world. I pose the rhetorical question to all members of this House: where would the Australian economy now be on the scale of vulnerability if the policies of those who sit opposite had been implemented and if we had not implemented our deficit cutting strategy, had not freed the labour market had not attended to micro-economic reform and had not privatised organisations like Telstra. The Australian economy would have been weaker and more vulnerable, and the Australian people would have been infinitely less confident than they are as we come towards the end of this year. Green Corps Program",36
75,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Is the minister aware that the four rounds of Green Corps project allocations show an even bigger political rort and bias than the scandalous allocation of work for the dole projects? Can the minister explain why government seats have obtained nearly six Green Corps projects for every one which has gone to a Labor seat, while Labor, with 33 per cent of the electorates, gets only 14 per cent of the Green Corps projects?",37
76,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am beginning to detect a certain lack of imagination in the tactics committee on the other side of the House. But thank you for the presents. Both the Green Corps scheme and the work for the dole scheme are particularly targeted at unemployed young people in regional and rural These are the areas of Australia which were neglected by the previous government and in which many communities are suffering exceedingly high rates of youth unemployment. It has been the commitment of this government to make sure that there are opportunities for young people in these communities to put something back into their community and to encourage communities to do something for these young people. It is not at all surprising that the majority of the projects under both work for the dole and Green Corps are in rural and regional Australia-because the coalition holds 88 per cent of these seats, and the Labor Party holds very few of these seats. If you did a better job in representing rural and regional Australia and started speaking out in a balanced way on behalf of their interests, you might hold more of those seats. If you held more of those seats, you might get more of the funds and more of the places in schemes particularly targeted to help young people in those seats.",37

79,Mr BRADFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Minister, in light of the forthcoming meeting with state ministers with responsibility for retail tenancy matters, are you aware of comments in the press today about alternative approaches to retail tenancy being proposed? What effect would these proposals have on small business?",37
80,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for his question. I have seen reports and I have read statements by the shadow minister responsible that the Labor Party in government-if they ever were to be re-elected-would introduce a system of uniform retail tenancies. Mr Martin-Bring the matter on for debate; we are ready.,38
81,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We are going to do it this afternoon. I am rather intrigued by this announcement from them. I hope my tactics will give me more than three minutes because there is something to be said here. For 13 years the Labor Party were opposed to this idea. There has been one quote after another. For example, in 1990 Minister Beddall effectively said that they would not do it. In 1995 Minister Schacht did not even mention that there was a need for retail tenancy law at all. Everybody remembers Keating's basic attitude: words to the effect that this is as good as it gets. When they got into opposition, their first reaction was that they would have a review about small business policy. They then announced seven small business policy principles. Did they include anything about retail tenancies? No, not a word. They then announced their draft platform on 21 November. That was the one with passive assistance for small business. Did it have anything about retail tenancies? No. They completely missed that. They then had something about industry policy. They talked about service industries, and they did not even mention the biggest of them all: namely, the retail industries. They completely forgot about that. Let me go back to what Senator Schacht said in April this year. They are now in opposition and this is a question before them. Senator Schacht said: Under the constitution retail tenancies themselves are a matter for the state. So there is a matter of getting good legislation at the state level. That was their position. The Leader of the Opposition made exactly the same point. At a meeting in Perth on 31 August, after the report came down, he said: You have problems in the day-today experience of tenants that goes beyond the general propositions that are covered by unconscionable conduct. You need a good state act to deal with that. I am not going to talk about that. Those are matters that Geoff Gallop--who is the state opposition leadercan consider. They have been opposed to this for years and years and years. In government and in opposition they have been opposed to this proposal. With very good reason, a lot of the bigger operators have registered property trusts. So they would not be picked up by it anyway. Furthermore, what they are proposing is that in Australia we have two sets of retail tenancy laws, which would be incredibly complicated. Who would end up paying the legal bills? It would be the very small business community that you are concerned about. Lastly, let me turn to my piece de resistance. We have been reading our Hansard, and on 24 November the shadow minister said this in the parliament: As he knowsreferring to the member for Bendigoan opinion in a submission given by Mr Dennis Rose QC, on behalf of Blake Dawson Waldron, lawyers to one of the major lobbying and constituent groups in small business-the Motor Trades Association of Australia Ltd-to the committee and subsequently to the government categorically states that, constitutionally, it is possible to bring down a uniform retail tenancy law which can be underpinned by changes to the Trade Practices Act, which will give effect toMr Martin-Correct.",38
82,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"'Correct', he says. Thank you very much. The last sentence was, 'The opposition will seek to do that.' Mr Martin-That is right.",38
83,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, I have got it out. I would be amazed if the Leader of the Opposition has read it. The Blake Dawson Waldron proposition is to achieveMr Martin- Mr Speaker, a point of order!",38
84,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I don't blame you; I would move the gag if I were you. Mr Martin- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. My colleague reminds me that this particular matter is on the Notice Paper for discussion today. I am quite happy for the minister to bring it on so we can debate it, see who is right and see whether they will support their own committee report.",38
85,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,39
86,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The proposition has not yet been put before the parliament. The proposition to achieve this policy objective of the Labor Party is, in these words, put by the Blake Dawson Waldron opinion. In the present context, referring to this proposition, it says: It would be open to the Commonwealth to impose high rates of income tax or land tax-on the lessors of retail premises if the lessors were not incorporated. Upon becoming incorporated, in order to avoid the higher income tax rates or special tax, the lessors would become subject to Commonwealth legislation based on the corporations power. Their means of achieving this is a new tax-it is a new tax on the small business community to achieve a proposition which is not provided for under the constitution. Mr Martin-Bring it on for debate.",39
87,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is a desperate opposition, that they would advance a policy which means a new tax, an income tax or a land tax, on the entire small business community to achieve a policy objective-which for years you were opposed to. Nursing Homes",39

We believe that that is the way to go forward to address the problems that we have inherited from the Labor Party. Of the figures that you quote, $4,380 is the maximum that someone can be asked to pay as they enter as an accommodation charge to a nursing home. The rules are well known and have been articulated in here and are available to the community. So you go away and do your own sums. The sums that you' do, like everything that you have done, are a gross exaggeration. Ms Macklin-Where is it from?",39

104,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You do not want to hear the answer; that is why.,40
105,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. It goes to the question of relevance-'as a result of this government's user pays policy on nursing homes, a pensioner will have to pay'. It is not an invitation to that discussion.",40
106,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no point of order. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I put it to you that we have had three points of order. They are clearly vexatious and simply attempting to disrupt the minister in providing a comprehensive answer.",40
107,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the minister. There is no point of order.,40
108,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. As I was saying, I quote from the article. It starts off 'Labor's new cell has an old smell'. It goes on, 'The old lions run again'",40

118,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They make their contribution through their pension, and that was the arrangement that you had in place. They make a contribution for user charges, and that has been announced, and that is fair. The arrangement that your shadow minister is talking about is generating a figure that is totally ridiculous-and you know that to be the case. Let me quote to you what Mr MCGuiness said. He said: Social welfare spokesperson Jenny Macklin has no hesitation in committing future Labor governments to huge expenditures on heavily subsidised age care.",40

137,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is outrageous! The honourable member for O'Connor thereupon withdrew from the chamber. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. On that previous occasion, the Minister for Family Services was still speaking at the dispatch box, and you were trying to gain his attention, and the microphone was turned off whilst he still had the call. Is that appropriate in those circumstances?",41
138,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no point of order, and it is totally appropriate. Private Health Insurance",41
139,Mrs BAILEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I direct my question to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Can the minister advise the House of any recent developments in the private hospital sector? How will these developments benefit people who enter private hospitals for treatment or surgery?,41
140,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-I thank the honourable member for her question. I have some good news for her. On 19 August, the government announced that it would encourage hospitals to enter into relationships with the doctors who work there in an attempt to get rid of out-of-pocket expenses. I am pleased to inform the House that late last week Health Care of Australia, which is Australia's largest private hospital operator, at its Melbourne Private Hospital announced for the first time that it had reached agreement with cardiac surgeons, neurosurgeons, cardiologists and anaesthetists so that anyone going into hospital for these procedures would have no out-ofpocket expenses and would receive a single bill. This is the first time this has happened in Australia. It is a great credit to Melbourne Private Hospital and the doctors who work there, who have been prepared to put a scare campaign behind them, have an incredible outbreak of common sense and do something that is in the interests of their patients. What it means is that there will be guaranteed informed financial consent that the health funds-HBA and Medibank Private-will pay an above schedule fee directly to the doctors. One of those funds has also agreed to pay an amount of money into a research fund for the hospital, and the patient can go in there knowing that they are not going to be up for a big out-of-pocket expense. The gap, as it is called, is one of the major impediments to people taking out and maintaining private health insurance, so I commend Health Care of Australia and the doctors at the Melbourne Private Hospital, in particular Dr Jack Cade, who is the head of medical staff there. This is great news for their patients. Nursing Homes",41
141,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Family Services. Yesterday the minister said in a media release that the new annual nursing home fee would be $4,380. Is the minister aware that last night the Chief Executive officer of the National Association of Nursing Homes and Private Hospitals said that in most cases an annual fee of $4,380 'wouldn't even pay the interest on the loan' and said, 'We believe that the nursing home fee has only been set until we can go back to the minister with further figures'? Mr Ross Cameron- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I refer to standing order 142 and House of Representatives Practice pages 512 and 513. The practice of the House is very explicit about the use of quotations from media reports. The member for Jagajaga did the same thing yesterday.",41
142,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,42
143,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Will the minister give a categorical guarantee that the fees for nursing home residents will not rise again?,42
144,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The $4,380 was announced on 6 November, and I confirmed yesterday that that is the continuing cap after further consideration by cabinet. I take it you quoted Mr Brotherhood from the organisation. Let me make an interesting observation about that. Mr MCClelland-He is from Doug Moran.",42
145,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is right. This is the spokesman for Mr Doug Moran, and you were the people who attacked viciously Mr Doug Moran for the bonds that he was charging. What they required of me was to put in place an uncapped bond system that allowed for the very thing that you and others in the community criticised. We varied that. Now you come in here, the hypocrites that you are, and use that line of argument in support of challenging the government's announcements of yesterday. I find that at the height of hypocrisy. If you want to defend that sort of approach, then that is a matter you. It is something that I have rejected. Furthermore, the level of capital that is generated by the cap that I have announced will, as I said previously, generate over a year period an amount of $1.4 billion into the sector. This is the first time that capital be generated into the sector. It behoves you ill will to pursue this line of argument because you have no answers and no plans. As was in the article that I was quoting from just recently: all that is left for you to do is into the area and tax more-new taxes, more taxes. You have no plans, and you know it. You ignored it as the finance minister. You have no answers. You are the guilty ones. Highway Programs",42
146,Mr BARTLETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. The minister would be aware that there is no mention of the black spots program or roads of national importance in Labor's policy platform. Given that these are very valuable programs and roads such as the Great Western Highway need considerable attention, what is the government's commitment to these programs?",42
147,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Macquarie for his question. He obviously takes a great deal of interest in the Great Western Highway. I will answer the second part of the member's question first. The government is absolutely committed to these programs, particularly the national highways system, roads of national importance and black spots. Black spots is a very significant program, which was cut by the previous Labor government. Mr Bevis-We introduced these programs.",42
148,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It was cut by the previous Labor government and reintroduced by the Howard-Fischer government. Importantly, it should be noted in the area of road funding that the Great Western Highway would be eligible for funding under the RaNIs program under the current criteria. It should also be noted that the Great Western Highway was not included in the national highway system under Labor. Under the policy platform that we have seen released in recent weeks, it for would not be eligible·for any funding under the RaNIs program. The Labor Party do not mention any RaNIs program. The Labor Party's draft policy does 10- not provide for roads of national importance. The Labor Party's draft platform does not will provide for funding for the Pacific Highway, which we have been committed to for 10 years. The Labor Party's draft platform does not include a black spots program. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs in an answer he step gave last week indicated that the veterans' affairs policy was about seven lines. The roads policy is only five lines and it does not mention any of those key programs. In closing, for the information of the House and particularly for the member for Macquarie, I reiterate that Labor's draft policy does not provide for roads of national importance, it does not provide for the black spots program and, most importantly, it does not provide for the Pacific Highway upgrade program-three programs that the HowardFischer government are absolutely committed to continuing. Nursing Homes",42
149,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Finance and Administration. Minister, what is your present assessment of the amount of capital which will now be raised by the latest version of the Prime Minister's nursing home entry charge, following changes announced yesterday? How far short does this amount fall of the capital proposed to be raised by the government's first version of the policy? How far short does it fall of the almost $500 million which you cut from nursing home funding in the 1996 budget? How does this square with your statement to the House on 18 November 1997 that 'with the nursing home policy which the Minister for Family Services is finetuning at this present time there will be no shortfall'?",43
150,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I would hope that by now the honourable member would realise what the role of the Department of Finance and Administration is in any government program. I am sure the Leader of the Opposition appreciates that.,43
151,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, I would not be too sure about that.",43
152,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am sure he at least appreciates the methodology that is used. When any program is brought forward by government it is checked by the department of finance. Ms Macklin-That is why we are asking you the question.,43
153,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If you just wait, you will get the answer. The assumptions that are used in calculating what might be brought through on any particular program in the way of funds that are raised are taken by the department of finance, and if those assumptions are seen to have a basis then the department of finance is happy to tick off on them. I indicated to the House on the last occasion this question was asked-1 think by the same member-that the program in terms of providing capital funds was broadly in line with the recommendations of Professor Gregory . We all know that Professor Gregory was given the task of looking at what might be required in the way of capital improvements to nursing homes in Australia by the former government. Having been given the task-and he came forward with a figure of around $500 million as being required-of course nothing was done. Nothing was done by Labor to do anything about it. Absolutely nothing was done to address the problem. The result of my colleague the Minister for Family Services - orking up a program, consulting widely and looking at the needs of nursing homes-that area neglected by Labor all of those years-was the need to raise funds to improve the capital stock. I indicated on the last occasion that, to achieve those funds that Professor Gregory indicated were necessary, in that report which was ignored by Labor, we would be broadly on target. The details that were announced yesterday by my colleague, as I understand it, actually comply with the statement that I made previously. They do broadly bring forward the capital that Professor Gregory recommended, and the capital funding is there, as was suggested by Professor Gregory in the announcements that have been made by my colleague. Industrial Relations",43
154,Mr ZAMMIT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. The 5,121 business enterprises in. my electorate of Lowe would be interested to know whether the minister could outline to the House the benefits of the government's workplace reforms and what these will mean to Australia's future. How does this compare with previous industrial relations policies and their outcomes?",43
155,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"1 thank the member for his question. His question is most timely because today marks the 25th anniversary of the election of the worse government in Australia's history: the Whitlam government. Amazingly, there are some on the other side who stilI have fond memories of the Whitlam government and, in government themselves, would wish to emulate the record of the Whitlam years. I say to all honourable members, as they hear the other side eulogise the record of the Whitlam government in the days ahead, that they should remember that the lot on the other side are still advocating the policies of the Whitlam years. I am a bit of a history buff, I suppose, when it comes to politics in this country, and I got out Labor's 1972 industrial relations policy. If you are interested in irrelevance, it is worth reading. Back then they were calling for contractors to be roped into the union movement as employees, they wanted the repeal of penalties on strike action, they wanted to widen the right of entry for union bosses into every business in the country, they wanted a more centralised role for the Industrial Relations Commission, they wanted to promote collective bargaining with unions and they wanted immunity of unions from action in respect of torts alleged to have been committed by a trade union in contemplation of a further trade union dispute. Does that have a familiar ring to it? It ought to, because it is basically their policy now. When they released their policy the other day, all the editorials said it was a voyage into the past. I have it here and it is proof positive that it is the past. I was in my early 20s in the Whitlam days.",43
156,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I hadn't turned 21.,44
157,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Some hadn't turned 21. You should not forget that when Whitlam came in we had a wages inflation spiral, interest rates went through the roof, they inherited a surplus and turned it into a deficit and at the same time they massively increased tax. Of course, unemployment went to record levels. The Prime Minister was away last week when I recounted the latest ABS figures on industrial strife. The number of working days lost under this government is now at 62 days per 1,000 employees. That is the lowest number, Prime Minister, in 30 years. In 1973, when Labor was in office in the Whitlam years, it was 551 working days lost per 1,000 employees. In 1974 it was 1,273 and in 1975 it was 717. The platform then was a rescue package for the union movement, and nothing has changed. The latest platform from them is exactly the same. I want to conclude with the remarks of a current member of the opposition who has also commented on the impact of the Whitlam years on the Labor Party, the shadow minister for transport. He had this to say about the Whitlam years in the Sydney Morning Herald on 12 October last year: We've got a problem. Whitlam grafted onto the labour base this new professional class, bit by bit their influence has continued to expand; new ALP members tend to come from it, the party's agenda has altered to reflect their perspectives. He is so right. That is why they lost in 1975 and why they lost last time. That is why the member for Melbourne then went on to say: I wouldn't like to see the influence of people like me becoming more dominant, because the traditional labour base could be squeezed even more. The words speak for themselves. I thank the Prime Minister for giving me back the Labor Party's industrial relations policy in 1972. Nothing has changed.",44

180,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House areas--Governfor discussion, namely: The deleterious effect of older Australians of the government's cuts to aged care and health funding, frequent and contradictory policy changes and a continuing refusal to adequately explain those changes. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",46
181,Ms MACKLIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Jagajaga) (4.28 p.m.)This government, we now know from this question time, continues to worship the concept ofuser-pays-$14,OOO worth of userpays for a full pensioner. For older Australians, especially those needing nursing home care, this government has had very specific plans indeed. These plans are to get very old, frail Australians to pay large amounts for their care. This generation of Australians aged 65 and over is quite unlike younger generations. Their characters and attitudes have been indelibly etched by the experience of growing up during a prolonged world depression and then living through and serving in a world war. It is a generation that developed frugal habits. They had two objectives in life: one was for their children to get a decent education and the other was to make sure that they owned a family home. The Howard government, for the last 18 months, have had their eye on the homes of the elderly in this country for developing a user-pays aged care policy for Australia. The great majority of people needing nursing home care-the most expensive form of aged care-are full pensioners because superannuation was not available in th-ir day. But more than 70 per cent of people in the age group do own their own homes. We saw the beginning of this debate with the National Commission of Audit in June last year, where the government had the singleminded strategy of making older Australians out to be a burden, a tidal wave that threatened to overwhelm our resources and that could be met only by making older people sell their homes to pay for nursing home care. This policy sat perf-ctly with the plan to make massive budget cuts of $500 million in the Howard government's first budget last year. This found its first expression in the now defunct iniquitous accommodation bond, which was to be an uncapped, up-front user charge levied on older Australians at the most vulnerable time in their lives. This government never had the courage to directly admit the logical outcome of their policy-that to pay the charge people would have had to sell their homes. That is, they did not admit the policy until the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) went on the Ray Martin show and did the most spectacular of all backflips that we have seen from any government.· Since then we have had the Prime Minister and the Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) trying very hard to say that the family home is safe. 'Safe;' they say. They do not say that it will not have to be sold. They do not say that it is not in the assets test, because it the assets test. It will be taken into account to work out who will have to pay this new annual fee. Of course, the pensioners have worked this out. In the Queensland newsletter of the Pensioners and Superannuants Federation they say: Don't be fooled by the Government's rhetoric, the Accommodation Bonds have NOT been scrapped, they have just had a name change and are still presented to the general public in a different package. The Government still intends to get the same amount of moneywe heard that today' in question time, so the pensioners and superannuants are absolutely rightout of this scheme . . . it is still to be collected from the dying, frail aged elderly. The newsletter goes on: ... is this a political stunt to properly package and sell the accommodation bonds? Well, it certainly looks like it. Let us look at the Voice, another publication from the Pensioners and Superannuants Federation. They too say that the introduction of the new $4,000 annual charge is regarded as unfair. It says: The changes still mean that the cost of upgrading nursing homes still falls on people who become very frail or sick and have to move to a nursing home through necessity not choice. That is the essence of it all. Older Australians still do not believe this government. Even though this entry fee has now become an annual fee capped at the moment at $4,380or, as the minister said in answer to a question in question time today, 'a continuing cap'; I am not sure what 'a continuing cap' is-older Australians know that this government's policies are still targeted squarely at the family home. Selling the family home has become one of a number of options: you can sell your home or rent it out and pay quite a lot of tax, which pensioners previously have not had to pay. Another wonderful option, which I cannot imagine anybody going into a nursing home would want to contemplate, is to go out and get a mortgage on your home. After you have spent 30 or 40 years getting rid of your is in mortgage, and you are facing going into a nursing home, what does this government say to you? Go and get a mortgage on your family home to help pay for this government's cuts to nursing homes. Rarely can there have been a policy that has been so marked by backdowns, changes and backflips. Now we see that the real intention is to cover up. Yesterday we had the evidence from the minister's letter to the Prime Minister that the primary aged care strategy now driving the government is cover upkeep the details of all the backflips and changes from the media and from the public at all costs; keep everybody in the dark. That is what the government wants to do. Let us remind the House of the scale of the changes that we have seen just in the month of November. On 5 November, we had the Prime Minister on A Current Affair saying that the fee was $4,000. On the same day the Prime Minister said that it was an average of $4,000. The next day the minister said that it was between $7,000 and $10,000. On 13 November, just last month, the minister at the table went to a doorstop. He called for just the electronic media; he did not invite the newspapers along. According to his media adviser, they did not ask the newspapers along because they ask difficult questions. What did the minister say at the doorstop? He said: The average payment for an entry contribution to a nursing home ... will be $12, which is a little more than $4,000. That's a continuing arrangement. I haven't yet set a cap, and have not done so A little later in the doorstop he said: With regard to nursing homes . . . the maximum of $12 a day, about $4,380 a year ... It was agreed in the room today that that is the appropriate to go forwardhang on a minuteuntil I get to a position where I can get the data that I need to formally set the maximum bond. That was the position on the 13th. Mr Warwick Smith-That's right. I got the data.",46
182,Ms MACKLIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He says, 'I got the data.' What a wonderful interjection, Minister. What did he agree on 11 November with the nursing home providers? This letter, which was sent to him, was signed by Aged Care Australia, the Uniting Church, the Anglican Church, the Catholic Church, the Baptists and the Aged Care Network. In that letter they say: At that meeting you invited us to present you with information about the capital funding needs of the sector which will not be met by the new accommodation bond and annual payment mechanisms. We advised that this would take approximately eight weeks . . . . It is envisaged that the task would be completed by mid to late February 1998. What they expected was that, having made an agreement with the Minister for Family Services, at the table, they would be able to come back in eight weeks time with information about the capital needs of their nursing homes. But what we see from the letter that the minister actually wrote to the Prime Minister is that he had no intention whatsoever of taking any notice of what the churches or the private nursing homes said.  that?",48
183,Ms MACKLIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am sure about it, because what he says in this letter is that he wants to put off any consideration of any additional capital needs until after next year's budget. Why would he do that? Because he has no intention of providing any extra capital. Mr Warwick Smith-That's not true.",48
184,Ms MACKLIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Now he says that is not true. That must mean the fee is going to go today. up. You cannot have it both ways. Let us put it very plainly. Either the annual fee of $4,380 is going to go up or the churches and the nursing home owners are being told, basis 'That's it, there is no more money.' You cannot have it both ways. This government tries to keep everybody in the dark, but nobody is so silly as to think that the money is going to come out of your pocket, because what we know is that this government has one objective and one objective alone, which is to make sure that it comes out of the pockets of the frail aged. That is where they want the money to come from, and that is now very clear in black and white from this government. What we also know is that this government has no idea how much a person is going to have to pay. What we asked in question time today was how much a full pensioner facing going into a nursing home would have to pay. I used the example of someone who rents their house out for $200 a week, and I think that is a pretty modest sum. I am sure that my colleagues from Sydney would tell me that $200 a week would not get anybody a home to rent, so the tax sums I have put before the House today are very conservative. Pensioners will be paying considerably more tax than that in Sydney. Take the case of a pensioner who has had, for example, a stroke and is in a public hospital. If they decide, 'The only way I can pay the new accommodation fee this government has put in is to rent out my home,' can you imagine how, in that situation, they are going to organise the renting out of t-eir home? Fifty years of history will have to be packed up before the home is rented out. They probably have not paid tax for the last 20 years. Suddenly they have to rent their home, organise to pay taxMr Warwick Smith interJecting",48
185,Ms MACKLIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The minister thinks it is a joke. The minister thinks that it is a joke say to somebody lying in a hospital bed, 'If you get $200 a week in rent, you will be up for paying $2,708 a year in tax. And it is the case that, if you are charged that amount of tax, and you have not had to pay that before, you will have to pay provisional tax. So you will have to come up with that amount of money up-front the next year.' That is what people are going to have to come up withthat amount of tax, plus the annual fee of $4,380, plus the 85 per cent of their pension which is $7,680. That makes a total charge for their care of $14,774.",49
186,Dr LAWRENCE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,They've doubled it.,49
187,Ms MACKLIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As the member for Fremantle says, they have doubled what someone is going to have to pay to get nursing home care in this country. And that is not just once they are going to have pay that amount of money; that is every single year. And who is it who has to pay this money? It is a pensioner who has one asset and one asset alone: their family home. That is who is going to have to pay these sums of money. Let us go back to what this is all about, because I think this will be the last time we have this debate in the House this year. Nursing home care is not a matter of choice. It is not a lifestyle option. People who go into nursing homes go in because they have to, after incapacitating illnesses or injuries. They go in because they have had a stroke or because they have broken their hips. That is not the time for them to be working out rents or mortgages or sales of their homes. Nothing could be more inappropriate than that. It is time this minister and this government took stock and went back to the drawing board and put the $500 million back into the aged care budget. (Time expired).",49
188,Mr WARWICK SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Again this matter is for debate and it follows the announcements that were made by the government yesterday. Before answering some of the issues raised by the shadow minister, I will reiterate exactly what the government's announcements were yesterday. I will come back to your example. I have had some to figuring done on it. It shows that the pensioners will be better off under our system than the one that prevailed under you. So I would not be crowing too loudly too soon. Mr Lee-They're looking pretty rubbery.",49
189,Mr WARWICK SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We will wait and see. What we announced yesterday was that, where the home is rented out to pay an accommodation charge for a nursing home, the total income derived would be exempt from the income test for the pension and wouid not be taken into account after 1 March 1998 in calculating an individual's contribution to daily care fees. In addition-and this was the important addition-the government has also decided that, for nursing home residents who rent their home to pay an accommodation charge, the value of the home would be exempted from the pensions test for a period of five years. Currently the home is included in the test after two years, and that was the pre-existing assets test that the Labor Party put in place. As I said previously, in the assets test the value of the home was always a feature of Labor Party policy under the hostel arrangements. The second issue that was announced yesterday related to the capping of the annual charge, the accommodation charge-$4,380; that is $12 a day-and that assisted residents would pay a maximum of $6 a day and concessional residents would pay no charge. That was an amount that I set on 6 November, the day after the announcement by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that brought the end to the uncapped bond system, which was required to be paid up-front. The arrangements that have been put in place are based on modelling that had been done by my department, showing me that we will receive somewhere in the vicinity of the amount that was required to be generated from the 1994 Gregory report. The factors to do that modelling are complex. They involve the residents' lengths of stay, the separation rates, the proportion of residents who will pay the charge, the gradual replacement of the pre-l October residents over the first few years, the new arrangements and of course the proportion of services that are certified. The average charge will generate in that 1O-year period an amount of $1.463 billion. That is the first time that that arrangement has been put in place to enable some capital to be put into this sector to address the issue of upgrading nursing homes to a standard of which all Australians can be proud. We have to address this issue of capital because of the . situation that was inherited after the period the Labor administration. They knew that something had to be done and it had to be done urgently. There is the issue relating to the unmet needs: fire standard needs, 13 per cent of homes; the 11 per cent of nursing homes who did not meet the necessary health guidelines; the 75 per cent of homes where the design and building codes were not met in the nursing home area; and the fact that 51 per cent of nursing home residents lived in wards with three or more people. I know as a local member, and other local members know, that we have to and need to continue to address the upgrading of nursing homes. So we knew there was a problem. To create and exacerbate that issue-and I have shown this graph many times-is the 75 per cent reduction of capital into the nursing home sector by the Labor Party over the last several years that. they were in government. So there was a problem there. The philosophical divide between the opposition and the government is how best do we generate the capital to meet this crisis. The government is saying that we need a system that is fair, that those who have the capacity to make a payment should be asked to do so. It is fair to the broad range of taxpayers. It is a way of generating capital from those who can afford to pay to address the problem and it is, as I said in question time today, a policy that is designed to bring together the different elements-that is the taxpayer and their contribution, the nursing home providers and their contribution and the residents and their contribution-to address this problem in a sustained and a sensible way. The alternative that the Labor Party are pursuing is to, as we know, generate more taxes. That is why former Senator Peter Walsh-and I have quoted him before-has pointed out in his articles in the Australian Financial Review that they are leaving themselves open for increases in general taxation. That raises a whole series of questions about equity to the rest of the taxpayers. I was trying to raise today the issue that was in the Sydney Morning Herald last week by leading of writer Padraic MCGuinness. He pointed out that the undertakings and the policy announcements by the shadow spokesman for the Labor Party lead to the inevitable conclusion that more taxes will be required, and of course that will be visited upon the whole broad range of taxpayers. We simply believe that that is not a sustainable way forward to address this fundamental problem. The other issue that I addressed to deal with these matters in a coherent fashion was to say that we needed to front-end load the issue of the capital requirements. There is a $10 million capital fund there already. I will be adding to that a further $20 million, which will be focused specifically on a restructuring approach to the nursing home sector in this country. It is quite clear that the reforms to the aged care sector had focused attention on the viability and appropriateness of a number of the facilities. The industry restructuring will focus on how best to cater for those older Australians who live in those residential facilities which may not be able to meet the building standards and care criteria now and into the future. We have put in place and will be starting shortly the aged care agency, which will focus on ensuring that accreditation is reached. We will be pursuing the issue of building certification to make sure the standards are maintained and indeed improved. We believe that a concerted, across-thesector approach to these issues is absolutely fundamental if we want to get to an outcome that we as Australians can be proud of. There are too many examples of nursing homes in this country that need attention. As I keep on saying, you cannot come off such a low base and just rely totally on taxpayers to foot the bill. There will be a requirement for all in sector to contribute. Indeed, the residents, where they have the capacity to do so, should also be contributing. The HECS system, which was proposed by the Labor Party to seek contribution for education, was supported by us when the Labor Party brought that forward, because what we were trying to do in a national policy sense was create more education places and seek a fair contribution from those who could afford to pay. The same principle broadly applies in this particular area of public policy as well. There have been some distortions by the shadow minister. I do not doubt that in the heat of political debate those sorts of things happen. But there is a fundamental divide between us, and I think I have highlighted that already in the remarks that I have made. The equity of the approach that we seek to put into place is that there are a range of ways in which people will be able to make this accommodation charge contribution, which I have capped at $4,380 and which generates the $1.4 billion over the 10 yearsequivalent to what is known as the Gregory figures. I want to respond to the point that was made. I think in question time or in the remarks of the member for Jagajaga during her contribution this afternoon in relation to the quotation from ANHECA and NANHPH, two private sector representative bodies. They are going to provide me with further information. I would welcome that when it arrives. But they also indicated to me earlier that their requirement was to have bonds at a minimum of $90,000-odd. I believe that was inappropriately high. I do not believe it would have been an appropriate figure to have put into the legislative package that we are talking about today. I reject that. The arrangements that I have put in place, I believe, together with the additional capital which is front end loaded to deal with the crisis that is there, are a far better way to go; and that is why, to give certainty to the community, I announced yesterday that the cabinet had endorsed the proposals for the $4,380 cap, the $12 per day. As the Prime Minister said earlier in his announcement, that this is about equivalent to the $4,000 figure. For the first time it will give the industry the opportunity to have an income stream specifically targeted towards improving the stock in nursing homes. Previously I had announced-and there are detailed packages going out to all providers today and tomorrow-the arrangements in regard to hostels where you will have an uncapped bond system and the capacity to utilise those bonds to continue to upgrade the hostel sector. That has certainly been welcomed by the industry. If the industry want to make further representations they know that they are able to do so. This package has been announced to provide certainty and to try to address the long-term needs that we know must be met and, based on the information and advice that has been provided to me, it generates the capital in quantities that can effectively address these problems, together with those larger amounts that I have announced. I also wanted to take quickly the issue of the arrangements that you mentioned in question time about the so-called impact on full pensioners. I can quote the figures-we have assessed your figures-and perhaps we will provide these to you because, at the end, they show that in actual fact a pensioner would be $3,311.50 better off. Let me go through the figures. If a full pensioner out their home at $200 per week to pay the accommodation charge the question basically is: are they better off or are they worse off? The income would be $10,400 for the rent and $9,042 for the pension with the total being $19,442. Their daily fee-remember that the daily fee went down under us; you had it at 87 per cent and we had it at 85 per cent-the capital contribution of $12 per day and tax on the rent of $200 per week, which would be $2,708-I am using your figurecomes to a total of $14,789. The total income after expenses would be $4,652.50. This is where I think you are being hypocridirect tical; you are absolutely ignoring your own system. We reduced the amount of the pension that is paid from 87 per cent down to 85 per cent and you totally ignore that. You misrepresented the arrangements that existed for the two-year asset test assessment and you misrepresented the issue with regard to the fact that yesterday in question time the member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton) asked the question specifically and ignored the fact that the assets test for the family home did apply to the hostel sectorMr Wilton-I didn't say",49
190,Mr WARWICK SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You did say that; you know you did say that. As I have said continually, the arrangements that we have put in place mean that the family home is safe. Under your previous system, the income of $9,042 from the pension less the daily fee of $7,701 gives a total income after expenses of $1,341. Therefore, a pensioner who now rents out their home to pay an accommodation charge is $3,311.50 better off. The misrepresentation that was detailed in your question I think was outrageous. I am going to make these figures well known. You quoted from a magazine called The Comet, the superannuants and pensioners magazine. As I understand it-I have not seen it but it was cited in question time yesterday-it is some weeks old. It does not take account of the changes that were announced yesterday. It is just a further misrepresentation of the issues you have been running around with. I might make mention of some of the other misrepresentations because I have to say that rents in my own local area I have been somewhat disturbed and disgusted at the outrageous material that has been put into the electorate by the Labor candidate down there who was making claims about $500 million which, as you know, has been acknowledged by others as totally and completely false. The amount was never $500 million. It started at $479 million and has been reduced substantially now to some $200 million. You have continually gone around misrepresenting this issue. A brochure was issued by the candidate down there, a Michelle O'Byme, and endorsed coincidentally by Anne O'Byme-no relation, as I understand it-who was formerly in charge of the hospital board there, a respected member of the community. I am absolutely surprised and saddened that she would lend her name to such a piece of paper being circulated in the community. This goes to the very point about how you are quite prepared to say and do anything to get a vote and to scare elderly Australians. Here I see it happening in my own community. The big issue in my area is whether or not Senator Murphy's wife, Jacquie, is actually going to be running as a Labor candidate closer to the election, rather than Michelle O'Byme. I think that is the question that the people of Bass ought to be asking-whether or not it is to be Michelle O'Byme, who works for Senator Kerry O'Brien, that mythical, mystical, never seen and never heard senator who resides in the city of Launceston and provides a safe haven and revenue for Michelle O'Byme-and Senator Murphy employs his wife in his office. Those people are all involved in a factional fight. They are the issues that the people in my electorate ought to know about rather than this litany of lies, misrepresentation and distortion that scares the people. I have seen it happening not just in my electorate but right across the nation. That is why we need a plan; that is why we need a policy that is fair. That is what we have. I believe this continued approach of scaring people is outrageous and a total distortion. Manifestations of mischief will always exhibit themselves in this place. The alleged leak of a letter, something that has been used by the Labor Party, is similarly outrageous. (Time expired)",52
191,Mr LEE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) finished on a very bitter noteMr Warwick Smith-I have every reason to be bitter.,53
192,Mr LEE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He says he has every reason to be bitter. His difficulty is that at the same time as worrying about whether or not Michelle O'Byrne will be the Labor candidate for Bass he is running around Victoria trying to get himself preselected for a Liberal seat in Victoria. So we say to the Minister for Family Services: let us see whether he is brave enough to back up his claims in the House today by stating his decision as to whether or not he will continue to seek Liberal party preselection for the seat of Bass. Mr Warwick Smith- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I claim that this response from the shadow minister is a further litany of distortion. I have already indicated that I will be a candidate for preselection and this arrangement to put on the recordMs Macklin-Where? Mr Warwick Smith-It has been in the newspapers; why don't you read them? Furthermore",53
193,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Nehl)Order! There is no point of order. I was listening to the minister very carefully and there is no point of order. Regrettably, I was not listening to the member for Dobell.",53
194,Mr LEE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That the minister is so sensitive to this issue confirms the very fact that second time he is trying to seek preselection in Victoria. He tried to do it once beforebefore the 1996 election. He is the person who started casting aspersions about whether or not Michelle O'Byrne would be the Labor candidate for Bass, yet he has the hide to get up here and complain if we repeat a fact that has been printed in Australian newspapersthat he is looking for an escape from the electorate of Bass. We know why he is trying to get out of Bass: because there is no way in the world he, as the minister responsible for nursing homes, will have any hope of holding the electorate of Bass at the next election. That is why he is seeking an alternative seat. The minister had the hide to say at question time today that what this is all about is putting in place a long-term plan for nursing homes. In his response this afternoon he also claimed that on 6 November he created this plan for certainty by announcing that the nursing home annual fee would be capped at $4,380. The minister is having greater and greater difficulty in coping with reality because he forgets that, whilst he did make that announcement on 6 November, he also made a few other announcements. On 7 November the minister announced that the annual fees would be somewhere between $7,000 and $10,000. That was the day after the minister claimed he set the cap at $4,380. A few days later, on 13 November, the minister stated that the cap would be-he flipped back to his earlier position-$4,380 and then he said 'unless the industry can provide evidence that they need more money'. Mr Warwick Smith interjecting",53
195,Mr LEE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The minister interjects across the table that he will not give into Doug Moran. Minister, the problem you have is that you said you would be willing to receive more information and submissions from the nursing home industry, the very people whom you claim you are not going to listen to. Minister, why would they bother sending you any more information if you claim that your 'continuing cap' is not going to be revisited? We know that on 6 November, when the minister said this was a continuing cap, he had every intention of varying the cap above for the $4,380 because on several occasions he announced that it would be more than $4,380. At the end of the day, we know that the scheme that we have ended up with is just as bad as the scheme that was announced by the government on budget night in 1996. Before all of the changes that were announced by the government over the last few months elderly people in the electorate of Bass were to pay $2,600 a year from their up-front accommodation bond and also up to $7,686 from their pension, totalling $10,200. That was what was going to happen before the government began making their endless changes. Today, under the scheme the minister announced yesterday, those people who were to pay $10,200 will now pay $14,000. It is clear that these people will be paying $4,000 a year more in fees to nursing home proprietors and the government as a result of their changes. I am sure that the member for Bass, the Minister for Family Services, has had as many calls to his electorate office as we on this side of the House have had. All of the people who have been ringing our offices since the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) went on A Current Affair are saying that they think this is a con, that they know that the government's abolishing the accommodation fees and introducing its annual fee is putting in place a scheme that is just as bad as the original proposal. Minister, the people in electorate will be holding you responsible for the fact that you are introducing a scheme which is just as bad as that announced by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in 1996. In addition to the Minister for Family Services having to explain to his constituents the higher charges for nursing home fees, he will have to explain why they have lost access to the Commonwealth dental health program. The minister will also have to explain to his constituents why there have been massive cut-backs in the Commonwealth pharmaceutical benefits scheme-$500 million in 1996-97 and another $600 million in the 1997-98 budget. These cut-backs have meant that earlier this year pensioners in the electorate of Bass went from paying $2.70 to paying $3.20 for a script and that families in the electorate of Bass went from paying a maximum of $17.40 to paying $20 for a script for their essential medication under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Thirty-five drugs, ointments and creams have been de-listed. Some anti-fungal creams now cost more than $100. That is an extra cost being placed on families. Drugs which are used to combat stomach cramps and diarrhoea have also been affected by this minister's and this government's decision to make it harder for families and pensioners to get access to essential medication. But what will really be the final nail in the coffin of the member for Bass at the next election will come on 1 February, when the changes in the therapeutic group premiums bite. Mr Wilton-Same time as preselection.",53
196,Mr LEE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The same time as he is probably lining up for preselection in the federal electorate of Menzies and the same time as he is trying to find an escape pod from the island of Tasmania. On 1 February 850,000 Australians will be asked to pay more for essential medication to treat high blood pressure and ulcers. The changes in essential medications have been accompanied by just as many backflips and backdowns as we have seen in the area of nursing homes. The initial changes were your announced in the budget in May this year. Beta-blockers were removed from the exemption. Drugs which treat depression were also removed. We have had the Prime Minister's claims that these changes would affect only drugs of equal clinical value and the Treasurer's bogus claims that the difference between these drugs was the same as the difference between Kellogg's cornflakes and no-name cornflakes. We bring into the House day after day examples of how these drugs are clinically different, how the newer drugs have fewer side effects and are more effective, and day after day the government has been forced to back down in relation to removing from the exemption beta-blockers and the drugs that treat depression. Yet, on 1 February, 850,000 Australians will still be expected to pay more for their essential drugs, the drugs which their doctors say they should be using. This will include drugs like Norvasc, a drug which the government's own advisers have told them is a drug that could mean that patients may be at a lesser risk of cardiac failure. When we asked the Prime Minister about this drug-a drug that the government's own advisers say means that you have less risk of a heart attack-and how it breaches his undertaking that these changes only affect drugs of equal clinical value, we have the Prime Minister claiming that these are ridiculous allegations which the opposition makes. We have had the minister come in and say that we have confused calcium channel blockers with beta-blockers. We have a doctor and a minister for health, with all of the resources at his disposal, confusing betablockers, which are exempted from the scheme, and calcium channel blockers, which are still covered by the scheme. At the same time, all of the tens of thousands of Australians who use the drug Norvasc will be expected to pay more come 1 February. I can guarantee the member for Bass, the Minister for Family Services, that his constituents who are affected by the higher nursing home charges, the cutbacks in federal funding for public hospitals, the abolition of the Commonwealth dental health program and the changes to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme will be knocking on his door. The tom-tom drums are beating and you will be in trouble in Bass. If you do not find that escape pod somewhere in Victoria then, once again, you will face humiliation and be the defeated Liberal candidate for Bass come the next election. (Time expired)",54
197,Mrs GALLUS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I learnt two things from this debate today: one, the aged care scare campaign is running out of steam because the shadow minister for social security, the aged and family services, the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), had to get the shadow minister for health, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), up here today to help her pad it out; and, two, we must be doing a damn good job as a government because there seem to be so few other issues that she can actually raise as matters of public importance. How could the shadow minister for health dare come into this place and talk about health funding? He was a minister-although, not the minister for health-in the Labor government that actually brought down the whole health system, a health system which originally had 64 per cent in private health funding. What was the figure when Labor left? It went down to 34 per cent. That was a deliberate policy by the then Labor government to destroy the private health system. In doing so, it destroyed the security of the pensioners, the elderly, who relied on that private health. By reducing the numbers, it put up the costs, because the fewer people that were in the private health system, the more expensive it became and the harder it became for those poorer people to stay in it. Labor deliberately forced them out of the private health system into the public system. What happened in the public system? Paul Keating, who was so fond of that public system, refused to pay, along with other Labor members, private health insurance. He was happy to put the burden on the public system knowing that if he got ill, if other Labor cabinet members got ill, they would go straight to hospital and to the head of the queue. What happened to the public hospitals with the breakdown of private health insurance? The shadow minister for health is now leaving the chamber because he obviously does not want to face his own record-the record of his party. It brought chaos to the public hospitals so that 80 per cent of what they dealt with became emergency cases. It totally and utterly changed the public health system. It brought out rorts between the states and the Commonwealth. To survive, the states were encouraging the public hospitals to set up private outpatient clinics so that it was the Commonwealth that had to pay through Medicare because the states could no longer afford to pay because there were not sufficient private health members. This is the legacy of this opposition that now stands up and criticises this government. It was this opposition that left health in an absolutely disastrous state when it left office and left this current government to clean up the mess in aged care that it left behind. We went through the funding for aged care last week. The Gregory report that said that Labor does not care about the elderly because Labor wants them to live in these degraded conditions. It wants them to live in nursing homes without air conditioning, in nursing homes without heating, in nursing homes where the sanitary conditions are not up to standard, in nursing homes-70 per cent of them-that did not reach building standards. This was the system Labor presided over. This is the system it apparently wants to keep. Labor are not making any suggestions to make the system better. Labor want to keep the system it had, the system it refused to improve, the system it refused to fund. Remember what I said last time. In 1992-93 Labor funded nursing homes with $45 million; in 1993-94, $26 million; in 1994-95, $15 million. The figure dropped all the time. That was the year the Gregory report came down and said to the government, 'These elderly people are suffering in these below standard nursing homes. Do something about it. Put in $125 million a year.' Labor's response was to drop the funding to a mere $10 million a year. Now you dare to come into this place and criticise this government for trying to do something for the elderly people of this country . You come in here with no suggestions and no positive plan. You come in with criticism and a fear campaign aimed at the elderly out in the electorate. This echoes what you did in government. You wanted the elderly to live in substandard accommodation because you did not do anything to change it once you knew what was happening. Now you are prepared to go out there and run a scare campaign. How do you expect to pay for aged care? The shadow minister for health raised the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. What was the cost when you went out of government? I believe it was something like $2.7 billion. It was due to rise 50 per cent in the next four years. The shadow minister for health has left this place, but perhaps the shadow minister for aged care would like to tell us how the opposition, in government, would pay for this escalation in costs? The truth is that all around the world every country is facing this dilemma: how to finance the growing cost of drugs. There is not a never empty bucket that you can go into for more money. You have to look at it and say: how do we rationalise the system so we can continue to supply medicines for the elderly, so we can continue to supply medicines for the young, so we can continue to supply medicines for the chronically ill? That is what responsible government does. It says, 'We work out a system and we pay for it.' This opposition is not prepared to do any of this. It is not prepared to come into this place and say , 'We should do a, band c, and this is how we should pay for it,' because it does not have any plans. All this opposition has is a strategy, and that strategy is a scare campaign aimed at the most vulnerable in our community: the elderly. But you do not go out to them and say, 'We were the ones responsible for the disastrous situation in nursing homes.' Instead you go out and scare them about the changes. Is that responsible? Is that any indication that you are fit to ever go back into government? Let us see exactly what we had under you as a government: a decrease in the standard of aged care and a drop in private health insurance that lowered the standard of care of our public hospitals. In the end, 80 per cent of their care was devoted to emergency care; the money was not there any more in the private system. All those people who used the private system were pushed back into the public system by the present opposition, the then government-and then they did not fund it! You did your best to close down private health insurance and then you did not fund the public hospitals to take up the slack. You broke up the nursing home system by not putting in enough funding. You made sure that older people were suffering in that system and you did the same to them in the health funding system. It has been up to this government to clean up your mess. Firstly, we are trying to get people back into the private health system-to make it easier for older people who want to keep their private health insurance so that they can have the doctor and the hospital of their choice. We want them to have that, they want to have that, but the opposition does not want them to have that. Secondly, we are making sure that they have adequate facilities in their nursing homes, and that is not too much for older people to ask-that they are cared for and looked after in their old age, in the times that they have to go to nursing homes. But this is not what the opposition wants. In government they ran down the stock in nursing homes and ran down private health insurance to put pressure on public hospitals. You were not thinking of the people then and you are not thinking of the people now. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs DeAnne Kelly)-The discussion has concluded.

200,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I move: That the amendments be agreed to. The Migration Legislation Amendment (Migration Agents) Bill 1997 relates to the requirement for registration of migration agents in order to render migration advice. This bill enables those ongoing arrangements to be supervised under a new regime which will involve the Migration Institute of Australia. In considering the bill, the government was apprised of certain concerns by some senators about the short length of time allowed for people to object to a person who is seeking to notify an intention to register as a migration agent. There was also concern raised about the lack of a formal reporting requirement to parliament for the proposed Migration Agents Registration Authority. The government has given consideration to some of these matters raised by senators and section has proposed certain amendments to the bilI to meet these concerns. The first amendment was to extend the period of notification of intention to register as a migration agent from 10 days to 30 days. This will provide a longer time for objections, if they are to be lodged, to be presented. The other amendment will require the Migration Institute of Australia to lodge an annual report on the activities of the Migration Agents Registration Authority to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs for tabling in the parliament. There was also foreshadowed in the other place an intention to restructure the proposed fees for migration agents and to reduce the section proposed fees that had been outlined for voluntary agents. That intention announced in the other place is something that the government wilHollow. I will be presenting regulations to give effect to the agreement that was the reached with senators to ensure the passage of this particular bill on that aspect. I very much welcome the passage of this legislation. It has avoided a difficulty that would have arisen if the course suggested by the opposition had been followed. The opposition proposed in the other place an amendment which would have brought to an end a sunset clause that was enacted by the previous government for the migration agents registration arrangements. That sunset clause had been extended already by the government on several occasions. The government had foreshadowed that it intended to legislate for a statutory self-regulatory scheme involving the participation of the Migration Institute of Australia. If the opposition had successfully amended the bilI in the other place, it would have been rejected by the government in this chamber. Undoubtedly, the end outcome would have been that there would have been no scheme for the registration of migration agents. I have made it clear that I think the statutory, selfregulatory scheme is eminently workable. It will provide a considerably improved regime for registration, particularly for enhancing the skill of migration agents. I think that outcome is a beneficial one. I welcome the fact that the Senate agreed to amendments that enable the bill to be agreed to.",59
201,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I would like to make a few passing comments on the nature of the amendments and, more importantly, on the overall nature of the Migration Legislation Amendment (Migration Agents) Bill 1997. At the outset, I question whether or not the passage of the bill, as suggested by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), will be advantageous with respect to the problems confronting people who are normally required to avail themselves of the advice available from migration agents. It is for that very reason that we raised a number of criticisms of the bill in its original form. addition, we indicated our overall view of opposition to the move to self-regulation as embodied in the bill. Whilst some of the amendments go part of the way to picking up some of the original criticisms that we offered on specific details of the bill in its original form, and whilst they are an improvement, we do not believe they go far enough with respect to the operation of self-regulation-if that is to be the order of the day as a result of the manoeuvring and deals done in the Senate by the government. Let me tum to the overall bill and its passage by the Senate. The bill still does not overcome the opposition of the Labor Party and the view of a lot of people, especially in the community sector, that the government's move to self-regulate the migration industry clearly indicates its lack of commitment to this area and the needs of consumers. In that context, I do not believe the amendments we are debating this afternoon come to terms with some of those criticisms-for example, the requirement for the period that is available to raise questions concerning the registration of migration agents. Alternatively, from the Labor Party's point of view, we still maintain our overall position of requiring the government to take a more proactive approach to the existing Migration Agents Registration Board. We think this bill is weak on the requirements to protect consumers. More often it is disadvantaged consumers and clients who require the assistance of migration agents with credibility, adequate training and the capacity to give advice in a free, open and honest way. These people clearly cannot afford to be ripped off. However, unfortunately, they are sometimes placed in situations where they are ripped off. In that context I would say that, in a selfregulatory environment where there are weaknesses as to the overall monitoring authority, consumer protection has been marginalised. Further, despite the amendments before the chair this afternoon, we think that consumet protection is still seriously marginalised, as the decision makers are the members of the association without, so far as we are conIn cerned, proper independence with respect to the necessary ingredient of overseeing the capacity to review decisions made on the question of the standing or the performance of some of these migration agents--especially those in the private sector, as against the goodwill and commitment that exists very much amongst the community sector advisers, who often operate on the smell of an oily rag and do not seek to rip off disadvantaged people in the community with respect to the operation and intent of this bill. On that note, I would refer to the fact that, with respect to community organisations that currently provide migration advice to the community on a free basis, the failure even for the bill in its amended form to exempt them from paying fees is of major concern to the community sector. A large number of community organisations have been in contact with my office since the deal was done yesterday in the Senate by the government with some of the minor opposition parties. It is our view that it is exceptionally difficult for those organisations to operate. They do not charge, yet they are now expected to pay, for example, a fee of $100, which I consider to be an enormous amount for payment by a voluntary organisation. For example, I would refer to the operation of some of these voluntary organisations in my own electorate. The latest unemployment figures by electorate clearly show that the federal seat of Batman is an area of great need. It is an area of high unemployment. It is an area in which many migrants, including new arrivals, look for assistance but do not have the capacity to pay for it. They therefore very much depend on the free advice available from voluntary organisations. More importantly, these voluntary organisations do not just provide such advice, but they go out of their way to try to meet every need of some of these worthy people. (Time expired)",60
202,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Given that we will canvass some of these issues again, let me just take the opporfee tunity briefly to make some observations about the community sector. The first point I would make is that, in terms of both the practices and the quality of advice, there are certainly good and bad in both the private sector and the community sector. I made some comments in the Main Committee which some people saw as a reflection generally upon the community sector's advice. I want to make it clear that I recognise that some of the advice people receive from parts of the community sector is of an outstanding quality and quite worthy. In fact, I have used some of the material that has been prepared by some of the agencies which have been working in this area over a long period of time. But the fact is that these agencies, if you include everybody with whom they are associated, represent about 25 per cent of the community sector. What you need to recognise is that the community sector includes many organisations, where people register, that may give very limited advice on very few occasions. One might well make the point-and, I think, quite validly-that, if people have worked only in the area marginally and not undertaken any continuing education, you would have to be concerned about the quality of advice they are able to give. I am concerned about the way in which not only people who represent commercial interests are encouraging people who have no bona fide basis on which to lodge protection claims but also some organisations that work voluntarily, and who give advice on a voluntary basis, are equally involved in those practices. It is important to recognise that one of the aspects of the com-unity sector's involvement in the provision of tuition to those people who are working for organisations and wanting to be professional involves the charging of a fee to participate in programs which constitute continuing education in this area. The fees are of the order, I think, for IARC of $200. If people are working for an on fee basis they charge a much larger amount, but those who are working for voluntary organisations charge $200. On that basis, I find the suggestion that a of $100, which will be the reduced fee in the second year for those who are working in the voluntary sector, being an amount which will be of a pecuniary nature is a flawed view, given the fact that people are prepared to pay up to $200 to participate in educational courses. If there were no fee, I suspect the prospect of getting any people who are offering advice-that is, amongst the 440 who are offering advice on a voluntary but only very ad hoc basis now-to forgo the opportunity of being able to obtain registration would be lost. The reason I have argued, which I think has been accepted, that a fairly modest fee be proposed-we in prospect see it as being a fee that can be reasonably afforded-is to achieve that objective. That is, it will enable those who are competent and prepared to work in this area to do so for a modest fee; the payment of a modest fee will discourage those people who would rarely give advice. It may be, in our view, a disincentive. We think that will be a better arrangement. It is for that reason we have come to the proposals we will put forward in the regulations at a later date. (Time expired)",61
203,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Whether $100 is a modest fee is a question of relativity; it depends on one's background and the nature of the electorate that one represents. In High Street, Batman, in my electorate-where some of the voluntary organisations are not funded for the purposes of education and training and where, in some instances, they are even forced to run chook raffles to raise some of the necessary finance so as to ensure that their staff are properly trained-$100 for each one of those voluntary workers is an exceptionally significant fee. With respect to some of these voluntary organisations the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) is talking about voluntary workers in the order of 40 or 50 people. One hundred dollars might not seem a lot to the minister-perhaps it reflects the nature of his electorate-but in a lot of other electorates there are quite a significant number of voluntary workers and a fee of $100 in addition to all the other fundraising they have to involve themselves into ensure that their voluntary workers are properly trained, on top of their job and capable of giving full and proper advice is a very significant cost impost. It is like everything else in this House: it is relative, dependsectors ing on the background and the nature of the electorate you represent. I, like the minister, want to ensure that people in this industry are properly trained. I also understand that in both the private and community sectors there are both good and bad advisers. I was pleased to hear the minister's remarks today qualifying what I thought was a fairly unjustified comment in the Main Committee with respect to the performance of the community sector. Obviously in the community sector there are a few bad advisers, but I question whether the situation there is as significant as it is in the private sector. Those in the community sector are not involved in charging fees and ripping off and rorting the system to line their own pockets for the purposes of li ving off the disadvantage of unsuspecting people seeking citizenship in Australia, as is the case with some of the private sector operators in this fairly sensitive industry. Having made that point, I tum to the question of the government's attempts to reinstate the 30-day period for lodging a complaint. That is obviously a compromise and an improvement on the previous situation outlined by the minister. In the context of his remarks about bone fides, credibility and the capacity of some of these organisations to actually perform, I question whether or not reinstating the period to 30 days is sufficient. Under the existing law an application for registration as a migration agent must be notified in the government Gazette, and there are six weeks in which any person may lodge an objection to the registration. For many in the House reading the government Gazette might not be as interesting as Hansard, but in previous jobs that I have held the reading of the government Gazette was bread and butter for me. It actually detailed, for example, which cleaning and security organisations received government contracts. It is how I cut my teeth when first introduced to the trade union movement representing the Miscellaneous Workers Union. We had to follow on a regular basis which organisations in the cleaning and security actually received, as a result of tendering processes, government contracts for the purposes of cleaning and securing government buildings across the length and breadth of Australia. Perhaps the minister does not read the government Gazette, but in previous occupations I found it exceptionally interesting reading. With respect to the need to register migration agents, I understand that the Gazette is also bread and butter for a lot of community organisations and private sector operators out there. They would like to see a proper process of accountability with respect to the performance of some of these operators by keeping their fingers on the pulse by way of the government Gazette to ensure that a proper process of registration applies. If the government is serious about providing access to the public so they can raise an objection, I suggest that it is important that in the legislation the definition of 'publication' include a national newspaper, which would give the public access to object to a registration. (Extension of time granted) I also believe that the MIA-the minister's new-found best friends; the people he cuts deals with on the run, as reflected in the amendments to this bill-must be obligated under legislation to publish a list of people potentially wanting to register so as to ensure it is subject to objection. So far as I am concerned, the organisation, the MIA, should be required to publish the list of potential organisations and individuals seeking registration. ,We therefore believe that the current amendments do not go far enough to include an extension of time for exceptional circumstances. I raise that point because many of those who have grounds to complain and raise objections to registration will be those for whom English is not a first language. I therefore believe that they will require extra time to respond adequately to such a nomination for registration. The other issue we raise this afternoon goes to the requirement of the MIA, as a statutory authority, to report to the minister and in tum the parliament. I question whether or not the current amendments before the House go far enough. They should more fully outline the specific details of accountability requirements. I suppose that also goes back to my previous work experience and the requirements on voluntary organisations, such as the trade union movement, under a variety ofindustrial relations acts throughout the history of trade union activity in Australia, to be fully accountable on a range of fronts with respect to the number of members, the breakdown of the membership by state or region, financial accountability, income from contributions, expenditure, donations, interest earned, et cetera. I doubt that the suggested accountability requirement is sufficient to overcome some potentially major problems in the move to self-regulation as embodied in this bill. For example, where are the requirements as to full and proper accountability and details of moneys collected for registration? I believe there should be a requirement to table in that report a list of members registered under the act, how moneys are expended and questions of expenditure on education, training and associated activities. I welcome the requirement to report to the minister and, in tum, to the parliament, but I question whether the suggested accountability by the minister in the amendments before the House this afternoon is sufficiently rigorous with respect to what is a big gamble. That is what self-regulation is: a big gamble by the government. They are not sure that it is going to work, yet in order to try to protect themselves should this act fail they are trying to bring in a smokescreen and have suggested to the Australian community-in an area of especially sensitive activity and an area of great need for a lot of disadvantaged peoplethat there will be some sense of accountability. As far as I am concerned, from my own experience in the operation of the trade union movement, the accountability requirements of the MIA should be as rigorous as they are for other voluntary organisations such as trade unions. If it is good enough for this organisation to place the onus of accountability on trade unions across all of its activities, then it ought to be good enough for this government to place a similar onus of accountability on the MIA, which is an unknown organisation as to its bona fides and its capacity to deliver and implement the intent of the bill which is currently before the House. That is not an issue to be lightly dismissed by the minister. It is a major issue upon which the performance of this governmentgoing to the operation of the act-might stand or fall. If there is not full and proper accountability, the finger will be pointed at the minister for not being rigorous enough with respect to the accountability requirements to himself and the House. I also raise that because it goes to the government making public moneys available to the MIA. Other organisations that receive public moneys have very onerous requirements on them with respect to accountability. As receivers of public money, the MIA should be required not only to assure full accQuntability to this House but perhaps to come before Senate estimates to account for their activities and financial obligations. That is a fairly serious issue. We are not talking about mickey mouse handouts; we are talking about significant amounts of public moneys. (Time expired)",61
204,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I will not take up the invitation to become combative on this issue, but I will say that these clauses are improvements resulting from some of the criticism that was raised, particularly in the Senate report. These amendments·are a response from me to the points that were being made. If there had been some indication from the opposition that they were willing to talk about these matters, I might have been in a position to have had a discussion with my colleague the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) about the detail of the amendments and to have picked up some of the points that he was making. I am not averse to being involved in discussions that are designed to improve legislation. Mr Martin Ferguson-But you're in government, not us.",64
205,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"No. We have a bill and amendments that have been agreed. They will achieve their purpose, and if concerns do develop with the working of this scheme I would be more than happy to speak to the honourable member for Batman about them. The important aspect is to have the passage of this bill and to have the legislation into enable us before the sunset clause operates to put the new arrangements in place. If we had failed to get agreement on this matter, there would have been no scheme. We have here an improved scheme in that there is now a requirement for a person who is intending to register as a migration agent to advertise in national and metropolitan newspapers rather than in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette. I am fascinated that the honourable member found time to read the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette in his former employment, but I notice he was not talking about reading it now that he is a busy shadow minister. I suspect very few of his constituents in Batman would be reading the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette; they are more likely to be reading a national or metropolitan newspaper and to become aware of these matters through them. Mr Martin Ferguson-Are they advertising in ethnic newspapers?",64
206,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I looked at that, and the cost of managing proposals for advertising in the ethnic press would, particularly for voluntary organisations, pale into insignificance, I suspect. Mr Martin Ferguson-The MIA should pay for it.",64
207,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"It is all right to say somebody else should pay. It is always the opposition's view that somebody else should pay. Mr Martin Ferguson-It is a big risk, a big gamble.",64
208,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I do not regard it as a gamble. The Migration Institute of Australia is intent on achieving higher standards and implementing a code of behaviour, and I think peer pressure will be a very significant factor in obtaining improved outcomes. The member for Batman's enthusiasm for registration schemes should be noted against the record of his colleagues when they were in office. I was in this House in 1989, I think it was, when the former government withdrew any consumer protection arrangements requiring registration. They were in place but largely place unused, and Senator Robert Ray told me it was better that those provisions be withdrawn and that the normal consumer protection regime operate instead. It was only in 1992, when it became apparent that the consumer protection regime the former government proposed was going to fail, that a registration scheme was brought in. But it'was a registration scheme that simply registered all of the people who had been largely in the business until that time, and it did not significantly change attitudes. I think the new regime, which is going to require continuing education, will have. a far better prospect of achieving an improvement in outcomes over time than the former government was able to achieve through the measures which it implemented in 1992.",64
209,Mr JENKINS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) addressed a matter that I wish to raise. Before the House today there are also amendments to the Trade Practices Act that go to the registration of codes of conduct within industries. I take it from the comments of the minister just then that, given that in the past consumer protection measures have been taken into account and have been considered, in this industry the reliance on the self-regulatory code will also be given regulatory underpinning by the scheme being placed under the proposed amendments to the Trade Practices Act. It is a little difficult to discuss that now because those amendments have not proceeded through the parliament. But the basis of those amendments is that, where any industry is engaged intra-industry or with consumers in that industry, it is the intent of the government to have those codes of conduct and codes of practice for the industry registered under the Trade Practices Act either as mandatory codes of conduct or as voluntary industry codes. I believe this is an important issue. If the course of action the government has embarked upon and the reliance on the code of conduct through the Migration Institute of Australia are to succeed and be seen to provide the protection for consumers, when these new amendments to the Trade Practices Act are instigated they will pertain to this industry as well. Anybody who knows the way in which the development of migration agents has gone knows the importance placed on ensuring that the practices the people in this industry engage in are fair and are in the best interests of those for whom they are acting. I think the minister would have to acknowledge that, while the opposition disagreed with the methodology and the best way of going about that, the principle we do have before us is to ensure that those who often find themselves in very emotional states over migration matters are not at the mercy of people who are predatory in their behaviour in the commerce of the industry. I am talking about something that is a little in the hypothetical, because the amendments to the other act not have not even gone through, so I know that the minister cannot give an immediate response. However, I hope that,during the stage where it is appropriate to be investigating this, the minister might take these comments on board.",64
210,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I do not think that the observations that have been made arise out of the amendments that we have been discussing, but I will certainly get a consid-red view on the points: I will write to the honourable member on that matter. As I said, the passage of this legislation is important if we are going to have a scheme in place before the sunset clause operates. If we had left it until next year it would have been very difficult to put in place the appropriate administrative arrangements. Question resolved in the affirmative.

211,Mr ROCHER,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Before the debate was interrupted for question time. I was talking about unconscionable conduct in the context of the bill. Whether conduct is unconscionable depends on the circumstances in each case. The bill lists a number of factors to which the court may have regard in deciding a particular matter. The Reid committee recommended against using the term 'unconscionable conduct' and preferred the term 'unfair conduct'. Its reasons for that included the premise that the phrase 'unfair conduct' can, at law, be interpreted to cover a broader range of activities than 'unconscionable conduct'. As well, 'unconscionable conduct', in its current usage, has not served small business well. Unconscionable conduct has been defined by the courts as conduct by a party who stands to receive a benefit from a transaction which, in good conscience, should not be allowed to stand. The doctrine of unconscionable conduct has been developed at common law to apply to limited and narrow circumstances. The courts have been reluctant to apply the doctrine to transactions involving business operators because they, unlike some consumers, could be expected to be more aware commercially and to be accustomed to hard bargaining and strong competition. The Reid committee therefore recommended that a broader statutory standard of fairness was required in order to address the types of conduct complained about in evidence to its inquiry. In the explanatory memorandum to the bill, the government explains that it chose the term 'unconscionable conduct' because the word 'unfair' has not yet been legally defined and is therefore uncertain. As an untested legal concept, according to the government, 'unfair' may not achieve what small business wants. But in addition to the well-understood, if limited, concept of unconscionability, the government proposes to add a list of criteria in order to assist a court in determining whether conduct is unconscionable. As the minister quite rightly said, there is a body of legal precedent behind the meaning of unconscionable conduct. As a matter of logic, the effect of adding a list of criteria will either expand the meaning of that phrase or it will not. If it does not widen at all, then the criticism that the doctrine has historically been too narrow to assist small business remains valid. If, on the other hand, the doctrine of unconscionable conduct is widened by the addition of the list of criteria, then the minister himself has introduced a new legal test which has not yet been legally ratified. On this point, a former chairman of the Trade Practices Commission, Professor Bob Baxt, argues that the new provision would 'erode the law of contract' and as a consequence cause widespread commercial uncertainty. An increased likelihood that contracts can be opened up and set aside is likely to deter property owners from developing. While the government is keen to help protect small business, it should not fall into the trap of portraying the larger companies as the guys always wearing the black hats. It is not, nor should it become, a question of small business versus big business. The marketplace is more complex than that. The response from the small business sector to the fair trading package has been, on the whole, positive, with only a few groups expressing some reservations. The Australian Retailers Association describes the legislation as setting a framework for good property industry practice. The association says that the package of measures is a firm basis for fair tenancy laws and that the government is sending a strong message to shopping centre landlords that they can no longer take advantage of tenants at the end of a lease. The association urges the states and territories to cooperate with the Commonwealth government in enacting harmonised retail shop lease legislation across Australia. Mr Robert Bastian, Chief Executive of the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, says: The government has responded to all of the Reid recommendations and then tossed in a set of steak knives. I'm very happy with it. He says that the proposal to direct the ACCC to conduct test cases against unscrupulous larger firms is most welcome. Mr Bastian says that, in the view of his council, the package of measures is not bad news for big business because a strong and vibrant small business the concept sector is good for everybody. The Australian Business Chamber has congratulated the minister for coming up with a comprehensive statement which would deal with what the chamber describes as the vast majority of areas of breakdown in relations between 'big and small business without resorting to a too heavy reliance on blackletter law. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry says that the government has demonstrated its determination to meet head-on the problems of some areas of small business but cautions that it is essential that there is careful and regular monitoring of the impact of the new provisions in order to ensure that the objectives are being achieved and that there are no unintended consequences. The Motor Trades Association goes as far as to say that the measures are the most exciting decisions made on behalf of small business for decades. The view of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia is that the measures to amend the Trade Practices Act to protect small business proprietors from unconscionable conduct are particularly welcome and demonstrate: . . . more than anything else the present ment's genuine commitment to the small business sector. The Executive Director of the Service Station Association, Mr Marcus Kollington, is reported as saying that the proposed changes will save thousands of service stations from closing and will stop their employees losing their jobs. On the other hand, criticism has come from some groups representing retail tenants who are concerned that there is as yet no mandatory code, underpinned by legislation, to protect them from overbearing landlords, while franchisees will have such a code to protect them from franchisors. The United Retailers Association says that the government's proposal to release a nationally negotiated set of principles for the states and territories to consider may mean very little to retail tenants who have no certainty that the states and territories will reach agreement. The association remains concerned about key issues of security of tenure, disclosure of turnover and recovery of outgoings. In contrast to the flood of praise from the small business sector, the Property Council of Australia challenges the principle of the bill, namely, that small businesses should be treated like consumers when entering into contracts worth less than $1 million. While they generally welcome the initiative, the council says that businesses become involved with each other for a mutual advantage and therefore each must be responsible for their actions and each is obliged to look after their own interests. The Property Council of Australia says that small businesses are not end consumers but, like all businesses, make money out of end consumers. The council also expresses concern that the proposed $1 million threshold is too high and will provide unnecessary protection to larger businesses against market forces. This may also be inconsistent with the government's own definition of a small business. The Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry, VECCI, while generally welcoming the package says that the extended unconscionability provision should apply only to proven problem areas such as governretail tenancies and franchising, and not across the whole commercial spectrum. In all other areas VECCI favours self-regulation and voluntary codes of practice for the reason that a statutory unfairness provision has historically been of no help to small business. The Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants describes the government's package as commendably strong in some parts but woefully weak in others. The society argues that the government should do more to encourage greater competition in small business financing. The government has gone some way to fulfilling the promises made in its small business election policy entitled A New Deal for Small Business. While the package of new measures has been generally welcomed by the small business sector, there are concerns about the extent of the measures and about how the package will work in practice. Importantly, the minister must dispel the confusion that has arisen from his proposed unconscionability test and clarify what standard of commercial conduct is sought by the government. The basic standard of business conduct is the thread that ties the government's package together. Any law that gives businesses more opportunity to reopen contracts will create uncertainty and nervousness in the marketplace. The government must produce a regime, whether by appropriate legislation or by sensible use of codes of practice, in which commerce can flourish, while accommodating the concerns of business, both large and small, for the ultimate benefit of consumers.",65
212,Mr BARRESI,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"In the last 20 months, this parliament has passed a number of very important pieces of legislation. Government members along with the general public remember the 1996 election campaign when the coalition campaigned very successfully on three key issues: jobs, families and small business. I am proud to say that it is the coalition that has best represented and continues to best represent the philosophies and aspirations of Australia's small business owners. The Howard government, through its reforms, is doing much for the hundreds of thousands of individuals and their families who derive their livelihood from small business activity. The coalition, unlike the previous government, with its dismal performance, is governing in the interests of small business. Across a number of policy areas we have introduced reforming legislation. The Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill is just one of those measures. We are cutting the burden of red tape, reducing the impact of capital gains tax and reforming unfai.r disrni-s­ al laws. It is these reforms, combmed wIth responsible economic management, th-t are making a real difference. We are making a dramatic and positive difference to a sector of our economy that employs thousands of Deakin residents and is a key to providing additional employment opportunities for my region. Deakin's small businesses appreciate and understand the government's agenda for their sector. Recently the President of the Ringwood Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Mr Louis Blank, publicly stated: The coalition government is endeavouring to ensure small business is given a fair go in a very tough business environment. They acknowledge that assistance to small business is vital to sustained economic recovery. That is true. As part of their ongoing work, small businesses often have to deal directly with larger businesses. In most situations those involved, both small and large, experience few problems. But, as we know, the commercial world is not perfect. Mutual advantage is not always present in commercial dealings. For years the small business sector has been crying out for greater protection from the inappropriate use of big business muscle. The Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill addresses this power imbalance. Correcting this imbalance is important, as fair conduct between firms, big and small, is a critical factor contributing to business growth and economic prosperity. This bill is one part of the government's response to the fair trading inquiry entitled Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia, otherwise known as the Reid report. Our response, known as A new deal, a fair deal provides confidence and certainty for the future. The major benefits of A new deal, a fair deal include prohibiting unconscionable or unfair conduct under the Trade Practices Act, new protection for small business franchisees through a mandatory and stronger franchising code of conduct, a safety net of minimum legislative standards to protect retail tenants and stronger. enforcement of small business fair trading rights by the ACCC. The most talked about measure and the one to which I will direct the bulk of my attention is that of unconscionable conduct. Under the Trade Practices Act consumers already have protection from unconscionable conduc.t. Through this bill the Howard government IS extending this protection to cover the small business sector. Small businesses will now also be legally protected against unconscionable conduct. No doubt there will be much debate about what constitutes unconscionable conduct, and the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) certainly touched on some of the issues that surround this debate. The Macquarie Dictionary, which is very popular this week for definitions, defines the word 'unconscionable' as '1. unreasonably excessive. 2. not in accordance with what is just or reasonable.' in simple terms, in the language of Mr and Mrs Trader or the average businessperson in my electorate, unconscionable could be described as unfair conduct. The power imbalance is most evident in the retail trading sector. I am sure the average small business retailer-franchisee can quickly explain to most members here the difficulties they have had with shopping centre landlords. There is ample evidence to demonstrate that small retail tenants in larger shopping centres have suffered disproportionately when compared to their larger retailing neighbours. Over the years the centre managers-big businesses with hundreds of millions of dollars invested in property-and their teams of lawyers and accountants have been accused of excessive behaviour in their treatment of small business tenants. My experiences in Deakin and elsewhere demonstrate that retail tenants are all too willing to readily describe such practices. For example, it is not uncommon to hear of such things as automatic rental increases without regard to turnover or profitability; huge set-up and ongoing capital costs; forced relocations within centres without adequate compensation; and the frustration of having to compete with new businesses within the same shopping centre on unequal terms. The fair trading inquiry received numerous submissions from small businesses which were being disadvantaged in their dealings with big businesses. One does not need to delve too deeply into some of the causes of such disadvantages. For example, much of this unfair business conduct arises from the inadequate disclosure of information and the imbalance of bargaining power between parties prior to making an agreement. It can also arise from a prospective tenant's eagerness to beat their competition and finalise a new lease. After his appointment, the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith), to his credit, actively consulted with the small business sector. During this period I was able to pass on the concerns and opinions of my business constituents. Their demands for a strong and effective response to the Reid report's recommendations were overwhelming. To the minister's credit once again, the government accepted the validity of the many arguments presented. The government listened and, with the introduction of this legislation, has delivered much needed reform. The Trade Practices Act, once amended, will be strengthened and better able to protect the rights of small businesses. Deakin's business people will be confident that, as they deal with large firms, they will do so under rules that are fair and that, when the rules broken, redress is available. To this end, I am pleased that the government proposes to appoint immediately two associate commissioners to the ACCC to specifically look after the interests of small business and in time, when a vacancy exists, to appoint a full-time small business commissioner. Unfortunately for some, these amendments come too late. For those who have fallen through the system and who will not benefit from these amendments, I say to them: look to the former Labor government and their failure to respond to your needs. In one example that has come to my attention a large company had the power to do what it wanted. It did as it pleased, completely disregarding a long standing business relationship. Callous disregard was shown towards my constituent who was a small operator. The large company simply wanted its own way. The business was sold from under the owner's feet at great personal and financial cost. Because of such conduct, we are not only finding families financially broken but also finding the actual family relationship itself destroyed. This is not an isolated case, and I am sure that most members would be able to recount similar cases. But Labor should not be excused for their record. We should firmly point the finger at the opposition for their neglect over the last 13 years. The Australian Labor Party do not speak with a credible voice on this important issue. Their sudden embrace of small business issues can be contrasted to their actions whilst in government. Over 13 years their efforts amounted to the fine total of 17 reports! They now propose an 18th. Procrastination is their response to my small business constituents; lots of rhetoric, but no legislative action. For the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) now to propose amendments to this bill is a Johnny-come-lately approach. For 13 years they had the chance not only to put up amendments but also to introduce one of their bills in response to one of their reports. The opposition spokesman even admitted in his speech in the second reading debate that the unfairness or imbalance has existed for far too long. Given that fact, I pose the question: are why didn't they do something about it years ago? Was it due to their ineptness, was it due to their complete lack of understanding of small business or was it due to their superb ability to put off the hard decisions? It was probably a mix of all three. We heard today that their proposal is to bring small business under the Commonwealth corporations power. By doing so, they are simply slapping a further tax on small business. We heard the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business say that this will result in a land tax. That is the opposition's response to the needs of small business. One thing is for certain: Deakin's small business owners and their employees cannot afford to trust Labor ever again. They cannot afford to wait for the dawn of Labor's false hope. I say to those that lean towards a party that has in its platform the aim of the 'democratic socialisation of industry production, distribution and exchange': watch out; you cannot trust their populist, whatever-it-takes policies. Their credibility on this issue, with others raised in this parliament, is non-existent. What they say now will be changed tomorrow, or at best referred to another inquiry. Their opposition to this bill is just another sleight on the working men and women of Deakin. Their amendments are not practical and it is unlikely they will be supported by the courts. In their recent policy launch they have even taken the word 'small' out of small business policy. That is how much they relate to the sector. The Deakin electorate is well served by retail facilities.",67
213,Mr CADMAN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,And its member.,70
214,Mr BARRESI,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I thank very much the member for Mitchell. There are two large suburban shopping centres-Forest Hill Chase and Eastland in Ringwood. Throughout the suburbs of Croydon, Heathmont, Mitcham, Ringwood, Nunawading and Blackburn there are numerous smaller shopping precincts. In fact, the Maroodah Highway-Whitehorse Road corridor is considered the retail hub of the east. Various tenants and traders have over time expressed various concerns to me. The Ringwood Chamber of Commerce and Industry ran a well attended and valuable business barometer meeting earlier this year. Whilst their concerns crossed many different issues and involved all levels 'of government, one cannot deny their very valid fears. Retailers have been particularly concerned over issues such as misrepresentation, undue influence, duress, good faith and unconscionable conduct. However, given the importance of these issues, it would be wrong to assume that shopping centre owners or franchisors are always the bogymen of small business. These organisations also have shareholders-very often mum and dad investors and superannuant retirees, many who live within my electorate. These stakeholders also create pressures to perform to get good financial results. In considering these pressures, the government is convinced that the court should not overturn contracts between traders and landlords, particularly where such contracts were entered into with full information and especially in circumstances where there was adequate opportunity for the parties to walk away if along faced with unacceptable demands. Landlords are free to drive a hard bargain. However, landlords are not free under our government to act unconscionably. State and federal governments have different roles and regulatory responsibilities. Both of these are important, and these laws create a business environment that is fair and open to all. I am pleased that in cooperation with the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business the states will soon be sitting down with our minister to discuss retail tenancy laws. I am also pleased that last week the Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett, introduced the Retail Tenancies Reform Bill which strengthens the tenant's position in lease negotiations. This is real change taking place through cooperation between the Commonwealth government and the state government as opposed to the opposition's intended tactic of simply stretching the Corporations Law, which results in another tax on small business. This bill is meant to bring about a behaviour change in dealings between large and small business, ensuring that contractual dealings are carried out on a more equitable basis. At the same time, it does not compromise the basic legal and economic principles of our free enterprise economy. The key is still that a trader has to be in a position of special disadvantage. From the landlord's perspective, it is reassuring to know the amendment will not provide contractual relief simply because of a difference in the bargaining power of the parties. Traders in Deakin have welcomed the practical application of this legislation. The bill provides $480,000 to the ACCC to conduct test cases to determine the scope of existing and new Trade Practices Act provisions. I am sure that, over time, in addition to these test cases, court cases will arise. I do, however, hope that such cases are rare. It is inevitable in our democratic system that people will tum to the courts. When these cases do arise, these changes will benefit and protect the majority of Deakin's small retailers, 300 of whom are based in the two large shopping centres. This legislation, through proposed section 51AC, contains 10 criteria for unconscionable conduct. They include the bargaining positions of the parties, whether undue influence or pressure was applied, compliance with any applicable industry code and the extent to which both parties acted in good faith, all of which will provide greater certainty and protection for small businesses. I would like to say a word on the much discussed issue of franchising. Many of Deakin's businesses are also franchise operations. This is particularly the case in the larger shopping centres and for those businesses based along the Whitehorse Road corridor. To many prospective small businesses, franchising offers many advantages as compared with establishing a stand-alone business. Purchasing a franchise broadens a business's customer base. It offers marketing and advertising advantages and, in most cases, innovative products and services. Franchising has fuelled the very significant growth of the small business sector in recent years. The government's package for small business requires compliance with the new franchising code of practice. Industry codes of practice offer flexibility in addressing issues of business practice. These codes will work better as the coalition has addressed the key concern of their enforceability. Voluntary codes and industry developed regulation will still remain. Where codes fail and there are significant levels of undesirable behaviour, government will prescribe a code to limit unfair business conduct. This legislation implements this beneficial change. The Trade Practices Act will now apply to all franchisors. A breach of a prescribed code will give complainants access to remedies and sanctions contained in the act. A new Franchising Policy Council will also be established to monitor and review the code and provide advice on its effectiveness. The coalition is improving the environment in which Australia's small business operate. Responsible, economic management, along with policy reform, aims to create an environment in which small business can be profitable and successful. This bill is just one part of the reform equation. It is, however, an important part. It seeks to ensure small business has an even chance, it offers real encouragement to Deakin's small retailers and it offers them greater incentive to rise to the many business challenges ahead. Accordingly, business owners will be free to take additional risks, which in turn will mean more jobs and improved living standards. On that note, I commend this bill to the House. I say to the member for Cunningham that if he is really serious about his amendments all he should do is go back to his amendments and look at point one, which denounces this government for not reflecting the intentions or recommendations of the committee. I pose this last question to the member for Cunningham, and it is the answer to his amendment. I ask the member: which past ALP committee reports and recommendations on small business were ever introduced in this parliament, acted upon and turned into an act which benefits small business? The answer to that is none, zilch. There were 17 reports, with the promise of an 18th. The small businesses of Deakin demand and want more. This bill, introduced by the coalition, responds to their very demands and needs.",70
215,Unknown,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Sitting suspended from 6.28 p.m. to 8.00 p.m.  inde«d a pleasure to speak on the Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill. I the notice the House is particularly packed, anxiously awaiting my contribution. Mr Andrew-All your fans are here.  Chief Government Whip so unkindly points out. I think it is important from the outset to get a couple of things on the record. Firstly, the opposition does not oppose this bill. Indeed, we have been very enthusiastic about the good work the Reid committee did in their fair trading inquiry report, which was enthusiastically welcomed on both sides of the House. I congratulate the government for bringing forward this bill for small business. Other bills have been introduced into the parliament but, regrettably, have not seen the light of day. It is true that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) introduced some private members bills but, again, the government chose not to accord them precedence, which would have allowed them to be debated. Again, I congratulate the government on introducing this bill. What are the concerns that I as an opposition member have? I am afraid to say they are many. I think it is important that the House understands that small business is one sector that this government has sought to make its own in the lead-up to the last election and of course since the election. We are constantly hearing the refrain of not only how important small business is to Australia-and it is, with nearly half of all jobs in the economy residing with small business-but also how responsive this government is to the needs of small business. My first area of disappointment-and I cannot understand the lemming like quality of government backbenchers who have allowed this-is the definition of small business being set at $1 million. In other words, if a contract is $1,000,001, it is outside the purview of this bill. We do have the ABS standard of definition for small business. It is very easy and it is not a monetary definition. It refers to the number of employees. The Australian Bureau of Statistics defines as a small business a company in the manufacturing sector with 100 or fewer employees or a company in a non-manufacturing industry or service industry with 20 or fewer employees. There would not be too many farms with more than 20 employees. All the farmers in your electorate, Madam Deputy Speaker, could be potentially covered by this bill. What have the National Party-the once great Country Party-done to stand up for farmers in rural Australia in terms of this trading bill? Sold them out. They will not use the ABS definition. I expected the Liberal Party to roll over. They are always on the side of big business, and this particular bill just shows how much they are in the clutches of big business. A neighbour of mine, the honourable member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly), likes to survey her electorate. I suggest that she writes to all small business and ask them whether they would like a definition of $1 million in a contract or the ABS definition. In my own electorate very few businesses would be precluded from the operation of this legislation if we adopted the ABS definition. It would be interesting if the line of government lemmings who are to get up and speak on this bill would share with the House just a mere morsel or crumb as to why they rolled over in relation to this definition. What great benefit will the country have by having such a narrow definition of $1 million? Of course, speaker after speaker has pointed out that, if someone enters into a five-year contract or a lO-year contract about leasing or machinery, for example-which businesses often do-it is not hard at all to get to $1 million. One million dollars sounds like an awful lot of money to ordinary people, and indeed it is, but I am afraid in business it is not hard to get there. So I ask government members: why have you sold out on the definition? Don't be embarrassed by us. We are going to move an amendment that will seek to put that definition back in and make sure small business and farmers get the coverage they should from this bill. I have heard a lot of speakers talk about why it is so important that we use this bill's definition of unconscionable conduct-that is, the unconscionable conduct between medium and big business and small business and farmers. They have said, 'Look, there is no problem with it. Don't worry about it. It really means that they get a fair go.' I wish it were so simple. I wish this were the truth of the matter. The opposition has abandoned unconscionable as being too tough a test and believes that the proposition that every Australian understands 'fairness' or 'a fair go' fair and is therefore a much better definition. What does unconscionable mean? It has a strict legal definition. This definition is not to be found in Webster's, the Encyclopedia Britannica or the Macquarie Dictionary. It has actually been established by legal cases. The library has put out a publication that lists some of them-and I do not want to go through all of them: Kitto J. in Blomley v. Ryan in the High Court; Merkel J. in Gregg v. Tasmanian Trustees Ltd 1997, et cetera. These are all decided cases that go to establish the conventional legal definition of unconscionable conduct. I would like to ask government members opposite how many of them feel that small business is going to be protected or come under these categories: ignorance of material facts known to the other party. Maybe. eracy or a lack of education. Again, I would think business people-and there are some notable, very successful business people who are illiterate-would rely on their advisers. But if there are a whole heap of small busido nesses that are going to use this, please, government members, tell us. Poverty or of any kind. Age-that is, I presume, that are in your 70s, 80s or 90s. Infirmity of or mind. How many small retailers in disputes with their landlords will be able or expected to be able to use infirmity of body or mind? Is it one per cent of cases or two per cent of cases? I would be indebted to the minister to let me know. The next is a beauty-drunkenness. I am not saying that I am not a wowser, that I am rent. against drinking, and I know small businessmen do not have anything against drinking, but I do not think too many contracts are being done when one of the parties is absoas lutely drunk. How many cases do government members know of? Lack of assistance or tenant explanation where these are necessary. tional dependence-that is, where a spouse being pressured to sign a guarantee for a partner's business loan. This is not my definition of unconscionable. It is really important that if not you then small business and farmers out there in Australia, in voter land, understand that these are the grounds that are being offered to them in the bill. But the Labor Party is being sell attacked for wanting to replace unconscionthat able with a proposition of fairness or a fair go. But it is being said that we are unreasonwill able, that we do not understand small ness. I do not think we are unreasonable. I do not think it is unreasonable. I think fairness is a pretty good determinant. People can understand the concept of giving people a fair go. I think they would welcome that as a system under which to operate. The retail tenancy code needs to be thrashed out between the Commonwealth and the state ministers with responsibility in this area. Already, some of the newspapers are suggesting-I regret to say, I think, accurately-that we are having a minimalist approach to this. This is not going to provide the Illitprotection that we are looking for. A lot of Australians just do not understand, with the advent of shopping centres and the way they are dominating retailing, the precarious position of the tenants. Firstly, they just not sign up for a fixed rent. In a low inflationary age, it is not uncommon to see need eight per cent increases per annum. This you government and, more latterly, the last body government can take some satisfaction from the low inflationary environment in which we live-two per cent; three per cent. Why then should their rental go up by eight per cent. Is that fair? But, in many cases, there is not only a fixed element of the rental but also a second part based on turnover. So the more successful you are as a tenant, the more you pay in It is true that shopping centres provide high volume shopping traffic and that tenants are benefited by being located in shopping centres opposed to outside them. But under the present regime it is quite possible that a can be given very short notice and told Emoto move shop. Who picks up the refitting is costs? It is not the shopping centre but the tenant. Even if the tenant believes he is going to a less desirable spot, he has no rights to argue. That is a terrible position. Secondly, the thing that makes small business is building up goodwill in the business. We have rightly heard that from both sides of the House in this debate. If a tenant wants to out of the business, it is really important they have that goodwill. But at the end of a lease there is no guarantee that their lease be renewed. You can be a long-term busitenant and suddenly find you are out of favour and booted out of the shopping centre. These things may not necessarily be redressed in this minimalist approach being adopted by the government. r would hope that the one Liberal Party member opposite, the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin), would agree with me that these things need to be addressed. I have had a bit to do with the Banking Industry Ombudsman. Here we see the supreme hypocrisy of not only the Liberal Party but also the National Party. They have agreed-and I do not disagree with this-that the ombudsman should now be able to look at small business and farm cases, and not before time. I have to say that this Banking Industry Ombudsman and his council have never once in their seven years of operation seen the necessity to extend their terms of reference. This has been forced on the Banking Industry Ombudsman. I have been critical of the Banking Industry Ombudsman, and I have put on the Notice Paper that there should be an inquiry into his operations and effectiveness. Indeed, the committee that the now Serjeant-at-Arms was secretary to is the relevant committee. I regret to say that the government has not permitted this to be taken on. You are going to extend the powers of the operation of the Ombudsman-and so you should; we support you in that-but you will not allow an inquiry into his operations and effectiveness to judge his performance and to see what he has done well and what he has done poorly. Do not think that there are not many things that he is doing poorly, not the least of which is not being able to see the necessity to extend his own jurisdiction. I think all too often, unfortunatea ly, he is an apologist for the banks. But the irony is this: neither the small businessmen come under the national credit code. In other words, when they make a contract with a bank, or a financing organisation-better get the new Wallis terms rights-they have no protection under the national credit code. Wouldn't you think all the government members who are speaking on this bill would be arguing to extend the national credit code to small business-in the Liberal Party case-and to farmers and small business in the National Party case? I have never heard that argument once. They do not care. And here is the rub: if there is a breach under the national credit code, banks can be liable to fines of up to half a million dollars, and under the Ombudsman I think it is a maximum of $130,000. But what is he going to say? He will say, 'I cannot apply the higher standards that are represented in the national credit code.' I have a case of an ordinary constituent-not a small businessman; not a farmer-who, regrettably, had a contract concluded prior to the introduction of this code. What did the Ombudsman say? 'I shall have no regard for the higher standards in the national credit code.' Wouldn't you think the National Party-the once great Country Party that would stand up as a coalitionist to the Liberal Party-would demand that farmers be included under the national credit code. I am waiting for the next government member to speak and I will be pleased to listen to his reasons as to why small businesses are not being included-why they have no regard for the protection offered under that. And whilst the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Reith, is arguing with his state counterparts, why isn'the arguing that we extend the national credit code? I hope the opposition in the Senate moves appropriate amendments. I would be really pleased. We hear the Treasurer (Mr Costello) talk about low interest rates, and I think they are great. We often hear him boast about how this is benefiting home owners, and indeed it is. But, of course, what he forgets to tell you is that only 25 per cent of the population have mortgage. So what happens to the other 75 per cent? Do they get that $300 a month farmers nor benefit? Of course they do not. What are the banks doing? In some cases, they are increasing fees and charges by 100 per cent. And what have the coalition-the Liberal Party and the National Party-said about the role of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. They have said, 'Oh, no, we can't have you looking at this increase of fees for ordinary citizens. We can't have you looking at the fee increases for farmers. Oh, no, don't report to us on the fee increases for small business. We don't want that information. Oh, goodness, no. We might have to do something about such outrageous increases in fees.' What a lemming-like, mute backbench the government has. Madam Deputy Speaker, one of the pleasures in this parliament was to sit with people such as Bob Katter Sr; the former member for Lyne, Bruce Cowan; Clarrie Millar; and, indeed, your predecessor, the former member for Dawson, Mr Braithwaite. I worked with him on a committee. He moved, and I seconded, that banks and other financial institutions should not be allowed to charge legal fees as expenses. There ought to be some incentive for them to settle, but not in a court process. Why, with all their assets, should they be able to line up against farmers and small businessmen with a wealth of legal representation, the cost of which they could not care less about. Is there anything about this in this legislation? Where is the National Party standing up for them? (Time expired)",71
216,Mr W AKELIN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I enjoyed, as I always do, the enthusiasm and the great passion with which the member for  But I want to say a couple of words on banking. I come from the state of South Australia and there was a party-I think it was the Labor Party-which actually had responsibility for our state bank. About $3 billion to $3.5 billion later, after that bank went broke, South Australia's taxpayers are still paying off the debt-and they will be for many decades yet. I have long experience of Labor's banking controls---or lack of controls.  national credit code?",75
217,Mr W AKELIN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I am making the point that sometimes we tend to look at the smaller issues when we should be looking at the bigger picture. The banking system in Australia has gone through significant shock, particularly in Victoria and South Australia. Whatever we might like to think in opposition-and it is easy to attack the current government's mode-I remind the House that the Labor Party had some fairly serious problems in managing the banking system of Australia. If you were to check the interest rate records, you would find that the lack of competition in the banking system contributed a lot more towards much higher interest rates than should have been the case. Since this government has come to power, we have seen significant improvements in the margins. In the housing market alone there has been something like a four per cent reduction. Part of that is due to the sound economic policy of this government, but some of it is due to the very strong competition within the banking sector. There have been many pluses in the way in which this government has administered the banking system. I turn to the Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997, which was introduced into the House on 30 September 1997 in response to the Reid report Finding a balance. I would like to make a few general comments to outline the other elements of the government's small business agenda. These measures underline the sincerity with which this bill is framed and demonstrate the government's commitment to Australian small business. Already small business has been buoyed by five interest rate cuts which have brought interest rates to their lowest point in decades. Inflation is anchored at two per cent or less, and growth is estimated to be 3.75 per cent this year. Furthermore, business investment grew by 16 per cent last year. In March this year, the government introduced its More time for business package to begin the task of resuscitating small business throughout the country. That package saw commitments made to the simplification of tax compliance; the provision of easier access to government information and compliance requirements; greater transparency and accountability in regulatory processes; improvement in business approvals and registrations; new client service standards for the public service; and reform of local, state and Commonwealth rules and regulations. What is more, the government is committed to real tax reform. Changes to the capital gains tax, the fringe benefits tax and other taxes have already given small business an annual $600 million windfall. That represents $600 million available for new investment and job creation-not to mention the confidence that it is creating. I think we have started to see that evolve in recent weeks. I am sure it will improve in the new year. Other innovative measures have included the Workplace Relations Act 1996 and its vital changes to the job destroying unfair dismissal laws that are a legacy of the Keating-Beazley government, and the innovation investment fund. The government has also addressed the significant problems caused by the lack of highly skilled employees by revitalising traineeships and apprenticeships. The government has now turned its attention to the problem of unfair business practices. I tum to the purpose of the bill. The bill amends the Trade Practices Act 1974 to prohibit unconscionable conduct in commercial relations between small and large businesombudsman ses, and allows industry codes of practice to be prescribed and, where necessary, enforced as mandatory industry codes. No doubt many previous speakers have highlighted the ALP's struggle with the issue of unfair business practices over almost four years. In 1992 the Trade Practices Act was amended. by Labor to try to deal with the notion of 'unconscionable conduct'. This attempt, however; was flawed. Fundamentally, this initial amendment failed to take into consideration the unique disadvantage of small businesses in dealing with much larger companies. It took another three years of meandering committees and delayed reports, but even Labor came to realise that this situation could not continue as it was. Introduced on 29 November 1995, the Trade Practices Amendment (Better Business Conduct) Bill was intended to protect small business from 'harsh or oppressive' conduct. In short, it was designed to correct Labor's own failure of three years before. Not surprisingly, the bill lapsed with the calling of the federal election in March 1996. Yet-and bear in mind the failure of Labor to protect small business for 13 years-Labor had the arrogance to reintroduce the bill as a private member's bill. This government's approach to such reform is in stark contrast to this failure. The report produced by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology Finding a balance was warmly received by all in small business. Its recommendations were carefully considered by the government and a response produced in September of this year. That response is far ranging in its measures and includes the following: firstly, a retail tenancies safety net-national reform of retail tenancy laws, with additional minimum standards for retail tenancy; secondly, franchising reform-a new mandatory code of practice, a franchising policy council, and the appointment of a dispute resolution adviser; thirdly, access to justice and enforcementappointment of two small business associate commissioners and, ultimately, a full-time small business commissioner and a new code of conduct enforcement unit; fourthly, access to finance-extension of the banking industry to small business matters; and, fifthly, education and information. The response of the government also focused on the reform of the Trade Practices Act through four different areas of amendment: firstly, a new provision to give small business genuine access to protection against unconscionable conduct; secondly, a new provision to allow industry designed codes of practice in full or in part to be prescribed as mandatory or voluntary codes and enforced under the act; thirdly, a new provision which will allow the ACCC to take representative actions against misuse of market power; and, fourthly, a new provision which will give small business interests equal importance with consumer interests when appointments are made to the ACCC. This bill addresses the first two issues. The remainder are currently under negotiation between the Commonwealth, the states and local government. Business conduct deemed to be unconscionable will be prohibited-an extension of the common law doctrine of unconscionability expressed in the Trade Practices Act at present. In the past there has been considerable debate over what to term the unfair conduct engaged in by large corporations. This amendment bill uses the expression 'unconscionable conduct' because in this way the legislation can build upon the already considerable bank of case law which has worked well in the past with reference to consumer matters. In order to make sure it is small business which benefits from this reform, the new provision will be limited to transactions not exceeding $1 million. Furthermore, publicly listed companies cannot take advantage of the provision. In short, this bill will mean that small business people, the lifeblood of this nation's economy-and, after all, there are over 12,500 self-employed business men and women in my electorate-will be entitled to the same legal protection currently accorded to Australia's consumers. But this reform is not simply a long awaited benefit for Australia's small businesses. The implementation of these reforms will aliow small business to confidently deal with the large firms with which they compete and cooperate on a daily basis. Those small businesses can act safe in the knowledge that the rules of the game are fair and that, unlike vious governments, this government is not beholden to big business interests. It is only kind of commercial environment that will allow small businesses to do what they do best-employ Australians, particularly young Australians. Surely this is the kind of result all Australians, including all members of this House, should be interested in and supportive of. '",75
218,Mr FILING,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"In speaking on the Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997, I want, first of all, to make some observations about the behaviour of governments in relation to some of their government business enterprises when it comes to unconscionable conduct. Although Telstra has been privatised by one-third, it happens to be one of the government business enterprises with one of the worse records as far as unconscionable conduct to either its clients or its users is concerned. Because of its size and ability to exercise its strength, its muscle, in relation telecommunications, telephony and the like, it is in a position where it can, in many instances, make things extremely difficult for those in competition, for instance, in the case of Internet service providers who are competing with i\. Telstra business that provides the same service but who are purchasing the telephone lines from Telstra itself. So, in actual fact, Telstra has a substantial conflict of interest-a conflict of interest that, I might say, would not be permitted in the United States under its particular system of antimonopoly regulations. The other day I posed a question to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) in relation to the super surcharge-a tax by another name but, in essence, another impost on small businessand its impact on a small business in Western Australia.. ·That business employs around 80 people and has around 38 people in its superannuation scheme. And yet that business was faced with the problem that to pass on $6,000 in super surcharge to the federal government would co-t it around $5,000 in administrative costs. This included, for instance, a $3,000 pre- cost fora' certificate from the AMP Society, which is responsible for the administration of this the superannuation scheme. As I said, this certificate costs $3,000, and the rest of the administrative costs were around $5,000. That is just to collect $6,000 which was for one, or possibly two. of the members in their superannuation: scheme. The federal government tells us that it is striving towards reducing the impost on small businesses to allow them to be able to properly compete, to profit and to employ because obviously small business is still the powerhouse of employment in Australia. But at the same time the government is madly adding to the imposts, the costs of administration, on those businesses. One of the first things that the government did in fulfilling an election promise was to wack another great slab of administrative burden onto small business with the family tax initiative. These sorts of things add so mu<;:h infuriating bureaucratic red tape to the operation of a small business that people start to wonder whether or not it to is, in fact. worth being in business. They seriously question themselves as to whether they want to stay in business basically operating as an agency for the tax office or as another branch of the bureaucracy of the federal government. That is only the federal government's imposts. When you add on local and state government imposts, the burden is almost intolerable. When you consider that people risk their homes and life savings in order to go into business and, hopefully, to employ other people in the community, and when you consider the aggravation and the sorts of impediments placed in the way of small business by all three sections of government administration, it increases your admiration for people who actually stick with it to make their businesses succeed. This bill is a consequence of one of the most important and best reports produced by the parliament in recent times, The undertone of the report Finding a balance is towards trading in Australia. All the committee members are to ,be commended, but special praise should be directed towards the committee chairman, the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid). He steered the report through hundreds of submissions from business organisations and the public. Finding a balance is a visionary report, and Mr Reid is a visionto nought. ary. It is a shame that he is not in the ministry, because I think le should be. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mrs Sullivan) looks up at me. I have a lot of time for her as well. I think she would make a good minister. Mrs Sullivan-You'd have us all on the front bench.",77
219,Mr FILING,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"No, I would not. In fact, there are a few I would not have there at all-and I will not name them. I was just making a comment. That is the trouble: when you offer praise, sometimes people just cannot take it. Obviously, with you Kathy, flattery will get you nowhere. Mr O'Keefe-it's always a poisoned chalice in this place.",78
220,Mr FILING,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"The member for Burke having had experience with a government that was a poisoned chalice, the previous Keating government, is in a good position to comment on that. He would know, of course, that nearly all the Labor Party, with a few exceptions, were racing around the countryside, disowning the former Prime Minister and divorcing themselves as fast as they could from the term 'Labor government'. In fact, many of them were trying to represent themselves as being independent in order to save themselves from the tidal wave of public anger that arose following the re-election of the Keating government-in particular, the worse aspects of that government in its midterm. But there are large differencesMr O'Keefe-This is most unkind. I made a generous comment and look what you've done.",78
221,Mr FILING,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I have always been generous to the member for Burke. Now he is trying to stop me from getting on with what I was going to say. There are large differences between the committee report and the recomfair mendations from the government as its response to it. On the whole, however, the government ought to be commended for making the effort to do something for small businesses and improving their status in relation to fair trading. This is in stark contrast, in my view, to the convoluted processes of the previous government, which amounted What I would like to see though is a stronger effort in government to improve the lot of small business in regard to fair trading. But I fear that this may not occur in the life of this government. The difficulty is: who knows what the complexion of this House will be in the next government? It just may well be that the following government-and, hopefully, it will be a coalition government-Will be hidebound perhaps by not having the vast majority it has at this stage. One of the great tragedies of this particular government is the opportunity lost from having such a huge majority in the House. The timidity of some of its actions is quite amazing. Such a majority may not happen again for a long time. The explanatory memorandum outlines the purpose of this bill as being to amend the Trade Practices Act to allow for industry codes of practice to be prescribed and enforced and to prohibit what is called unconscionable conduct in relation to certain small business transactions. Unfortunately, it could be better described as amending the Trade Practices Act to allow for some industry codes of practice to be prescribed and for some of them to be enforced and to prohibit some unconscionable conduct in relation to a few speCified small business transactions. The government has made great store of the positive public responses from small business to Finding a balance. But one must be careful. Small business today, particularly in Australia, have suffered badly because of a lack of equity in their business relationships, especially with landlords, franchise headquarters, larger competitors, financial institutions and service providers-for instance, Telstra. In my view, it is one of the worse operators of a monopolistic type business enterprise. I believe that the positive but still small steps forward represented by this legislation should be taken in context. Small business can sometimes be compared to a starving person: they need balanced sustenance if they are to survive. They have gone through a long period without adequate nourishment and support and, instead of getting a treatment aimed at addressing their specific condition and bringing them back to full and productive health, they are offered something which may keep them alive for some time and they just pull off the inevitable rather than lay the foundation for a full and productive life where they can positively affect the circumstances of those around them. The title of the report at the base of this legislation is a bit of a give-away: 'finding a balance' and 'towards fair trading in Australia'. When the government talks about finding a balance, it is somewhat tom between the need to support its traditional electoral base-small business-and those people who bankroll the Liberal Party. John Howard believes small business is the powerhouse of the economy, with its enormous potential to improve national income, employment and standards of living, but its interests fundamentally conflict with the biggest donors to the Liberal Party. Ron Walker and others are always there to warn that without these large donors the government would not be able to finance a campaign that would win elections. I do not believe that anyone expects the government will get it completely right first time. Of course they will not. But I am afraid that, underlying their ambitions, the government intended only ever making initial tentative moves towards fair trading. The bill aims to institute strong industry codes to regulate activity on two levels-one within the business industry and the other between the industry and its consumers. I want to deal with each of these in tum. The retail industry believes that the size of the retail market is not increasing. There is a need to increase market share to stimulate growth and increase profits for shareholders through any method necessary. One method in WA, for instance, is to deregulate trading hours: Coles Myer-and I do not wish to single them out for continual criticism-are an example of how a large, almost monopolistic concern can have a stranglehold on retailing and its associated activities. In fact, there is a very substantial vertical connection between all of the aspects of manufacture: importing, wholesaling, transport, retailing and the sort of subsidiary elements associated with retailing operations. They make it extremely difficult for others to compete. In Western Australia, which is not a large retailing market compared with, say, the Victorian or New South Wales retail markets, you can see where companies like Coles Myer can have predatory trading or marketing practices that make it extraordinarily difficult for small businesses to compete. In many instances they are purchasing their products or goods at prices far higher than Coles Myer purchase them for. In some instances, Coles Myer will indulge in loss-leading in particular niche products. Of course, that makes it extraordinarily difficult for the small businesses that depend on those particular products for their main source of income. We increasingly see Coles Myer and Woolworths-I should not single out Coles Myer-go into areas which in the past have been the province of smaller retailing operations, perhaps more family based or, in some instances, professional based, where there has been a much closer relationship between the retailer and the consumer. No-one in their right mind is going to presume that we can tum back the clock and have the comer store as the dominant element in the retail sector. Of course not. But in some instances an for unhealthy trend is occurring where small businesses are being swallowed up very laid quickly, or muscled out of the marketplace, through the use of what I consider to be predatory marketing tactics. Sometimes it is unconscious, in the sense that they are not overtly predatory; they happen to be predatory because they are in a position to exercise enormous financial muscle in comparison their competitors.",78
222,Mr SLIPPER,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,Give us some examples.,80
223,Mr FILING,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"A good example is florists. In most places around Australia florists, small retailers, have had an effective niche market. They have provided a close, flexible service to their consumers. But, as soon as supermarvariable. kets or larger combines start getting into the operation, it makes it extraordinarily difficult because they have a far superior power that allows them to pass on their savings to their customers. In some instances, they can then corner a particular sector of that market by deliberately running at a loss, running close to a loss, which makes extraordinarily difficult for their competitors to survive. Government regulation does not help small operators necessarily. Sales tax for big panies like Coles Myer and Woolworths is paid on the value of goods as they go into company warehousing. For small businesses, whose margins do not allow them to maintain large stock levels, the tax is on the wholesale price they pay on the item as it comes out the warehouse. It often gives a price and profit advantage of significant proportion bigger players. In the report, much has been said by small business people about landlords. Predatory behaviour has been attributed to shopping centre landlords because of the charges and conditions they apply to tenants. Often, first major problem faced by tenants is rental arrangements. Rents are often charged almost at whim, based on an ability to pay. If a business becomes more profitable, rents are varied to generate the best return to the landlord and, even if performance is poor, rents may be varied to get rid of a tenant might not be able to generate a better income the landlord. All this occurs irrespective of conditions which are, in many instances, down in the original lease arrangements. Variable overheads are another source of concern. A landlord can share out costs such as air conditioning, council rates and charges and other expenses amongst the tenants. This is another instance where larger combines can extract far more favourable conditions from with the landlord, for obvious reasons. They occupy a greater floor space and, because of their size and their enormous financial power, they are in a much better position to be able to extract those types of conditions. Normally, variable overheads are stipulated in the contract, but by their nature they are highly The reality is that for many tenants the calculation of their share is seldom transparent enough for them to be able to properly purchasing see how it has been levied. I am aware of claims by tenants that any attempt to get a breakdown of variable overheads liabilities and how they are shared out or usually results in disciplinary action by a it manager who would threaten a lease or increase rent. I have also been told of fabricated variable overheads costs, up to 30 per cent higher than the real cost, passed on to tenants comwho are unwilling or unable to check their veracity. Undoubtedly, the origin of these problems is a lack of balance in power between the two parties. This is why the Finding a balance report has been anticipated with such great hope in the small business comof munity and why it has been sought to be neutered by big business through a quick to reversion to self-regulation. What can we say about the fairness of such an operation? Surely the shopping centre management has a responsibility to maximise profits for the landlord as well as stockholders. But is that, in the end, going to result in the a fair relationship? The fairness could be the illustrated using the parallel example of renting a home. In this case, your family is required to make a substantial financial outlay for improvements to the property as a sign of your goodwill towards the arrangement. Also, you must give an account of your monthly who income so that the landlord can best gauge the potential profit of the arrangement and vary the rent according to his view of your ability to pay. There are some instances of extraordinarily good relations between shopping centre management and their tenants. The manag-­ ment at the Whitford City Shopping Centre m my electorate, for instance, is a particularly enlightened one. I have had long conversations with the management about the way they gauge rental arrangements an- the suitability for people to take on shops m the first place. You may have a situation where a person sets up a shop in a shopping centre, and naturally they are going to write down the cost of the fit-out and other expenses over, say, a three-year lease. Part way through the lease they are in a position to sell - he business, and they sell the business for a profit-let us say the original set-up cost plus 30 per cent. That means the following owner has to write down, during the remainder of the lease period, the original cost plus 30 per cent, in a shorter period of time. T-at is difficult, and it means that the business IS less profitable for that owner. This is one of the dilemmas posed by the management of a shopping centre: how do you ensure that you are always on top of the likely consequences of these types of sales? No matter how much you regulate, there are always going to be some people who are prepared, with unscrupulous management, to enter into these arrangements without understanding the consequences. When you have an enlightened and professional management-as in the case of the Whitford City Shopping Centre-people are given the opportunity to understand. The manager there told me a number of people had been refused tenancies by him because he could se- that they. were going to have problems making a profIt and contributing towards the success of the shopping centre. They probably think he is the worse person in the world for refusing them, but he has probably saved them the considerable loss of their personal savings.",80
224,Mr SLIPPER,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,Does it have any vacant shops?,81
225,Mr FILING,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"No, it does not. The next subject. I was going to get to is a matter for local and state government regulation. One of the problems affecting retai- tenancy in my area is the plethora of shoppmg centre space available. In my area-a high growth, mortgage belt area-there seems to be a shopping centre opening every five minutes. The difficulty is that the planning scheme seems to be completely out of kilter with. prorer market expectations. We have a sItuatIOn where one shopping centre opens, the tenants get established and start moving towards making it profitable and all of a sudden another one opens down the road and virtually puts them out of business.",81
226,Mr SLIPPER,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,What's the solution?,81
227,Mr FILING,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"In my view, the solution is a much more sensible planning arrangement. It is one thing to regulate orprovide for better codes of practice in an industry which has a reputation for being predatory, but it is pointless if you have shopping centres opening every five minutes making it almost impossible for businesses to stay in business. In conclusion, the government hopes to go to a system of industry self-regulation once it has established a constructive ethos affecting small business. I contend that regulation remains at the hub of government functions. It must provide adequate protection in the longer term so that peo-le can - lan for .a long-term business operatIOn, not Just pro-It taking in the shorter term. If government faIls to do so, reversion to a situation similar to the current unfair environment will be swift and complete, simply because those with the financial power, driven by financial imperatives will be able to do so. Unfortunately, one - f the great features of our current retailing situation in Australia is the almost monopolistic and predatory practices of the large combines vis-a-vis the smaller niche markets which have been traditionally a part of the Australian shopping scene. (Time expired)",81
228,Mr SLIPPER,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"The Liberal-National Party government set up the fair trading inquiry, which was chaired by the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid). In doing so, the government struck a chord in the small business community and more than 200 submissions were received nationwide and over 50 organisations gave evidence in public hearings. It is to the credit of this government that, after one inquiry, it is prepared to implement the essence of the Reid report. The former government had some 17 inquiries or investigations into small business; yet, regrettably, absolutely nothing was done to assist small business which, as we all know, is the engine room of the Australian economy. The government will act on the recommendations made in the seven areas of reform identified by the Reid committee: unfair conduct, retail tenancy, franchising, misuse of market power, small business finance, access to justice and education. It is interesting that the government has implemented these recommendations, in whole or in part, according to the restraints on Commonwealth powers and the importance of delivering a policy outcome that maximises the benefits to small business while minimising counterproductive impacts on the sector. The minister pointed this out in his response to the fair trading inquiry. In some cases, the government has gone even further. The government has, through this bill, introduced amendments to the Trade Practices Act to protect small business in its dealings with big business. We are all about fairness. We appreciate that small business is absolutely vital to the economy and employment. The economy is heavily dependent on small business and the government appreciates this. We recognise and support the role that small business plays and has played in boosting jobs and employment opportunities. Of the 927,000 enterprises that make up the Australian economy, about 810,000 are private, non-agricultural businesses. Of these, some 97 per cent are small businesses. They generate about one-third-that is, about 33 per cent---of the gross domestic product of the country and account for 50 per cent of total employment. That is why we often say that the best way to create employment is to have a situation where small business is prepared to take a risk and put on extra staff. If small business is able to grow and invest then jobs will be created. Of course we, as a government, since March 1996, have built an environment where small business has been prepared to allow so many more people to get one foot on the employment ladder. It ought to be recognised that more than 3.6 million jobs in Australia have been created as a result of small business. Over the past decade, employment in the small business sector has been growing at the rate of about 3.6 per cent per annum, more than twice the national average. Small business is increasingly driving innovation in Australia. In the period we have been in government we have done a number of things to get the economic settings right, because the best way to assist small business is to have a healthy economy. It ought to be recognised that there have been five successive interest rate falls since March 1996. Interest rates are now at their lowest level in more than two decades and the interest rates that banks charge small businesses are at their lowest levels in 20 years. Underlying inflation is now running at two per cent or less. The economy is forecast to grow by 3.75 per cent in 1997 and 1998. The government is on course to deliver a structural budget surplus of $1.6 billion by 1998-99. Business investment grew by 16 per cent in 1996-97 and during the first six months of 1997 the economy was growing at an annualised rate of 3.7 per cent. There have now been 24 consecutive quarters of GDP growth-the longest period of expansion since these statistics have been collected. I am sick and tired of hearing the Labor Party bleat about small business and about how they were interested in small business. I think it is important to note the ALP's approach to fair trading during those 13 sad, sorry, dark years when the Labor Party occupied the treasury bench. It is a matter of absolute fact that the ALP in government was far more interested in cultivating big business and unions than small business. We all remember former Prime Ministers Keating and Hawke hobnobbing with those who were, in many cases, responsible for the corporate disasters of the 1980s. In the first four years of ALP government, from 1983, the ALP did not even have a small business minister. Can you believe that? There was not even a minister for small business in the parliament. For 13 years they could not be bothered representing small business in cabinet. For the whole of their tenure on the treasury bench they did not have small business represented in cabinet. In the cabinet where Mr Beazley sat, the same minister responsible for big business had to try to stand up and speak for small business. Of course, that was a recipe for absolute disaster. Is it any wonder that small business suffered so grievously during those 13 years of Labor rule? I suppose we ought to look at why the Labor Party was not interested in small business. Why was it that the Labor Party, for its first four years in office, did not bother have a small business minister? Why was it that for the 13 years they were in government they did not have a small business minister in cabinet? It ought to be recognised that small business is not an area of high union actIvity-and, of course, the Labor Party is only interested in unions and big business. I suspect that was why they were not interested in small business. Let us look for a moment at what the ALP government did give small business: the recession, which meant consumer spending fell and small business sales dollars were down. The Labor Party gave small business interest rates of up to 27.5 per cent, which meant that small business costs were up. The Labor Party gave small business an era where most of the problems with fair trading occurred. For example, when the ALP took over government, retailers' occupancy costs were about seven per cent of sales. When they left government those costs had doubled to 15 per cent of sales. Is it any wonder that large numbers of small businesses were finding it so difficult just to survive? The Labor Party was all about talk but nothing about action to deal with fair trading problems. We all remember Labor's job destroying unfair dismissal law. We all remember the way that successive Labor ministers admitted that they had got it wrong. They came in here and sought to amend the unfair dismissal law but, at the end of the day, small business still went to inordinate lengths to avoid putting on extra staff. To this day, the Labor Party continues to seek to frustrate the efforts of this government to amend the unfair dismissals law to make it one that is fair to employers and employees. To this day the ALP is frustrating the efforts of small business to put on extra staff. To this day, by refusing to pass our legislation through the parliament, the ALP is condemning many people to remain on the dole queues. That is unacceptable and the Australian people have seen through them. They continue to see through them and it is about time they woke up to themselves. Only in the last week of 13 years of Labor government did the former government to introduce any proposal into the parliament on fair trading, and it did this knowing that parliament could not pass this law before the election. It was therefore just a cynical political exercise designed to win and buy votes. We all know what the election result was in March 1996; and that ruse absolutely failed. It is about time the Labor Party realised that one cannot pull the wool over people's eyes. The ALP did not care about small business. When did one see the former Prime Minister out in shopping centres? Remember what he said about shopping centres? He said that he would not be a prime minister who tripped over TV camera cords in shopping centres. He steered clear of the fair trading issues and real people in shopping centres. The fair trading report was commissioned by the coalition government, not by the ALP. So the ALP has an absolutely sad and sorry record. We have looked at their record, and what did they say? The former Prime Minister said: If they're feeling the pinch, they are feeling it in the highest growth economy we ever had. We have been growing at five per cent to six per cent with two per cent inflation. So if they are feeling the pinch, they ought to say, 'small business is not for me', because it is never going to get any better. This is as good as it gets. To have an economy growing at five per cent with two per cent inflation is as good as it ever gets, so if they are feeling the pinch they have got to say 'I had better go back to PA YE employment.' That sums it all up. The legislation we are now debating will make things much better for small business. It will give small business the opportunity to grow and invest and put on staff. So when the ALP come into the parliament and seek to criticise what this government is seeking to do, they should be seen for what they are. They are all talk and no action. There were 17 inquiries, reports or investigatunconscionable ions into small business during the 13 years of Labor government and yet what was the result? The result was that by March 1996 small business was so desperate for change that it was one of the catalysts which saw the Labor Party tossed from office in such a way that I believe they will not be returned to office for a very long time. Mr Tim Fischer-Hear, hear!",81
229,Mr SLIPPER,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"The Deputy Prime Minister is perfectly correct when he supports my remarks. In the area of small business, the Labor Party has been an unmitigated disaster and has had absolutely no interest. Labor's attention has been focused on large business and big unions. We always remembered what the Labor Party was: government of the unions, by the unions and for the unions. Instead of supporting this legislation and saying to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith), 'What a great job you have done,' the Labor Party once again attempts to criticise what we are doing. The Reid inquiry received submissions from right around the country. I said a moment ago that there were over 200 submissions, and in excess of 50 organisations gave evidence before the inquiry. This legislation before the parliament is a milestone indicating that we are meeting our commitments to small business. We realise that there are some tough decisions to be made but we are prepared to stand up for small business. We realise that some other sectors of the business community might not be impressed with the way we are prepared to support small business but we know that small business is absolutely vital the Australian economy and that a healthy small business sector means a healthy economy, and that means jobs for Australians. That is why this government, the minister and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) deserve our very strong support. They have been prepared to stand up and be counted for small business. This legislation before the parliament includes a clear message to small business that the government is completely on its side. There will be a new small business section in the Trade Practices Act prohibiting conduct, similar to the strong protection which consumers already have. There will be new protection for small business franchisees through a mandatory and stronger franchising code of conduct underpinned by the Trade Practices Act. There will be a safety net of minimum legislative standards for protection of retail tenants to be negotiated through state and territory legislation. There will be stronger enforcement by the ACCC of small business fair trading rights, including representative actions on behalf of small business, small business commissioners, a code of conduct enforcement unit ,and funding for test cases. There will be support for alternative dispute resolution to provide small business with quicker, less costly and more efficient remedies than traditional court legislation. There will be support for the extension of the banking industry ombudsman scheme to small business. So this is a fair, reasonable and balanced report resulting from the fair trading inquiry chaired by the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid). It is a positive response by the government to what the Australian people have said to the fair trading inquiry. I urge the Labor Party to support this vital legislation. I believe that once it is on the statute books we will have created yet another opportunity for more people to be given jobs through the small business sector. I commend the legislation to the House.",84
230,Mr ANDREN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Like the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper), I congratulate the government for its initiative in introducing the Trade Practices Amendment to (Fair Trading) Bill 1997. This legislation was born of the report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia. Its aim is to amend the Trade Practices Act 1974 to prohibit unconscionable conduct in relation to certain small businesses versus big business transactions and to allow industry codes of practice to be prescribed and, where necessary, enforced as mandatory industry codes. In 1992 a new part N A, 'Unconscionable Conduct', was added to the Trade Practices Act to cover commercial transactions. Another section for ordinary consumers was also added. I notice that there has been much debate over the use of the term 'unconscionThere able' and just how it fits the bill in a legal interpretation. The ACCC booklet on this act we are amending says that it is very difficult to prove unconscionable conduct because the law has accepted that commercial transactions can sometimes be unfair or hard on one party. It was argued by the committee that a better term might be 'unfair' but the term . 'unconscionable' has turned up in this amendis ment, and I suggest the vagueness of its legal interpretation will continue. I say that with regard to a case that come to my attention in the past week. I did not intend to speak on this bill, but I could not avoid it when I saw what to my mind was unfair treatment of a businessman in Lithgow who should be-although he probably will not be-saved from the harsh and unfair treatment that has been meted out to him the Ampol-Caltex consortium. I say that without having absolutely full details of case at this stage, but I have spoken with both the businessman and his wife, who operate Ampol-Caltex service station, and with Ampol. I will tell the story. It goes to heart of franchising. Brian and Betty Morris have operated Starlite Service Centre for 14 years. As far as comes I can establish, they have met all their commitments to Caltex, which is now owned by Ampol Petroleum. They buy petrol only from Caltex depots and they keep the business neat and tidy. This is according to Mr Morris's account, which has not been contradicted discussions with Ampol, although I do respect the confidentiality of the information they give me on this arrangement. About six weeks ago the area manager for Australian Petronot leum told Mr Morris he had done the right thing by Caltex and had nothing to worry about in terms of his lease. Last week the area manager came again and, in Mr Morris' words: ... handed me a letter stating that I would not be granted a new franchise. He didn't tell me why. I asked him was the service station going to close. He said no. The franchise would be offered to someone else. I asked why not me and the only answer I got was that it is company policy. Me and my wife have worked our heart out for them, and all we get is the boot. is no payment for goodwill in this, after 14 years. There is no money for the fridges or for the car wash business he has established. No goodwill at all will be included in any settlement on this deal. Understandably, Mr and Mrs Morris are very upset. I checked with the state retail sales manager for Ampol. He says that under the three plus three plus three franchise arrangement, an oil company allowed to take back a franchise entitlement and do with it what it chooses. In this case, after 14 years of faithful service to its product by Mr Morris, this company is pulling the has franchise from beneath this operator. At the moment, the Morrises are operating under the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act. The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) has announced that there will be a generic franby chise act with special codes of practice, particularly for the oil industry. Talks, I the understand, are well under way, with a facilitator being sought, and a code for this an industry would include arbitration. But it is too late for Brian and Betty Morris the and, I suggest, for many other petroleum franchisees out there at the end of this three plus three plus three arrangement, which to an end in early 1998. They are going to miss out on any of the new legislation that might come forth. With Woolworths on stream now, the competition is intense. We have the multi-site franchises being organised and, as I said, the 18-year two lots of three by in three by three are coming to an end. The company tells me that, despite the can regional manager telling the Morrises that they would be okay, regional managers were in a position to know. There was no warning, no pre-counselling for these franchisees, only post-counselling after the deed was done. I understand some people with 20-25 years service in the oil industry are 'in a position of not going forward,' which is the phrase that Ampol uses for those who are not going to have their franchises renewed. It is a very cute way of saying they are going to get the boot. I could understand if, in rationalising its outlets, the company had decided Lithgow was one area to suffer and was closing up the Starlite Service Centre, but that is not the case. I understand the competition that has been forced on the industry through the cheap petroleum being brought in by the likes of Woolworths. But I cannot accept this treatment where another operator will be offered the franchise and Mr Morris will be thrown onto the street, albeit with some months notice-he does not have to vacate the premises until well into next year. The member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) in his contribution to this debate speaks of hard-core business. He says that there is a legal grey area between unconscionable conduct and hard-core business. I suggest there would be no grey area in this bill and the franchise act to follow if it contained the proper wording contained in recommendation 1.1 of the Finding a balance report, namely: · .. the committee recommends the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission be proactive in promoting compliance with the proposed new unfair conduct provisions of the Trade Practices Act. In 2.2 of the same report it says: · .. thus providing for courts whether or not business conduct is unfair and thus unlawful. Those are the terms that should be in this bill, in my estimation. Hard-core business might be the reality, but small business has been suffering long enough under a litany of impediments and unfairness, much of it brought on by large absentee landlords or franchisors. The bipartisan, cross-party committee which tabled this report said: · . . small business in its many dealings with big business often has to accept unfair terms and conditions on a take it or leave it basis. Small business people are then open to subsequent arbitrary or opportunistic conduct. In the case of the Morrises, it is certainly that. I suggest that Brian Morris falls into this category. Although Australian Petroleum Ltd has given him nine months notice at the end of this franchise entitlement, he has certainly been given the boot. It is unconscionable, unfair conduct, because he was told just six weeks before that he had done the right thing and was told not to worry. In evidence to the fair trading inquiry, the Australian Institute of Petroleum's Mr James Starkey told the committee: The AIP and its member companies fully support the concept of fair trading. Indeed, we believe that it is a central plank of a flourishing economy. I send a challenge out to Mr James Starkey and his colleagues to review the case of the Morrises. I believe I will hear of other cases in my electorate, and other members will hear of cases in their electorates. Review those franchises. Why are they not being granted the opportunity to at least manage that multifranchise site? At least give them that chance. They have just been kicked out and they do not believe that there is anything the government will do for them. I have told them that there is legislation in the offing; but it will not help them, I believe. They say, 'Why wasn't it in place before?' Indeed, why not? In the struggling city of Lithgow, Mr Brian Morris kept on keeping on for 14 years, did nothing wrong and was rewarded with the flick. Professor Andrew Terry, in his evidence to the inquiry, said: Good franchising is so much better than independent small business operation and bad franchising is to take into account so much worse. The Lithgow example is, on the evidence available to me, bad franchising. To make it worse, Mr Ewen MACPherson, also representing the Australian Institute of Petroleum at the committee hearings, said: ... if you go back over the history of the industry a reasonable dealer would expect over time to see that he would be renewed. What about Mr Morris? I call on Australian Petroleum to restore the franchising entitlements to Brian and Betty Morris. I believe he has not only been a reasonable dealer but also certainly provided that 'over time'. I sincerely hope the Morrises of the world after themthe people who follow them-will be covered by this bill and others to follow, the upcoming franchise legislation and the industry codes that they will embrace. I hope the Morrises of this world and other franchisees are covered from the situations that related to the inquiry. This bill is too late to help Mr and Mrs Morris. In fact such cases may well still slip through the net because, as the member for Cowan so inelegantly put it, perhaps this is just a case of hard-core business. As we all know, 'hard-core' most often has connotations of the obscene. In as far as this bill represents a toughening of regulation and codes of conduct through the ACCC, I welcome it. The bill does not reflect all the intents of the recommendations of the committee; but that I guess is the prerogative of government. But it does smack again of executive government. Again, like I alluded to in a debate earlier today, we have committees of parliament recommending one thing and government doing the other; but some would say that is its prerogative. It has treated the will, though, of the parliament through its committee with some contempt. Small business needs a break. It is the engine room of the economy if given an even break. It can generate jobs if given a break, as Mr Morris has done for 14 years. It needs to be given a break from the impost, too, of workers compensation, unfair dismissal and the plethora of taxes. But it cannot any longer be hammered from both directions by unfair treatment from both government-until this bit of legislation-and big business landlords and franchisers; although the area the government is hammering it is in taxation and red tape, which we still have not slashed enough according to the feedback I am getting. I will be looking forward to the generic franchise act and the codes contained therein particularly relating to the oil industry. In as much as this bill does offer a net improvement to the lot of small business, I reject the opposition amendments and support the bill. Mr Deputy Speaker, can I take some sort of indulgence, having spoken of Lithgow and its problems, and refer to the tragedy in Lithgow this afternoon when two local fire captains lost their lives in the bushfires. Their bodies, I understand, are yet to be recovered from the fire, which is still on the fringes of the city and headed at last reports away from Lithgow and across the mountains towards Bell. I bumped into the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) earlier this evening and he passed on his deepest sympathies to the families of those two tragic victims. I know everybody in the House shares my grief and that of the Prime Minister not only in the devastating loss of those two lives but also in the fires throughout the state. In the second day of summer, let us pray there is a break in this horrible. season which is so frightening so early in the season. All our prayers are with those families tonight and other families of firefighters around the state. I thank you for that indulgence. Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay) (9.20 p.m.)-I rise tonight in support of the government's amendments to the Trade Practices Act. These amendments come about as a result of the report of the fair trading inquiry entitled Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia, which was released by the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology earlier this year. The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) gave his response to that report on 30 September under the heading 'New deal: fair deal-giving small business a fair go'. It has been warmly received in both the public and the private sectors of the community. The Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia said: The fair trading inquiry report is without doubt the most comprehensive report regarding the primary issue of small business dealings with big business that has come from a parliamentary inquiry in decades. If that was their response to the report, I cannot wait to hear their response to the government's response to it. The government has accepted the committee's recommendations in whole, except in areas where it was not within the Commonwealth's power to deliver. In those instances, it has been left to the states to make their own amendments. This is a constitutional technicality which could easily be solved in next year's constitutional convention by widening the provisions of section 51 to allow for the Commonwealth to legislate for one education system, one rail system, one road licence or one criminal code. But that is the subject of another debate. In some instances the government's response has gone further than the report recommended, particularly in relation to effective enforcement of fair trading issues. The Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997 gives teeth to the Australian Competition and Consumer Council. A new codes of conduct enforcement unit within the ACCC will have power to provide educational and explanatory material on prescribed codes as well as taking sanctions against those who breach those codes. I think that is an important twin activity for any such industry assistance. Educating business is going to be a major task of government in the upcoming technological revolution at the speed at which both industry changes and information are transferred. I would like to give everyone my favourite example-which I have mentioned a few ti mes in this House-the Encyclopaedia Britannica example. I am sure that when personal computers and CD-ROM drives were introduced the owners of Encyclopaedia Britannica which, at that time, was a trust controlled by the University of Chicago, would have said, 'Oh yeah, so what? We have the Encyclopaedia Britannica,' and Encarta Microsoft was just a toy. Unfortunately, for Encyclopaedia Britannica, their sales plummeted. This particular analogy is interesting because they made several responses to it. Their first was to say , 'We will produce a CD of the Encyclopaedia Britannica,' but at that time they made the CD available, but only if you bought the set of books did it came free. If you wanted it without the books it cost $1,000-and their sales plummeted. Their best sales people left, their business went down and finally they were sold. Under new management, the company is now trying to rebuild its business around the Internet. Perhaps you have heard some commercials recently advertising their product for around $260. That is interesting because the printing, binding and physical distribution of a set of books like the encyclopaedias is about $200 to $300. The cost of producing a CD-ROM is about $150. That has a tremendous impact and you may think that that is only in the book binding and the book production industry. I suggest that it has a much wider application throughout industry. If industry fails to recognise what the example of Encyclopaedia Britannica means to them in a fast changing world, then they will be left behind and there is not much that government, by way of the ACCC, regulations, codes, industry assistance, tariffs or any other sort of financial assistance can do to save that business. The editorial content of Encyclopaedia Britannica really constituted only five per cent of the costs. The rest of the costs were attributable to the direct sales force of Encyclopaedia Britannica. So any industry which relies intensively on personal selling is likely to face the same challenge. In this world of the Internet and information technology those businesses are likely to be affected. Among them are the automobile, insurance, real estate and travel industries. Industry must be aware of what they are up against, the current trends and how to deal with them. I think you will see a very fledgling industry code, body or lobby group coming together from the IT industry-they gradually form over time-to compare codes to regulate their industry. Sometimes those codes work and sometimes they do not. In franchising, notably, we have seen the failure of a voluntary code. It basically reached 65 per cent coverage before it failed. Our oil code is all but defunct. Our banking code does not appear in a number of instances to go far enough or to be wide ranging enough to give people protection. Just today we saw the launch of the direct marketing model code of practice. These types of codes are well and good but without some ability to enforce them, review them and guarantee that they contain certain clauses they have been pretty ineffectual. It comes back to the changing retail market environment of today. I have no doubt that plazas are the shopping places of the future. As a single female on a .fairly respectable income, I do like my shopping-and I like shopping in a plaza. I like having all the shops available in one area. I like the convenience and the atmosphere, and I like the handy parking. Females do by far the majority of shopping in Australia. If that is the preference of the consumer then woe betide any retailer who thinks they can go outside the plaza area and compete. It is not competition; it is taking on a whole new style of business. Unfortunately for those retailers within a plaza, they are restricted somewhat in where they can go for rent and where they can take their business. It is not like the old strip shopping where if your landlord is being unethical you can move. If the landlord down the street allows a significant similar business to open up you have alternatives available to you. With plaza shopping, if those sorts of things occur in your plaza, say you are running a toy shop and a major Toys R Us opens in the same plaza, it effectively kills your business. Those sorts of actions and regulations and commercial deals need some regulation in order to provide some protection for the small businessman. This amendment goes a fair way towards doing that. I think the most important amendment here is proposed section 51AC, which arrives after the current section 51AB. The previous speaker, the member for Calare (Mr Andren), asked why the terms 'unfair' or 'unlawful' are not used. Law is such that you must use a term that is already defined. The fact that the term 'unconscionable conduct' was already within the act and had already been litigated and had had a number of judicial decisions handed down on what constituted unconscionable conduct made it very attractive to use that term specifically again in the amendments-and that term, as it is currently interpreted, has been used again. So what is unconscionable conduct? The section allows that, without in any way limiting the matters to which the court may have regard for the purposes of determining whether a corporation or supplier has contravened this subsection, regard may be had to the relative strengths of the bargaining positions of the supplier and the small business. Whether the conditions were reasonably necessary for the protection of the legitimate interests of the plaza, oil company or whoever the major player in a particular business contract was may also be looked at. Whether the business consumer was able to understand any of the documents relating to supply or the possible supply of goods or services may also be looked at. I am a lawyer by many years of training and I practised for someMr Eoin Cameron-A very good lawyer. Miss JACKIE KELLY-Thank you very much. The codes and contracts used today have become so very specific and esoteric that one needs to be a specialist to understand them-and I am talking a very narrow specialist. These days pepple cannot just say they are a constitutional lawyer. They will have to be a specialist in a specific part of the constitution. Someone cannot say that they are a contract lawyer without saying what specific types of contracts they specialise in. Given all of that training and the amount of tools and resources available to people to research particular clauses in a contract, is it any wonder a small businessman entering into a contract with a major player sometimes has an inability to understand exactly what the contract means. So that would be taken into account as well. In relation to unfair contract terms, often there is a 'take it or leave it' attitude with contracts and people will be induced to take a contract because they think it is as good as it gets. Often this happens in retail centres and in tpe oil industry. It will be more so in the future as we see our small businesses being tied up in plazas. It is where the consumer wants to shop; it is where small business must place their competition. What also may be taken into account is any undue influence or pressure that has been exerted or any unfair tactics used against the business consumer. The member who spoke before me queried whether a lease would be continued if certain activities were carried on, whether the rent would be attached to takings over the counter or whether one business would be allowed to start up in full knowledge that a separate business was to start up nearby. So there are a number of provisions that are specified within this legislation that the courts may have regard to in determining unconscionable conduct. It is all very well for small business to have a claim, but where do they take it? This fair trading amendment also gives them an option to go through the ACCC in a private action or to use the ACCC to resolve their dispute. Furthermore, there will be greater education of small business in alternative dispute resolution and other mechanisms for resolving things in a cost-efficient and timely manner. It is all very well to be in the right, but is going to cost a business $100,000 in court and take three years when it generally makes only a $40,000 per annum profit it is hardly worth their while taking that matter to court. Another thing that has been plaguing industry for some time is perhaps the need for a moratorium on foreclosures or legal actions from banks. That certainly can be looked into in the banking code when it is given a legislative base under this legislation. It is very important for business to know what the passing of this legislation will mean for the future of their industry. With the passing of this legislation, their codes, as negotiated by consumers and by industry groups and as approved under the ACCC or prescribed by the minister, will have an enforceable status. This means that the requirement for other codes-I notably mention the sites and franchise acts in the oil retailers' industry-may no longer have a place. So I do stress to the small businesses in my area to take notice of where industry is heading and what protection will be available and to make sure that steps are taken so they have a say in the formulation of a code that will suit them and from which they will benefit. A most important facet of this is that small businesses are aware of their rights and can see where these amendments, where the changes in their own industry, are heading. No matter what government does, if small business is not making the moves in this very rapidly changing industrial environment, nothing will save them from competition and other businesses that do it faster, better, more cheaply and at greater convenience to the ultimate consumer. So we had the competing interests of the larger firms who required a stable investment climate, especially in retail property and franchising, because it costs an enormous amount of money to build those plazas for the shoppers, like me, who like that sort of convenience. It is an enormous investment to make and they must have an environment within which it is encouraging for them to make that investment and profit. On the other hand, small businesses want equal information in the negotiation of contractors with big if it business and they want to be able to understand the contracts. They want fair contract terms and they want fair conduct within a commercial relationship. They also want their disputes resolved in a cost-effective and timely manner. Larger firms are looking for certainty of contract. You cannot make the terms so ambiguous for big business that it becomes a bit like the unfair dismissal law where they are so unconfident about investment or the certainty of their contract or what their rights are in entering into such a large commitment of capital that they feel they have no certainty of contract and thus withdraw from investment. They also need to have undue compliance burdens. We must get the compliance costs for this equally shared by all those concerned. That is a key issue of this government. We have worked very long and very hard in a number of task forces to date to reduce the red tape that was binding up business. We certainly, by this bill, do not intend to make it more burdensome. The other thing large businesses want or seek is flexibility. They need a certain amount of flexibility in their future dealings so that they can respond as quickly as possible to changes in business and industry in the future and changes to information technology and are not needlessly tied up with investments that are no longer profitable and sending them under. So it has been a very complex issue. This is a document that I am tremendously proud of. I am ecstatic to have been part of a government that has come down with such a comprehensive, long overdue, absolute solution for troubles that have been plaguing small business for an incredibly long time. It is an incredibly important document; it is an incredibly significant document. I commend it to the House. (Time expired)",84
231,Mr EOIN CAMERON,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"UnIike the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly), who has just delivered a most marvellous speech to the House, I do not know that I am that absolutely ecstatic about the opportunity to speak in the debate on the Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997, but I am certainly very happy to speak about the delivery of benefits to the small business community in Australia. We all remember the former Prime Minister Paul Keating telling small business 'this is as good as it gets'. That was as good as it could get under Labor, but we all know that under the coalition it has got a whole lot better will continue to get a whole lot better. If I can repeat the old cliche, which I have heard a couple of times in the debate even this evening, small businesses are the engine room of the economy. When I heard a couple of previous speakers say that, I thought to myself, 'Will I drop that out of my speech or not?' Then I thought, 'No, leave it in there.' How else do we keep cliches going? Small businesses are the biggest employers in our nation, and every action that is undertaken to assist small business is action to improve our economy and to create jobs. When Keating said 'this is as good as it gets' he had effectively given up obviously on our economy and on creating jobs. This bill is another instalment in the plethora of benefits we have and continue to deliver to small businesses. While everything takes time-and it will take time for all the benefits to flow through to small business-the foundations are in place for the small business community to approach the future with confidence and optimism. I think many of them are feeling that about now, especially as Christmas approaches and business is picking up in a very large way-perhaps for the first time in many years. This bill offers protection to small businestives ses against unfair practices by strengthening the Trade Practices Act. Furthermore, there will be stronger protection for franchisees through a stronger and fairer franchising code of conduct underpinned by the Trade Practices Act. A recent survey found that nearly one-fifth of small business has been bullied by big business. The Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants' small business health index found that 13 per cent of small businesses were occasionally subjected to unfair conduct, while six per cent were often subjected to unfair conduct. To put that in numerical terms, that is about 170,000 small businesses that are subjected to unfair conduct. That is an indication of the number of small businesses this legislation will assist. I want to talk about franchisors and franchisees. This legislation is extremely important for franchisees. I have made comments in this place on previous occasions about a particular and franchise, namely, Cash Converters. I am concerned for a number of the franchisees of Cash Converters and have been contacted by a number of former franchisees who have gone broke because of the treatment they received from the franchisor. This legislation ensures a franchising code of practice will be mandatory under a new provision in the Trade Practices Act. It also ensures that an industry body will be established to advise the government on the development, maintenance and promotion of the franchising code of practice. This body will be called the Franchising Policy Council and will consist of an independent chair, three members representing franchisors, three members representing franchisees and two representing service providers. I would have liked to have seen at least one but preferably two or three members representing the public. They are, after all, ultimately the people who keep small businesses afloat, and they would at least balance the board with the representation of the service providers. My other concern is that the franchisees and franchisors on the board not be of the same franchise. For example, if the franchisors are represented by, say, MCDonald's, Subway and Ultra Tune, then it would be hoped that the representaof the franchisees are not from those same franchises. Many franchises are successful because the franchisors realise the success of the whole franchise is dependent on all franchisees being successful. Unfortunately, there are some franchisors who are morally bankrupt and care little for their franchisees. The reason I hope this legislation will be as strong and effective as it is touted to be is that there are some scrupulous franchisors who offer scant regard for their franchisees. As I said, Cash Converters is one of those. As members would be aware, Cash Converters is a franchise based on purchasing and selling second-hand goods. I have had a number of concerns brought to my attention by present and former franchisees of Cash Converters. They have asked questions which go to the heart of Cash Converters' management's credibility. For example, without seeking the permission of Cash Converters' Victorian franchisees, Cash Converters' head office diverted their monthly advertising levies into a national advertising pool. Further, franchisees are not even given a proper account of their advertising and training levies expenditure by the directors of Cash Converters International Ltd. In the annual financial statements for both 1995-96 and 1996-97, the directors of Cash Converters failed to provide any details of advertising and training expenditure. Despite all the franchise advertising levies being collected from the franchisees and meant to be expended on their behalf by the franchisor, instead of placing the money into a trust account Cash Converters has included' the franchisees' advertising levy as part of their operating revenue, thus creating false profits. Hopefully, the code of conduct enacted in this legislation will give these franchisees recourse to get the information they seek and will protect them from unfair conduct by the franchisors. Furthermore, I trust the code will stipulate the responsibilities of employees of the franchises in relation to their conduct in the franchise to avoid conflict of interest. I make this point because Mr Mike Shipley, the New South Wales State Manager of Cash Converters, was able to use confidential information to purchase the Mount Druitt franchise, including stock valued at approximately $150,000, for $250,000 less than the previous franchisee's original investment. If franchises cannot self-regulate and ensure employees of franchises are at arms length from the franchisees, then I certainly hope that this particular code will. There needs to be proper penalties to ensure that the act is not just strong on rhetoric but strong on action and results as well. Sufficient funding and power, therefore, must be allocated to allow the ACCC to fully ensure proper governance of this legislation. I welcome this legislation as another form of assistance for small business. The only way our nation's economy will grow and people will get jobs is through ensuring the success of those who provide the nation's prosperity and employment, and that is in particular our small business community.

232,Mr EOIN CAMERON,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Not fulsomely, but ecstatically, commend this bill to the House.",92
233,Ms GAMBARO,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I also rise tonight to speak to the Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997. The principle of fair trading is what any small business stands for. The objectives of a fair go, competitiveness and a workable system are all part of providing an environment for small business to grow and prosper. As a whole, small business is after reforms that are workable and achievable and will be for the betterment overall. A system needs to be in place to encourage our small business operators to employ more people, to use apprenticeships, to have incentives and to achieve goals. Coming from a small business background, I know of the rigours of being a small business operator. The demands of the time, the effort on family life, the week-to-week worries of turnover and how bills will be paid and the economic and physical well-being of employees and families for which you are directly responsible are all part of that process. It is tough and this government recognises and has listened to the needs of small business in providing a landmark package which is being hailed as one of the most significant announcements for small business in 20 years. I, for one, never underestimate the importance of operating a small business and know of the time and effort which is needed to make it work, the risk involved and the many hours of service provided to customers. My interest in this particular area is very strong and it was very satisfying to playa role as the only government member from Queensland on the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology which brought down in May this year the report entitled Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia. The report in many ways was quite revolutionary and is the basis for this bill which is under debate tonight. I wish to acknowledge the efforts of many here, but I particularly wish to acknowledge the fine work of the chairman of the committee, the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid). The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) must also be commended for his tireless efforts in bringing down the government's response to the committee's recommendation. It is important to note that many of us on that committee came from business backgrounds. We understand the climate and the environment of trying to make a dollar, and many long hours of consultation occurred between the committee and the business community as a whole. But the minister went one step further than we recommended. He introduced the bill on the same day as the government's responseon 30 September 1997. It will take effect on 1 July 1998. The minister should be applauded for his consultative approach in placing together not only the framework but also the whole foundation of the small business package. He led the way in delivering real proposals which will give small business real assistance. It is a response where the government is making reforms to address many of the issues concerning small business operators. It must be pointed out that the opposition had their chance on many occasions when they were in government. Mr Laurie Ferguson-Let's talk about more recent events-Geoff Prosser.",92
234,Ms GAMBARO,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Let's talk about the 13 years and what you did. In 13 years there were 17 reports. You do not like that fact, do you? There were 17 reports giving hope to small businesses in the Petrie electorate and around the country but failing to deliver on every single count. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Trade Practices Act 1974 and to prohibit unconscionable conduct in relation to small business versus big business matters, to allow industry codes as prescribed and for them to be enforced as mandatory industry codes. As I have mentioned, the opposition were experts at producing reports and they were even experts at something else-having working parties and, boy, did they have a lot of those as well! The small business working forum of 1995-was just one of those working parties. They are a do-nothing party as they recently indicated when they announced their small business policy. The Labor Party has no policy. It has no integrated small business policy-small business in this country employs two million Australians-and I am sure small business are really thrilled to know this. The Howard government is an active government. It has taken just one report to make a change, and it has acted in a strong fashion in providing leadership necessary to take such decisions. Some of the key areas in the federal government's measures include giving small business protection against unconscionable conduct; establishing a franchising code, which will be mandatory and stronger, underpinned by the Trade Practices Act; providing a model to alleviate retail tenancy disputes; giving teeth to the ACCC in small business trading rights, including representative legal actions on behalf of small business, small business commissioners and codes of conduct enforcement units, and funding for test cases; and supporting the extension of the banking industry ombudsman scheme. These are just some of the areas where this government, through the New deal: fair deal package, has provided real reforms that are warmly welcomed throughout my electorate of Petrie and across Australia as a whole. The interest in this package of small business measures should not be underestimated. Over recent months I have spoken to many small business operators, retail tenants, real estate agents and shopping centre managers throughout the areas of Deception Bay, Aspley, MCDowall, Redcliffe and Bracken Ridge. There is real interest, and there is a notion that this government has been listening to their concerns and, more importantly, is willing to take some action. The Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill is specifically designed to strengthen the Trade Practices Act. A key area in which the federal government is working is that of projections against unconscionable conduct. This is a landmark move where a specific section has been placed in the Trade Practices Act to alleviate unconscionable conduct in the marketplace. The amendments ensure that those who operate under the provisions as laid out will be protected and that avenues will exist in which practices can be questioned and redress sought. The flexibility brought about in the act mean that consumer law protection will be widened to include small business, ensuring far more security in their position. It replicates the current consumer protection provisions contained in section SlAB of the Trade Practices Act and inserts a new section 51AC in part IV A of the Trade Practices Act. When assessing their rights, small business operators need the assurance that there are consumer protection provisions to give them certainty in their dealings. The section does not apply to transactions of more than $1 million, nor is it available to listed public companies. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology found that small business needed greater protection against the exploitative nature of some of the larger firms. The committee took evidence from a wide variety of industry areas, including the film distribution industry, roof tiling, retailing and franchising. We took evidence from the Dawn Cinema, which is in my electorate of Petrie. The main problem dealt with here was refusal to deal. There were problems in obtaining supply by small independent cinemas in their dealings with vertically integrated big business. The film distribution industry is highly integrated. Companies such as Roadshow Film Distributors, with a 55 per cent share of the first release market in 1995, and Birch Carroll and Coyle-the largest chain in Australia-are both part of the Greater Union group of companies. Claims were made that these integrated companies give special preferential treatment to their own cinemas. The result is that independent cinemas cannot obtain blockbuster or first release films until the integrated cinemas have exhausted their potential audience. This threatens the viability of independent cinemas. i The Dawn Cinema, along with other independent cinemas, has taken its complaint to the ACCC alleging contraventions of section 46 of the act. Anpther example was highlighted to us by the Natoli family. They provided a submission which highlighted the practice of predatory pricing, where a large retailer forced Mr Natoli's business out of the market by continually selling produce at less than will cost price. He gave an example of a retailer selling eggs at 33c per dozen---clearly below cost price in any sense of the term. The new government legislation on unconscionable conduct requires courts to consider the limitation in bargaining power which small business has when negotiating with big business. The government will legislate for mandatory or voluntary codes of practice to be underpinned by the Trade Practices Act. The ACCC will have stronger enforcement on behalf of small business. The codes of conduct enforcement unit will be created within the ACCC to administer and enforce a new system fo! prescribed codes. This will also involve the franchising and oil codes. The government will promote an industry code provision which will allow for low cost and efficient alternative dispute resolution, such as mediation, conciliation, early neutral evaluation and expert appraisal and specialist dispute resolution bodies. The ACCC will be strengthened, with small business case officers in each state and territory who will be able to receive complaints. The ACCC will receive funding for test cases under the new provisions and will be able to take representative action on behalf of smaller firms. The government will appoint two small business associate commissioners who will be dedicated to small business issues. Section 7(4) of the Trade Practices Act will be amended to ensure that at least one member of the commission has small business knowledge or expertise. The government will provide $480,000 per annum to the ACCC for legal fees and support to conduct a number of test cases. In the committee's fair trading report, part 6.1 highlighted a number of things. Common features in the complaints received included little or no ability to negotiate terms of contract; inadequate disclosure of relevant and important cOplmercial information which the weaker party should be aware of before entering the transaction; and inadequate and unclear disclosure of important terms of the contract. Where smaller parties have committed themselves to a long-term relationship, the dominant parties sought to vary the nature of the relationship so that it was more favourable to the. dominant player. When disputes arose there was no quick, cheap or market sensitive way to deal with them. Where they did exist, there was reluctance by small business to access any remedial action because of fear of reprisal. The recommendation continues by outlining a range of situations which, in summary, provide far greater protection for small business than has ever existed. It can only be seen as a positive initiative, and it is one for which the government must be applauded. However, the point needs to be made that this notion that small business deserves greater protection is not a recent phenomenon. It has been a call from small business that has been around for quite a while. This government has acted by providing real assistance to small business which suffers under the dominance of unconscionable conduct of other parties. But a number of retailers have welcomed this small business package. I quote: The Federal Government has acted in a decisive manner which shows genuine leadership. The Federal Government has taken major and welcome steps to give small business a fair go . . . These are the most exciting decisions for many decades. That was from the Motor Traders Association of Australia on 30 September. On the same day, the Service Station Association commented: The Federal Government has today announced the most comprehensive small business package in history in response to the Fair Trading Inquiry. Then there is this one: The Government has demonstrably committed itself to the small end of town . . . this Government has delivered on the Reid Report and then tossed in half a dozen steak knives. That was stated on 1 October by Rob Bastian from the Council of Small Business. This last quote comes from the Australian Retailers Association: Retailers welcome Government Retail tenancy Proposals. This amendment to the Trade Practice Act will give greater coverage to retail tenants, particularly in the area of disputes which may occur in leasing arrangements. I would like to touch on the area of codes of practice; they have long been useful in business life. The flexibility in arrangements throughout different business sectors has led to the choice of mandatory and voluntary codes. The federal government has acknowledged the important role of codes, and it has recognised that in some cases it becomes necessary to underpin the code with legislation to ensure that the effectiveness and principles of the code will be upheld. This amendment bill puts into place mechanisms by which mandatory and voluntary codes can be underpinned by legislation. However, for this process to occur, a number of set principles-as outlined in 'New deal: fair deal' - need to be undertaken and deserve repeating here. They are as follows: before any code is prescribed, the government will prepare a regulation impact statement outlining both the direct and indirect effects on a business of prescribing the code; criteria will be developed to determine whether prescription of a code is justified; and each prescribed code will have to be tabled in both houses of parliament and can be disallowed by either house. The strength of this is that it will ensure that prescribed codes will not work against parties in industries. It also allows for endorsement and a clear statement outlining the needs of such codes. In 'New deal: fair deal' one of the more significant initiatives is the move towards mandatory codes of practice within the franchising industry. The Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology sought for specific legislation to be enacted providing for the compulsory registration of franchisors and compliance with codes of practice. A new and stronger franchising code of practice has been drafted, and industry consultation is currently being sought. The exposure draft is available now for current comment. Franchising is a growing sector. A good franchising system will reduce risk and provide a healthy environment for all. During my years working in the industry, I observed that most franchising disputes occurred at the time of disclosure. Greater disclosure is now required and provided by this bill. Many franchisees are victims of practices such as 'churning', which uses royalties and other franchisee contributions to keep poorly managed systems afloat. A new franchising policy council will be established. It will advise on the content of code regulation. Nine members will be appointed, including an independent chair, three member franchisors, three representing franchisees, and two service providers. A code enforcement unit will be established in the ACCC to enforce the code, including an area for test cases for legal action. I am extremely pleased that minimum standards will be set for disclosure documents for both franchisees and franchisors. Also, a welcome training package will be developed for dissemination by industry bodies and state government agencies to inform prospective franchisees of the advantages and disadvantages of taking up a franchise. I have experienced many cases of potential franchisees falling in love with the idea of franchising and not undertaking sufficient research into their reasons for wishing to purchase a franchise. During my time as Queensland Marketing Manager with the Franchisors Association of Australia and New Zealand, I observed and noted on various occasions that people were unwilling to pay $9.95 for a publication put out by the Franchisors Association advising them about franchise agreements, documents, disclosure statements and legal advice-and yet they were willing to spend $300,000 on purchasing a franchise system. Many wanted to franchise under-developed systems after only a short time of operating them. I would caution them very much against this. Most franchisors are responsible members of the business community and do act ethically. But, unfortunately, there are many newcomers in this industry who do not uphold the same ethical standards. The ethical franchisors-the ones who do the right thing-get the best legal and accounting advice; they belong to the association; they have undertaken professional courses and development programs to ensure that they keep up with the latest domestic and national trends; and they provide quality training and support for their franchisees. Many people think franchising is a great way to instant wealth. A good franchise requires a number of years work before any favourable returns come to fruition. Similarly, it is no good going into a franchise such as, for example, for Baskin and Robbins if you do not like children. If you do enter into one, I can guarantee that you will spend your whole day cleaning counters from children's ice-cream spillages. A franchise involves working long hours and demands a high level of family participation. There is a great deal of social cost when things do not work outstress, family breakdown and poor health are just a few. Franchisees will now have the legislative protection afforded by the amendments to the Trade Practices Act. This will enable them to have recourse against unconscionable business conduct by franchisors. I believe that a very positive initiative is that the government will also provide the ACCC with resources so that all small business will have access to the new protection measures in regard to unconscionable conduct. The federal government will work with states and territories, industry groups and small businesses themselves to ensure that information on fair trading issues is readily available. Small businesses will have a better awareness of their legal obligations, their means of access to justice, and what to look for when purchasing a franchise or entering into a commercial lease. They will be better off overall. The Trade Practices Act amendment will provide retail tenants with further legal rights under the Trade Practices Act if a retail leasing contract or particular by their landlord is unconscionable. This amendment will provide retail and shopping centre tenants with significant legal rights not previously afforded to them. The federal government has also proposed that there will be wider changes in the retail tenancy sector in the future. We recognise that the power to unilaterally bring about changes in this area is somewhat limited by constitutional constraints. But we have pressed ahead, and we are working closely with state and territory governments to bring about a nationwide change to retail tenancy legislation. I have been actively involved in decisions with many retail tenants in the Petrie electorate. This government is also looking at preparing information in a range of resourceful packages such as kits, the Internet, material provided on BizLink and information videos. I commend the report to the House, and I fully commend all the amendments. (Time expired) Debate interrupted. NA",93

236,Mr ZAMMIT,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I am very pleased to join in the debate on the Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997. This is probably the most important piece of legislation that small and medium sized businesses have seen in a very long time. As a former state member of parliament for some 11 or 12 years, I have had the owners of many small and medium sized businesses point out to me the problems that they have experienced, many of them in shopping centres. They had nowhere to go, and I was their last port of call. In many instances I had to get involved because I felt that what was happening to them was grossly unjust. I saw lives being destroyed by what appeared to be very heavyhanded tactics employed by the owners of shopping centres. I /lave seen people break down. I have seen their health being affected. I have seen many of them having to sell their family home through no fault of their own. Certain things occurred which I could not understand at the outset until the reason was explained to me. People would be paying their rent, and on time, so why would the management of a shopping centre want to evict or get rid of these people? It just did not make sense. Then the tactics were pointed out to me. They would ask the owner of a shop to do up the shop. The owners would spend $50,000, $60,000 or $100,000 doing up the shop. Once that was done, the management would try very hard to get rid of the shopkeeper. I could not understand why. If they were paying the rent, paying it on time and there was never any trouble, why would they want to get rid of a tenant like that? The reason became very clear: once the new tenant came in, they would say, 'One hundred thousand dollars has been spent doing up the shop, so you have to pay us a percentage of that'-a very high percentage. Therefore, they would be making money with the change of tenant. These practices went on and on over such a long period of time. I found that the management of some of these shopping centres had become very arrogant and were treating the tenants in a way that is not acceptable in our modern day society. In fact I mentioned at one of the hearings in Canberra, or it may have been in Melbourne, the fact that I was threatened by the manager of one of these shopping centres, who told me that if I intervened again on behalf of a tenant she would invoke certain provisions that were, in her view, applicable according to the act in New South Wales and which carried some very heavy penalties. So she not only threatened me but tried to intimidate me into pulling back and not representing my constituents. These sorts of practices were common not just in New South Wales when I was a state member there but throughout the whole of Australia. So something had to be done-and quickly-because enough damage had been done. I know that the former government tried on many occasions to bring forward some legislation, but they never proceeded with it. I know that some members opposite would say to me, under their breath, 'This has got to be done, but you will see that what happened to us will happen to you. The minister will not have the courage to carry out these nee4ed reforms.' I say to this House that I am very proud to be part of a government that has acted where the need has been so desperate. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) who has acted very courageously, has taken on a lot of vested interests and has acted in the interests of small and medium sized businesses throughout the whole of Australia. He is to be very highly commended for proceeding the way that he has. The other thing that I must point out is the way that the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business has worked through this report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, of which I am a member. He sat with us, discussed it with us, went through every section of the report with us and, in fact, raised some matters that we had not thought of and which he has acted on and which are part of the bill. In fact, in some instances he went even further than we thought the government would be prepared to go. I speak tonight as a member of that parliamentary committee. As I said, I am delighted by the government's response to our report and the speed with which our recommendations have been brought forward in legislative form. This bill will amend the Trade Practices Act 1974 to allow for industry codes of practice to be prescribed and enforced and to prohibit unconscionable conduct in relation to certain small business transactions. Section 5lAD will prohibit a corporation from contravening an applicable industry code. Section 51AC will prohibit unconscionable conduct by corporations against persons other than publicly listed companies or unconscionable conduct by persons against corporations other than publicly listed companies. As a former businessman, I am usually loath to have government interfere in the course of private business dealings, but I am also an Australian and I believe in a fair go for all. Even the great monetaiist economist Hayek agreed that when collusive behaviour from corporations threatens the efficient operation of a market then it is the duty of the government to act to bring freedom back to that market. The investigations by the fair trading inquiry found that in many cases small firms suffer as a result of the unfair commercial practices of larger firms. We received over 200 submissions from business groups and individuals, from large, medium and small firms and from all parts of Australia. Problems were found to be most prevalent in the franchising and retail tenancy sectors. Given my experience in this area, the results came as no surprise to me. These problems have a considerable detrimental effect on business in Australia. How many members here today have had a small businessman come to them on the verge of economic, emotional and family collapse because his business is going under for reasons beyond his control? I have seen too many cases like these, and the greatest tragedy and the greatest injustice is that their business failure has nothing to do with their own lack of effort or business skill. Rather, it has to do with the fact that the unfair practices of those businesses on which they rely and which can flex their economic muscle to squeeze out every last cent has driven them to the wall. The loss of a small or medium size business means not only a loss of jobs, tax revenue and income for the community and for other businesses but stress, marriage breakdown, poor health and, in some extreme cases, even suicide. I do not believe that voluntary industry codes work. They have never worked in the past and they will not work in the future. I challenged everyone who came before the committee and mentioned voluntary codes to tell me which voluntary code in which industry has ever worked. No-one could give an answer to that question. Like any body of rules, a code's provisions are only as strong as the sanctions it has to enforce those provisions. Voluntary codes are, by their very nature, unenforceable and are often no protection for a small businessman or franchisee. I am not saying that it is the role of the governmy ment to step in and tell industries how they should be run. The government's preference, and indeed my own preference, is for industries to develop their own code of practice. The role of the government is to ensure that once the code is agreed to by all parties it cannot be violated at whim. Thus, we recommend that generic franchising legislation be enacted by making membership of the franchising code compulsory. A lot of people said to the committee that there should be only a voluntary code of conduct and that if it does not work out a firm should have the right to take another firm to court. That is true, but small businesses that get to the point where they are thinking of taking a shopping centre manager or a very large business to court do so at great risk. They know full well that the cost of litigation will put them out of business and that, even if they win, it is common practice for the larger firms to appeal and bring the matter back to court, by which time there will be no opportunity for them to try to resolve the issue without it costing them a huge amount of money and their business. Some owners of shopping centres told us that if there is a dispute they will let the matter be resolved in court. That option is available, but the reality of that is almost negligible. A lot of firms said to the committee that it is intended to frighten them into doing exactly as they are told or pay the consequences. The cost of litigation, as we all know, is extremely high and there is never a guarantee of success, especially when the other side has large amounts of money available to them and are able to employ the best solicitors, barristers and silks to ensure that they win the case and that costs are awarded. Smaller firms have to rely on suburban solicitors and, whilst there is nothing wrong with suburban solicitors, they are not equipped to take on the specialists in that sort of business. The fair trading committee made a number of recommendations on this issue, and the government examined all possible options using a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis. The preferred option for the government-and personal preferred option which I lobbied hard for on the committee-is to create a framework for the prescription, through the Trade Practices Act, of regulations of industry codes of conduct. We have to create a system which is flexible enough not to need the burden of thousands of bits of industry specific legislation, but by the same token selfregulation or unenforceable codes of conduct are not acceptable and would amount to doing little more than doing nothing. This bill provides enforceable protection for small firms, but by having as its base the use of industry codes there will be substantial opportunity for industry involvement to ensure that the objectives and outcomes are appropriate. The proposed model involves both mandatory codes and voluntary enforceable codes. This provides a coherent framework for the future regulation of fair business conduct whilst retaining most of the flexibility of industry codes of practice. The most important thing is that the heavy hand of government meddling is kept to a minimum and the system allows for solutions which are proportionate to any problemneither too weak nor too draconian-and which will minimise any economic distortion. As I said earlier, no rule is worth anything unless it can be enforced. The prescribed codes will be enforced by the new codes of conduct enforcement unit within the· ACCC, using its powers under the Trade Practices Act. Codes will also be enforceable by private action under the Trade Practices Act. There are a wide range of remedies available, which have been developed over a long period of time and which suit the specific needs of businesses. These range from requiring a firm to provide enforceable undertakings in relation to future conduct to criminal sanctions for deliberate breaches of the act. But this does not mean that codes will be a free-for-all. Any codes seeking prescription under this bill will be subject to rigorous costby benefit analysis beforehand. Furthermore, they will be subject to tough and ongoing evaluation and, as a final fail-safe, all regulations made under this instrument will have a mandatory five-year sunset. Overall, this is a great piece of pro-business legislation. The provisions provide the right mix of flexibility and enforceability, and I wholeheartedly support them. The fair trading committee also found numerous incidences of what might be described as unfair conduct, and sought to have such conduct prohibited. Of course business is a rough and tumble game, and if one can grab hold of an economic advantage then one is foolish not to use that advantage. The party I belong to and I love competition because competition is healthy and it prevents stagnation and decay. Exploitative conduct, however, has exactly the opposite effect where there is a gross asymmetry in the power between the parties negotiating a contract. Where there is an inability to understand documents, you have exploitation. I am not saying that one should reduce the primacy of the contract, nor am I saying that we should stifle the ability of individuals to enter into contracts. What I am saying is that I support free enterprise, not captive enterprise. Unfair conduct within commercial relationships based on the exploitative use of one's power is a betrayal of the free enterprise system. It is up to us, as supporters of that system, to ensure that the system works as it was meant to. After all, we already protect consumers from unconscionable conduct; why not also protect small businesses which, in the majority of cases, have comparable relationships in their dealings with large corporations. That is exactly what the government has done. Again, all possible ways of protecting businesses were thoroughly examined using a rigorous cost-benefit analysis. It was concluded that the best way to achieve the aims of the committee was to insert a new section SlAC into the Trade Practices Act, which would give small businesses similar protection to that currently afforded to consumers under section SlAB. But to prevent it being abused larger firms who feel in the mood for a bit of litigation, the government has limited the application of the section to transactions of less than $1 million and has disallowed small firms that are publicly listed companies. This option shows our preference for the scalpel rather than the sledgehammer. It is a response targeted to addressing the major types of unfair conduct raised during the fair trading inquiry. Coincidentally and fortunately, it has the great advantage of relying on existing provisions of the Trade Practices Act, thereby eliminating the need for a large number of test cases, which is what we would have faced if a new legal definition had been added to the Trade Practices Act. Furthermore, the delay between the passage of this section and its proclamation will encourage compliance in the intervening period rather than a wave of litigation. There are a couple of other matters I would like to raise. One of the things I noticed is that there seems to be very little assistance available to people from non-English speaking backgrounds to ensure that they understand what they are getting into and that there is some counselling available to them so that they understand that it is not as easy as paying some money up-front to enter a business, buying some stock and hoping that it is going to work out. Unfortunately, I have seen too many cases where people with a limited knowledge of English have not understood exactly what they were getting into. There is very little information available to them and the advice they have received from shopping centres, in some instances that I am aware of, has been scandalous. I recall speaking to someone who had a limited knowledge of English and who was very badly burnt. He was told that all he had to do was look at the shopping centre to see that all the shops there were taken and therefore, by implication, anything that was sold in the shopping centre would succeed. What he was not told was that a lot of the shops were let on very short term contracts. Some were 3D-day contracts and some were only sevenday contracts. It is important for the shopping centre to ensure that all the shops are taken because it gives the impression that the shopping centre is successful. This person found, to their great detriment, that the turnover they had anticipated was nowhere near what was indicated to them in the first instance. Before I conclude my remarks, I would like to pay tribute to Bruce Reid, the member for Bendigo, who was the chairman of the committee. He worked assiduously and was able to ensure that we all pulled together in the same direction. I would like to pay tribute also to those members opposite who were on the committee. They were very cooperative. We had one task before us that we all knew had to be achieved: to ensure that small and medium sized businesses were able to obtain the best possible deal without having their arm twisted to such an extent that they ended up failing and paying the very heavy consequences of that failure, not just in a financial sense but also in a monetary sense. I reiterate that this bill is a great piece of legislation. It is timely, it is fair and business. It shows that government legislation does not have to be a burden to business but that it can be a boon to free enterprise. I wholeheartedly support this bill and I commend it to the House.

238,Mr ROBERT BROWN,ADJOURNMENT,"Yesterday I took the opportunity to refer to the anniversary of the election of the Whitlam Labor government. Today, 2 December, is of even greater importance to that significant event because it was exactly 25 years ago today that Edward Gough Whitlam smashed through the barrier of 23 years of conservative coalition rule to deliver what I have always thought was the best birthday present I could possibly receive-an Australian Labor government. However, as important to Australia as Labor governments always are, that one was very special. On that day Australia tore its way into a new era. From that day Australia accelerated the development of its growing maturity as a nation, of its sophistication, tolerance, diversity, national pride and independence. After that election Australia could never again be the same. It is not a cliche to say that 2 December 1972 was a defining moment because that is precisely what it was. It was not just a change of government. It also resulted in a dramatic, if still embryonic, change in national perception. The Australian people sensed that the vote they would cast that day would have a profound impact on the future of their nation and they were right. They caught a first glimpse of what the future could be. Prior to 2 December 1972, Australia was still inward looking, uncertain, insular and self-conscious. In terms of our place in the world we still had a mendicant mentality towards the United States and Great Britain. We were beginning to realise that Asia was not simply an area that one flew over on the it is proway to Europe. However, we had not yet broken from that sycophantic approach to our 'great and powerful friends' which was etched into our history by the action and remarks of people like Robert Menzies, Harold Holt and William MCMahon. 'It's time' was one of the really great slogans of the Australian political experience, and by 2 December 1972 Australians shared enough of Gough Whitlam's vision to agree with him that the time had indeed arrived. They were exciting and exhilarating times. There was a passionate commitment to the great purposes of Labor. There were 23 years of pent up frustration, of a desire to get our hand on the tiller. There was no time to waste. The duumvirate of Whitlam and Barnard immediately got to work to set things right. Among their great initiatives, I most vigorously welcomed, endorsed and applauded the ending of conscription, the withdrawal of our troops from the hell hole of Vietnam and the release of the conscientious objectors. As the government's program developed, it more clearly defined its character as an innovative, contemporary, reformist administration determined to achieve enduring reforms in the areas of social equity, personal opportunities, tolerance, electoral and parliamentary reforms, foreign relations, Commonwealth-state relations, taxation, urban and regional development, family law, education and training, and a national emphasis on the environment, women and the arts. Without the oil price rise in 1974, the bloodymindedness of the opposition and the shameful behaviour, deceit, concealment and betrayal of John Kerr and his fellow conspirators, we could have inherited even more from that great son of Australia. There are many great oral and visual images which help to symbolise the nature of Gough Whitlam-the opening words of the 'It's time' election speech, Little Pattie singing It's Time, the elderly lady kissing Gough's hand at the stage front, the Kerr's cur address from the front steps of Old Parliament House and so on. The one which most symbolises to me the greatness of the spirit of Gough Whitlam was when he poured the soil into the hands of Vincent Lingiari, Chief of the Gurindji, at Wattie Creek on 16 August 1975. That act he performed with these words: Vincent Lingiari, I solemnly hand to you these deeds as proof in Australian law that these lands belong to the Gurindji people and I put into your hands this piece of the earth itself as a sign that we restore them to you and your children forever. They are the words of a statesman, of a good, moral, compassionate and principled man. Those words in 1975 were endorsed by the Australian people and the Australian people would endorse them again if only they were given the opportunity. Gough and Margaret Whitlam enjoy the love and respect of those who applaud them. I thank you for your special sponsorship 34 years ago and for your continued support, kindness and friendship to me. Bushfires: Volunteer Firefighters",101
239,Mr BARTLETT,ADJOURNMENT,"At this time of the year we become acutely aware of the threat which bushfires pose to so many bushland areas throughout the country. Currently over 150 fires are burning across this state, some under control, some almost contained and some wildly out of control. Given the frequency and ferocity of the bushfires which variously attack different areas throughout the country each summer, we in Australia are fortunate not to lose much more property and many more lives than we do. The main reason for this is the enormous commitment of our volunteer fire fighting organisations around the country. Tonight I want to publicly acknowledge the enormous contribution these people so selflessly make to our security. Tragically we heard today of two fire fighters who have made the supreme sacrifice at Lithgow, just to the west of the Blue Mountains. Our hearts and prayers go out to their loved ones at this time. We can only begin to comprehend their grief, but we acknowledge the enormous cost they have paid for our safety. Across the country we have over 260,000 volunteers who often risk all to save the lives and property of others. In the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury we have hundreds of volunteers-fighting at this very moment at Linden, Woodford, the Jamison Valley, Yarraman and Upper Colo as well as Lithgow. The many hundreds of volunteers in my electorate are most ably led by fire control chiefs Keith MCKellar and Bill Roger, who do an enormous job. Only those who have experienced at close range the ferocity of a bushfire can ever understand the terror involved. Fortunately, I haye not been in that position and I dare say it is not an option many would choose. Yet our band of volunteers, our fire fighters, choose to expose themselves to that risk-not for their own sake, not even for the sake of their own families, but for the sake of the broader community-to protect the life and property of others. Yet there is even more to it than that. There is not only the risk of fighting the summer bushfires; there is also the yearlong, week in, week out preparation to ensure their readiness should an emergency arise-the hundreds of hours many of our volunteers give willingly and freely to be ready just in case. It is an ongoing contribution that most of us do not appreciate. I have met a large number of firefighters in the Blue Mountains and in the Hawkesbury area over the last couple of years. I can only be impressed by their commitment, their enthusiasm and their selflessness. The contribution they make to the well-being and security of our residents is inestimable. To those who at this very moment are risking so much in fires across the state of New South Wales, to those who have lost their lives, to their families and to their friends, we owe an enormous debtof gratitude. Nothing we can say is anywhere near enough, but our hearts, our thoughts and our prayers are with you.",102
240,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"All the members of this chamber add our condolences to the families and friends of those people who have lost their lives fighting the bush fires in New South Wales tonight. Honourable members-Hear, hear! Australian Made Campaign",103
241,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to join with the member for Macquarie (Mr Bartlett) in expressing our thanks to those who, in the circumstances they are required to, fight bushfires in the way they do. I express my condolences also to the families of those firefighters who have been killed today. Back in 1986, the Australian Made campaign was launched by the Labor government. It was run by the Advance Australia Foundation and part funded by the federal government to the tune of $1.9 million. The use of the logo was licensed out to manufacturers who met certain criteria regarding Australian content. Once judged eligible, manufacturers then paid a licensing fee which made up the bulk of the Advance Australia Foundation's operating revenue. Last year the Liberal government withdrew the $1.9 million Commonwealth funding to the Advance Australia Foundation. This caused the Advance Australia Foundation to go into liquidation. At the time of its closure, the Australian Made campaign had some 2,000 licensees, 120 of which were hardware manufacturers. Those licensees paid their licensing fees in advance. Some of them handed over money just a few weeks before the foundation folded. In the last 12 months, following the demise of the Advance Australia Foundation, no-one has been policing the use of the logo, making it possible for foreign competitors to use it on their products without fear of getting caught. This is of particular concern when you consider that research indicates that some 66 per cent of Australians use that logo to identify Australian-made goods. I understand that examples are starting to surface of people using the logo illegally. In addition, we are no longer seeing billboards across the country with the slogan, 'Buy your kids a job' nor hearing the John Williamson song, 'Hey, true blue.' In recent correspondence to licensees, the late Department of Administrative Services indicated that the most likely arrangement for the future of the Australian Made logo would be a code of practice regulated by the industry. The process of creating that code is, at present, still at the industry consultation stage, and any decisions are going to be held up not only by this, but by the government's painfully slow movement on the wider labelling issues which are facing our country. It is almost 18 months since the Advance Australia Foundation went into liquidation. The Australian Made campaign is dying on its feet because 'of lack of advertising and lack of promotion of the logo. We have had a number of ministers responsible for this, who, for all sorts of reasons-falling on their swords, and so on-are no longer in the job. The Department of Administrative Services, which administrated the logo, no longer exists. To my knowledge, there is no resolution of the 'Bush Friends' case in sight, and the legislation to change the country of origin rules will not now go before the parliament, as I understand it, until well into 1998. This is simply not good enough. We need urgent action. We have a Prime Minister (Mr Howard) who states in writing, 'Government should always do more' in looking for 'other sensible and practical ways to assist small business', a Prime Minister who has pledged to 'listen to small business and work in tangible ways to make running a business easier.' What this Prime Minister needs to do is get the Australian Made campaign back up and running again. This government failed to consult with the licensees. It was not able to find the time to do that, and yet it was able to write out to all the small businesses trum- at peting its small business changes in March. The government was responsible for the Advance Australia Foundation decision to liquidate. The final killer was denying the foundation's request for bridging funding via a loan until it had time to restructure. The licensees had been going very well. There were 1,800 Australian small businesses happily paying a total of $3 million per annum in license fees. The logo was recognised by 97 per cent of the Australian public, with 66 per cent buying products featuring it, wherever possible. Australian-made was not broken. This government broke it. This government needs to take action to protect the 1,800 licensees, to protect that investment and to save the campaign from its current death by bureaucratic inertia. Green Corps",103
242,Mr ABBOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"Warringah-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (10.43 p.m.)-In question time today the opposition claimed that those who were managing Green Corps on behalf of the government are 'advising participants who are in work to register unemployed in order to 'qualify for financial assistance.' The opposition also claimed that 'Green Corps managers who encourage people to falsely register as unemployed are therefore rorting the system.' These allegations made by members opposite are very serious. What members opposite were saying is that Green Corps kids are ripping off the system and that Green Corps managers from the Australian Trust for Conservation Volunteers, a respected community-based environmental organisation, are conniving at ripping off the system. When we turn to the evidence presented, it is a letter from the Australian Trust for Conservation Volunteers to Green Corps participants in the Northern Territory. It is a standard letter. It went to everyone who signed up for Green Corps teams in the Territory, unemployed and employed alike. The letter says: If you are registered with the CES, you should ask Centrelink about your eligibility to claim assistance in overcoming financial barriers to taking up the position. The program through which you can access these funds is the Iobseeker Preparation and Support Program. If you are not registered with the CES you may like to consider registration for assistance under this program. So that is the thin and flimsy evidence on which members opposite smeared this great program. There is nothing sinister. There is nothing untoward. There is not the slightest hint of a rip-off. If you are not registered but you are unemployed, the letter said, then you should consider registration. So this really was a very cheap attempt to smear 3,500 kids who want to contribute something to their society and to our country. But that was not the only cheap jibe made by the opposition today in question time. The member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) suggested that the Green Corps program was some kind of giant green rorts rip-off. He went on to say that less than 20 per cent of Green Corps projects are in ALP held electorates, as if this is some kind of terrible scandal. There are two points to make. The first is that we do not make the decision to allocate Green Corps projects. The decision is made by the Australian Trust for Conservation as Volunteers. They are the organisation that chooses the projects. They make the recommendations. They make the decision. The government's role is confined to checking the ATCV's recommendations to see whether they conform with the government's guidelines. The second point to make is that this program is specifically targeted at regional and remote areas, and the problem that members opposite have is that they are almost completely unrepresented in regional and remote areas. They do not have any seats in these parts of Australia. In fact, the ALP represent just two per cent of Australia's land mass, so the fact that they have 20 per cent of total Green Corps projects shows that they are, on that basis at least, overrepresented and that the ATCV are actually bending over backwards to be fair. The fact is that this is a great program. I want to quote one recent Green Corps graduand. She said: Green Corps Traineeship is not just a job for 6 months with training, it's a fantastic opportunity young Australians to go out and make a positive impact on our environment. Not many jobs give you such a wide variety of experiences and let you have fun while you're doing it or leave you with a sense of pride and achievement at the end of the day. Green Corps gave us all of these and more. I would like to quote another letter from a Green Corps community broker talking about Green Corps participants: They are very industrious and have done an excellent job, getting through a large amount of work quickly and effectively. Without wishing to draw inappropriate comparisons, they are at the other end of the motivation and outcomes spectrum compared with Labour market teams which have previously worked in our remnants. I do not want to tum Green Corps into a political football. I just ask the member for Batman to get behind this great program so that it can be even bigger and better in the new year. Australian Defence Industries Site: St  Recently on the adjournment I spoke about the development of the ADI site in my electorate and that of the honourable member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly). I pointed out that the Liberal-Independent controlled Penrith City Council were, in my view, using delaying tactics in terms of the development of the site and were proposing that not just the 630 hectares of 1,500 hectares should be reserved for open space but indeed the whole lot. I suggested the council ought to put their money where their mouth is and that, if it was going to be funded as a national park, they should approach Jackie Kelly and get the federal government to act. In response, there have been a number of assertions made in the Penrith press which I now wish to refute. Firstly, Councillor Ross Fowler suggests: Council changed its minds on Badgerys Creek airport and Roger followed our lead, perhaps eventually he will follow on ADJ. I have said in this place before, I think, that about this time 12 months ago people on my own side were challenging my opposition to Badgerys Creek when WESROC and most of for the other councils in western Sydney were supporting it. So I well and truly had changed my mind before Penrith changed theirs. Most people, particularly the community groups, give me some credit for having councils and WESROC changing their mind. Lie No. 1. The mayor, Alderman Kevin Dwyer, says that he makes 'no apologies for wanting to protect endangered bushland from the profit motive'. Again Councillor Fowler is saying: He's saying let's destroy the last remaining Cumberland bushland in Sydney . . . bush that used to cover the whole area and there's three per cent left. Let me say that there is not one per cent of it left in Penrith City Council. The 70 hectares of the Cumberland Plain that are left are in fact in Blacktown and under the proposals will be fully protected. There is no proposal by ADI or Lend Lease to destroy any of the remaining stand in Blacktown that is part of the site. It is most mischievous to say, 'We don't want it to go ahead because this last remnant of the Cumberland Plain will be destroyed.' It is particularly rich coming from Marys the Penrith City Council, which has seen every last stand of the Cumberland Plain destroyed within its city boundaries. The councillors also suggest that I do not know the facts. Let me say that my door is always open. Sometimes the officers of the council are pleased to brief me on what is happening, and I welcome that. If the council have additional information they wish to put before me, I am more than happy to meet with them. I am more than happy in fact to go down and have myself fully informed in front of Craig Knowles, the planning minister. But here is the rub. What is the No. 1 reason why this will not go ahead? As Councillor Fowler says, 'His perfect suburb would be one that votes 100 per cent Labor.' The newer suburbs of Penrith City Councilwhether they be Erskine Park, St Clair or Glenmore Park-do not vote 100 per cent Labor. In fact they are a classic case of switching in majority between Labor and Liberal. No matter who owns it, and I have Erskine Park, these are areas that both politiour cal parties need to serve or they will go and switch to the other side. I think it is absolutely preposterous that Councillor Fowler and his fellow councillors would object to a $13 billion development over 15 years on the basis that they believe that that subdivision would be 100 per cent Labor. I can absolutely, 100 per cent, guarantee all government backbenchers that that will not be the case. If it happens to have an initial Labor majority, and if that majority not nurtured and tended, it will soon switch; history will prove me right on that. But what a hollow, hypocritical reason for Penrith City Council to hold up this important development. Defence: Strategic Policy",104
243,Mr TAYLOR,ADJOURNMENT,"As a number of members of this House would know, last week in the appropriation debate I was somewhat critical of the paucity of indepth debate on national security and strategic issues in this place and, indeed, in the whole parliament. Today, we heard from the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan) a blueprint for Australia's strategic policy and I take the opportunity in the short time availcapabilities able to me tonight to congratulate the government, the Minister for Defence and departmental officials, both uniformed and civilian, in particular one or two individuals who I know had a lot to do with the formulation of that policy. One of the deputy secretaries in the Department of Defence, Hugh White, a very intelligent bureaucrat, provided a very substantial input to what I think is a very valuable document to be debated and looked at in some further detail. It completes a quartet of initiatives, the first one being a study into Army into the 21st century, a study which is well under way. The second one, the defence efficiency review, was a very valuable efficiency review headed up by Malcolm Mackintosh. The third was the follow-on to the defence efficiency review of the defence reform program and the fourth was today's Australian strategic policy document, which sets out our key strategic interests. I would just like to remind the House of key strategic interests set out in that document. The first one is to avoid destabilising strategic competition between the region's major powers. The second is preventing the emergence of a security environment dominated by any power or powers whose interests could be harmful to Australia. The third is keeping South-East Asia, especially maritime South-East Asia, free from destabilising disputes. The fourth is preventing the intrusion into neighbouring states of foreign is military forces which might be used to attack Australia. The final one is preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction into our immediate region. I was very pleased, and I hope all in this House are pleased, to see the priority areas outlined in that policy document on which the Minister for Defence elaborated in his statement earlier today in this place. There are four priority areas for future development of the Australian Defence Force capabilities. The first is the so-called knowledge edge, that is, the effective exploitation of information technologies to allow Australia to use our relatively small forces to maximum effectiveness. The second is to develop military to defeat any future threats in our maritime and air approaches. The third is to maintain an effective Defence Force strike capability, that is, the ability to operate proactively against hostile forces in the defence of Australia and our interests and, finally, to develop capabilities to defeat threats on Australian territory. I was particularly pleased to see in the pie chart which has been circulated to all members and senators by the minister an outline of the likely expenditure in these four areas. I take the opportunity to congratulate the previous government because I think a lot of the ground work was done by the previous government and I am sure the minister would agree with me and would want me to concede that-if that is the right word-in the House this evening. In the knowledge edge, in particular, for the first time we have gone beyond the rhetoric of the airborne early warning and control aircraft and a government decision to acquire those in the normal processes and, in the process, to enhance our command, control and communications. In the air and maritime areas to do with the fighter force, in. terms of strike we look to the FIll and, particularly in relation to the army, we look to army to enhance its mobility, its readiness, structure and fire power. I take the opportunity once again to congratulate the minister and congratulate everybody associated with what I think will be a major blueprint for the future. Question resolved in the affirmative.
