Mr KING O'MALLEY - I desire to make a personal explanation. Some time ago I raised a question in this House in regard to the Fremantle Municipal Tramway loan, and the honourable member for Fremantle, acting, as I believe, in good faith and quite conscientiously, denied that my statement was correct. I am now in the happy position of being able to show that it was, by quoting the. following paragraph from the Perth Truth of 27th ult Most Truth readers will remember that some time ago this paper contained a paragraph ' I took my information from the financial columns' of the Age and the Argusindicating that the statement made by King O'Malley, M.H.R., on' the occasion of the raising of the Fremantle Tram loan, to the effect that the flotation had proved a failure was, despite denials by interested parties, absolutely correct. At the recent tramway social held in Fremantle, Mayor Thomson of the eastern suburb of the Port stated emphatically during the course of a speech that he knew O'Malley was correct at the time the statement was made, but from purely local reasons he, Thomson, could not then bear testimony to the truthfulness of the utterance of the Federal legislator. Thomson added that before relinquishing his present Mayoral position he hoped to more publicly vindicate O'Malley who had been unjustly treated in the matter. You will thus see, Mr Speaker, that once more are the righteous vindicated. OLD-AGE PENSIONS. NA MARYBOROUGH.",14

8,Dr MALONEY,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"the Treasurer, u f o n notice I. With reference to the Public Service Commissioner's decision as to certain female officers transferred from the State, to the effect that their work is of a simple character and not worth 1 the minimum wage, will the Minister inform the House how many years of service they severally served under the State and Commonwealth Governments up to this date? 2.

Is he aware that the Postal authorities of the same State, when asked to remedy this rough, incomplete work, by finishing the poles in a tradesmanlike manner, whilst admitting the need for finishing and painting them, have tried to throw half the cost of their own departmental work on to the municipal authorities, who receive no part of the revenue from the use of the poles ? 3-_ Does he not consider this system of administration should be altered, seeing that the telephones are a substantial source of Commonwealth revenue, that the ratepayers of the municipalities have to pay full rates for their telephone service, and that the municipalities themselves do not share in the revenue?",17
20,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Inquir y will be made, and the desired information furnished, as soon as possible. SURPLUS REVENUE BILL.",17
21,Mr THOMAS,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"the Treasurer, upon notice I. Whether it is correct, as stated by ter for Defence on 3rd December, that the Surplus Revenue Bill as agreed toby the State Premiers, providing that the Surplus Revenue Act 1908 be amended to "" so debited to the several States that the capitation in the case of each of the States of New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland shall be to the capitation in the case of each of the States of South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania, in the proportion of three to two,"" represents to the State of Victoria a saving of about ,Â£150,000 on her proposed contribution to the purposes of old-age pensions under the provisions of this Bill? 2. If this is a correct presentment, of the position, will he state from what State or States funds this difference will be made good?",17
22,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"I rise to a point of order, my point of order being that this question does not represent in any way whatever what I said. The statement that I did make was uttered during the consideration of the Surplus Revenue Bill, but not in the connection in which the honourable member has put it. In other wordsy the matter I spoke of had little to do with the particular matter mentioned in this question.",17
23,Mr TUDOH,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"The honourable member .said that Victoria would take .Â£150,000. _",17
24,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,A misunderstanding.,17
25,Mr SPEAKER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,The Minister of Defence has risen to a point of order with regard to the accuracy of a statement made in a question. I have to point out that the Chair and the House always hold an honourable member who puts a question upon the notice-paper responsible for the accuracy of the statements made in that question.,17
26,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"The answers? to the honourable member's questions are1. The Minister of Defence was referring to>. the fact that under the new arrangement the amount of ^5,543,750 will be distributed amongst the States on a population basis. If this amount had been distributed in accordance with the; present bookkeeping system, Victoria would have received ^150,000 less. 2. If Victoria had received ^150,000 less, the other States would, of course, have received more, and vice versd.",17
27,Mr THOMAS,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Ir a view of the point of order raised by the Minister of De-! fence on my question, I think an explanation is due from me. I placed the question on the no.tice-paper for the reason that, when we were discussing the Surplus Revenue Bill, the question arose as to the fairness of callinar upon V i o toria, New South Wales, and Queensland to contribute in the proportion of 3s. to 2s. I then stated that, in my opinion, such a proposition was unfair and unthe Minis- just; and the honourable member for Yarra, with me, objected to Victoria and the States mentioned, being thus penalized. The Minister of Defence then said, "" I hope you will not forget also to mention the fact that, under this provision, Victoria gains ^150,000 a year.""",17
28,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,I meant under the nnancial agreement with the Commonwealth.,18
29,Mr THOMAS,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"The honourable member for Calare then rose and asked whether, if Victoria was to gain ,Â£150,000 a year, - the Minister of Defence would kindlly say what State would make up that amount. The Minister for Defence replied that all honourable members had to do in order to get the information was to look at the Budget Papers. I asked the Treasurer if he would be good enough to give us the information, but he said, he could not do so off hand, but would endeavour to obtain it if I gave notice of a question. I ' 'gave notice of a question, and the Treasurer has given a reply.",18
30,Mr TUDOR,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,Mr Speaker,18
31,Mr SPEAKER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"I am afraid we are going to have a discussion on a Question which has already been settled by the House. I do not think that any statement of the honourable member for Yarra has been called in question,, and that, there.fore, there is any need for him to make an explanation. If there is that need on the part of the honourable member, I hope that other honourable members, whose names have been mentioned incidentally, will not also find it necessary to make explanations. If the honourable member for Yarra feels that he has been mis represented or misunderstood, I shall be glad to hear him.",18
32,Mr TUDOR,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"It was the statement by the Minister of Defence, as to the gain which he said would accrue to Victoria, that has given rise to this discussion. The Minister now says that he was referring to the nnancial agreement, but I point out that that agreement was not mentioned in the course of the debate. TELEPHONE SERVICE: "" PURCHASE "" SYSTEM. Motion (by Mr THOMAS BROWN) agreed toThat a Return be laid upon the Table of the House, showing :(1) The number of Exchange Telephone services in each of the States of monwealth leased to subscribers under what is known as the "" Purchase"" system, and the annual rental and maintenance charges usually made in connection with these services.

33,Mr KELLY,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Wentworth) [11.25] There is a foot-note, which I think has crept in under a misapprehension, and I desire to have the matter cleared up, so that no injustice may be done. The footnote is to the item of .Â£800, for "" Representative in England,"" and reads as f o llows :This salary is paid to Colonel Bridges-hi s place in Australia being taken by an Exchange Officer from the Imperial Forces. I. am not seized with the facts, but I understand that Colonel Bridges was formerly Chief of the General Staff in Australia, an appointment with a duration of three years. He, however, resigned that office to go to England, to what would generally be regarded as a more important office, namely, that' of the representative of Australia on the Imperial General Staff. The foot-note informs us that an Imperial officer is now occupying Colonel Bridges' position in Australia; but that Imperial officer is under the Chief of the General Staff here, who is, since Colonel Bridges' departure, General Hoad. In other words, unless this foot-note is an error, it shows that Colonel Bridges will have taken a step down, and I do not think that any of us would wish to do an injustice to a public servant, especially a public servant of the character, attainments, and reputation of Colonel Bridges. It ought to be perfectly clear that, when Colonel Bridges returns, the fact of his absence will not penalize, him in any way. At present, however, he,' apparently, is to have a step down, owing to a little foot-note made in the Departmental office, perhaps by some one who steps over- I do not know-that may or mav not be the case.",19
34,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"ParramattaMinister of Defence) [11.27] - I hope that there is no stepping down so far as Colonel Bridges is concerned. Whatever has been done is with Colonel Bridges' concurrence, and, at the time of his leaving, I know that the arrangement was eminently satisfactory to himself.",19
35,Mr KELLY,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,Does Colonel Bridges know about the foot-note?,19
36,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"I do not know whether he knows anything about the footnote, but he did know about the exchange officer.",19
37,Mr KELLY,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,The foot-noteis the whole thing.,19
38,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"The foot-note is nothing without the fact. I should like to say, further, that no exchange officer is doing the work in place of Colonel Bridges.",19
39,Mr KELLY,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,Then we should strike out the foot-note.,19
40,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"I have no objection, but is it worthwhile, after the explanation ? Amendment (by Mr KELLY ) agreed toThat the words, "" his place in Australia being taken by an Exchange Officer from the Imperial Forces"" be left out.

41,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,Calare) [11.36] - This would be a fitting opportunity for the Minister to indicate the number of camps and the special training it is proposed to provide for during the current financial year. . About Christmas time last year there was a considerable amount of friction and dissatisfaction on account of cadets being excluded through want of funds.,19
42,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"ParramattaMinister of Defence) [ri.37] - Provisio n is made on these Estimates for a full camp throughout the States. These items have been cut down in previous years for one reason or another, but this year for .the first time for some time past it is proposed to have a full camp. The more I see of the forces and arrangements, the more it seems to me to be absurd to have a camp at all, unless it is adequate. I have therefore put on the Estimates sufficient money for an eight-day camp throughout Australia, and I hope we shall be able to get the men for that time. This has always been the case in two or three of the States, but in the others it has never been possible to get a full eight-days' camp. I am going to do my best to remedy that, and to see that all the State forces, as far as possible, will go to camp for eight days. The provision for an extra nine days' training is for the technical arms of the service, as has already been decided upon. In addition to the sixteen days which the infantry and horse sections of the forces get, they are to get nine days, bringing their total training to twenty-five days per annum. The third item is for vehicles - We are seeing if we cannot improvise our transport, or the non-technical part of it , and so save ourselves hundreds of thousands of pounds, by making arrangements with owners of private vehicles which are suitable for this class of work. We shall make a test in that direction in this year's camps. Three thousand pounds appears on the Estimates for the purpose, of which Â£[850 represents the portion allotted to New South Wales. Proposed vote agreed to. Divisions 97 to 102 (New South Wales Military Forces), Â£[103,898, agreed to. Division ro3 (Rifle Clubs and Associations), Â£[22,865.",19
43,Dr LIDDELL,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Hunter) [11.40] - I wish to call the attention of the Minister of Defence to the fact that a sum of money was placed on the Estimates to be spent on a hall at Wyong in his electorate, but that there is no corps there, whereas we have a very virile corps forming at Cessnock, in my electorate. Will trie Minister transfer the money which was to be spent at Wyong to Cessnock?",20
44,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"ParramattaMinister of Defence) [11.41] - I have been asked about this matter already, and if the facts are as alleged, I see no great objection to the transfer being made. rate, I shall have none. Proposed vote agreed to. Division 104 (Victorian Military Forces, District Head-Quarters Staff), Â£[3,645. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) [11.42] - I notice that the cost of the Head-Quarters Staff is considerably increased. That does not confer any benefit on the great multitude of the people. The vote for the Permanent Forces for Victoria js increased this year from Â£ 5 9 , 2 1 5 to ^63,278. Mr. JOSEPH . COOK (ParramattaMinister uf Defence) [11.43] - The increase referred to is rendered necessary by the special provisions that we are making this year for a Military College, and the general instruction which will ,06 necessary for the training of the new arms of the forces, amounting altogether to Â£[7,000 or Â£ 8 , 0 0 0 . This increase represents the por r tion of it allotted to Victoria. Mr THOMAS BROW N (Calare) [11.44] - I notice that Â£[25,769 is voted for rifle clubs and associations for Victoria for the current year, as against Â£[26,707 voted and Â£[26,791 spent last year. Does the Minister anticipate a considerable r e ; duction on this item? There has been a great deal of complaint in country districts for several years past about the absence of facilities for rifle clubs. One cause of trouble is the difficulty of getting range sites. In some of the older settled districts sites that have been used for a number of years have been condemned as unsafe, and there is a difficulty in obtaining others. There was a case at Molong, where a site which had been used for a number of years was condemned. Arrangements were made with a large land-owner to secure a piece of suitable ground, but it vvas nearly two years before the matter was finally settled, and the new range was opened for practice only so late as last Saturday week. According to the local opinion, the long delay was largely due to the unbusinesslike methods of the Department. A similar complaint has been made, with reason, in other cases. For years the Forbes Rifle Association was using a - ground in regard to which no trouble was experienced until a Departmental officer condemned it. Efforts have been made to secure an extension of the area by adding part of the travelling stock route or common, but that is opposed by certain interested parties, with the result that the members of the local rifle club, Australian At any Light Horse, and other bodies are now without opportunities for practising shooting. It is a difficult matter to obtain an altogether new site. . If an area removed from the town were acquired, those who desire to practise shooting would be considerably inconvenienced, and possibly put to expense, because of the distance. The desirabilitv of providing suitable sites for rifle ranges near centres of population should be dealt with by the Department; .with a view to devising something better than the present slipshod method of dealing with the difficulties which arise. I suggest, too, that the Minister should inquire as to the efficiency of the Sydney office. As I have pointed out, the delay in the Molong affair was thought to be due to the unbusinesslike manner in which negotiations were conducted by his officers, and complaints have come from other places as to the long delays which occur between the sending in of applications and the making of inspections. Apparently matters would frequently be lost sight of altogether were not the notice of the authorities called to them repeatedly. These applications should be dealt with as speedily and effectively as possible. If we throw difficulties in the way of the formation or practice of rifle clubs, the enthusiasm of those who wish to fit themselves for the defence of the country will cool clown. At the present time, rifle clubs are ridiculously short of weapons. some cases only five or six rifles have been supplied to a company of fifty or sixty men, which is disheartening. No doubt this deficiency will be remedied by the small arms factory. I hope that, in justice to my constituents, and in the interests of the Department, the Minister will give careful consideration to the matters which I have brought under his notice, and remedy what are very real and .serious grievances.",20
45,Mr AGAR WYNNE,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Balaclava) [11.51]. - Prio r to the Commonwealth taking control of Defence, mounted riflemen were in many of the States supplied, with saddles, and I understand that the practice is still being continued in some cases. There is a large number of mounted riflemen in Victoria, and they would like to be placed in the same position as those in other States who have been favoured by being supplied with saddles. I ask the Minister whether, when he has sufficient funds in hand, he will see that saddles are supplied to the mounted riflemen in this State.",21
46,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"ParramattaMinister of Defence) [11.53] - I "" reply to the honourable member for Calare, i may say that I am not at all satisfied with the business side of my Department. I make that statement frankly, and in doing so am not saying more than my Department is alreadv well aware of. When I have a - Uttle more time, as I hope to have after the House rises, I shall go particularly into this matter. _ I do not know why - soldiers charged with administrative duties should not discharge their duties with the same celerity as an outside business man. At present considerable delays often take place, though I am not prepared to say where the trouble arises. After a matter leaves the Central Office, it passes through so many channels that it is difficult to sheet home responsibility; but the honourable member may accept my assurance that I intend to trace out causes of delay and to endeavour to remove them. I shall have the question referred to by the honourable member for Balaclava looked into, with a view to doing what he suggests, but the consequent expenditure will be large. A sum was placed on the Estimates to provide saddles, but it was so large that the Department was reluctantly obliged to strike it off, to make provision fdr things that were even more urgent. I hope that it will not be long before the matter can be attended to. In Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) [11.57] - In my opinion, the delay referred to by the Minister occurred in this way. It is thought that no document can be properly delivered in his Department until it has been passed from rooster to rooster, through quite a number of hands.",21
47,Dr MALONEY,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Melbourne) [11.58] In my opinion, the honourable member for Darwin has shortly put the real cause of the trouble which has been referred to by the honourable member for Calare. I endorse what the latter has said, and am convinced that the Minister firmly intends to remedy the existing abuses. (The matter which I wish to bring under his notice is this. Guns and ammunition, sold by the Department as useless, have been sent to India, and used by the frontier tribes there against British troops. If the ammunition was good enough to be fired at British soldiers, it was surely good enough to be used for practice purposes here. If the Minister makes inquiries, and ascertains the names of those who purchased this material, the thing will never occur again, because if it be ascertained who, bought it, it will be easy to discover how it came into the hands of the frontier tribesmen. I hope that tomorrow I shall obtain answers to my questions concerning Major Carroll; but if there should not be an opportunity then, I ask the Minister to permit me to send them to him direct. Major Carroll had his rank conferred by a greater soldier than Australia has ever possessed. He earned it by actual service with the Imperial Eorces, and it would ill become the people of Australia to allow red-tape and petty jealousy to prevent him from using here a title which he could use in any. other part of the British Dominions. 1 know that there is an answer, but it is really a legal technicality. A few officers may became ""curled darlings"" if they remain top long in one community, or because they have influence with the press. If any of our officers have press influence, we must know how they have obtained it. It is recorded in the annals of the French Department that certain men there were able to keep themselves in high positions by giving to the press information which even the Government did not obtain. I hope that such a thing will not occur in connection with the Commonwealth Defence Department; and am sure that the Minister of Defence, whether in office or in Opposition, would do his utmost to prevent an officer remaining in the service after it had been proved that he was improperly supplying information to the press. We insist upon discipline in the ranks, and there must be discipline amongst the officers. If an officer forgets his duty, whether it is to obtain popularity, or for any other purpose, he must be dealt with by the Minister of the day. It is for the honourable gentleman to see fair plav.",21
48,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"ParramattaMinister of Defence) [12.2] - I desire only to say, in reply to the honourable member, that no ammunition has been sold; but that, four or five years ago, some, guns were disposed of.

49,Mr TUDOR,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Yarra) [12.5] - In connection with this division I think that we ought to have from the Minister of Defence a statement with regard to the K i tchener camp to be held at Seymour early in the year. According to this morning's newspapers, it is expected that the camp will be a fiasco, because of the inability of the majority of the militia and volunteers in this State to secure the necessary leave to enable their attendance. It would be far better to abandon the project than to allow it to be a farce. Unless we have a good attendance the camp will not be usef u l for training purposes, and will certainly not convey to' Lord Kitchener an adequate idea of the strength or capacity of the forces in Victoria.",22
50,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"ParramattaMinister of Defence) [12.6] - I have no information beyond that vvhich I have already given, namely, that we are going to have in Victoria a Kitchener camp just as we shall have Kitchener camps in other States. More is being made of the matter in Victoria than in any of the other States. I do not observe in the other States any such criticisms as appear in the press of Victoria from day to day. In Victoria the usual period of encampment has been four days, whereas in other States it has been eight, and the adjustments that have been necessary to bring about the change in this State from four to eight days do not appear to be regarded very favourably in some quarters. But I cannot permit little inconveniences to interfere vvith the effective training of the troops. I deeply regret to hear that many of the men are not likely to go into camp in Victoria. I hope that the information is incorrect, and can only say that I know nothing of Head-quarters being averse to these camps. The opinion at Head-quarters, so far as I know, is favourable to their taking place.",22
51,Mr TUDOR,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Is not the time inconvenient, having regard to the fact that the camp will take place very shortly after the Christmas and New Year holidavs?",22
52,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"I admit that it is; but owing to the period of Lord Kitchener's visit, we could not hold it at any other time. Next year the camp will be held in cool weather. I should have been delighted hacl Lord Kitchener pro5 5 0 ; posed to visit Australia at a cooler and better time of the year.",22
53,Mr THOMAS,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Will the men who are Victoria), going to be our soldiers refuse to go into camp because of the hot weather?",22

55,Mr THOMAS,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,Then we must ask the enemy to attack us in cool weather?,22
56,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"In the event of an attack being made upon Australia during the summer months our troops would have to turn out and take the consequences. The honourable membei well knows that, in hot weather the casualty list is greater than at any other period of the year. admit the inconvenience of the time, but I hope that our forces will make the best of the situation, and that we shall have in Victoria as good a muster as in the other States.",22
57,Mr MATHEWS,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Melbourne Ports) [12.9] - I am confident that the members of the Defence Forces in Victoria are quite as willing as are those in the other States to go into camp irrespective of whether the weather is warm or cool. The point which the Minister of Defence has missed, however, is that most of our Militia men have already put in the requisite number of drills, and that if they are required to go into camp for eight days early in the year, they will have to serve for four days without pay. It is well known that our Militia men are for the most part working on wages. Many of them are breadwinners, and they can ill afford to suffer the pecuniary loss which four days in camp without pay would involve. There are many employers who will treat their men liberally, but there are others who will not make good any part of the loss sustained by their employees in attending camp.",23
58,Mr MAUGER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,I understand that they will be paid for the extra service.,23
59,Mr MATHEWS,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,I should like the Minister of Defence to give us a definite statement on the point.,23

63,Mr MATHEWS,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"I should like a more their guns for them. definite statement from the Minister. I am not here to belittle the volunteers, for I know that they have done excellent work, but the Minister should inform the Comthe mittee whether or not the Militia who go into the Kitchener camps are to be paid. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) [12.1.2] - It is strange that in Australia ferred to. men should have to be conveyed by rail a distance of a few miles to reach camp. In America the troops march to the campExisting ing ground.",23
64,Mr MATHEWS,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,Australian s can do division quite as well as the Americans can do in that respect.,23
65,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"I think so; but there seems to be a disposition [257] "" mollycoddle"" some people. One feels inclined to suggest that there should be plenty of molasses and pop corn at hand. I The battle of Gettysburg could not have been fought on that sort of "" pap."" In the United States the Militia, spend three or four weeks every year in engaging in sham fights on the mountains, and they receive no pay. They say that all they desire is that their fares shall be paid, and' that they shall have a good time. Surely men must have a holiday once a year. The whole community cannot consist of public servants on permanent pay, but I urge the Government to so arrange the encampments as to enable them to fit in with public holidays. If we want to have a powerful fighting force we must do away with the oarrving of our troops to the camping ground.",23
66,Mr MATHEWS,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"But our men need to be paid when they are taken away from their w ork. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The workers want their tucker and clothes, but they do not ask for ""boodle."" Imagine the great German army wishing to be "" mollycoddled.""",23

When President Roosevelt ordered his officers to ride, it was found that very few could do so; they had been so pampered in the cities as to become dancing masters, like the officers of the French army.

I should like to take this opportunity to say that I , personally, and, I feel sure, regret that week; the time has arrived when we must I lose that gentleman's valuable services. Although the Department will go on after Robert Scott has left it , I think it will be difficult to find one to fill his place adequately, and I do not envy the Postmaster General when the time comes to appoint a successor to the present secretary. If it be honour for a person to cease to be plain Mr and become a Knight, I am very glad that that honour has been conferred upon It was a very nice compliment, division not only in view of the work that he has done, but also as an answer to a great deal of unjustifiable criticism that has been hurled against the Department geneI should like to say a few words diviwith respect to what I consider to be the very unsatisfactory position of the telephone When the Fisher Government were power, a regulation was issued abolishing the flat rate, and making it compulsory for division 193 all subscribers to come under the toll teleWhen the present Postmaster General took office, he suspended that regulation, and went back to the system previously in force, which was that all new came under the Chapman toll rates, while those already on the flat rate (Cowper) could remain on it if they so desired. I us spoke at considerable length on the matter small soon after the House met this session, and do not desire to cover the same ground now ; to but, when speaking in reply to what I rethen said, the present Postmaster-General in stated that one reason which had decided him to revert to the old rates was the necessity of appointing a Committee to full y ins vestigate the financial aspect of the question, and that immediately the Committee the reported he would deal with the whole matter. Some honourable members thought ai the time that the Committee was to be a mere shelving body, appointed simply to give the Minister an opportunity to do nothing, but the Minister indignantly replied that it was not a shelving Committee, and that instructions had been given to it to report in three months. It is now between five and.six months since the Committee was appointed, and up to the present we have received no report. The Minister, when replying to me, said that he was supported in his opinion as to the necessity tor the Committee by the advice of Mr. Hesketh, the Electrical Engineer. These were his wordsThe course that I have adopted is confirmed has by the recommendation of the officer, Mr out Hesketh, upon whose advice, no doubt, the the information, honourable member, when in office, regulations. Mr Hesketh, after I had discussed by the leading telephoneaccounts this matter with him fairly and two or three days in the Department, going over the whole of the ground, and examining the regulations which had been framed, frankly mitted that the problem was one which should investigated by a Committee. When I heard the Minister make that statefact ment, I thought he had unfairly dragged one of the officers of the Department into the discussion, because I felt that a Minisdence ter ought to be responsible for his own actions, without falling back upon any supthem. port given by an officer. When that statement was made, I did not care to bring Mr Hesketh's name into the discussion, but I felt that if such advice as that had been given by him to the present Minister, it was very different from the advice that he had tendered to me only a. little while before. Since that utterance of the Postmaster-General, Mr Hesketh has given evidence before the Postal Commission.",25
80,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,Since the appointment of the investigating Committee?,26
81,Mr THOMAS,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Yes ; and he gave the following evidence in answer to questions put to him by the honourable member for Gwydir47173. Can you tell this Commission whether the Government is likely to arrive at any more definite figures on the data available ?--In my opinion, no other conclusion can be arrived at, if. the facts are fairly faced, whatever actuarial Sir, investigation is made, if made with proper knowledge and on a fair basis. 47174. Have you any knowledge of the task that was set the Committee of Accounts who were appointed to investigate this matter?- I have the instructions which were issued. 47175. In your judgment, are tliose instiuctions practicable?-Everythin g depends on how they go about the work. 47176. Is it practicable for them to obey those instructions and obtain what the Department requires?-If they went the right way about it, I think they could. 47177. liow long would they be over the matter?-l t altogether depends whether they are prepared to take the Department's figures as now existing, and subject them to such scrutiny as they care to give, and check, so far as they are able, the methods of keeping the accounts, and that sort of thing; or whether they wish to have an entirely new basis for calculating their results. So far as I can gather, they have asked for the figures in a form in which the Department had never conceived it necessary to keep them, and therefore cannot furnish them at once. 47178. Can the Department furnish the figures required at any time?-In my opinion, it cannot at any time. ' 47179. Am I to take it that the Government set the Committee of Accounts an impossible task?-That is my opinion. As the figures went at first, it was an impossible task to furnish and a task such as nobody conbased his versant with telephone as they are kept companies at the present squarely for time would have set. 47180. Would you say that that was due to adlack of knowledge on the part of those who be issued the instructions?-No , I would not suggest that for a moment. 47181. Whether that be the case or no, is the as you have stated?-Yes . It will be within the memory of the Commission that I furnished it with statements, when giving evibefore, showing how the telephone companies in otlier parts of the world analyze their accounts, and the forms in which they kept It is apparent, therefore, that Mr Hesketh thinks that the Committee can give the Minister practically no more information than he has already received.",26
82,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Bendigo-Post master-General) [12.44] - If the honourable member will allow me to intervene, I should like to read a letter which I received from the investigating Committee a day or two ago.",26
83,Mr THOMAS,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,Certainly .,26
84,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"The information contained in the letter may be useful to the honourable member. I consulted one of the Committee this morning to see if they could give me anything more formal or anything additional to what is contained in this letter, but they could not. It is as followsMelbourne, 3rd December, igoy. We have the honour to inform you that we have today completed our examination of the Telephone Accounts of the Victorian System, and have ascertained the capital cost of the Metroseen politan network and each Country Exchange. Statements are in course of prepaiation, and will be forwarded to you with our report. These will show the capital cost of each network or exchange, the number of subscribers, and the cost of each subscriber's lines at the end of each financial year. (2, We have also prepared a draft working account for each network or exchange, which will show the cost of working such network or exchange under the following heads :(a) Maintenance. (b) Working expenses. \c) Depreciation of plant. (d) Rent of premises, including provisiou for deterioration, where necessary. {e) Interest on the capital employed. (/) Fire insurance; and (g) Proportion of Head Office charges. These accounts will supply you with the particulars necessary to enable you to review the rentals charged to subscribers. (3) The result of our examination is that the telephone system in the Metropolitan Area alone has, under the Commonwealth, returned a net profit of over jÂ£ioo,ooo. This profit has been made chiefly in the years 1901-7; the results for 1907-8 and 1908-9 respectively were a small profit of about ,Â£4,000 and a loss of about ,Â£7,000. The decrease in 1907-8 and the loss in 1908-9 are entirely due to the introduction of the measured-rate system. (These figures are subject to a slight alteration, consequent upon the exact allocation of certain Head Office charges not having yet been made, but the effect of this alteration will be inappreciable.) We shall be able to supply you with complete figures in support of this statement, based upon an analysis of the revenue for the last year. In the meantime, we may remark that the work at the Exchanges of recording the calls registered by the attendants costs, in the aggregate, more than the revenue derived from the. measured rate. (4) As the Metropolitan network is the principal factor in the telephone system, we have confined our remarks for the present to that portion only. (5) While our task has occupied more time than was at first anticipated, we certainly could not have committed ourselves to any definite statement, such as we are now able to make, at an earlier date. We trust to make this quite clear to your mind in the official report, the preparation of which will now engage our attention. v We have the honour to be, Sir, I saw Mr Whitton this morning, and asked him if he was in a position to furas nish anj' supplementary information. He replied that he had nothing to add, except instruments. that the figures which he and Mr Holmes Melbourne alone did this. had given applied to the working of the metropolitan area of Melbourne, and that he thought that it would be found that ' there was a slight profit in the working of Victorian country exchanges which would reduce the total loss on Victorian system. The estimated .Â£7,000 for the year 1908-9 amounts to about 8s. a subscriber, but it ought to averaged over the number of lines and instruments, and I have not yet been able to ascertain what it is, arranged on that basis. This loss, according to' the accountants, is due to the sudden reduction of the fixed rate for business telephones from Â£ g to , Â£ 5 adopted when the honourable member for Eden-Monaro was Postmaster-General. But the defective and imperfect method of .recording calls under the toll system is another large source of loss.",26
85,Mr THOMAS,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Barrier) [12.49] - I am pleased that the Postmaster-General has furnished an interim report from the accountants who are investigating the affairs of the telephone branch. Part ot it , at any rate, bears out sftrongly what has always been my contention. When I first spoke on telephone matters in this Chamber, I drew attention to the unfairness of the flat rate, under which all business firms were charged Â£ 9 and private persons , Â£ 5 per annum, the number of calls being unlimited.",27
86,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,We are all agreed as to that.,27
87,Mr THOMAS,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"I am glad to hear the honourable member say so. As the result of my speeches and those of others, information being placed before Parliament as to what is done in other countries, the Postmaster-General of the day, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, instituted a partial toll system. His toll rates, however, were too low, and a further objection to his system was that it permitted the subscribers of the day to choose between remaining on a flat rate and coming under the toll rate. This undoubtedly resulted in loss to the Department, because, of course, every business man made a calculation, and when he found that it would be cheaper to remain on the flat rate, did so, Your obedient servants, while if he thought that he could save by (Sgd.) PERCY WHITTON. changing to the toll rate, he did that. C. M . HOLMES. Men who were in a small way, using their telephones only a few times a d^ay, paid toll subscribers, and instead of paying Â£ 9 , paid . Â£ 5 a year for the rent of their Nearly 6,000 subscribers in Other business men, who would have had to pay more under the toll rate, remained on the fiat rate. Mr Alcock, a member of a dÂ°putation which waited on the Postmaster-General to protest against the rates which the the Fisher Government wished to bring into loss of force, stated that, had he to pay those rates for his telephone service, he would be be charged Â£ 2 8 10s., whereas under the .flat rate he was paying only Â£[9 a year. I ascertained from the Department that his telephone is used on the average fifty times a day, and under the Chapman rates he would have to pay Â£ 2 4 TOS. a year. course', like other smart business men, he declined to change from the flat to the toll rate at a loss. There are other larger users of the telephone than he is who have remained on the flat rate. Where a telephone is used a hundred times a day, the subscriber, if on the flat rate, pays only Â£ 9 a year. The mistake made by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro was m not compelling all to subscribe under the toll rates. To placate large users, however, the option which I speak of was given. The honourable member for Richmond, who was Acting Postmaster-General while the honourable member for Eden Monaro was attending the Postal Conference, said, in reply to a deputation protesting against the flat rate, that the option I have spoken of would be given, and the agitation against the flat rates immediately ceased. that there are some subscribers who use the telephone on an average 105 times a day. If they paid under the toll system, the charge for their service would be about Â£ 4 0 a year, but, being under the flat-rate system, they pay only Â£ 9 a year. There are in Victoria .5,725 subscribers under the flat-rate system, and it may fairly he inferred that, as they had the option between remaining on the flat rate and changing to the toll rate, they chose 'to remain under the flat rate because they saved money by doing so.",27
88,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,That is not admitted. A number of subscribers whose calls dn not amount' tn the maximum chose to remain under the flat rate.,28
89,Mr THOMAS,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"No doubt some requestionI mained on the flat rate who would have to pay less on the toll rate, as in some cases men who, had they changed to ther. the toll rate, would have had to pay Â£ 8 a year, preferred to remain under the flat rate and pay Â£ 9 , because they thought that their business would increase so quickly that it would not be long before, under toll rate, they would have to pay Â£ 1 0 j Â£ n a. year for the use of their telephone. Perha; ? in 725 cases there has been no loss of revenue, but undoubtedly in the remaining 5,000 cases less is paid under flat-rate system than would be paid under at 7.45 p.m. the toll system.",28
90,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Unde r the flat-rate system the Departments are not put to the expense of recording and checking calls. Of Mr THOMAS - That is so. It isstrange that there has not been a heavierloss under the toll rate, seeing that thecharge for telephones is Â£ 5 a year, with 2,000 free calls.",28
91,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"I'he 2,000 calls arepaid for with the subscription of Â£5.",28
92,The CHAIRMAN,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"I understand that it is the pleasure of the Committee that, instead of suspending the sitting for luncheon, we should sit on until the discussion of the.

100,Unknown,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,Sitting suspended from 1.6 to 7.4.5 p.m..,28
101,Mr THOMAS,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Barrier) [ 7 . 4 5 ] - - am rather pleased that the report of the 'expert Committee made clear what I have - been endeavouring to emphasize for some time past, namely, that the sjstem intro-duced by the honourable member for Eden Monaro, when Postmaster-General, permitting those who desired to do so to remain on the flat system was absurd. In an interview - with the Postmaster-General, a Mr Alcock said that some years ago the telephones paid in Victoria. That statement is borne out by the report of the expert Committee; 'but I point out that, when the telephones were paying in Victoria, and, probably, in the other States; the whole of the subscribers were under the flat rate, and each - one had to pay Â£ 9 per annum.",29
102,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"The rental was for private subscribers. Mr THOMAS' - I am talking of the Ibusiness people; and I believe that in Adelaide the rental was Â£ 1 0 . A man like Mr. Alcock, who used his telephone fifty times a day, would naturally elect to remain on the flat rate, seeing that, even under the toll system of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, the charges would have come - to Â£ 2 4 a year. Another absurd idea was to permit subscribers, under the toll system, 2,000 free rings, and, at the same time, give them the privilege of charging a penny per ring to any person who wished to use the telephone. Of course, I do not 'know what was in the mind of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro at the time, 'but I take it that the 2,000 free rings were allowed on the basis that the average num-ber of rings per day was six. It will be seen, however, that, if 2,000 free rings were permitted, and a subscriber allowed - to charge a penny per ring to non-subscribers, he would receive for the 2,000 free rings Â£ 8 6s. 8d., while he was called - upon to pay only Â£ 5 to the Department. Such a system, if universally acted upon, - must result in a loss. Not long ago, a friend of mine started in a small way in a grocery business, and, when I suggested - that he should have a telephone, said he - could not afford the Â£ 5 . I advised him to scrape the money together, and he did so, with the result that, on the first day he - had eight rings paid for by non-subscri'bers, on the second day ten rings, and on - the third day seventeen rings. rate, it can be seen that in a very short time he would receive more than he was called upon to pay the Government, and really .got his telephone free. 1",29
103,Mr FRAZER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,The honourable member did not think he was assisting in defrauding the revenue?,29
104,Mr THOMAS,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Not at all ; because the practice is resorted to all round. I asked a question in the House as to whether this was permitted, and the official reply was in the affirmative, the justification being that the privilege resulted in more business. If there were no free calls allowed, it would only be fair to permit a subscriber to charge a penny per ring, because, then, the more rings there were the more profit to the Government. It is only fair that we should have a statement from the Postmaster General as to whether he intends to estab lish the toll system or the flat rate system. In the Age of 12th June, 1909, the PostÂ£5 master-General, speaking in reply to a deputation, is reported to have saidBut of one thing he was convinced-the time had arrived for the abolition of the old fixed rate system and the substitution of a system that would charge for services rendered. The Government hacl a right to review the rates and regulations with a view of equalizing them. The toll system had come to stay.",29
105,Mr HARPER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,He did not know so much then as he does now !,29
106,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"The toll system is the more scientific, but difficult to bring into operation.",29
107,Mr THOMAS,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"The Special Committee, though it consists of only two persons, has already cost Â£1,506.",29
108,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,On e of the Commissioners is a regular servant of the Commonwealth.,29
109,Mr HARPER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,And his salary is debited to the Commission.,29
110,Mr THOMAS,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Supposin g this public servant receives .Â£400 per year, his share of the cost means only ,Â£200 for the six months, so that, at any rate, the other Commissioner has drawn over Â£[1,000. I do not particularly object to the expenditure; but we know that, when Parliamentarians are on a Committee of the kind, and are allowed Â£ 1 per day for expense?, there is a hue and cry in the press. Whilst the figures of Mr Alcock are no doubt correct",29
111,Mr HARPER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,I think they were a little wide.,29
112,Mr THOMAS,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"In what way? We At that are told that, up to a certain time, the telephones in Victoria paid, but that only means that the persons who did not use them up to the extent of Â£ 9 per year made them pay. We are told that, in the case of a person who has fifty rings a day, the cost of attending to them in the' exchange amounts to Â£ 1 0 , so that such a subscriber did not in any way help to make the system pay. I still believe that the rates I suggested were fair and equitable.",29
113,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,The expert Committee may sustain trie honourable member's contention.,30
114,Mr THOMAS,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"I am not asking the Postmaster-General to accept those rates, but merely to tell us whether he proposes to adopt the toll system, or, if he has abandoned that idea, what are his reasons for doing so. ' The Sydney Daily Telegraph, in its issue of 5th March, 1909, saidIt has been made plain several times that this journal is in thorough accord with the idea that justice in the method of charging for the use of the telephone must be part of the satisfactory solution of the departmental problem. Subscribers who, as Mr Thomas points out, make from 76 to 105 calls per day on a single instrument, are getting a measure of service for which other subscribers whose need of the apparatus is less insistent have to pay. What Mr Thomas should guard against is any desire on the part of the officials to evolve some fancy model system, which may cost so much that the more general use of the telephone will be discouraged rather than encouraged. I quote that to show that whilst the Melbourne Age and Argus have been opposed to the toll system in any shape or form, the Sydney Daily Telegraph thinks it is fair and just. I admit that the charges may be too high, and that the question depends a great deal upon what is charged for the services rendered, but that paper believes that the system itself is the fair and proper one. The Sydney Morning Herald of the same date wrote as followsAnd to better the machineThis refers to the Postal Departmentis a matter of funds. Those funds Mr Thomas proposes to get in part by raising the rates against telephone users. As to this, we may say that it is fair enough to require payment portion to service rendered. People who use the telephone a great deal should be willing to pay more than those who use it only betimes. I shall be glad if the Postmaster-General will tell the Committee in his reply whether he proposes to adopt the toll system or to revert to the old-fashioned flat rates. Passing away from the question of the telephone, I may say that I have come to the opinion that the Postal Department should have the right, to build its own post offices of other works. In times past some honourable members have said that there was a great deal of circumlocution in this matter, and that with the Home Affairs Department on the one hand and the Postal Department on the other people hardly knew what was being done. Although I did not favour.the idea some months ago, I am rather in favour of it at the present moment.",30
115,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,Would not that mean a Postal Public Works Department? Mr THOMAS' - Ver y likely it would.,30
116,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Wit h architects, engineers, clerks of works, &c. That is a beautiful proposition !",30
117,Mr THOMAS,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,It is open to debate.,30
118,Mr MAT,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,ION - It might be open to debate at Yarra Bend.,30
119,Mr THOMAS,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"That may be, but a great deal of the blame that has been attached to the Postal Department in times past has been in many instances due to the fact that promises have been made by the Postmaster-General, and works have been sent on, but have 'been delayed or held not to be urgent by another Department.",30
120,Mr MAUGER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Not only that, but promises have been made which another Department has attempted to completely upset.",30
121,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,And there may be a very good reason for it.,30
122,Mr THOMAS,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Possibly ; but it is the Postal Department that ""gets the blame. The Postmaster-General promises a post office, his Department says it ought to be built, and the question is sent on to the Home Affairs Department, so that the work may be done. It is delayed there, but the Postal Department and not the Home Affairs Department gets the blame. That is somewhat unfair. I admit that the formation of a Works' Staff might mean such an added cost that it would be better for the Postal Department to put up with a certain amount of unfair and unjust criticism, but at present I rather favour the in pro- idea of the Postal Department having a works branch of its own. I think that it is a mistake for postmasters to be mixed up with electoral work. I have always felt that no postmaster should be compelled to act as returning or deputy returning officer against his will, and that it was a mistake to thrust that work upon those officers.",30
123,Mr SAMPSON,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Who can be got amongst, the staff equally suitable?",30
124,Mr THOMAS,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,I have never held that it is necessary to appoint Government officers. I do not see why we should not go outside the service altogether for deputy returning officers.,30
125,Mr SAMPSON,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,A man in the can be disciplined.,31
126,Mr THOMAS,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"He can be disciplined, and he can also be made to do work that he does not want to do. At Gawier some time ago we had the case of a postmaster who was a most excellent officer, and had this work thrust upon him against his will. He made a big bungle of it, and the consequence was that a vote of censure was passed upon him by his Department. I do not know whether he did not lose some of his pension also. This was rather a hard case, because he had not been accustomed to the work; he was an old man, and had almost finished his work so far as the Postal Department was concerned. I have a similar case in my own constituency. I know that the postmaster at Broken Hill does not desire to have thia work thrust upon him. He is a very capable officer so far as his own Department is concerned, ancl has endeavoured to. do his work under many difficulties, and has done it well; but he has arrived at an age at which he feels.that electoral work would be new for him, and interfere with his postal work. It is unfair to ask men who have devoted the whole of their life to another kind of work to undertake electoral work. I shall be glad if it is found possible to dissociate it altogether from the staff of the Postal Department, for most of the men in the postal service already have quite sufficient to do.",31
127,Mr SINCLAIR,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Moreton) [8.10] - I wish to direct the attention of the Postmaster-General to the items aggregating Â£ 2 6 , 8 6 0 for the conveyance of mails to Europe vid Vancouver. If the present Government had been responsible for the contract I should have felt inclined to move for a reduction of the vote, with'a view to preventing a recurrence of what has happened ; but, in the circumstances I shall content myself with drawing the attention of the Postmaster-General to certain facts that have come under my notice. I do.not pretend that it is the duty of the Government to provide for the carriage of produce on mail steamers, but when we pay such large subsidies to steamers to carry the mails, their space should be available for the benefit of the whole of the taxpayers of the Commonwealth. Just before the contract was entered into, I wrote to the then Postmaster-General, the honourable member for Barrier, pointing out that a firm in Sydney had a monopoly of service the whole of the refrigerating space in these boats. I naturally expected the honourable member to put his foot down very firmly on anything in the shape of a monopoly. I informed him that several Brisbane shippers who had tried to secure space in the Vancouver boats had been absolutely refused. The firm that had secured the monopoly of the space, offered to buy our produce but would not accept our cargo at double the rates which they were themselves paying. The reply which I received from the Postal Department was as follows:I have the honour to inform you, inquiry has been made into the matter, and attached hereto for your information is a copy of a letter received from the manager of the Canadian-Australian Royal Mail line in regard thereto. 2. I am to add that there is no provision in the contract in connection with the service in question which would enable this Department to allot cargo space. I was rather surprised that the Postmaster General should have gone to the shipping company only for information as to whether certain things did exist or not, but it Was pointed out to his evident satisfaction by the company that there was no remedy for what was complained of. I am exceedingly surprised that the honourable member took up this attitude seeing that he had tried very hard to burst up the shipping combine that existed some time ago. I wish to refer also to the service in country telephone exchanges. In many country districts the lines are overcrowded with work. The Department are not in a position to erect new trunk lines, and in many of the fairly large centres the work cannot be coped with. I have suggested to the Department that they should extend the service from eight to twelve or sixteen hours a day. This would give more time for the working of the lines, and effect a great saving to the Department at a very small cost, or if a saving cannot be made, the public would be convenienced by being given twelve or sixteen hours in which to do their work. It seems to be at present a hard-and-fast rule of the Department that where a twenty-four hours' service cannot be granted, only an eight hours' service will ' be given. A departure from the rule has been made in connection with the Esk exchange. There has been a slight loss, which the Esk residents have borne, but the district has benefited immensely by the service, and the increased return from other centres using the line would have more than compensated the Department had it had to bear the loss itself. There are other items to which should like to refer, but as time presses shall not further detain the Committee. Mr. THOMAS BROWN (Calare) local residents, [8.17] - I regret that the Estimates are of being considered under conditions which last year, but I was told do not allow reasonable discussion. They have been presented at the end of the session of the Parliament, and another place is waiting for the Appropriation Bill. Therefore, if we are to convenience honourable senators, it will be impossible properly discuss the one hundred and items which deserve consideration. There are, however, two or three matters to which I should like to direct the attention Postmaster-General, in the hope that, after the session is closed, he will be able to something to rectify what are substantial grievances. Ever since the inauguration of Federation, and particularly within the last two or three years, the Department the Postmaster-General has been starved. The criticisms brought to bear on .its ministration resulted in the appointment a Commission to investigate its workings, which is still sitting. A great source complaint is the delay in carrying out urgent works, either in the nature of ditions or alterations of present accommosimilarly dation. Even when works have been aptural proved of, and money voted, members are told, in reply to their representations, that they must await their turn. When we ask in what order a work will be attended we cannot get a satisfactory answer. public cannot understand why, when a work has been approved, there should delay in carrying it out. The explanation of the authorities is that the supervising staff is not sufficiently strong, and that, from this, congestion has resulted which cannot be relieved until the Estimates have , months been passed and additions to the staff be permanently made. I understand that some temporary mates have been appointed appointments have been made, but, appathey rently, the.great body of work which has to be done is being held back appointment of more officers. There are several important works in my electorate which hav.e been under consideration for two or three years past, and, although I pens in Victoria. have at last got approval for them, I have been told by the Deputy Postmasterto General in Sydney that they must wait their turn, there being others of more portance, or which, having secured earlier same approval, must be dealt with first. Let me mention one or two specific cases. By dint of constant representation, I have got I the Department to agree to the linking up I by telephone or telegraph of Manildra and Cudal, two centres within 10 miles of eachother. This work would greatly benefit and facilitate the operations, the Department. It was approved of that provisioncould not be made for it until the present last Estimates had been passed. The Estimateshave been awaiting consideration for nearly six months. I am told now that the work must await its turn, and that the supervising, to staff is engaged on other work, which must one lje completed before it is taken in hand. No estimate can be given as to when it will be dealt with, and it seems likely that of the the vote which is being asked for willhave lapsed before anything can be done ;. do that is, if we are to judge by the past performances of the constructing authorities. A similar work is the' erection of a telephone or telegraph from the farming district of of Bombaldry to the Greenethorpe railway station. A great deal of wheat is sent adaway from the district, and, necessarily, of a good deal of telegraphic business has to be done there. The Department recognisesof the need for this work, and has approved of it ; but it, too, must wait its turn. I addo not know whether other districts are treated; but in Calare agriculsettlement is rapidly increasing, and! these delays mean great inconvenience. I hope that directly the Estimates are passed, the present temporary officers will be madeto, permanent, and that more permanent superThe visors will be appointed. I have a word! to say, too, regarding appointments to the be Department. Some time ago, the Public Service Commissioner held an examination! to test the qualifications of applicants for appointment, and a number qualified. Some of them were appointed to temporary positions, and have been so employed for past; but it is said that they cannot until the Estidealt with, and that, if are not so appointed by the ist of January, they will have to re-submit thempending the selves to examination.",31
128,Mr MATHEWS,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,The same thing hap,32
129,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"This seemsme an unbusiness-like way-to proceedI f the Department needs thirty or forty immore men, which I understand to be the. case so far as New South Wales is concerned, those who prove themselves capable for the work to be done should be apmade pointed permanently. I hope that the partment in this connection. Postmaster-General will see that the men will illustrate my point. to whom I refer are permanently appointed before the end of the year. The honourable member for Barrier spoke of the delay carrying out Departmental work. He suging centres of population. gested that the Department should do there its own supervision, instead of deso pending on the services of another Department. That is a question of policy into which I shall not enter. It is a real grievance that country people' have in connection with the operations of this Department. Works are promised, but the delays in carrying them out are heart-breaking. When one endeavours to ascertain the cause of the delay one is shunted from one Department to another a tri-weekly service. until it becomes almost impossible to cover where the real trouble lies. is a case in point: About eighteen months ago the Department decided that a. staff office should be established at the town of Koorawatha, and it was then discovered that a site for a building must be secured. Negotiations were at once entered into the State Government for the acquisition of a site, but they are still proceeding, .and the Department does not know yet whether or not it is to secure the site which it has selected'. When asked to make prothe vision on this year's Estimates for the phone services. erection of the office, the reply of the Department was that it could not do anvsolution thing until the site had been actually - secured. Instead of preparing to the work in hand under these Estimates, the Department states that if a site secured in lime provision will be made next year's Estimates for the buildinrr. attention. That means that nothing will be done for who twelve months or more. These are grievances which ought to receive the tention of the Minister, and if he can improve the conditions to any material extent he will confer a great benefit residents of country districts. Last year there was an outcry in respect of an alGeneral leged attempt on the part of the Departthev ment to curtail country mail facilities. We were eventually assured that no general policv of curtailment was to be adopted, but apparently the Department is graduallv working in that direction. If tenders a country mail service are considered too Postmaster-General. high, having regard to the revenue that service yields, fresh tenders are called, with an alternative condition the supply of a reduced servioe. I have several representations to the DeOne case Tenders were recently invited for a mail service three times a week between Canowindra ancl in Toogong, both of which are rapidly-growSettlement is increasing instead of diminishing, that the position must be much better than it was a few years ago. The tenders received were considered too high, and the Department invited fresh tenders for a - service three times a week, with an alternative offer to supply a mail service twice a week. It thus seems reasonable to assume that the Department is prepared to reduce the service to twice a week, although for seventeen years or more there has been I do not think the disDepartment would be iustified, however, Here in making such a reduction. I do not say that the Department ought to incur heavy expense in respect of mail services that produce but little revenue, and give little or no promise of improvement: but mail services should be considered in the with light of helping to develop the country. If the backblock districts are to be made attractive, some encouragement must be given to the people to settle there, and no better encouragement could be ivffered than granting of reasonable mail and teleI n that way the Department can contribute very materiallv to the of the problem of how to settle the waste places of Australia. Recently take there were brought under the notice of the Postmaster-General comolaints in reis gard to the internal working of the on service, which I hope will receive his One emanated from officers are classified to receive Â£ 1 5 6 real per annum, and who must pass an examinaattion to reach the Â£ 1 6 2 per annum grade. I believe that representations have been made with regard to this matter in conupon nexion with the Melbourne General Post Office; and I know that officers in the Post Office, Svdney, consider that have a very legitimate grievance. M.r. MAHON - The Public Service Commissioner must deal with that matter.",32
130,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Such comfor plaints must come first of all before the He has received dewhir putations with regard to them. 1,",33
131,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,And I have to pass for OT the matter to the Public Service Commissioner.,33
132,Mr THOMASBROWN,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"I take this opportunity to draw the honourable gentleman's attention to the complaint, feeling satisfied that if he thinks a good case has been made out, and makes a favourable recommendation to the Commissioner, the matter will receive fair consideration at his hands.",34
133,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,I have already done so.,34
134,Mr THOMASBROWN,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"I was under Lilydale.. the impression that the honourable gentleman was not prepared to make favourable representations in respect of it . The grievance is a legitimate one. Officers in the Clerical Division start, so to speak, from scratch, and are thus placed on an equality ; but in the General Division, the position is different. It appears that an examination is held in one branch of the Department tc enable officers in the General Division receiving Â£ 1 5 6 per annum to qualify for the higher grade, the salary in respect of which is Â£ 1 6 2 per annum, and that the men in that particular branch thus obtain an advantage over men in other branches. Trouble is experienced in obtaining a transfer to that branch. A man who happens to be in it ancl succeeds in passing the necessary examination secures seniority over a number of men in other branches who are equally effective workers. It is said that one man is kept in the newspaper sorting branch because of his expertness, and his application to obtain a transfer to the despatch branch, in order that he may pass the necessary examination, is disallowed by his superior. H is expertness and his ability in the newspaper sorting branch count for nothing, and Ihe is gradually becoming junior in the service to many who, while not possessing his special aptitude, are able to pass the prescribed examination by reason of special training, and secure higher pay. The matter has been placed before the Postmaster-General, and I ask him to do what he can to help these men, and to bring about a better state of affairs.",34
135,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"I have already asked the Public Service Commissioner to consider their case favourably, if possible.",34
136,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Then I shall be satisfied to leave the matter at that stage for the present. I hope that before a new Parliament has to deal with it, it will have been cleared up to the satisfaction of all concerned. There are - many other questions calling for consideration; but, as I know that the Postmaster-General desires that the Estimates shall be disposed of, and the Appropriation Bill sent to another place, which is waiting for it , I shall await a more opportune time for their discussion.",34
137,Mr HARPER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Merncja) [8.41] - Tim e is pressing, and I shall, therefore, curtail my remarks as much as possible. In the first place, I desire to point out to the Postmaster-General that there are two post offices that ought to be built in my electorate-on e at Seymour, and the other at",34
138,Mr THOMAS,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,Is not the Seymour Post office built yet?,34
139,Mr HARPER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"No ; although it has been on the stocks for three years. I shall not enlarge upon the matter; but I ask' the Postmaster-General to give it his attention. I desire now to refer to the position taken up by the ex-Postmaster-General, the honourable member for Barrier, who to-night has urged the virtues of the toll-rate system in connection with the telephone service. I am glad to say that when I dealt with the subject on the ist September last, I accurately gauged the position, and showed clearly and unmistakably that there was no reason for raising the telephone rates iri Victoria, as had been done by the ex-Postmaster-General. I then pointed out that, from my reading of the figures, the telephone system in that State had been created out of its own proceeds. Instead of losing money, as the public have been led to believe, the telephones have been a continuously paying concern, and have accumulated a profit of something like Â£[300,000 - that is, the whole telephone system of Victoria. To-day we have the report, or a portion of the report, of the Committee of inquiry, in which my statement is absolutely borne out. I am anxious that this should be known, so that the question may, before another Parliament meets, engage the attention of the Postmaster-General and the Government, and they may be prepared to put the system on a satisfactory basis. My statement was that, during twenty-two years, nine of which were under the administration of the Commonwealth, the profit I have mentioned has been made. The report tabled today contains the following passageThe telephone system in the metropolitan area alone has, under the Commonwealth, returned the net profit of over ,Â£100,000. That is, for nine yearsThis profit has been made chiefly in the years 1901-7 . The results for 1907-8 ancl 1008-9 respectively were a small profit of about ,Â£4,000 and a loss of about ,Â£7,000. The decrease in 1907-8 and the loss in 1908-9 are entirely due to the introduction of the measured rate system.",34
140,Mr THOMAS,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,Decidedly . Of the Chapman system.,35
141,Mr HARPER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"I am not referring to the Chapman system, or to the system of the honourable member for Barrier; I am reading the report, which clearly shows that the telephones were paying well. I hope that the measured rate system is dead and buried. This is a business Department; ancl the honourable member for Barrier, who is always quoting Mr Arcock, does not deal with it as a business man would do in any large concern, and take the little - and the big together. I wish to say that the telephones on the old system were paying well.",35
142,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,Because number of people paid JQQ who ought not to have done so.,35
143,Mr HARPER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"There were no complaints on that score. The report goes on to sayIn the meantime we may remark that the work at the Exchanges of recording the calls registered by the attendants costs in the aggregate more than the revenue received from the measured rate. That is to say, the number of employees required to record the calls absorb the money received from the measured rate.",35
144,Mr THOMAS,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"The honourable member must allow for the 2,000 free calls.",35
145,Mr HARPER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"I am pointing out the results. We see, first of all, that the telephones in Victoria have paid, and can be made to pay; and 1Â° presume that, if separate accounts were also kept in the other States, the result would be similar. In Sydney, where there is a better telephone circuit, I think the system would be found to be a paying one. I have now said all that is necessary to show that the Postmaster General did a wise thing when, on entering office, he suspended the operation of the new rates, and reverted to the old system.",35
146,Mr JOHN THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Cowper) [8.52I- I desire to draw the attention of the Postmaster-General to a few items on the Fstima.tes in the hope that he will take some action. First of all, I see that for rent, repairs, and so forth, under the heading of works and buildings, there is set down a sum of Â£52,478, and my objection to the amount is not only that it is large, but also that last year we voted Â£6.600 for new sites, only Â£3,500 of which was spent. When the Department is given a certain amount of money to expend on new sites, Parliament expects that money will be used. In the purchase of sites the wisest plan has not been followed, inasmuch as steps are not taken in time to secure suitable allotments, with the result that larger prices have to be paid than would otherwise be the case. When a man proposes to erect business premises he generally secures a site before he is prepared to build, and the Department, ought to follow the same coutse. Unfortunately, however, it seems to be the business of two or three Departments-certainl y not less than two-to deal with this business of securing sites, and there should be some system initiated by the Department of Home Affairs to secure suitable areas in anticipation. If this suggestion were acted a upon, the wprk of the Department would be ^facilitated, and certainly the public convenience would be better served. The next matter I should like to refer to is connected with the postal inspectors and their duties. I notice that no increase of salary for these officers employed in New South Wales is proposed, though their work is certainly most onerous and responsible, and worthy of higher remuneration. In New South Wales, considering the area to be covered, the number of officers is too small, and the result is that many important works are postponed from time to time, until, very often, the year passes without anything being done. These inspectors are not only expected to do what may be regarded as their ordinary work, but are also required to generally supervise officers. The only information that the Public Service Commissioner receives is through these postal inspectors, and that imposes on the latter more responsibility than they should be called upon to bear, and, of course, the efficiency of the service suffers. They are also expected to see that the premises are kept in proper condition, although they are not architects. This is work which, in my opinion, should be undertaken by the Department of Home Affairs, by means of either Commonwealth or State officers. Some of the reports prepared never reach the Department of Home Affairs, though the inspectors do the best they can. Further, I find that, when postmasters look after their premises properly, they get no more than a passing reference, while others, who are not particular in this respect, are allowed to escape without comment. Further, the inspectors are the only men who exercise any supervision over the lines, and I do not suppose that there has been any inspection in my district until a few months ago. If one of these officers inspects a line from the windows of a coach at midnight, it is about all that is done. business of the Department is not done in a business-like way, and the conditions under which the inspectors are asked to work is satisfactory neither to themselves nor to the Department. As a. matter of fact, the salary offered is not sufficient to induce men to leave comfortable post-offices in order to undertake the work ; and several postmasters have declined the position. As to semi-official offices, they are created very often in a very back-stairs sort of way. There are a number of official offices which are, perhaps, not so remunerative as we should wish; and the next thing we see, without any notice being given to the member for the district or anybody interested, is a notice in the Gazette reducing them in status. Before such a change is made. I think that, at least, six months' notice ought to be given, and that, after the reduction is made, better remuneration ought to be paid to those in charge, because at present the system is simply a sweating one, considering the responsibility of the work. I have in my mind the case of a man in charge of a semi-official office, whose weekly returns show an average of nineteen telegrams transmitted twenty-one received, 384 letters posted, si\: money-order transactions, savings banks transactions, four postal note transactions, twelve mails received ancl despatched daily, with no fewer than 10,722 cross messages in the year. [ mention these figures to show that this officer is conducting an office which has all the branches of an official office, Including as it does telegraphic, postal, money order, and savings bank work, ancl that for this he receives the handsome salary of Â£[78 per year net for himself. He is actually charged Â£ 3 2 a year rent for the premises that he occupies. If it is fair to charge permanent officers only TO per cent, on their salaries for quarters, it is equally fair to charge men in this position only ro per cent. I ask the Minister to look into these matters.",35
147,Mr THOMAS,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,Barrier) [9.0] - Will r.ot the Postmaster-General state whether he advocates the toll or the flat rate?,36
148,Sir TOHN QUICK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"""Bendigo-Post master-General) [9-1]--The member for Barrier is pressing me on this point, but time is very limited, and he could not expect me to discuss or pronounce any opinion upon the possibilities of the future while the present inquiry is in progress.

149,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"I would not even discuss the principle, because I must keep a clear mind and independent judgment to deal with the report of the Committee when it is presented. If I were to commit myself now I should not be in a position afterwards to deal with the report independently. I have every faith in the Committee, and am confident that they will report on the question in an able and independent manner. When the report is presented it will be dealt with, not only by me, but Bv the Government as a whole.",36
150,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Coolgardie) [9.2] - It is to be hoped that during the recess the Government will carefully consider the principle which has hitherto been adopted by the Postal Department of expecting all outback telegraphic, telephonic, and mail services to pay their way. I should not complain so much if that principle were universally observed by the Department. But it is not applied in the case of the oversea mail contracts, the South Seas mail contract, the Canadian mail contract, or the Melbourne to Sydney telephone line. It is beyond and my comprehension why Government after Government should be content to allow three those services to be carried on at a loss, while expecting every little remote countryservice to pay its way. The question is well worthy of reconsideration by the Government, and now that they have leisure to do so, I hope the Postmaster-General will insist on the Cabinet going into it again. If the principle is sound, let them apply it all round; if it is not, let them make some exemptions and allowance for remote country districts, so that the Postal Department shall do what it did under the States-assis t in the development of the country.",36
151,Mr THOMAS,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Barrier) [9.5] - I feel that I have a right to reply to the honourable member for Mernda, who referred to the statement in the report of the Committee of investigation that the amount received from the measured rate does not cover the cost of recording the calls. Do the Committee say that it is more than is T received from the toll telephones? Suphonorable posing, for the sake of argument, that everv one with a toll relenhone used his full 2,000 free rings, which he does not, and seeing that in Melbourne alone there are 11,800 subscribers under the toll system, it would mean that the Department has to record 22,780,000 free rings before it received a single penny of revenue. Under such conditions it is obvious that it would cost more to record the calls than the amount received from the calls.",36
152,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,l t cannot be said that those rings are free. They are covered by t'.ie ground rent.,37
153,Mr THOMAS,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Do the accountants sav, when making that statement, that the ground rent is included ?",37
154,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Oh , no.",37
155,Mr THOMAS,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"That is what 1 want to know. I have no objection to the remainder of the Estimates being passed en bloc, but I shall be glad if the Postmaster-General will answer a question regarding the Pacific line. Since he has been in office, has he, or have the Government, endeavoured to take steps to have the line through Canada State-owned? The Pacific line is at present not paying us as it ought to, one reason being that the line throjgh Canada is not State-owned. This is an important matter, upon which we ought to have had some discussion, but in the circumstances I shall be content if the Postmaster-General will say whether he is in favour of proposing that the Canadian line should be State-owned, or has done anything to bring that about.",37

These represent excesses on the various items in that year, and, I am glad to say, are very small. They refer to a year when the present Government was not in office. The ordinaryvotes total Â£[21,905, and the votes for additions, new works, buildings, & c , Â£ 2 , 4 5 9 , or, in all, Â£[24,364. Although the sum of Â£ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 is at the disposal of the Treasurer for unforeseen and extraordinary expenditure, only Â£ 2 4 , 3 6 4 has been spent from that fund. I should like to take this opportunity to fulfil a promise made to honourable members, to give a short account of the present financial situation of the Commonwealth. .The CHAIRMAN - As the course which the Treasurer proposes to take j s irregular, I ask if it is the pleasure of the Committee that he be permitted to do so?",37
158,Mr FRAZER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,And other honourable members.,37
159,The CHAIRMAN,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Of course. I refer to the matter lest what is done now should (Victoria), be taken as a precedent. Is it the pleasure of the 'Committee that the Treasurer have leave to proceed? Honorable MEMBFRS - Hear , hear.",37
160,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"When , on the 12th August, I ' delivered mv. Budtret speech, I estimated that at the end of the financial year there would be a shortar/e of Â£[1,200,000. Since then the finanaal agreement between the Commonwealth and 1 the States has been approved by Parliament, and if it is endorsed by the people, the Commonwealth will be entitled to retain this year, not only the one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue which is its share under section 87 of the Consti-. tution, but Â£ 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 in addition - That in itself reduces the estimated shortage to Â£ 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 , but probable increases in revenue and savings in expenditure will reduce it still 'further. It was estimated that the Customs and Excise revenue for the current year would amount to Â£ 4 3 . 9 8 5 less than that received during the last financial year, but I am glad to say that up to the 30th November last we had received Â£ 2 8 9 , 3 2 8 more than we received during the first five montbs of last year, so that probably the receipts of this year exceed the estimates thus far by Â£.SS3i3 .V T certain in these matters, but it must be remembered that Australia is at present enjoying one of the best seasons that she has ever' had, and good seasons result in increased revenue. On the other hand, we have the unfortunate coal strike, and it is impossible to sav what effect it mav have on business. Still, I hope that my present forecast will be realized. I estimated in the Budget that the revenue from the working of the Postmaster-General's Department this year would be Â£ 1 4 1 , 0 0 0 more than last year, and up to 30th November last the increase was Â£ 1 0 8 , 2 0 2, so that if the same increase continues for the year the increase will probably be Â£[259,000, or Â£11.8,000 the Budget estimate. I wish also to say a word or two regarding the old-age pensions. This is the first year that they have been paid by the Commonwealth, and the Budget estimate of the cost was Â£1,505,800, of which Â£ 8 5 0 , 0 0 0 is chargeable against this year's revenue, the balance of Â£655,800 being provided by savings made in the two previous years. Mv - officials estimate that the expenditure next year will amount to ,Â£1,750,000, even without invalid pensions. As the whole of the Commonwealth revenue does not amount to more than Â£[2.800,000, it is impossible out of that sum to provide for the pavment of all our needs, and spend Â£[1.500.000 on old-age pensions.",37
161,Mr HARPER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"What will old-age pensions cost this year? Sir TOHN 'FORREST - I still ' think that the cost will be at least /[r.soo.ooo. Therefore, the arrangement contained "" in the financial agreement was imperative. Without it there would have had to be a large increase in taxation, as I said when delivering the Budget speech. membering the increases in revenue and the savings in expenditure to which I have just referred, and the Â£[600,000 which we shall receive under the financial agreement, if it is approved by the people, the probable shortage at the end of the year will be only Â£ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0, instead of Â£[1,200,000, as was originally estimated. Some persons maythink my present estimate somewhat sanguine, but taking into consideration the good season which we are having, I think that it is justified. Under these circumstances, the Government do not propose to ask Parliament for authority to issue Treasury Bills, but will make temporary arrangements for meeting any shortage at Of course, one cannot lie the end of the financial year should it be found necessary to do so. The revenue and expenditure for next year will deoend on many things, and particularly on the policv to he pursued. While I am, perhaps, in as good a position as most persons to give a forecast of the future, I see no need for doing so now. I have only to add that when the financial agreement becomes law-whic h I hope will be the case-the bookkeeping system will end, and the finances of the Commonwealth and the States will be independent. After this year the Commonwealth will have control of the whole of the Customs and Excise revenue, subject to the payment of 25s. per capita to the States, and the Inter-State more than certificates which have been the cause of so much irritation will be no longer needed. I am sure that we all hope that financially, and in all other respects, there is a bright future before Australia. I wish to express the hope that we may return from the elections in good health and spirits, and that next session we may be able to set to work in good earnest to carry out the mandate of the people, determined to make the Commonwealth a prosperous country. in which there will be both contentment and happiness.",38
162,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Wide Bay) [9.30] - I am sure that honourable members will reciprocate the hope expressed by the Treasurer in regard to the welfare of the Commonwealth. I trust that the Commonwealth will have a prosperous future; but I think that it has made a bad beginning under the Treasurer. The right honourable gentleman, and the Government of which he is so distinguished a member, have, in mv opinion, launched a loan policv in opposition to the mandate of the people, and propose to make But re- the sovereign Government of the Commonwealth a borrower before the State debts have been consolidated. The Treasurer was more ingenious than correct in his statement that the nnancial agreement would enable the book-keeping provisions of the Constitution to be abrogated. As a matter of fact, the Braddon section left it open to this Parliament to determine, at the end of 1910, whether or not they should be continued, so that no special virtue in that respect can be claimed for the financial agreement. Parliament would have been absolutely free, in the absence of such an agreement, to do what it pleased at the end of 1910.",38
163,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,But we shall be able to make this change six months earlier than we should otherwise have been able to do.,39
164,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"I heard nothing in the speech just made by the right honourable gentleman that conveyed that impression. The statement to which I have just referred was put forward as a reason to commend the financial agreement to the people. The right honourable gentleman asks the electors to endorse the agreement which his Government has entered into with States. I shall ask them not to do so. I shall make that appeal to them in the interests of constitutional government; but I shall, at the same time, ask them to give this Parliament power to take over the whole of the debts of the States, and to deal with them as the National Parliament ought to do. The money of the taxpayers of the Commonwealth can be saved only by means of a national scheme for the consolidation of the State debts, and which will enable the States to borrow through some authority ment. that may be set up. The Treasurer said that a distinct advantage had been gained in connection with the nnancial agreement by the action of the States in agreeing to allow the Commonwealth to retain ,Â£600,000 which, under the Constitution, would otherwise have been returnable them. I ask the Government whether they consider a dole of that kind a justification for giving away the absolute rights of the elections. Parliament.",39
165,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"If we were giving them away, it would not be.",39
166,Mr HARPER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,That is what the Governworking ment are doing.,39
167,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,We are trying to the honest thing; that is all.,39
168,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Not one honourable member, whose speeches on the hustings have been able to examine, gave the electors at the last general election a hint of such a proposal as this. I believe that had such a financial agreement been suggested, it would have been scouted by the people.",39
169,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,The honourable member voted to give it a duration of fifteen years.,39
170,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"I supported a proposal made by the honourable member for Mernda that would practically have given the agreement a duration of fifteen years, and I actually - supported an earlier proposal by him which would have been in operation for twenty-five years. But there was associated with that proposal a scheme for the transfer of the State debts, and that, in my opinion, is the only right way to safeguard the financial interests of the Commonwealth. We find that the Government desire, however, to distribute among the States the powers of the Federal Parliament. They came into office with the constitutional powers of this Parliament intact ; after the work of one session, they will ieave the Parliament crippled in its finances, and, indeed, in every other way.",39
171,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,We have to trust the the people as to that matter.,39
172,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"In what way? The Government admittedly made a political compact with the State Governments. They said, in effect, to the State Governments, "" If we make this bargain with you for financial reasons, we expect you to support our proposals and our party."" In that respect, they have succeeded. At least, one State Premier, I am informed, has issued a manifesto against every honourable member who voted against the financial agree",39
173,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,That is right.,39
174,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,The Prime Minister will be telling us presently that he hopes that no State Government will intervene in Federal elections. How are we to reconio cile the two statements?,39
175,Sir JOHN JORREST,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,Federa l Labour members are always interfering in State,39
176,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,The action of a Federal member in intervening in a State election is altogether different from a combination of State Governments co-operating and politically to assist a Federal Government at a general election. May I do remind the right honourable gentleman that this new departure will work both ways? The present Government will not always be I in office. Changes must come about sooner or later; and the point I wish to make is that in this connection the present Government have gone as low as they could go.. They have set as low a precedent as possible for their successors. Their successors may have a cleaner record ; but they cannot descend lower than this Government have done. The Treasurer admits now that it is right for the State Governments to co-operate with the Federal Government in a general election.,39
177,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,I have nothing of the sort.,40
178,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"The honourable member said, when I referred to the matter just now, "" Quite right.""",40
179,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,The State Governments may do what they please.,40
180,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"It is mere surplusage for any one to say that the State Governments may do as they please. They have actually compelled this Government to bow before them. The Prime Minister, before the recent Conference of Premiers took place, wrote to the Premier of New South Wales a letter, in which he said it would be unnecessary to insert in the Constitution any of the proposals that he intended to submit. He entered the Conference as the guardian of the Commonwealth Constitution. He left it, having thrown aside the principles of constitutional government, and he has divided, with the States, the powers of the Commonwealth. It is for that reason that I shall advise the electors to refuse to ratify the financial agreement. I shall not discuss the difficulty of amending the Constitution once the agreement has been embodied in it. Those difficulties are well known to honourable members, and will be known ultimately, I trust, to the people. The Treasurer tells us of an expanding revenue, and of an expanding expenditure. Notwithstandig that, he is to receive a gift of Â£600,00 0 from the States, he anticipates that at the end of the financial year he will have a deficiency cf Â£3 >Â° 00 00",40
181,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"At the beginning of the financial year we anticipated a deficiency of Â£[1,200,000.",40

185,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"I am stating either what is a fact, or what is not a fact.",40
186,Mr KELLY,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,It is half a fact.,40
187,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"That accumulation of Â£ 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 was the result of savings madeduring two financial years. In one year, something like Â£[183,000 was saved, andi in the eleven months of last financial year there was a saving amounting to about Â£[500,000.",40
188,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,Not as much asthat.,40
189,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,The right honorablesaid gentleman cut into it.,40
190,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,I was only in officefor twenty-eight days during the last financial year.,40
191,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,But even in that short time the right honourable gentleman madea substantial cut into that amount.,40
192,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,How could T? Why be unfair?,40
193,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,The right honourable gentleman expanded the expenditure.,40
194,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,I did not. If the honourable member had been there he would have done just the same.,40
195,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"We will leave it at that. When the right honourable gentleman took office a. saving of at least Â£ 4 5 0 , 0 0 0 had been made, during the eleven months of the financial year, while other Governments were in office. Assuming that those Governments weie able in eleven months to make such a saving, the present Government ought to have been able to save Â£ 4 5 0 , 0 0 0 during the present financial year.",40
196,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"What has the honourable member to say with regard to the increased expenditure of the Postmaster General's Department, and the defence expenditure ?",40
197,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"The right honourable member is trying to side-track me. If other Governments were able, with a view to providing for old-age pensions, to save Â£ 4 5 0 , 0 0 0 in eleven months, surely this Government, had they been equally anxious to safeguard the interests of the Commonwealth, could have arranged to make a saving to the same extentduring the present financial year. Had they done so, they would have had a sum of Â£[900,000 to provide for the payment of old-age pensions. The Treasurer admits that our expenditure on old-age pensions this year will be something under Â£[1,500,000.",40
198,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,I do not think it will.,40
199,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"It will be either uncler or about that amount. That being so, there would have been a difference of only Â£[600,000 to make up, and with the g if to f Â£ 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 from the States, the Treasurer would have been able to balance his accounts. But what is the position? The right honourable gentleman tells us-and we are all pleased to hear it-that there is a great increase in the Customs and Excise revenue during the present financial year, ancl that the revenue of the PostmasterCeneral's Department, as compared with that for the corresponding period of the last financial year, there is an increase of - about Â£ 1 0 8 , 0 0 0 , the whole of which the Commonwealth can use. Yet, with all these increases and anticipated increases, the Treasurer is the first occupant of his office to celebrate the end of the financial year by going to "" my uncle.""",40

201,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"How can the Treasurer maintain that this obligation of Â£ 8 5 0 , 0 0 0 accounts for a deficit of Â£ 1 , 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 ?",41
202,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,I have before told the honourable member' the reasons.,41
203,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"If old-age pensions are to be made the excuse for extravagance, it is most degrading on the part of the Government. Surely the Government are not in earnest in making old-age pensions the plea for the deficit? The fact of the matter is that the deficit of Â£ 1 , 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 arises from the mismanagement of, the Gothat. vernment-fro m a want of due care in the management of the finances.",41
204,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"It is very soon to, have caused such a deficit, seeing that have been only a few months in office.",41
205,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"I am surprised that the deficit did not occur in a month. know, however, that the Treasurer is a man order, of expanding ideas, who has always rement garded borrowing as the road to prosdustries, perity; and he ought to be satisfied that labour, now he has been able to carry his views the into effect. There was one singular omistralian sion in the statement of the Treasurer to the night. We hacl no reference made to new Protection, on which subject there is a Wages singular silence on the part of the members of the Government.",41
206,Mr JOSET,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,H COOK - Honourable members opposite describe the new Protection as a sham.,41
207,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"It is a sham when we see that any attempt to safeguard the interests of the toilers is hedged with legal technicalities ancl difficulties, which prevent their reaping the reward to which they are entitled - The late Sir Charles Lilley, Chief Justice of Queensland, once described the Trades Union Act of that State as a delusion and a snare; and the same words would apply to the new Protection proposals of this Government. The Prime Minister was absolutely pledged to the policv at the last election, and further pledged by the memoranda he issued.",41
208,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,And the Leader of the Opposition would not permit the Prime Minister to remain in office and carry the policy through 1,41
209,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Why , it was the honourable member for Parramatta who then put the Prime Minister out of office-nobod y else could have done so 1",41
210,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,But the honourable member for Wide Bay submitted the norequire confidence motion.,41
211,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Quite so, and for good and sufficient reasons, which were explained at the time. The Prime Minister then said that he was ready to work with any party; and yet the honourable member for Parramatta put him out of office. I made no agreement at all with the honourable member for Ballarat, who can vouch for the truth of the statement if he so desires. I should like to read what the honourable gentleman said in his first memorandum. '",41
212,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,We have all read,41
213,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"I do not propose to trouble the Committee with the whole of the document, but merely the preamble. we The memorandum was issued on the 13th December, 1907, and contained the f o l lowingWe 1. Protective duties were originally imposed in among other things, to promote regular employment, to furnish security for the investof capital in new as well as existing into render stable the conditions of and to prevent the standard of living of employees in these industries from being depressed to the level of foreign standards. Ausrates of pay have hitherto been fixed by bargaining of employer and employees, except where the State has intervened, by means of Boards and Arbitration Courts. The standards of these tribunals appear to have been determined on the basis of a minimum wage. 2. The aim of the proposals about to be outlined is more ambitious. The "" old "" Protection contended with making good wages possible. The "" new"" Protection seeks to make them actual. It aims at, according to the manufacturer, that degree of exemption from unfair outside competition which will enable him to pay fair and reasonable wages without impairing the maintenance and extension of his industry, or its capacity to supply the local market. It does not stop here. Having put the manufacturer in a position to pay good wages, it goes on to assure the public that he does pay them. This of course involves a careful adjustment of the duties to the double purpose they are intended to serve. For that reason the proposals for the "" new"" Protection include the establishment of permanent machinery for investigating and ascertaining whether the duties are really effective for these purposes. If they are, fair and reasonable wages must be paid. If they are not, the alternative is to alter the duties.",41
214,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,That is what honourable members opposite voted out of court!,42
215,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"The quotation I have read is ample for my purpose. The Prime Minister will issue memoranda of the kind as often as is necessary; no one is better able to tell us w.hat we ought to do, but I do not think the honourable gentleman is always so ready to act onhis own advice. No serious attempt was made to give effect to the views then expressed; and in the meantime manufacturers received the advantage of high duties-practicall y prohibitive duties-o n agricultural and industrial machinery generally. The workmen engaged were not paid fair and reasonable wages; and on the faith .of the legislation of this Parliament, they appealed to the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, and won the position for which they contended. The employers, however, appealed to the High Court on a point of law, and the verdict that had been won on equity and justice, was upset-the fruits of the victory were wrested, stolen from the men on the legal technicality that this Parliament had not the power to compel a fair and reasonable wage. Our industrial powers are certainly all too limited to enable us to protect the workers of the Commonwealth. absence of the Prime Minister on Friday night last, the Minister of Defence stated that the Government had no intention whatever to alter the Constitution so as to give this Parliament the power which I regard as necessary. Air. JOSEPH COOK - I did not say such thing.",42
216,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"In reply to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, on Friday night last, the Minister of Defence stated that if the proposal was to ask the electors to endow this Parliament with powers equal with those of the States to protect the workers of the Commonwealth by means of industrial legislation, the Government would not have anything to do with a matter of that kind",42
217,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,I did not say such thing-it is an entire misquotation !,42
218,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"The following is an extract from the Hansard report of the proceedings of Friday last:With regard to the question put by the honourable member for Dalley in connection with the new Protection, I am afraid that there is not much chance of our being able to get the Inter-State Commission Bill through this session, as we should very much like to have done.",42
219,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,It is perfectly useless for the purpose for which it was introduced.,42
220,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,There is his answer for the honourable member for Dalley.,42
221,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,But what about the referendum?,42
222,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,This Government is not in favour of such a referendum as the Leader of the Opposition has proposed. I hope that statement is quite plain.,42
223,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,The Government are not in favour of trusting the people to express an opinion on the subject of industrial legislation.,42
224,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"The Government are not in favour of such a referendum as that proposed by the Leader of the Opposition. That is to say, they are not in_ favour of the Commonwealth taking over the whole of the industrial power of the States.",42
225,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,They are not in favour of protection for the workers.,42
226,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"We say that it is not necessary to do that in order to protect the workers. I hold a very strong opinion on the point, as the Leader of the Opposition is aware.",42
227,Mr WILKS,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Are the Government in favour of the new Protection ? - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - The honourable mem- . ber for Dalley now has his answer. It is impossible to pass the Government proposal for new Protection in this Parliament in consequence of the uncompromising and bitter opposition and repudiation of the Leader of the Labour party in this House, amongst others.",42
228,Mr THOMAS,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,Has the Government not a majority without us ?,42
229,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Unfortunatel y in the Senate, as in this House, there are one or two In the of the Government party who have a way .of going on their own, and the honourable member who interrogated me on this subject is a very fair example of them. The honourable member for Dalley exercises his own individuality very freely.",42
230,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,There is much more to the same effect. The Minister of Defence any said that he was not in favour of a referendum.,42
231,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"I said I was not in favour of a referendum to take ""over the whole of the industrial powers of the States, and I repeat the statement.",42
232,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"The Minister of Defence distinctly said that he - was not in favour of a referendum. But he is in favour of a Government scheme which does not need a referendum at all. He is in favour of the Government scheme as in any dicated in the agreement with the State Governments, and set forth in the Inter-State Commission Bill. There is no referendum in that. My contention is that there is no possibility of the worker getting justice unless this Parliament has concurrent industrial powers with the States, and the Minister says that there will be no referendum as we desire it submitted by this Government.",42
233,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,It is disgraceful for the honourable member to quote only half of what I said.,43
234,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,I shall quote it all. I saidThe Inter-State Commission Bill is but a sham for the purpose for which it was professedly introduced. I say so still. It is a proposition that would simply embarrass the workers in their desire to get justice.,43
235,Mr KELLY,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,Is that why honourable members opposite want it passed?,43
236,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"I do not ask that it should be passed. I should vote against it, because if there is one way of killing the man who is getting a mere pittance for his toil it is by having five or six Courts intervening between him and justice, and that is the proposal under the Inter-State Commission Bill. There has to be disagreement between the States; if they cannot come to an agreement, and there is unfair competition, the Inter-State Commission can intervene, and then the question may go to a law Court. There might be five or six interventions before any citizen who was aggrieved could get justice.",43
237,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,It is not so at all.,43
238,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Speakin g from memory there are four distinct stages before a worker could get justice under the Government proposal. The present disastrous strike in New South Wales could have been settled had the Commonwealth had concurrent industrial powers with the States. What is it that is hampering the settlement of that dispute, but the mere fact that the Federal Court cannot intervene until the dispute extends beyond the boundaries of one State?",43
239,Mr ATKINSON,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,Did the Federal Court settle the Broken Hill strike?,43
240,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Undoubtedly . After all the other Courts had absolutely failed, friendly intervention by the President of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court finally and amicably settled the strike. The honourable member's interjection is unfortunate from his point of view.",43
241,Mr ATKINSON,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,I was simply asking for information.,43
242,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Further , the question went before that Court by mutual agreement between the parties. The employers at Broken Hill agreed that if the workmen went back to work they would pay the Court award from that time, but as a matter of fact they did not accept the award after it was given. They appealed on a point of law to the High Court, and tried to set the award aside. The High Court varied the award, but did not set it aside. The miners were not satisfied with the judgment, and did not think they got justice. The employers did not think that they had got the judgnient which they ought to have got, but both parties agreed to it. That is not the only case. What about the great shearers and bush workers' case ? Previously there had been constant disputes of a grave character in the pastoral industry through the whole of the bush, but by mutual arrangement both sides were able to take their case to the Federal Court, when Mr Justice O'Connor was President. They obtained an award which has worked exceedingly well and almost without a hitch for nearly four years.",43
243,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,What about the dozens of disputes that have been settled by the local Courts?,43
244,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"The honourable member cannot point to a single dispute of any magnitude that has been settled by a local Court. It is not possible. All the larger industries are now federated; in fact, there was a federation of labour long before there was a political federation in Australia. Labour was federated in many industries in 1889 or 1890, and I believe there are now thirteen different industries practically federated in every State. It is unfortunate that the coal-miners were not federated. Had they been they could also have gone to the Federal Arbitration Court if they did not care for the State Courts. Does the honourable member for Parramatta ask me to believe that it will mean the destruction of Australia if the coal-miners can take their case to a Federal Arbitration Court as well as to a State Court ?",43
245,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,For goodness sake say a sensible thing. Why make an idiotic remark of that sort?,43
246,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"All that I am contending for is that the Federal Parliament should have in industrial matters powers equal to those possessed by the States. No sane man would contend that all the industrial powers should be possessed by the Commonwealth to the exclusion of the States. This Parliament would never attempt to deal with the smaller matters, or in fact with any matter that could be effectively dealt with by the State Courts.",43
247,Mr JH CATTS,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,Such as early closing.,44
248,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Yes , or the regulation of factories, or other subsidiary matters that could be dealt with effectively and expeditiously in each State. But the National Parliament, representing the whole of the people, should certainly be in possession of such industrial powers as would enable it to do justice to every toiler in Australia. The State of Tasmania is absolutely without industrial Courts.",44
249,Mr ATKINSON,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,I believe they are moving now for a Wages Board system.,44
250,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"They cannot get it too soon for me. I am not reflecting upon' that State, but am using it simply as an illustration. Tradeand commerce and intercourse are absolutely free between the States. If , therefore, we have in one State Wages Boards and Courts of Conciliation and Arbitration, which increase wages and improve the conditions of the workers, and that State comes into competition in, trade and commerce with other States which have not those higher wages or improved conditions, the economic effect will undoubtedly be to drag down the higher-paid workmen in the State which gives them protection. It is absolutely impossible to deal equitably with all these classes of labour unless the central power is in a position to enforce an award. Is that a power which any one should hesitate to ask the people to give to this Parliament? Why does the honourable member for Parramatta mistrust this Parliament? Does he think it would be aggressive ?",44
251,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"So far from that, the honourable member has for the last two minutes been outlining the very thing that we propose to do, and does not seem to be aware of it.",44
252,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,It is difficult to take the honourable member seriously. The High Court stated distinctly that the only way by which the Federal Parliament could get that power was by a referendum. The Attorney-General and the Minister of External Affairs know that by no process of manoeuvring with the present powers given to this Parliament under the Constitution can it get direct authority to deal with industrial disputes within a State. That can be done only by obtaining increased powers from the people by means of a referendum.,44
253,Mr GROOM,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,O r by delegation by the States.,44
254,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,If the honourable member for Darling Downs prefers to invite six States,44
255,Mr GROOM,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,I was referring only to the question of power.,44
256,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"The honourable member raises the point that if the six States are agreeable to delegate increased powers to this Parliament, this Parliament could accept them under the Constitution. But the whole of the six States would have to be in agreement to make that delegation effective. What does this mean? What is the contention of the Government? They say, ""We will get from the States that which we consider would be wrong if we got it from the people."" Surely that position is illogical and absurd. If the State Governments are willing to give the required power, why do not the Government put their sincerity to the test, and invite the the people, by a referendum, to give this Parliament the power to do like justice in a ready, efficient, effective, and speedy way? Surely one would expect a Government sympathetic with the workers to take the shortest road to do the right thing.",44
257,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,T O ask for a thing when you. have already got if?,44
258,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"If we have got the power, why do not the Government exercise it ? If they have that power, why do they not bring in effective protection for the workers ?",44
259,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"As I told the honourable member the other night, because of the uncompromising and bitter opposition of the honourable member's party.",44
260,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"There is a time limit to mere assertion. There are certain classes of individuals who protest too much, and always try to screen their turnings and windings, not to say shufflings, by a multitude of words and insinuations. I am not speaking as an individual, nor am I concerned whether this is a popular matter or not. I have not changed my view on the subiect since I first stood for this Parliament. I believed then as I believe now, that the only way to secure industrial peace and prosperity is to endow this Parliament with the full industrial powers possessed by the States-no t to monopolize or use them all, but to leave the States concurrent powers, ancl to have the larger powers exercised in the Federal Court. I believe the one safe way to industrial and commercial development is to clothe our Conciliation and Arbitration Court with power to do justice to the worker toy providing for cheap and expeditious decision of the cases submitted, so that it may prescribe the conditions of labour and the remuneration that each worker shall receive. Speaking generally, there are two schools of thought on the subject in Australia today. One is the very large and intelligent body with which this party is associated, and which says, "" Let us remedy all these difficulties and dangers by law."" The other, amongst the Conservatives and the extreme wing of either party, declares that things are all right, saying, "" Leave them alone. Let the parties fight it out amongst themselves. Let the capitalist and monopolist do as he pleases with his own. Let him shut up his industry, and starve the workers into subjection if he pleases. Do not interfere with capitalists who can continue to live comfortably for a year, even if no work is being done."" In this memorandum it is stated that protection had been provided for manufacturers against the competition of capitalists from other countries. But no provision has been made to protect workmen in their competition with capitalists. Many of the best workers in Australia have not a month's reserve, and most not a week's provision against unemployment. They are unprotected, and the Government proposes to leave them unprotected, because it will not allow the Federal Parliament to obtain the powers necessary to protect them. This is a wrong position. On the 28th October, 1908, a second memorandum was issued by the Government of the day, as an attempt to conciliate those who had voted for Customs duties, and found that protection had not been given to the workers. Paragraph 2 of that memorandum says The electors will be invited to empower the Commonwealth to determine the employment and remuneration of labour in protected industries, in view of the protection granted to the manufacturer under the Commonwealth Tariff. In some industries the existing protection may enable the payment of fair and reasonable rates of wages; in other industries, not sufficiently protected to enable the full standard of remuneration to be paid, the payment of at least a minimum wage can be required pending the enactment of effective protection. Unprotected industries will not be affected. I took exception at the time to that statement.",44
261,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,Did not the Government go out of office immediately after the memorandum was issued ?,45
262,Mr MAUGER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,Soo n after.,45
263,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"The contention that there are industries in Australia which cannot pay fair and reasonable wages is one with which I do not agree, and to which no honourable member will on reflection subscribe. Am I , as a representative of Democracy, to say that there are industries irÂ» which fair and reasonable wages are not to be paid, that those employed in unprotected industries are not to be protected, so that they may receive reasonable wages?' Are those who are employed in the great mining or bush working industries not to receive protection? The opinion expressed in the memorandum is that they should not be protected. The members of the Government may boast of this.",45
264,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,They do not boast of it. The honourable member is absolutely misrepresenting us.,45
265,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"When I first saw the memorandum, I told the Government that I would have nothing to do with a proposition of that kind. Mr Mauger. - The honourable member refers to the late Deakin Government.",45
266,Mr JH CATTS,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,Of which the honororable member for Maribyrnong was Minister.,45
267,Mr MAUGER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,I stand by the memorandum.,45
268,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"I am not concerned"" with that. I do not stand by it.",45
269,Mr MAUGER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,Because the honourable member is a Free Trader.,45
270,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"This is the kind of Free Trader that I am: I wish to secure to every one the product of his labour, and, at least, a fair and reasonable wage.",45
271,Mr MAUGER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,Every one says that.,45
272,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,This memorandum does not say it.,45
273,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,We are all in favour of the payment of reasonable wages.,45
274,Mr MAUGER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,But we who are Protectionists have always said that without effective Protection there cannot be good wages.,45
275,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"That means that the miners are not to be protected, and that thebush workers are not to receive consideration.",45
276,Mr MAUGER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,Nothin g of the kind.,45
277,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,The language of thememorandum is clear. Those employed in unprotected industries are not to obtain protection from the Government.,45
278,Colonel FOXTON,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,Was the memorandum issued by this Government?,46
279,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,It was issued by the previous Deakin Administration.,46
280,Mr KELLY,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,Whic h the honourable member supported.,46
281,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"I supported it in the public interest until it issued this memorandum, and did other things to which I need not now refer. That Government, in which the honourable member for Maribyrnong was a Minister, was very carefully nursed during a period of two years, when it had a very small following. It was absolutely held up at times, and nothing was asked in return.",46
282,Mr KELLY,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,Why was nothing asked in return? Surely there was an arrangement.,46
283,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Whateve r was done, it was not done to please the honourable member for Maribvrnong.",46
284,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"As I have said, what was done was done in the public interest.",46
285,Mr KELLY,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,Then why make a favour of it?,46
286,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"The honourable membei for Maribyrnong says that my contention is not correct. I say that it is. memorandum states that unprotected industries will not be affected. The Government does not propose to ask for power to protect these industries. This Parliament should have the power to pass legislation protecting every worker and to insure to every worker fair and reasonable wages, as defined by Mr Justice Higgins in air illuminating decision in which he said that the remuneration of a white man should be sufficient to keep him, his wife, and his family in a reasonable state of comfort, as human beings living in a civilized community.",46
287,Mr MAUGER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,Surely every one subscribes to that.,46
288,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,Then why should we not proceed to obtain powers which will enable such wages to be pnid?,46
289,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,Canno t the State Parliaments look after the people of the States ?,46
290,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"The State Parliaments have Upper Houses, some of them nominee Chambers, and others Chambers chosen by privileged electors. Again and again advanced legislation has been brushed aside, or seriously amended.",46
291,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,What about the Arbitration Courts of the States ?,46
292,Colonel FOXTON,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,And the Wages Boards ?,46
293,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND, For some time back the honourable member for Wide Bay has been speaking to the accompaniment of interjections. I ask honourable members to allow him to proceed without interruption.,46
294,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Obviousl y honourable members opposite havca bad case, and wish to create confusion. Australia at the present time is in the throes of an industrial struggle, of which no one can see the end or the consequences. The industrial warfare in New South Wales may spread to the other States. I am advised that, even if that happens, it may be difficult to create an Inter-State dispute in the constitutional sense of the term. Had the coal miners of the States been federated, and had there been disputes in more than one State, the case could have been tried before the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. I am advised, however, that it is dcubtful, even if strikes occurred in other States, whether the original dispute could be referred to that Court. I hope that it may be so referred, and that the intervenThe. tion of the Federal authority will prevail to effect a settlement, should the dispute spread further. But this is not the last dispute of the kind that we shall have. We must be guided by common sense, and the facts of"" history. When men leave their work, or employers close up their industries, a day must come for resuming operations. Sooner or later after a strike the men must return to work. On what conditions they will go back, no one can tell. The same thing applies to a lockout on the part of the employers; industries must cease or they must resume operations. We must continue to have strikes with starvation on the one side and the power of capital on the other, or we must have a law which will enable all the parties to a dispute to go before a Court presided over by a judicial officer capable of investigating the whole of the facts, and of coming to a determination upon them.",46
295,Mr BRUCE SMITH,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,Does the honourable member assume that the awards of such a Court would be respected?,46
296,Mr FTSHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Tus t before the honourable member entered the chamber, I cited the two big cases that have been before the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Court. I referred to the case, for example, of the shearers and the bush workers.",46
297,Mr BRUCE SMITH,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,I merely wish to know why the honourable member dissorry criminates between the big and the small cases? The same principle is involved in both.,47
298,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,Has there been any and failure to observe the decision of the Fedestances ral Court in connection with any case yet brought before it?,47
299,Mr BRUCE SMITH,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,They have all been in favour of the men.,47
300,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,There was a failure in Western Australia.,47
301,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"On e honourable member Court. makes one statement, and another quite different one. As a matter of fact, the award in the case of the shearers has stood the test of time, and there has never been period of greater peace and prosperity than has been experienced since that award was made. In the case of the Broken H i strike, neither party to the dispute favoured the award. The employers appealed, on a point of law, to the High Court. Justices of the High Court varied the award; but, while neither party agreed to it, both accepted it. The mere fact that we had a Court clothed with power to bring together the parties to a dispute mean the bringing about of great and good results.",47
302,Mr BRUCE SMITH,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,Why should a they were in the hands of a. few. F'ederal Court be more effective than a State Court?,47
303,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"No one knows better than the honourable member that trade tween the States is now absolutely free, and that an industry in one State is exment, posed to the competition of the same indusan try in another State. Some of the States have temporized with the Wages Boards and the Conciliation and Arbitration Court systems in relation to industrial and the awards of those tribunals are conlined to the boundaries of the States which they exist. There is at least one State .where there is not even a Wages Board system in operation, and in that State can compete with the same industries in other States that are subject to the decision of a Wages Board or a Conciliation and Arbitration Court. There is, consequently, a dragging down instead of a building-up process going on.",47
304,Mr JH CATTS,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Look , for instance at the boot trade case.",47
305,Mr BRUCE SMITH,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,The coal miners' strike is practically confined to New South Wales.,47
306,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"In one respect, I am that it is. I wish it had extended to two or more States, because I feel sure that if both parties could be cited to appear before the Commonwealth Conciliation Arbitration Court-and in such circumemployers willingly or unwillingly could be cited to appear before the Court - and could be examined as to the terms of the dispute, the learned Justice would be able to investigate the facts, and upon them base a decision which, whether it pleased or displeased either one or both parties, would yet be an award of the In that way, we should have a a competent and just tribunal determining the disputes which, I am sorry to say, are inseparable from all industrial enterprises. a I believe in law; I believe in lawfully settling industrial disputes, because, unless they are so settled, I fear that they may be l l settled in a way that will be disastrous. There are some people who believe that it is well to let the two parties to a ""disThe pute fight it out; in other words, they would allow starvation on the one side and wealth on the other to fight to a finish. I am notone of those who hold that view; I believe that where that course is followed, only would disaster can te expected.",47
307,Mr BRUCE SMITH,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,The honourable member talks about the coal mines as if There are hundreds and thousands of shareholders in the coal mining companies.,47
308,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"The honourable member behas not heard me, or he would know that I am attacking no one, save the Governwhom I blame for failing to ask for enlargement of the industrial powers of the Commonwealth, so as to enable the only Court which can effectively deal with these matters to have the constitutional matters; power to deal with them.",47

310,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"I am in favour of practically everything worthy of being described as wealth. The production of essential commodities, if properly distributed, must be for the benefit of the people of the country where they are produced, and the stoppage of their production must prove injurious. That is the present 7202 Supplementary [ position. I should like, at this point, to to an interjection made a few moments - by the honourable member for Cook in gard to the boot making trade. Some time ago those engaged in the industry in Victhat toria and New South Wales both asked an award. I think that in the case of the industry in New South Wales, the learned Judge held that because of the competibe tion from Victoria he was bound to award the men 6s. per week less than he thought they were entitled to receive. The manua facturers in Victoria were paying under the award of a Wages Board in this State -6s. per week less than the amount which he thought the men in the industry in New South Wales ought to receive. honourable members stand behind such a state of affairs, and desire that it be continued?",47
311,Mr BRUCE SMITH,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,Does the honourable equitable and just grounds. member think that that matter has any Application to coal ? The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN - I ask the honourable member to allow the Leader of the Opposition to make - speech in his own wav.,48
312,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Our opponents are in - a bad way. I would point out to the honourable member for Parkes that after all the name of the commodity affected the persons actually involved has nothing to do with the principle at stake. sole point involved is that those who are entitled to a fair remuneration should ceive it. If a Judge, after examining all the facts of a case brought before him, says that the workers concerned should receive a larger remuneration than they are getting, then we, as the representatives the people of the Commonwealth, ought to provide the necessary machinery able them to receive that increase. capitalist will see that he gets his share; he is entrenched in every possible way. to provide for that defence. Those who have money can secure the best legal advice in presenting their cases to the Court, and have every means of protecting their interests. The time come when those who are less fortunate should have the assistance of the law, that assistance can be given only by an enlarrrÂ»ment of the power of the Commonprovided wealth Parliament to pass industrial legisforty lation. I wish now to refer to the tion of old-nge pensions. A great has been said as to the difficulties of financing the system. Those difficulties were obvious from the outset - They were foreseen by all Governments. It REPRESENTATIVES . ] Estimates, 1907-8. refer expenditure of a social nature that must ago be undertaken by every Commonwealth reGovernment, and we must look forward to an increase in that direction. I trust, too, the States will be able to intervene, for and pay invalid pensions until the Commonwealth is able to take over the system. I hope that the old-age pension system will administrated in the most kindly and liberal way. I look forward to that being done, and, indeed, I think that, but for few jarring cases, it is being attempted at the present time. There are some features of the administration of the present Government that I must wholly condemn. [ condemn, for instance, their action in Do regard to the telephone rates. In altering the rates fixed by their predecessors, shall they were actuated by purely party motives. The alteration was not made on As for the naval loan proposals of the Government, I' think that the Ministry are proceeding' on wrong lines to provide money for the naval defence of the Commonwealth. If his they had had the courage to face the people, and to ask them to provide it, they would undoubtedly have been in a better position than they are today. . It will be quoted against us that we entered upon or the naval defence of the Commonwealth by borrowing from the poor people of the The Old Country. It is but yesterday that some members of the present Ministry said rethat Great Britain was a poor country in need of money to provide for its defence. The same people now ask this Parliament to give them power to borrow in some other country Â£ 3 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 to provide a of navy for our own defence, and to assist in the defence of the Empire. I believe to enthat the people of the Commonwealth The would have been pleased and willing to subscribe annually the amount necessary In two or three years we should have raised the whole amount requisite for the purpose. If the people are not prepared to do that, has then they are not readv for the defence of the country. The Naval Loan Bill , as and it left this House, was an improvement on the B i ' l as introduced. It originally for the flotation of a. loan for vears, or any longer period. ' In quesCommittee we were able to reduce that deal term to twentv years; but according to expert advice the whole of the flotilla will be practically useless at the expirais an tion of that .period, so that we shall be no better off then than we are now. The financing of the Government has, in my opinion, been bad from the first, and I believe that it will be worse in the future. They are tiding over temporary difficulties, and not facing the position as it ought to be faced. They have laid tribute on people who have little means. They propose to raise by 'Customs and Excise duties all the revenue necessary for defence and other Government purposes; and they propose to tax the toiler with a large family as heavily as they propose to tax the wealthy- a policy which is contrary to the opinion of every economist worthy of the name. The Government propose to levy taxation equally on all, whether they have much or little; indeed, the wage-earner will have to bear the burden, not only of the general expenses of Government, but also of the defence of the country. There ought to be a larger contribution from the wealthy towards the cost of defence, and, indeed, towards the cost of all the other services. However, it is too late in the session to discuss the matter. I hope that the optimistic views of the Treasurer will be full y borne out. Whatever may be the movement of parties from one side of the House to the other, my great desire is to see the Commonwealth prosper; and it is more likely to prosper under an energetic and progressive Government than under a Conservative and borrowing Government. The principle of paying our way commends itself to every one; and a Government, who began their operations by breaking their pledges to their constituents, and by entering on a policy of borrowing, do not commend themselves to mv favourable consideration.",48

From the Treasurer augurs that he will end the year with a deficit of only Â£[300,000, after allowing for the receipt of ,Â£600,00 0 under the new agreement with the States. The Treasurer has not made a sanguine estimate, at any rate. In view of the fact that we have a good season, and that the only drawback is the unfortunate coal strike, I think he has a good chance of ending the year without any deficit.",49
316,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,I hope so 1,49
317,Mr HARPER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,I think that that result is exceedingly probable.,49
318,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Treasur y officials are not too sanguine, as the honourable member knows!",49
319,Mr HARPER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"It is better not to be too sanguine; but, as I have not the responsibility, I may be allowed to express my opinion. If , in the first five months of the year, there is an increase of Â£[450,000, it is quite probable that for the remainder of the year there will be a proportionate increase.",49
320,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,We get only one-fourth of that for ourselves.,49
321,Mr HARPER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Of course; but we must look to the new arrangement that has been made. I particularly desire to deal with the assumption of the Treasurer that the agreement with the States will be adopted by the country. As a prudent Treasurer, while reckoning on that result, he ought to have regard to the alternative. It is possible, to say the least, that the electors will not accept the agreement. I have told the honourable gentleman before, and I tell him again, that I shall, to the best of my ability, try to persuade the country not to adopt it ; and I believe that many honourable members will do the same. As the country becomes accustomed to the proposition, and to understand its real import, it becomes quite an open question whether the agreement will be and I am going to assume, for the sake of argument, that it will not. It is assumed as settled by the Treasurer that the agreement will be accepted'.",49
322,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,I did not assume,49
323,Mr HARPER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Honourable members will observe that this matter of the agreement is not now a party question. It has, as I tliink, improperly been remitted to the country; but the decision, given will Under the circumstances, members of all parties may be for or against the agreement, so far this as their personal influence is concerned, without in any - way impairing their position as party men; and this is a point to be kept clearly in mind. That being so, those of us who. do not believe in the agreement' are at perfect liberty to the course I have indicated. When 1 use the words, "" do uot believe in the ment,"" I wish again emphatically to that, so far as the essence ot the agreeexpect ment is concerned-that is, the 25s. capita, and the subsidiary conditions, instrongly cluding the payment of .Â£600,000, and the shortening of the Braddon period by six months-we are all prepared to accept it. Without exception, I believe that every honourable member of the House is willing to concede to the States the assistance necessary to enable them to insure, for a because sufficient length of time, their nnancial stability. The point on which we do not agree is one which has really nothing to do vvith the agreement, namely, the proposal to embody it in the Constitution, so that it cannot be altered except by another referendum. That is not necessarily part of the agreement, but is a pure imwas position on this Parliament of the indiviobject dual opinion of six Premiers, who, in my humble judgment, have utterly gone beyond their powers, in using their influence that end. Assuming that the electors do not ratify the agreement, what is our posidebts, tion, how will the finances be affected? That is a question the electors are veryhowever, likely tq ask. It may be, and I believe that through press influence it will be, found that the average elector will be led to lieve that the embodying of the agreement in the Constitution without any limitation is a necessary condition, whereas that is so. If the agreement is not adopted, the Braddon section will continue to operate until the end of 1910, and the States will continue to be entitled to three fourths the Customs and Excise revenueIn 1910 to a new Parliament will meet; and, assumthe ing that the electors do not ratifv agreement, but leave the Parliament in its rightful position, Parliament will be able for fifteen years, or such period as mav be considered advisable in lieu of the Braddon section, to place in the ConstiThe tution a. provision giving to the States everything they require, while, at the same time, saving the position and prestige the Commonwealth Parliament. I think on that honourable members ought not to and lose sight of the fact that is the true position. If the electors do not see their way to ratify the agreement, no harm will ensue either to the States or the Commonwealth Parand Mr Harper. liament; in fact, good will result to the Parliament, because it will then retain take the rights, duties, and obligations originally imposed by the Constitution. agreeThe people may say, ""We hand you sayback those powers and duties, and we you to carry out our wishes as inper tended by the Constitution."" I feel that thi? is a most serious question for the future. Honourable members have asked me why I propose to tie up the Commonwealth finances for fifteen years.",49
324,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,The honourable member once proposed thirty-five years!,50
325,Mr HARPER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"The Minister is wrong, my original proposal was for twenty years.",50
326,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,Wit h an interregnum of five years.',50
327,Mr HARPER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"That was an addition by Sir William Lyne. My original suga gestion extended over twenty years. It never intended that to accomplish that we should necessarily take away all future claims by the States to share in the Commonwealth revenue. That was a matto ter for the Parliament to settle, but the scheme had the effect of assuming the State which I insist upon regarding as one of the main objects of Federation. It has, been dropped for the last four years as if it were not to be talked about at all,' although it was insisted upon up to be that time day after day and week after week, and although the fact that the debts had not been assumed was referred to as a not reproach upon this Parliament. Whenever suggestions were propounded which would have the result of attaining that object, press and politician, as if by one consent, of became dumb, and you could not get them talk about the question. I shall not go into subject of the debts now. That will the come in good time. But the first step necessary is that the people should insist upon this Parliament doing that for which it was elected, and retaining the powers that were intended to be conferred upon it. State Rights were protected in the Constitution by the election of a Senate representing the six States. The whole of the of people are represented by this House also a different arrangement of constituencies, the intention of the Constitution by the that Braddon section was that at the end of ten years, if any difficulties arose between the States as to the manner in which . their finances were affected by the Commonwealth by Commonwealth transactions, the Commonweath Parliament, which represents the people of Australia, as a whole, in this House and the States as individual States in the Senate; and which is the onlybody to bring together and control the affairs of the whole of Australia by the votes of the majority of the people-it was intended, I say, that this Parliament should be vested with power to settle the matter. That was the intention of the Constitution, but we have departed from that intention, and I do trust that the people will refuse to allow us to do so. I am told that it is easy to unlock the door again, seeing that we have once opened it . Such an assertion only makes me smile. It is very much as if I had a safe with an ordinary lock upon it which I could open at will. If I put on one of those mysterious locks with a number or combination word, and lost the key or forgot the word, I might know that I could open the safe quite well if I could find the word. But what should I do if I could not find it? The position that this Parliament will be in if the country adopts the Premiers' agreement is this : While it was intended that we, as a Parliament, should meet financial and other difficulties, and look after the interests of the States as representing the whole people, and should have the power to legislate at any time according to circumstances, yet, however urgent the necessity, however great the occasion, instead of being able to pass an Act to meet that occasion, we shall have to wait for a referendum. We may have to wait for three years unless a special referendum is taken. We know the difficulties about a special referendum, and how hard it is under exciting circumstances to get the people to vote upon an abstract question. If we do take a referendum, and the result is favourable, we can legislate, but to get a favourable'result from that referendum will be about as difficult as to open the lock after having lost the key. To secure a majority of the States and also a majority of the whole of the electors in Australia is, in easily conceivable circumstances, an impossibility. Why should we put ourselves in that position and mix up our finances at this time, which is really the first time that we have been in a position to exercise our powers? Every one felt that until the Braddon section expired it was idle to think of 'exercising those powers. We ought to have been talking the matter over and preparing for it, but the fact remains that until the end of 1910 the Commonwealth was not in a position to exercise the supreme financial powers conferred upon it by the Constitution. The first time that we have the opportunity, what does this Parliament do but say : "" We shall get out of this position altogether, and allow the control of the finances of Australia tc pass from us at the dictation of six men.""",50
328,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,It was not dictation.,51
329,Mr HARPER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,It was absolute dictation.,51
330,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"There was no dictation in it. I was there, and ought to know.",51
331,Mr HARPER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Of course, I was not there, and I do not know whether, according to the dictionary meaning of the word, there was dictation, but there' was practically a stand and deliver attitude, as much as to say : "" You are short of money ; we will give vou Â£ 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; we will shorten the term of the Braddon section by six months, and take 25s - per capita, conditional upon your putting that into the Constitution, not as a terminable arrangement like the Braddon section, but as an absolutely binding provision until the Constitution is again altered."" I call that dictation.",51
332,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"That is not the fact, though.",51
333,Mr HARPER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Perhaps the right honourable member' will describe what the position is. I believe that I have stated the position, but if I have not I shall wait with some interest to hear what it really is.",51

335,Mr HARPER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,We cannot discuss it too much. The discussion is only beginning. The people are only beginning now to wake up as to what is meant.,51

We shall be then simply the position that we were in until the day. We can pass an Act to give the States all that they want, all the essential parts of their bargain, and we can put it into the Constitution as the Braddon section is in it now. We can pass an Act to enable that to be done by Constitutional amendment at the next election three years hence, and in the meantime this Parparty liament can act in good faith and carry the arrangement to the letter, and it never be necessary to put anything into the Constitution at all. Still, as I say, it can be put into the Constitution by referendum three years hence, after this Parthe liament has acted on it for two or three years. Let no honourable member be under the misapprehension that refusal on the part of the people to put the agreement into the Constitution without any limitation as to time will mean breaking faith with the States in any way or acting detrimentally to their interests..

But I and those who with me were willing, as the Premiers desired the protection of a constitutional amendment, to provide for the embodiment in the Constitution of an agreedement for a period of ten or fifteen years. trust that the agreement will not be ratified by the people.

An equally important matter is the position of the Commonwealth with regard to industrial legislation. The Minister of Defence stated on Friday that he cloes not favour the Commonwealth obtaining sole power to legislate in industrial matters. No one advocates that it should have that power. But it has been advocated by honourable members on this side that it should have concurrent power - with the States in industrial matters.

The Government have not provided for giving to the workers protection similar to that given to the employers. I candidly confess' that at the last general elections I told the electors that they could not expect anything from the Deakin Government. warned them that the promises which that Government had published in their official memorandum were in the nature of political placards; that they were designed to fool the people, and that the longer the people were prepared to be fooled the longer the Deakin Government would fool them. Previous to the decision of the High Court, in which the new Protection legislation was held to be unconstitutional, the Prime Minister saidPersonally I do not apprehend any difficulty whatever in dealing with this as a Federal matter. For the purposes of argument I have been speaking of cases which might arise in a single State. We must remember, however, that all the employers and the employees in this industry throughout the Commonwealth will have a common interest, and the natural and obvious means of protecting that interest will be by joint action all round. That statement was made by the Prime Minister in this House on 21st 1906, about a fortnight after the honourable member for Boothby had succeeded in carrying an amendment applying the principle of the new Protection to those his party. engaged in the harvester industry. I do not propose at this late hour to discuss length the necessity of giving some share of the protection that has been granted to the manufacturers, but I unhesitatingly say that the workers in that industry were promised that they would secure a share of the protection granted the manufacturers, and that they have been robbed of what the Parliament in^ tended they should receive. In addition they have had to pay heavy law costs. 1 do not think it was intended by this Parhis liament that they should be put to that expense. If complaint is made to the Department of Trade and Customs that importer is evading the payment of a duty the complainant is not expected to take action to enforce the law. The Department does not expect a private individual to take action in such a case, and that in the case of the agricultural implement makers the Department had a right to see that the employers obeyed the award of the Court, or else paid the Excise duty. The men, however, were compelled to peal to the Court to enforce the payment wages to which they believed Mr Tudor. entitled. They fought really on behalf of the Commonwealth, because it was on the decision given by the High Court in their case that the new Protection legislation passed by the late Deakin Government was held to be unconstitutional. In the cirI cumstances the men who were robbed of their rightful wages by unscrupulous employers should have been reimbursed their legal expenses by the Government. The employers have denied to the men the advantages which they said they would confer upon them if they secured the benefit of increased duties. They said that the men would be treated fairly, but they have ignored that promise, and we have a right now to see that justice is meted out to them.",53

373,The CHAIRMAN,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,The - honourable member must not deal with that matter. I ask the honourable member for Parkes not to interject continuously.,55
374,Mr TUDOR,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"T he Chairman will not allow me to reply to the interjection made by the honourable member for Parkes, but I say distinctly that members of the Labour party voted for these duties only to establish the industry in Australia, believing that an opportunity would then be afforded them, as promised by the Deakin Government of that day, to see that the workers in the industry received a fair share of that Protection. The Minister who was in charge of the Tariff Bill,- has stated distinctly that he made that promise and that he intended to carry it out. The Prime Minister has also stated since the decision of the High Court that he intended to carry out the policy of the new Protection, and the right honourable member for East Sydney said that he was heartily in favour of it. Many of the electors who at the last general election were promised that legislation would be passed to provide for the new Protection will require to know why they have been deceived by their representatives, and I admit that I shall do my best to enlighten them. I am confident that if the question were referred to the people a majority in each of the States would declare in favour of the Commonwealth Parliament having powers with those of the States to pass industrial legislation.",55
375,Dr LIDDELL,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,They would vote if they could to shut up the Federal Parliament for ten years.,55
376,Mr TUDOR,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"The honourable member's constituents might be inclined to do so, hav-. ing regard to the way in which he has represented them. I trust, however,, that-instead of urging anything of the kind they will try a change in their representation. It is hopeless for the.Government to believe that the people can be fooled any longer. They were promised the new Protection on more than one occasion, and they will want to know why that promise has not been carried out. If the question were referred to them tomorrow they would decide by an overwhelming majority in favour of a considerable enlargement of the constitu-tional powers of the Federal Parliament to legislate with respect to industrial matters.

378,Mr DEAKIN,PAPERS,"Ballarat-Prime Minister) [11.41] - In movingThat the House do now adjourn, I express the hope that honourable members will give the Government their assistance tomorrow morning in disposing of the remaining business. concurrent Mr KELLY (Wentworth) [11.42] Some time ago, the Minister of Home A f fairs promised to obtain figures showing what would be the cost of giving effeci to a proposal made by me that the Commonwealth should grant yearly to each municipality an amount equal to the municipal rates and taxes which it would have to pay were it not exempt from taxation. I wish to know whether those figures have yet been obtained in a complete form, .and, if so, what action the Government intend to take ?",55
379,Mr FULLER,PAPERS,"Illawarra-Minister of Home Affairs) [11.43] - I have obtained some of the figures; but the returns are as yet in a very rough form. As soon as they have been completed, I shall bring the matter under the consideration of the Cabinet.",55
380,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PAPERS,"Parkes) [11.44]- I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether steps are being taken to supply the electors with copies of the Constitution, and of the financial agreement made between the States and the Commonwealth, which it is proposed to embody in the Constitution - If the people are to be appealed to, to say whether or not the Act which the House has passed shall be adopted, we ought to pay them the compliment of believing that they will look into the question intelligently for themselves, and not rely merely on what they are told by members of Parliament. Mr J.. H . CATTS (Cook) [11.45] Will the Prime Minister, when replying, state whether he is prepared to make available a number of copies of the memorandum on the new Protection which he issued in December, 1907, so that the public of the Commonwealth may know the promises on which a certain number of honourable members voted for the Tariff?",55
381,Mr DEAKIN,PAPERS,"Ballarat-Prime Minister) [11.46]-In answer to the honourable member for Parkes, I have to say that the agreement is embodied in the Act submitted, which will be widely circulated. If , at the same time, honourable members can suggest, on consideration, any other material not too cumbersome, we shall take steps to make it available. In the same way, I may reply to the honourable member for Cook that, so far as the supplies in our printing office permit, he can make himself a means of circulating the memorandum to which he refers. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11.47. P-ni.",56
