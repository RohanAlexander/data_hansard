JOHNSON - Is it the intention of the Minister of Home Affairs to invite the architects of Australia to submit designs for the Commonwealth parliamentary buildings to be erected on the Capital site, or will he rely on the professional officers of his Department? Mr KING O'MALLEY - The Department possesses officers of eminent talent, but I hope that the designing of the Commonwealth Parliament House will be thrown open to the competition of the architects of the world. TELEPHONISTS.",14

2,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Â°-I shall ask the Postmaster-General to reply to the question on his return from Sydney. SUGAR INDUSTRY.,15
3,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I have received from Mr George Barber, the representative of the Bundaberg constituency in the Queenssideration land Parliament, a telegram stating that large majority of the small growers favour equalization, and asking that they be sacrificed by the abolition of the bounty and Excise, which would place them at wealth ? the mercy of the sugar millers. Will the Prime Minister ascertain what is the opinion of the sugar-growers of QueensGovernor land ancl New South Wales on this subknows ject?",15
4,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"If the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court had power to determine, when the matter was brought before them, the relative value the work done by each set of persons engaged in the production of sugar, no diffiand cheapest. culty could arise. I have stated publicly .again and again that the remedy for the present state of affairs is to give the Commonwealth Court power to determine the relative value of the work done by each section of the sugar industry and the turn that should be received for it.",15
5,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"What is to be the policy of the Government in the matter, as trivial. pending the vesting of this power in the Commonwealth Court ?",15
6,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Our policy will be, as it has always been, tp protect the sugar producers to the best of our ability, and enable the industry to prosper. OLD-AGE PENSIONS,",15
7,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Has the Prime MinGOVERNMENT HOUSE, SYDNEY. ister taken into consideration in connection with the introduction of an amending Age Pensions Bill, and, if not, will he - so, the advisability of paying to hospitals of which old-age pensioners are inmates, the amount of their pensions during the time of their being there?",15
8,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"That question has been raised repeatedly since old-age were first proposed. It is considered by the Government that the State hospitals other similar institutions may well conshare the burden of supporting the COMMONWEALTH BANK. SYDNEY OFFICE. Mr W. J. JOHNSON - Is it a fact that the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank has recommended the resumption of certain property in Sydney as a site for _ a branch of the Commonwealth Bank? If ' so, will the Prime Minister take into conthe advisability of declining to a. act on the recommendation, and of resuming the whole of the General Post Office not block, as in that way a more profitable bargain can be made by the Common",15
9,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wit h all clue respect to real the honourable member, I think that the of the Commonwealth Bank best what site to choose for a particular building. The Government approves of the resumption of the site recommended for banking chambers. Mr W. J. JOHNSON - It is the dearest of and worse site in Sydney for the purpose.",15
10,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I think it is the best REFERENDUM.  correctlv reported in today's Argus as having stated, when asked whether the rereferendum would be purely a party issue, "" without hesitation, ' yes ' "" ?",15
11,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I regard the question PAPUA: FRANCHISE.,15
12,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,Does the Govern- ment intend to consider the question of givto ing the white adult resident population of Papua the franchise?,15
13,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Yes .,15
14,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Is it a fact that when OldLord Denman was appointed Governordo General of Australia it was understood that he would have the use, during his term of office, of Government House, Melbourne, and Government House, Sydney ? If that be so, will the Prime Minister use every endeavour to see that effect is given pensions to the understanding?",15
15,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"It is correct that when Lord Denman accepted the high office that he holds it was understood that both Government House, Melbourne, and Government House, Sydney, would be available as residences for him and Lady Denman. The position was put before the State Government when the controversy arose respecting Government House, Sydney, and was repeatedly urged as a reason that should weigh with them, but without avail. The conflict is not one of money, but one of principle, and the Federal Government feel that they are not called upon to pay interest or rent under the circumstances I have detailed.",16
16,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"In view of the legal contention which has been put forward, and which, I take it, the Prime Minister has seen, to the effect that, at the time the Constitution was granted to New South Wales, power was given to the State Government to deal with waste lands only, will he instruct the Attorney-General to inquire into the legal position, and see whether the New South Wales Government have authority to act in the way in which they are acting?",16
17,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The Attorney-General is now looking into the matter, and has been, I think, for some time.",16
18,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"In view of the anxiety of the people of New South Wales to have the Governor General residing in that State, will the Prime Minister consider the question of resuming Yarralumla House in the Federal Territory, so that His Excellency may be domiciled there ? Mr KIN G O'MALLEY - We have that house now.",16
19,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,What is it used for?,16
20,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I feel sure His Excellency would, in the meantime, feel glad of a little quietude in regard to his domestic affairs. - Mr FULLER - It is reported in the Argus this morning that in the speech attributed to the Governor General, His Excellency said yesterday in Sydney I was advised by the right authorities land, and by my Ministers in Melbourne, to come here and try to effect an amicable settlement of the matter. I have endeavoured to do so. If that be a correct report, I should like to ask the Prime Minister whether he is' prepared to hand over his duties to the Governor General and allow His Excellency to interfere in that way in a matter which is essentially one for the Prime Minister and his Government?",16
21,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"That is the first discordant note we have had on the subject, and there is no need whatever for it. TheGovernor-General, I think, showed great courtesy, great patience, and great consideration during his residence in New South Wales, and in the manner in which he carried out his duties; and all His Excellency has done, the Government take the full responsibility for. Later:",16
22,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I desire to disabuse the Prime Minister's mind of any idea that I have introduced a discordant note; it was the construction which the right honourable gentleman placed on my question that might lead any one to think such a note had been sounded. I am concerned only with the action of the Prime Minister and the members of the Government-no t with the action of the Governor General. In view of the reported statement by the Governor General, that he was advised by his Ministers to go to Sydney, and to try to effect an amicable settlement, and that he hacl endeavoured to do so in vain, I desire to ask the Prime Minister1. What were the terms on which the Governor General was advised by his Ministers to go to Sydney and try to effect an amicable settlement of the matter? 2. In view of the statement that he agreed to give up the greater part of house and grounds, was that power given him by this Government, or by the Imperial authorities? 3. Whether the failure to make an amicable settlement was owing to the New South Wales. Government requiring the house and the whole of the grounds? 4. l f this was not the cause of failure, what was the cause? 5. Does he not think that it is the duty of the Government to deal with a matter of this sort without putting the Governor General to the indignity of pleading with disloyal State Ministers for a place to reside in when visiting Sydney ?",16
23,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The honourable member has read out a somewhat lengthy question of a technical character, but I think I may as well answer it, ancl get it out of the way. In answer to the first question, I in Engmay say that the Government are responsible for any actions of the Governor General. The facts as set out in the reported words are not admitted. As regards the second question, the Government agreed to accept terms for Government House. Sydney, with a lesser area of land. Every one knows that, for the fact has been made public.",16
24,Mr FULLER,Unknown,What was the cause of the failure of the arrangements?,17
25,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The cause of the failure must be obvious. The Commonwealth Government declined to pay rent or interest on the value of the property. They did not propose to alter the conditions. If the State Government desired to alter the conditions during the term of His Excellency's residence the Commonwealth Government saw no necessity, and, indeed, thought it would be a wrong policy, either to pay interest on the capital value or to pay rent during the period of His Excellency's residence in Sydney. As to the loyalty or disloyalty of State Ministers that is a matter which does not affect the Commonwealth Government. We shall see that the Governor General will be properly housed in every State alike, when he is not at the Seat of Government.",17
26,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Following on the question put by the honourable member for Illawarra, I should like to ask the Prime Minister, without notice, if he does not think that the State Government of New South Wales were considering the health of the Governor General and his family when they told him, in effect, to live in Melbourne instead of in Sydney?",17
27,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I do not know whether the State Government considered that aspect of the matter, but their benevolence is well known throughout Australia.",17
28,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"I should like to ask the Prime Minister, without notice, whether the Government have considered the advisability of resuming Government House, Sydney, for public purposes?",17
29,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"That is a matter of policy. The right to resume undoubtedlyrests with us, but I have already stated the policy of the Government in this matter.",17
30,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"Referring to the same question, I should like to ask the Prime Minister: Should the Governor General desire in future to visit New South Wales, will the Federal Government see that he is accommodated in the same way as when he visits other States of the Commonwealth in the same capacity?",17
31,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"In this matter we can guarantee nothing beyond the fact that we shall see that the Governor General, as the chief representative in the Commonwealth of Australia of His Majesty the King, is accommodated in a manner befitting the high office he holds. MOISTURE IN BUTTER. Mr W. J. JOHNSON - Does the Minister of Trade and Customs intend to take any steps to meet the wishes of the people engaged in the butter industry by increasing the percentage of moisture in butter beyond that laid down by the regulations?",17
32,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The matter is under consideration at the present time. PRIVILEGE NOTICES OF MOTION.,17
33,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Capricornia) [3.15] - I move That the action of Mr Speaker on ist October, 1912, in endeavouring to prevent a member of this House from reading a notice of motion, and in refusing to accept such motion, on the ground that it was frivolous, is a breach of the powers, privileges, and immunities of the members of the House of Representatives.",17
34,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Do I understand the honourable member to be referring to some motion that I have already dealt with?,17
35,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"My motion is as stated, Mr Speaker.",17
36,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have to point out to the honourable member that I cannot accept that motion. Standing order 287 is as followsI f any objection is taken to theruling or decision of the Speaker, such objection must be taken at once, and in writing, and motion made, which, if seconded, shall be proposed to the House, and debate thereon forthwith adjourned to the next sitting day. There was no notice taken of my action on the previous occasion, and, under such circumstances, I cannot accept the motion.",17
37,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I submit, as a point of order, that a question of a breach of the privileges of the House supersedes a mere question of order.",17
38,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"On a question of privilege the honourable member would be perfectly in order, but he will see that nothing has arisen since the date named by him to create a breach of privilege. Under such circumstances, he cannot move the motion.",17
39,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Capricornia) [3.16] - Ac cepting your ruling for the present, I beg to give notice that tomorrow I shall move That an address be presented to His Excellency the Governor General, informing him that the Fusion known as His Majesty's Opposition merits the censure of the House and the country",17
40,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member is now trying to evade my ruling, and tie must not do so. The honourable memoer knows that I have ruled that notice cf motion out of order, and he is now pertion, sistently defying my ruling.",17
41,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Do you still rule, sir, that I am out of order in giving the notice motion ?",18

47,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,It does not need to be seconded.,18
48,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable memknow ber must not attempt to direct me in duties. The motion does require conder.,18
49,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"With great respect, I would point out that the motion has not yet been written. I should like to know from you sir, whether, as you have ruled that I cannot read this notice of motion may not raise the question of privilege now.",18
50,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I point out to the honourable member on the question of pricause vilege that an honourable member is at liberty to raise a question of privilege anything affecting the business of the House or honourable members personally, and may conclude with a motion dealing with the matter on which the question is raised. The honourable member will see that when I ruled him out of order the other day he was trying to deal with someany thing which he could not properly deal with at that time. I may inform the House that the honourable member good enough to write a letter to me saying that he proposed to take this action. With that the consent of the House I should much prefer that the honourable member, instead and of dealing with the matter tomorrow, House should deal with it at once. If he is prepared to go on with it now I am ready the and willing that he should do so in order that the matter may be done with. Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear.",18
51,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Acceptin g your suggessir, I shall deal with the matter at once. I may say that I spent a good deal of time considering this question. I of endeavoured to frame my motion in a form which should be as unobjectionable as pos",18
52,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"What is the honourable member now dealing with, the question of or the ruling with respect to his",18
53,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"The question of priviThat the action of Mr Speaker on ist October, 1912, in endeavouring to prevent a member this House from reading a notice of motion, in refusing to accept such notice of motion, on the ground that the motion was frivolous, is a breach of the powers, privileges, and immuniof members of the House of RepresentaOn last Tuesday, certain action was taken in the House, which placed me in a most invidious position. Doubtless, those of the general public in Australia who do not me would come to the conclusion that my I was humiliated, but the public of Ausa setralia who do know me know very well that I would not place myself in an extreme position without very good reasons. I yield to no man in the respect I have for the office of Speaker. No member of the House is more careful than I am on I entering or leaving the chamber to make due obeisance to the Chair. If ever I come into conflict with Mr Speaker; if ever for a moment I resist Mr Speaker, it is beI have a doubt as to whether he isright. If ever I continue to resist Mr. upon Speaker, honourable members will know that I have the strongest conviction that he is wrong. So that, when I attempt to resist Mr Speaker, it is not out of disrespect to his high office, or to himself personally, or to this honourable House, but because I deem it a sacred duty to resist encroachment, from whatever source, on my powers, privileges, and immunities as a member-of this House, as they are set was out in the Constitution. Section 49 of the Constitution providesThe powers, privileges, and immunities of the Senate and of the House of Representatives, of the members of the Committees of eachshall be such as are declared by the Parliament, and, until declared, shall be those of Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom and of its members and Committees as at the establishment of the Commonwealth. These powers, immunities, and privileges are decided by this House. Whatever may be our respective abilities or social or other position, we are all here, as members of Parliament, equal in the eyes of the law, and according to the custom of Parliament. The privileges and immunities of members of this House are embodied in our Standing Orders. But we have not behind us the centuries of experience of the House of Commons, ancl we have therefore made provision in No. 1 of our Standing Orders in these termsIn all cases not provided for, resort shall had to the rules, forms, and practices of the House of Commons. I can find no standing order which enables a Speaker to intervene to prevent me readenabled ing a notice of motion, nor is there any standing order of the House of Commons or practice of that House enabling a Speaker to declare that he will not such a notice of motion as I desired to give. Freedom of speech is one of our most ancient privileges. From time immemorial dress freedom of speech has been one of the and privileges of members of the House of national Commons, and, so far as our history goes, of members of the State Legislatures. This within ancient privilege of freedomof speech was some centuries ago interfered with by ments; members of the House of Commons, when pointments, a member named Haxey introduced a Bill referring to the excessive charges of Royal Household, that displeased the King. The member brought in his Bill, just as I , for example, might introduce motion dealing with what I might consider to be excessive charges in connection with the Governor General's establishment. Howtration, ever, the House of Commons, by jority, condemned Haxey as a traitor. That was in the reign of Richard II 1377 to 1399. I find, however, that the next reign-that of Henry IV - the motion. decision was reversed by the Lords and Commons, as against the law and custom quite of Parliament.",18
54,Mr GROOM,Unknown,What is the Honourable member quoting from?,19
55,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"My information is obirresponsibility, tained from' page 94 of Sir T. Erskine May's Parliamentary Practice. So long as an honourable member says nothing personally opprobrious of other honourable members-and I take that to be something scurrilous concerning the private character of honourable members-h e can say anytary [i4S] thing he likes in debate. What he can say in debate he can put into a motion. He can say anything he likes, however offensive it may be to the feelings, or injurious to die characters of individuals, and he is protected by his privilege from any action for libel, as well as from any molestation. There was nothing personally opprobrious in the motion which I proposed to put upon the business-paper concerning members of the Opposition. That motion dealt with their public actions and public speeches, and yet Mr Speaker denied me the right, as a member of this be House, to give notice of it. I trust that when he replies, if he does reply to me, he will point to the standing order, or the practice of the House of Commons, which him to apply the closure to me. How did I come to think of framing that motion? I had witnessed certain things in receive this House. I remembered that the Leader of the Opposition gave notice of a motion which readThat the following words be added to the Ad:- "" And to inform Your Excellency that the Government merits the censure of the House the country for its failure to realise its and constitutional obligations, for flagrant neglect of its duty to secure industrial peace and good order, and to uphold the law the Commonwealth; for its maladministration of public affairs and public Departfor its grossly partisan actions and apand its reckless irresponsibility in the financial affairs of the Commonwealth."" the That motion was moved by him on 25 th June last, as will be seen by reference to Hansard, page 104. The Leader of the a Opposition charged the Government and their supporters with failure, which means neglect or incompetency, with maladminiswith grossly partisan actions and a mawith reckless irresponsibility. Mr Speaker did not interfere to prevent in the honourable member from moving that The honourable member for Ballarat was within his rights in submitting it. It did not deal with the personal character of honourable members, and if he believed that the Government were responsible for failure, for maladministration, for reckless and partisan appointments, he was perfectly entitled to move it, and, as a matter of fact, he did move it. He was not prevented from reading it. Mr Speaker waited to hear what it was all about. Now, if honourable members will turn to Sir T. Erskine May's ParliamenPractice, page 263, they will see the class of matters which may be debated, and those of which notice of motion must be given. May lays downsCertain matters cannot be debated save upon treatment of me. a inhstantive motion which can be dealt by amendment, or by the distinct vote of House, such as the conduct of the Sovereign, the heir to the Throne, the Viceroy and vernor-General of India, the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, the Speaker, the Chairman of and Means, members of either House of liament, and Judges of the Superior Courts the United Kingdom, including persons holding the position of a Judge, such as a Judge in"" a moveCourt of Bankruptcy, and of a County Court. These matters, therefore, cannot be questioned by way of amendment. substantive motion, I take it, is a motion which can be dealt with by way of amendment, and Sir Thomas Erskine May, the authority to whom we chiefly refer on matters of parliamentary procedure, there outlined a sample of the questions which must be dealt with by a substantive motion. He lays it down that no motion concerning honourable members, the Speaker, or the Chairman of Committees can be dealt with by a substantive motion. I could not tack my motion to a Bill dealing with the land tax, or the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank or the maternity allowance. I had to submit a substantive motion. I contend that by analogy I am entitled to move any motion regarding any section of this House, so long as it is couched in parliamentary language. I would appeal to honourable members opposite to dismuss from their minds the words of the motion of which I desired' to give notice. These questions of procedure are questions which ought to be dealt with on a non-party basis. The rules of parliamentary procedure concern us all, because there is no knowing at what lime we may be in a minority, and the Standing Orders which we have adopted, ;is well as the practice of the House of Commons, have beep created in the interests of the minority-in the interests of the single individual-becaus e the majority can always get their own way. The brilliant minds of past members of the House of Commons have laid down this practice for us. The honourable member for Hindmarsh made an interjection a while ago regarding the possibilities of a revolution. In my opinion the decisions of members of the House of Commons during the centuries have prevented revolution in the Old Country. They have permitted freedom of speech in the House of Commons, and Mr Higgs. that has been the true safety valve. Contrast the action of Mr Speaker in regard to the Leader of the Opposition with his If honourable members with will refer to Hansard of ist October of the the present session they will see that he permitted me to read, part of my motion. GoI want them to be thoroughly seized of the terms of the notice of motion which he Ways endeavoured to prevent me from reading, Parkeeping in their minds the terms of the of motion which had been moved by the Leader of the Opposition. I desired to That an Address be presented to his Excellency the Governor General, informing him that Now a the Fusion known as His Majesty's Opposition merits the censure of the House and the country(a) for its failure to realise its national and constitutional obligations; (Â£) for flagrant neglect of its duty to vote against those measures which it professes not to believe in ; (r) for unduly taking up the time of the House in moving amendments which, if one may judge by the remarks made in support thereof, ought to be put to a vote and a division recorded thereon. (d) for its grossly inconsistent actions and speeches; (Â«) for the notorious lack of harmony between its leaders; and (/) for its general incompetence. Mr Speaker endeavoured to prevent me from reading that motion. He made me withdraw and apologize.",19
56,Mr GROOM,Unknown,He was endeavouring to save the honourable member's reputation.,20
57,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I ask honourable members of the Opposition to dismiss from their minds the reflections, which they may consider quite uncalled for, which were contained in my notice of motion, and to treat this matter on a non-party basis in the interests of their own powers, privileges, and immunities. Contrast the action of Mr Speaker in dealing with the motion which was submitted by the Leader of the Opposition with his treatment of the motion of which I desired to give notice.

71,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I name the honourable member for Capricornia for disobeying the Chair. The motion of which I gave notice can be read in less than a minute. Reading slowly, one can dispose of it in forty-five seconds. The point which I wish to make that? is that Mr Speaker did not allow me to read the notice of motion, and that in itself, a breach of the privileges of honourable members. It is true that I heard Mr Speaker call "" Order !"" ; it is true, duction also, that I was wrong in disobeying him; but I was only technically wrong, because, according to our Standing Orders, an honof orable member is entitled to be heard out interruption. If he is in order, even Mr Speaker has no right to interrupt. Mr Speaker, however, interrupted me, and I resented his action because it was not the first time that he had done so I had believed myself to be thoroughly order. The Leader of the Opposition gave notice of his motion of censure on the Government, and the Prime Minister obvious accepted that notice the night before the the motion itself was debated. Next mornall, ing, I endeavoured to ask a question in tion. regard to it, but was not allowed to read towards it. I resented that action on the part of Mr Speaker, and was "" named,"" with the result that I had to apologize. Speaker refused to allow me to read this motion, and some honourable members enber deavoured to shout me down. They cried out so loudly that my voice could be heard House. only within a few feet of me. That shows a distinct breach of the privileges of orable members. I consider that I was only technically wrong on this occasion; but Mr Speaker made me apologize for disobeying him, and then made draw the words and apologize for having uttered them. Surely, if the Leader of the Opgoing position could be allowed to move a motion accusing the Government of flaga rant neglect, maladministration, [145]- 2 tisan actions, and reckless irresponsibility; surely, if he could place on the business paper that notice of motion, I should be entitled to place on the business-paper a notice of motion accusing the Opposition, which is a political entity, of flagrant neglect, of gross inconsistency in their actions and speeches, and of unduly taking up the time of the House? When I framed that motion, I thought that it was clever; I thought it "" a hit- a palpable hit!"" A gentleman who indulges his wit, very often at my expense, and who can hardly be deemed to be a friend of mine, considered the motion a well-merited .gibe, quite worth launching at the proper time.

I mention that to show that the opinion a section of the general public was that with the motion of which I proposed to give notice was not a frivolous one. I am aware that the Leader of the Opposition takes exception to the statement that he gave his blessing to the Maternity Allowance Bill, and that he has stated in the press that he when placed on record in Hansard his opinion in that it was a rash experiment. But he also said, in the same speechHowever faulty this measure; however and serious its omissions and numerous risks that it must run, I look upon it, after as a social endeavour in the right direc. . .

In such circumstances, I can see no finality business of the House. The first reason given by Mr Speaker for ruling my notice of motion out of order to allow the motion to be read. was that it was frivolous. The meaning "" frivolous "" is ""trifling, trivial, slight, important, petty, worthless, silly. "" honourable members whether the terms of my go upon the notice-paper. motion were trivial, slight, unimportant, silly? If they were either slight frivolous, what can be said of the terms of the motion moved by the Leader me of the Opposition? Mr Speaker might have thought that it was frivospeecb lous, or even slight. He might come to the conclusion that it would never be carried, but that would not be good reason for refusing to allow it to apshow pear on the business-paper. The Leader of the Opposition could not carry his moI t was lost by forty votes to thirty, and, that being so, the permotion of which I gave notice could as posnot be ruled out of order on the have ground that it would not be carried. That was not the question at all. I submit that the question of frivolity has It is a a matter for the House to decide. If the House considers that a motion is frivolous, House can, according to the standing beorder, apply the closure. It is laid down After any question has been proposed, either in the House or in any Committee of the Whole, 11 motion may be made by any member, rising in his place, and without notice, and whether other member is addressing the Chair or ""That the question be now.put,"" and the motion shall be put forthwith and decided withHouse. I out amendment or debate. the House can deal with the quesof the frivolity or seriousness or dangerousness of a member's speech. I should to give honourable members a specimen of a motion which might be deemed to be frivolous, and which the majority of the Senate did consider frivolous. I was not one of the senators who did consider it frivolous. I voted for it , but there were only six of us, and there were twenty Hanagainst it. Senator de Largie movedThat in the opinion of this Senate the Argus having printed a foul libellous article that the memory of King James I . , referring to monarch as a "" fool and a blackleg,"" the should take steps to prevent desire to the circulation of the newspaper' through of the Argus has to this Senate. to the Senator) Stewart seconded that motion. The President, the late Sir Richard Baker, a most painstaking man, a great authority on parliamentary procedure, did not refuse I dare' of say half the members of this House would unconsider that motion frivolous, but the I ask President allowed it to be read, and to The majority or of the Senate showed their opinion of it or by allowing the closure to be moved. I submit that Mr Speaker must deal with on my own motion, and not rule it out of order, because somebody else may put a in ids motion. Was there a speech have in my motion? If there was, there was a speech in the motion of the Leader of a the Opposition. What is a speech? When Senator de Largie's motion was before ""Senate, the late Sir Frederick Sargood - rose, and said I agree with the Leader of the House, that public importance. - we come here to attend to the business - Commonwealth, and not to join in what, .all, is a perfect farce. I therefore move"" That the Senate do now divide."" T'he President saidThe honourable member cannot do that. - has made a speech. There was a speech of a few words. As to the question of whether I or any other member of the House can move a. motion concerning another honourable member, ask honourable members to refer to Todd's Parliamentary Government in ihe British Colonies. At page 64 they will see that in the Canadian House of Commons a member moved for a Select Committee inquire into a series of specific charges which he preferred against another memadjournment in ber, Thomas MCGreevy. That notice of motion occupied two octavo pages of brevier type. I submit that, whether notice of motion occupies 6 or 160 or lines of type, that has nothing to do Mr Speakei, so long as the language parliamentary. As regards the limitations placed on Mr Speaker, at one time the House of Commons ^he Speaker, after bearing the debate, actually framed the motion himself. It is stated in May, page prevent him. 265Formerly it was customary for the Speaker, House. when he thought fit, to frame a motion out of the debate. This ancient custom, however, was open to abuses and misconceptions, and has since been disused. Now, the Speaker must put the question in the words of the mover. To show that he has no right to interfere with the motion when it is couched in parliamentary language, I draw honourable members' attake place. tention to the limitations which are upon him. Take the question of the closure. Mr Speaker cannot decide when a debate shall close. That is decided a majority of the House. Mr Speaker is not permitted to decide what is a definite wit. - matter of urgent public importance. Any member in this House, however frivolous - a subject may be, may move that it is definite matter of urgent public importance, and, if he can get five members in the House to agree with him, he and they decide whether or not the question is frivolous, or ought to be brought forward. Mr Speaker has nothing to do with that. It' was found by the Standing Orders Coinmittee in various Legislatures that the would be dangerous and open to misconceptions to allow the Speaker to decide what was a definite matter of urgent I submit that that is of the proof that Mr Speaker was wrong in preafter venting me reading my notice of motion, and in refusing to allow it to go on the notice-paper. Mr Speaker does not decide how long a He member may speak. Surely, if he can decide whether or not a motion is frivolous, he can decide how long an honourable member who is making a frivolous speech can take ? But any honourable member who joins with I another in moving the adjournment of the House, can speak as long as the Standing Orders permit. However frivolous and unimportant, and even silly, his remarks may be, Mr Speaker has no right to into terfere with him. Take the case of the some of of the House. At one time, the Legislative Assemblies of Australia, it was the practice that Mr.. a Speaker, on the question that the House 1,060 be adjourned, had the power to stop a with member from bringing up a question; but, is under our Standing Orders, on the motion for the adjournment of the House, a memin ber can bring forward any question he likes, from a political needle to a political anchor, and the Speaker has no power to Mr Speaker says that he can see no finality to the business of the May I say that he has misapprehended his powers? He has nothing long to do with the finality of the business of the House. The House adjourns on its own resolution. With the majority of the House lies the decision as to when the business of the House shall be determined - whe n the finality of the business shall That is a matter for put the Government, with the ""consent of the majority of the House, to determine. In conclusion, let me say that Parliament by is a place in which party is set against party, mind against mind, and wit against It is the right and duty of every party to endeavour to prove to the public that the one party, and not the other, a should have the occupancy of the Treasury bench. All the weapons of humour, satire, ridicule, mockery, derision, contempt, burlesque, and farce can be used by honourable members, if they so desire, to prove that the Ministerialists have no right to occupy the Treasury bench, or to prove that the members of the Opposition are the it proper persons to take their place. Mr. Speaker should hold the balance evenly between the parties. What would be thought on the cricket field if , when a player was making a run which he hoped would be to the advantage of his own side, the umpire stopped the game on the ground that the run was a frivolous one? What would be said in the football field if , when a player was about, in his opinion, to score for his side, the umpire stopped the game on the ground that the kick was frivolous? We are not in the football or the cricket field, however j we are in Parliament. I sincerely hope that honourable members will dismiss from their minds any irritation that may have been caused either by the terms of my notice of motion or its intention, and that they will decide this question on the merits of the case. I trust they will recognise that where the Standing Orders do not in black and white provide what shall be done, Mr Speaker ought to be guided by precedents; and I submit that ""it would be an exceedingly bad precedent to allow any occupant of the Speaker's chair to interfere to prevent an honourable member from reading a notice of motion. It would also be an exceedingly bad precedent to lay it down that Mr Speaker could prevent a notice of motion, couched in proper parliamentary language, being placed upon the notice-paper.",22
81,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Wit h regard to the words ""on the ist October"" in the honourable member's motion, I have already ruled that they are out of order. I would ask the honourable member to amend his motion by leaving out those words.",24
82,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,I will leave out the date. Motion amended accordingly.,24
83,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"There is another part of the motion which, if strictly interpreted, is out of order, but I have no objection to allowing the motion to be put as amended.",24
84,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"Riverina) [4.5] - I intend to approach this question without party feeling, ancl I trust that every honourable member will do the same. The honourable member for Capricornia has dealt with the question calmly, judicially, and without any heat, though when his notice of motion was ruled out of order he, no doubt, felt very sore. The whole question before the House is whether a member of this House, occupying the position of Speaker, has power to prevent a motion being tabled. I have some little parliamentary experience myself, and I have looked through the Standing Orders very carefully indeed. It is laid down in the Standing Orders that notice of a motion may be given; but as far as I can seeand I have looked up the parliamentary authorities, May, Bourinot, and others-r nothing can be quoted which appears to give to an honourable member occupying the position of Leader of the Opposition any more privileges than those enjoyed by any other member of the House. I do not' think that that proposition can be denied for a moment. By usage, however-and parliamentary practice has grown by usage more than under Standing Orders-the Leader of the Opposition has certain privileges extended to him. When he rises in his place, and gives-notice of a motion, it rests, not with Mr Speaker, but with the Prime Minister to treat it either as an ordinary motion or as an extraordinary one. The Prime Minister may choose toregard the motion as one attacking the policy of the occupants of the .Treasury bench. But it is only by courtesy and' usage that a motion from the Leader of the Opposition is treated in that fashionUnder the Standing Orders no precedence is given to him over any other member of the House. As to the motion of which the honourable member for Capricornia desired to give notice last week, I think that Mr Speaker himself will see that it would be exceedingly dangerous to the privileges of this Chamber if the sole power were vested in him to say whether a motion was frivolous or not. The Standing Orders make provision that a matter of the kind shall not be left in the hands of Mr. Speaker, but should be determined by the whole House. Mr Speaker is there topreside over us and keep good order. He must do so in accordance with Standing. Orders that we ourselves have adopted. The Standing Orders provide that wherever there is any deficiency in them a Committee appointed for the purpose shall any make a recommendation, or the practice other of the British House of Commons may beresorted to. This is not a party question, and I do not approach it out of any feeling of antagonism to the present occupant of the chair. I shall be glad to know whether any Speaker of the House of Commons has ever prevented notice of a motionbeing given when that motion has been couched in proper and respectful terms. My own opinion is that such a precedent cannot be produced. Therefore, our Speaker should not attempt to claim morebinder our written Constitution and Standing Orders than is claimed by the Speaker - of the British House of Commons under its unwritten Constitution. The formula is laid down so clearly that honourable members can see for themselves what is the notice of motion. Whether the notice of motion read by the honourable member for Capricornia was in good taste or not, I am not going to argue. The honourable member himself has not argued that point, but he has argued, and, in my opinion, rightly argued-and I think that honourable members should agree with him-that it is the undoubted privilege of any member of this House to give notice of a motion dealing with a matter affecting what he might - consider interests of the country about to be disturbed, so far as he can judge, by the action of any individual, or any section of the House. Having taken that course, the notice of motion would appear upon the business-paper, and without the actual assistance of the Prime Minister in allowing the notice to be taken out of the ordinary course, it might be months before it could be reached, indeed, the session might close without it being reached. There is quite a number of safeguards provided in matters of this kind. that our Standing Orders do not vest in the occupant of the Chair the right to reject a. notice of motion. I believe, sir, that I am - correct in saying that you declined to allow the honourable member for Capricornia to - continue to read his notice of motion because, in your opinion, it was frivolous. If that was so, the power of deciding the question of frivolity is, by the Standing - Orders, and the usage of the Parliaments in Australia, vested, not in the Speaker, but in the members of the House. Some - of my confreres from New South Wales may, perhaps, remember that some years ago the right of rejecting a motion was vested in the Speaker by a standing order - of the Legislative Assembly; and so dangerous did the standing order become, and so ill-used was it, in some cases, I regret - say to the memory of those who have now passed away, that the members of the House saw their privileges being taken away from them, and, therefore, by a considerable majority, they deliberately altered the standing order depriving the Speaker of the right to say whether a motion was frivolous or otherwise, and placed that power in the House itself.",24
85,Mr CANN,Unknown,Does he not cut out motions sometimes ?,25
86,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"Yes , he did. I do not wish to mention his name, but my colleagues will remember the gentleman whose action brought about the alteration. To a considerable extent, the Standing Orders of this House were framed on the lines of the Standing Orders of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales. These matters were discussed- I was a member of the first Standing Orders Committee-and it was considered advisable that only what are termed temporary Standing Orders should be adopted in order that more time might be devoted to producing a complete set of rules in the future for the guidance of the House. It was stated then, that the first standing order-the one providing that where our own rules do not make provision lor any cases, the practice of the House of Commons must be resorted to- covered all detects in the code. But we have gone on to this day in the eleventh year of our existence with temporary Standing Orders. Every honourable member has, I repeat, the absolute right to place on the business-paper a notice of motion to be afterwards proposed by him. When the notice appears on the businessI assert paper, is it the property of Mr Speaker? No, it is the property of the whole House to be dealt with in accordance with its own procedure, and at its own time. Another abuse crept in in the past. Experience, we are told, teaches wisdom, and, so, in order to get rid of abuse, through the Speaker being invested with the power of declining to accept a motion, or to say whether it was frivolous, or would be noneffective, the power was deliberately vested in the House. I need only refer honourable members to the standing order to which the honourable member for Capvicomia has alluded. If I desire to intercept the business of this country by intimating to the Speaker that I propose to discuss a matter of very great public importance, though it may not be a matter to of the slightest importance in the world, public or otherwise, Mr Speaker is not vested with the power to say so. The House is invested with that authority. If five of my fellow members rise with me, although the Speaker may incline to the view that the matter is of no public importance, he cannot refuse to receive the motion. The motion is launched to be dealt with. The House may allow the motion to be discussed in the ordinary way,' and a vote to be taken, or it may not. It is the judge. If it should be considered that' the matter is frivolous, or of no public importance, any honourable member may appeal to the others to stop the debate at a moment's notice, and the House can close the debate at once. So far as the practice of the House of Commons is concerned, and certainly so far as our own Standing Orders are concerned, the power of decision is vested in the House, and not in the Speaker. I recognise, sir, that you would be the last person to willingly attempt to deprive any member of the House of his privilege of faithfully, honestly, and honourably representing those who sent him here, but with all due respect I would point out that none of us is immaculate or perfect. We are all liable to err. If honourable members, after calmly considering this matter, decide that the honourable member for Capricornia was wrongly interfered with, and was prevented from exercising a right which he possesses, it will be no reflection on you, Mr Speaker. The honourable member did not claim privilege for his notice of motion, asking that it be given precedence of all other business. He merely read it, with a view to having it set down on the business paper for discussion in the ordinary way. .You, sir, interfered when he was reading it, and asked him to discontinue. Is there anything in any of our Standing Orders which allowed you to do that? It is expected of a member who is giving notice - of motion that he shall read it so that the House may know what his proposal is. It is time that we had a complete set of Standing Orders to define exactly our procedure, and the rights and privileges of members, and to determine whether the guardianship of those rights and privileges is vested in you, Mr Speaker, or in the House. I contend that it is vested in the House at present. This discussion will do good in giving an occasion for thought on this subject, and I hope the incident will induce the Government to provide for the adoption of permanent Standing Orders. Under the temporary Standing Orders, the Leader of the Opposition has no more rights andl privileges than another honourable member. The Prime Minister, and his colleagues, have certain rights. They have the right to sit on a particular bench; they can obtain messages from the Crown and produce them here; they can arrange their order of business, and do other things which private members may not do. When the Leader of the Opposition gives notice of a motion censuring the Mr Chanter. Government, the Prime Minister may accept it as a challenge, and give opportunity for its immediate discussion, or he may refuse to do so; in which case, it takes its place on the notice-paper in the ordinary way. I understand that the honourable member for Capricornia thinks that, although the Leader of the Opposition made certain charges against the Government, those charges would be more properly brought against the Opposition ; and he desired to bring them against the Opposition. You, Mr Speaker, ruled that such motions as that of which he gave notice would lead toendless discussion and interference with the business of Parliament. Without reflecting on you, personally, I think that your ruling deprived the honourable member of a right which - he possesses, and left him with no other course to pursue than to bring forward the matter as a question of privilege, to be determined immediately by the House.  other private members, I have so few privileges, that I am always ready and willing to guard jealously those I have. No feeling has been engendered by the action of the honourable member for Capricornia, who has taken a manly and honourable course to get this question debated and put out of the way. He thinks that he has a grievance against the House for being pulled up by you when reading a notice of motion on Thursday last. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - A grievance against the Chair.  Standing Orders, and supports the Speaker - in his rulings. Who is it takes the onus of any decision, the House or the Speaker ? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The Speaker, if there is no motion of dissent.  able member. If I do anything here derogatory to my position or to the House, I .can be dealt with by my constituents. The honourable member for Capricornia is willing that his constituents should be the judge of his conduct here.",25
87,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Will the honourable member deal with the question before the Chair?  bulary, and my views may be narrow in some respects, and if I cannot transgress as much as I have done in expressing my thoughts, I do not know what I can say. I do not wish to get into conflict with the Chair, lest something worse might happen to me than happened to the honourable member for Capricornia.",26
88,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member is reflecting on the Chair.  think that you have given me a fair deal.,27
89,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member will see that his remarks are out of order. ,27
90,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I do not think that the honourable member intended to say that. If he meant to deliberately insult the Chair, I should be compelled to adopt a very severe course.  do with me, so long as you do not kill me.",27
91,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member must withdraw those remarks.  not believe.,27
92,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member must withdraw his remarks. ,27
93,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I name the honourable member for Maranoa.  nothing to regret, anyway.",27
94,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [4.30] - Following on your ruling, Mr Speaker, there is a certain course that I am bound to take without question. You have invited the House to take action by naming the honourable member for Maranoa j and I move That the honourable member for Maranoa be suspended from the service of the House for the remainder of this sitting.",27
95,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have no desire lo press this case, because I know that the honourable member for Maranoa did not really mean what he said. If the honourable member is prepared to .apologize, I am prepared to accept his apology; otherwise, I must put the motion.  ashamed of! Question put, and division called for.  a coward, but, if it is not too late, sir, humbly apologize, and withdraw the words to which you have taken exception. I do not feel in a fit state to say anything ther; and I shall content myself with supporting the motion.",27
96,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [4.35] - The question of order is always an important one, and, without referring to a recent incident, we see how acute men's minds are, and how strongly they feel, on questions that affect them so far as the etiquette of the House is concerned. A great deal has been said about the powers of the Speaker, but, in my opinion, the Speaker possesses no powers except those vested in him by the Standing Orders, or the practices of this House, and of the British House of Commons; the Speaker can do nothing on his own initiative outside those Standing Orders. There is no member but has far greater powers than those possessed by Mr. Speaker. According to the honourable member for Capricornia, Mr Speaker must put a motion in the words submitted by an honourable member.",27
97,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,Mr Speaker is the mouthpiece of the House.,27
98,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,The motions must be respectfully worded.,27
99,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Exactly ; the Speaker has to decide, not only as to the proper wording of a motion, but as to its relevancy, and as to its compliance with the Standing Orders, and especially has be to decide whether or not a motion is frivolous.",27
100,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,Where is the standing order to that effect?,27
101,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I say that that is my opinion; there are customs and practices which are just as strong as Standing Orders.,27
102,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,Where is the custom? A man will soon not be allowed to speak at all 1,27
103,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I do not agree with' the honourable member for Bourke. Even if a motion were respectfully worded- a motion raising a point such as that raised by the honourable member for Capricornia - referrin g to members of the Opposition, or certain members of the Opposition, or members on either side of the House, it would, undoubtedly, lead to abuse in this or any other Parliament, and, moreover, would be futile and demoralizing. When I have said that I have said all I can against this kind of motion. In my 1 opinion, the broadest possible latitude should be given to every. member who enters this House. A man does not come fur- here as John, James, or Bill Sykes, but he comes as the honourable member for a constituency; none of us are here in our own names, but simply in the names of constituencies outside, and for these only can we speak, and on their behalf. It is, for that reason I desire there should be the widest possible latitude for honourable members to declare themselves in this House, where a record is made of their statements and actions, so that they may be judged by their constituents. Subject to decorum, and to the best known methods of carrying on business, the greatest latitude gives the best results in a representative House such as this. The strength of Mr Speaker's position lies in the fact that, if motions such as that before us were permitted they would fill the notice-paper, and some of them, though respectfully worded-and it would require no great ingenuity to so word themwould, doubtless, prove most disagreeable and offensive.",27
104,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,If they were offensive they would be out of order at once.,28
105,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I think not. honourable member is not such a youth in parliamentary business, and in the framing of motions, that he could not, in perfectly innocuous language, make insinuations that would have the effect of a dagger thrust. What I mean is that hon--orable members would be quite capable of drawing up motions of that kind; and it is just as well that the privilege should not be so widened as to enable the most frail of us at some time to do an irreparable injury to another quite as honest as himself. The weakest point I think in the position of Mr Speaker is that, - before the honourable member for Capricornia had read his notice of motion in the first instance, he was stopped and named.",28
106,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Accordin g to the report, Mr Speaker did not interfere until the motion had been three-parts read.",28
107,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The honourable member is anticipating what 1 was going to say. The practice has grown up in this Parliament that an honourable member, on giving notice of motion may give the substance of the motion, or read the whole of it, while he may afterwards alter it. If that be so, I submit that it would be wise for Mr Speaker to hear motions stated in their entirety, even though they should seem to involve a breach of the Standing Orders. An honourable member might see fit to alter a motion objected to, so as to bring it into conformity with the Standing Orders or the ruling of the Chair. It is inadvisable to anticipate that an orable member by a notice of motion desires deliberately to flout the Standing Orders. He should be allowed to read it, and, if objection be taken to it, and the honourable* member will not modify it in order to meet the objection, it can be ruled out of order.. Such a practice would strengthen the position of the Chair. The honourable member for Capricornia has given a very fair historical review of the privileges, powers, and' immunities enjoyed by members of Parliament when they attack persons who are not members of the House. He will agreethat it is a different matter to attack otherhonorable members in their representative capacity. They are the butt of public criticism here and elsewhere, just as he is himself. In dealing with subjects which are not politically personal, we may at times go too far, but it is much more likely that members will go too far when attacking the Opposition, who are not clothed The with the responsibilities, powers, and dutiesdevolving upon members of the Executive. The members of the Executive are subject to attack to a greater degree than are anyprivate members of the House.",28
108,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,Member s of the Opposition have no greater privileges than havehonorable members on this side.,28
109,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"No , none whatever. Noone is more able than is the honourable member for Capricornia to look up thestrongest arguments in support of any position he may assume, and the strongest point he was able to make was in his reference toa motion of censure which was launched by the Leader of the Opposition against the Executive, who are responsible for the government of the country. The honourable member's motion is launched against the Opposition, who are charged with no such duty as the management of the affairs of the country. Themembers of the Opposition do not requireprotection from me or from any one else.. They are quite able to look after themselves, but I feel bound to say that I do not think the illustration given by the honourable member for Capricornia was a good one, because the cases he sought to compare are not analogous. The honourable member's references to the conduct of an umpire in controlling a game of cricket werebeside the question. The question really is whether the game of Parliament can be carried on at all if motions of the kind 1 under consideration are to be constantly moved or read out in this House If everyhon- member of the House exercised the privilege of reading out such motions referring to other honourable members, the time of Parliament would be entirely taken up in the consideration of questions of privilege.",28
110,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,An honourable member's constituents would look to that.,29
111,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Exactly . I anticipated that objection in my opening statement. I say that the more complete the opportunity given to honourable members to display themselves in any way they think fit, as representatives of their respective constituencies, the better. But there are limits, and those limits must be decided, on behalf of the House, by Mr Speaker, whose duties are onerous and difficult even under the best conditions. His powers and - privileges have been placed in his keeping by the House. He cannot enter the chamber or leave it but by the authority of the House. He cannot put a motion except in accordance with our rules, and in the words in which it is submitted. He must act in every way in accordance with the rules and Standing Orders, and, while he does so, he is entitled to the greatest respect from honourable members.",29
112,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,There is no standing order dealing with such motions as that under discussion.,29
113,Mr FISHER,Unknown,There is no standing order and no procedure dealing with such matters.,29
114,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,There is the practice of the - House of Commons.,29
115,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The honourable member for Riverina has had a distinguished career in the Chair, and he must know that circumstances may arise, in this or in any other Parliament, which have never previously arisen. In such cases, common sense must rule, and the gentleman we appoint - to the most distinguished position in this House must decide, to the best of his ability, what is in order and what is not, and what action should in the circumstances be taken. Taking it all in all, the privileges of private members will not, I think, be seriously invaded by upholding the ruling of the Chair in this case.",29
116,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Swan) [4.45] My desire always has been, and I hope always will be, to uphold the authority of the Speaker or Chairman of Committees. I believe that should we cease to uphold the authority of our presiding officers, very serious difficulties must arise. My desire to uphold the authority of the Speaker or Chairman of Committees would not influence me if I believed that on any occasion they flagrantly exceeded their powers. Although my parliamentary experience has been very lengthy, I have had very little experience indeed of differing from the authority of the Chair. I have always been very anxious, even though I felt that I was being rather badly treated, to bow to the authority of the Chair. I am not aware of any precedent for such a motion as that which the honourable member for Capricornia desires to give notice of. I have never previously known a private member propose a motion of censure upon members opposed to him, and questioning the way in which they think it well to perform their public duties. I cannot see what object there is in such a motion, or what would happen if it were carried. I do not know what the Governor General could do with the members of the Opposi. tion if such an address were presented to him.",29
117,Mr RILEY,Unknown,That is not the question before the Chair.,29
118,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I think it bears upon the question as to whether the rule or motion which the honourable member for Capricornia desires to give notice of is frivolous or not. VVhen would such a motion be discussed or be replied to? I think it is quite without precedent in parliamentary procedure. In my opinion, Mr. Speaker was quite right in considering it a frivolous motion. It was frivolous, not only because it could have no effect, but because it reflected upon the conduct of "" members of this House in an unnecessary, and, I think, a frivolous and unbecoming manner. T have no sympathy whatever with the present motion. All I need say in regard to it is that I am opposed to it, and I think that the honourable member for Capricornia has unnecessarily taken up the time of the House in bringing it forward.",29
119,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"Bourke) [4.50] - I should not have risen to address myself to the question, but for some remarks which were made by the Prime Minister. In the first place, it seems to me that neither the merits nor demerits of the motion which the honourable member for Capricornia sought to move a few days ago are in question. We are bound by our Standing o Orders, which lay down that, if I desire to bring forward a motion, so long as I can secure the support of five honourable members to that motion, I am entitled to move it. It is this House, and this House alone, which has the right to say whether or not a motion is of a frivolous nature. If I choose to occupy the time of honourable members in discussing frivolous and non-essential matters, the penalty which I pay for my action is to be found in the odium and contempt in which I shall be held by my fellow members, and in the punishment which will be meted out to me by an outraged country. Mr Speaker possesses only those powers and privileges which are conferred upon him by the Standing Orders.",29
120,Mr RILEY,Unknown,B y this House.,30
121,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,Exactly . He is as much bound by those Standing Orders as is any ordinary member of the House.,30
122,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The right to move the adjournment of the House on a matter of urgent public importance is not attacked by Mr Speaker's decision.,30
123,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"The fact that an honourable member is at liberty to move the adjournment of the House to call attention to any matter, so long as he can secure carried. the support of five honourable members, clearly shows that there are no rules which vest Mr Speaker with power to decide that a motion is frivolous. It is this Chamber, and this Chamber alone, which has that power. If we are going to vest Mr. Speaker with such a power, he may prevent any honourable member from submitting any motion. Is he to be the absolute judge of whether or not a motion is of public importance? If so, he may tomorrow prohibit any honourable member, who is in the minority, from moving a particular motion. It is idle to discuss character of the proposal which the honourable member for Capricornia desired to bring forward. I recollect that, when the Gaming Act was under consideration in the Victorian Legislative Assembly, the Government of the day desired to exclude race-courses from the designation of public ""place"" ; and thereupon I attempted to move what was regarded as a farcical amendment to the effect that public "" place "" should be held to include "" any place, anywhere, and at any time."" The Speaker, on that occasion, held that my proposal would reduce the position to a farce; but, after discussion, he decided that I was perfectly within my rights, and the amendment was allowed to be put. Since I have been a member of this Chamber, I have seen proposals which commanded the support of only three honourable members. What is the logical deduction to be drawn from that circumstance? Is it not that, in the opinion of the majority of honourable members, the proposal was absolutely farcical ?Upon that occasion, Mr Speaker might just as well have decided that the motion was; farcical. But, if we are to discuss the merits or demerits of the motion which the honourable member for Capricornia desired to bring forward, I ask what was there in that, motion which was mere farcical or frivolous - so far as its terms were concerned-than , there was in the motion submitted by the Leader of the Opposition? The honourable member for Ballarat has no more rights or privileges here than has the honourable member for Capricornia. What-: ever position he may occupy as Leader of the Opposition, so far as our Standing Orders are concerned, he possesses no morerights or privileges than does any other honourable member.",30
124,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"There would have beeir a little difference if his motion had been,",30
125,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,There was this difference : that the motion of the honourable member for Capricornia had a chance of being carried.,30
126,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,It meant nothing if ithad been carried.,30
127,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"Jus t so; because it was on "" all-fours "" with the motion submitted by the Leader of the Opposition, which meant nothing. Knowing full weir that he had no chance of carrying it, honourable members opposite occupied the timeof this House for three weeks in discussingthe an absolutely frivolous motion.",30
128,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member must not discuss the merits of that motion.,30
129,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"I am not. I am dis- . cussing the merits of the motion which the honourable member for Capricornia sought to submit, which is almost identical in its. terms with that actually moved by the honourable member for Ballarat. What was it which made the motion of the Leader of the Opposition so reasonable, and that of the honourable member for Capricornia so absurd? I , at least, enter my protest against the exercise by Mr Speaker of any power, until he has been armed with that power by this House. For that reason, I am in agreement with the motion of the honourable member for Capricornia.",30
130,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth) [4.56] Everybody will agree with the honourable member for Bourke that, so far as freedom of speech is concerned, honourable members of this House are exactly upon the same footing. Indeed, a number of honourable members will go further and say that freedom of speech is permitted us to facilitate the transaction of public business. If the honourable member for Ballarat, on behalf of a united party, submits a motion of no-confidence in the Government, and that motion be carried, it is interpreted as an intimation by Parliament to His Excellency the Governor General that Ministers have forfeited the confidence of the Democracy of Australia. On the other hand, if any honourable member chooses to submit a motion of no-confidence in a non-official member of the House, even if that motion be carried, it can lead to nothing, except to a petty gratification. It cannot in any way change the conduct of the affairs of the Government; and, consequently, must lead to a considerable waste of time, whilst being productive of no good. For instance, I might rise immediately after the honourable member for Capricornia had carried his motion, and move That an address be presented to His Excelscale. lency the Governor General informing him the honourable member known as the honourable member for Capricornia merits the censure of this House for his failure to realise his national and constitutional obligations, for flagrant neglect of his duty, and for unduly taking the time of the House in moving amendments of a frivolous character. Such a motion would promptly lead to rethose questions upon the crimination on the part of the honourable paper member against myself. Thus, the time of the country would be taken up in the given voicing of frivolous differences, without any possibility of reaching finality. Those differences would have nothing whatever do with the public business which we are sent here to transact, and for doing which we are handsomely reimbursed. There is, however, one difficulty which was mentioned by the honorone, able member for Bourke, and which by Mr Speaker. is worthy of attention. I have searched the Standing Orders, and I have also given a little passing attention to May, but I cannot find that any power is vested in Mr Speaker to deal with matters of this character. In order to absolve him from any charge of arrogating to himself a power which is not vested in him by the Standing Orders, Mr Speaker should be given this power expressly. thinks that the conduct of public business will be seriously interfered with if certain matters are brought forward, he should be empowered to prevent them being brought forward. 1 cannot agree with the Prime Minister that the easiest course to pursue is for Mr Speaker to hear motions read in their entirety before deciding whether he shall rule that they are in or out of order. That would be an unfortunate procedure to adopt, because every honourable member would then be afforded an opportunity to insult every other honourable member and to turn this Chamber into a place which would not reflect credit upon us. I must say that my sympathies in this matter-and I have been to considerable trouble to arrive at a just decision-ar e with Mr Speaker. I think that Mr Speaker is right in endeavouring to curb frivolity in the chamber. As an earnest student of public affairs, I like to see Mr Speaker adopting this procedure, and I should certainly hardly be doing justice to my humanitarian instincts if , on the occasion that I thought he was right, I did not support his ruling. I am sorry that the honourable member for Capricornia did not frame his motion on a somewhat broader There are other matters to which 1 that do not think I should be in order in referring in this debate, and therefore I shall not allude to themj but it seems to me that as the House has apparently given up Mr Speaker power, by default, to alter the actual wording of questions on notice, without consulting the member who places business",30
131,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,Where is that power ?,31
132,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"It is given by default. to It has been exercised by Mr Speaker, and it is a very serious power, as contrasted with that now objected to-the power to say that frivolous business shall not be placed before the House to the detriment of the conduct of ordinary business. No however, has objected to its exercise There are other decisions by Mr Speaker, which have been endorsed in their entirety by honourable members opposite, but which, like the decision to which I have just referred, seem to have absolutely no precedent in May, and no justification under our Standing Orders. My honourable friends opposite, however, have endorsed them, and it is not in order for me, at this juncture, to refer to them. Where he I regret that I am forced into the position of endorsing the general attitude of Mr. Speaker in this matter. I do not endorse it because the motion was moved against honourable members nf the Opposition. As a matter of fact, we are delighted to have any public criticism. upon our public actions in this House. We are ready to stand fire upon any of them, but we do think that, as we have come here to conduct public business, we might be permitted to do so without the time of the House and the country being taken up by the discussion of frivolous motions against us. Honourable members perhaps have not quite realized the reasons for the action which you took last week, Mr Speaker, against the honourable member for Capricornia. The honourable member was in the middle of his notice of motion, when you, Mr Speaker, called him to order, and Hansard, at page 3631, and the following pages, shows conclusively that the honourable member took absolutely no notice of you when you called him to order. That proves conclusively, to my mind, that the offence of which the honourable member was primarily guilty, and which resulted in his being named, was not the frivolous framing of his mction, so much as his repeated disregard of the orders of the Chair when the Chair was seeking to interpose.",31
133,Mr FISHER,Unknown,This discussion founded upon a question raised this afteras noon.,32
134,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"But it arises out of the incident that occurred last week, and shall do no harm in looking thoroughly it. My reason for referring to the matter in this case is that Mr Speaker gave a reason why he should not permit the honourable member to proceed, the fact that, as reported in Hansard, page 3263In such circumstances I to the business of the House. It seems to me that the question of finality to the business of the House is not one for the matter. the discretion of Mr Speaker.",32
135,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,That was the honourable member's former argument.,32
136,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"No ; I have been referbusiness. ring not to the question of finality, but the question of reasonable as against frivolous business being brought before House. The question of when any ' ness brought bef ore the House shall be concluded is for the House itself "" to determine, and I trust that it will never be given by the House to the hands of any one however able he may be.",32
137,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Surely the question what business the House shall conduct also rests with the House itself?,32
138,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The point is arguable, but I do think that the question of whether business that can result in nothing should be brought before the House ought to be left to the discretion of Mr Speaker., He is able to act at once, whereas the House can act only after a long debate. If the business be not frivolous, and if an honourable member be truly aggrieved, it is always open to him to challenge the action of Mr Speaker, and to obtain upon it the verdict of the House. But, if business be purely frivolous, I take it that the power to curb the waste of time resulting from it should lie with Mr Speaker.",32
139,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,It is a reserve power to be exercised subject to the approval of the House.,32
140,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Yes . If it does not lie with Mr Speaker, the House can only exercise it, and arrive at a verdict, after a long and useless debate, and much waste of public time. But so far as the question of finality to business is concerned, where a question is moved in order, and conducted in order, I take it that the House ought to be the only arbiter of such a matter. That being so, while I desire, in this, as in is all other cases, to uphold the Chair as far I can, it seems to me that, in his ruling in that matter, Mr Speaker gave a bad reason for a good action. I do not wish to we take up the time of honourable members furinto ther on that point. I can imagine the indignation of my honourable friend in being as curbed in the middle of a most excellent joke. I realise that it is an excellent joke that can be turned upon any honourable member no matter on what side of the can see no finality House he sits.",32
141,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member must not discuss the merits of,32
142,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I think that some steps should be taken in order to put upon a legal basis the exercise of this power by you, Mr Speaker, in regard to frivolous I do not think it has any existo tence under the Standing Orders, but it is eminently necessary in the public interests the that you should have the power, and I busihope that it will be given to you.",32
143,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Darling Downs) [5.7] I rise, Mr Speaker, to support your over ruling. I think that there must naturally man, be inherent in the Chair some power to deal with the regularity or irregularity of of notices of motion. The honourable member for Capricornia, despite his seriousness today, must admit that when he gave notice of his motion, he thought he was making, as he said, a hit, or doing something clever. It certainly was not seriously intended to be a notice of motion having anything to do with the transaction of public business in this House.",32
144,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,That is where the honourable member begs the whole question.,33
145,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I am not begging any question. I am simply putting before the House my view of this matter. The honourable member for Capricornia himself has said that he looked upon his notice of motion as a clever hit at the Opposition. He was seeking to aim at the Opposition a motion which he never intended to be regarded as part of the public business of this House. It is stated in May, page 243As the notice-paper is published by authority of the House, a notice of a motion or of a question to be put to a member, containing unbecoming expressions, infringing its rules, or otherwise irregular, may, under the Speaker's authority, be corrected by the clerks at the table. These alterations, if it be necessary, are submitted to the Speaker, or to the member who gave the notice. A notice wholly out of order, as, for instance, containing a reflection oo a vote of the House, may be withheld from publication on the notice-paper",33
146,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Unde r what particular phrase does the notice of motion under consideration come?,33
147,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Will the right honourable member allow me to conclude my quotationor, if the irregularity be not extreme, the notice is printed, and reserved for future consideration ; though, in such cases, it is not the duty of the clerks at the table to inform the, member who gave the notice of an informality that it may contain. Then this is the important point:When a notice, publicly given, is obviously irregular or unbecoming; the Speaker bas interposed, and the notice is not received in that for m ; and he has also directed that a notice of motion should not be printed as being obviously designed merely to give annoyance.",33
148,Mr FENTON,Unknown,The notice of motion was allowed to be given.,33
149,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"No . The substantive issue we are discussing is the Speaker's power to prevent the notice being given. We maintain that he has that power, l t is stated furtherI f an objection be raised to a notice of motion upon the notice-paper, the Speaker decides as to its regularity; and, if the objection be sustained, the notice will be amended or withdrawn. The House has also, by order, directed that a notice of motion be taktn off the notice paper. According to this authority, Mr Speaker, if, in your opinion, a notice of motion is obviously unbecoming, you have the power to intervene, and to prevent that being done which is unbecoming to the dignity of the House. Or if you think that a notice of motion is intended only to give annoyance-to "" make a palpable hit,"" even though it is regarded as clever - that is a ground on which you can refuse to accept it.",33
150,Mr FENTON,Unknown,But the notice must be given.,33
151,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"There is something in what the honourable member says, in that the Speaker cannot rule something out of order before he hears it. What was the Speaker's action in this case? The Speaker listened to the honourable member until he reached the third objection or ground, and, knowing the honourable member's attitude in this House",33
152,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,That is a very remarkable attitude !,33
153,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The honourable member did not wait for me to finish my sentence. I was about,to say that the Speaker, from the attitude of the honourable member for Capricornia in the House on that occasion when he rose, and the way in which hegave the notice of motion, was able to gather from what he did hear of the motion that it was unbecoming to submit such a motion to the House. When you see the motion, what - was it ? It was a mock motion of censure, obviously intended to be a travesty upon a motion that had been moved seriously in this House against the Government. The Speaker, as far as he heard it, could gather distinctly from the notice that the honourable member gave that his intention was simply to perpetrate a burlesque upon the ordinary parliamentary procedure.. There is a proper way of attacking a Government on a motion of want of confidence. This was only a burlesque on a want of confidence motion. The honourable member was trying to turn it round and point it at the Opposition in a way that he knew could only be futile. As the honourable member said, he thought it was clever, and possibly it was a clever point to make, but that is not the issue. It was for the Speaker to decide from what he had already heard whether the honourable member was starting on a course which was intended to lower the dignity of the House by^ introducing a practice unbecoming to the proceedings of the House, and by giving notice of a. motion which might in itself be offensive to the House. In the circumstances the Speaker had the right to rule that the notice of motion was out of order, although, of course, this House has always the right afterwards, on proper notice being given, to object to the Speaker's ruling, and override it. So that, ultimately, as the honourable member says, the supreme power does rest with the House. But, for the time being, for the proper and orderly conduct of business, there must be somebody in the House to preside over, and, if necessary, to correct the irregularity of our proceedings. That ]iower we have vested in you, sir, for the time being, as the custodian of the procedure of the House, and I contend that the practice you have adopted, which seems to be in conformity with the quotation I have made from May, was in order, and that you did your duty in declining to accept the notice of motion.",33
154,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"Batman) [5.16] - I desire very briefly, but most cordially, to support the motion of the honourable member for Capricornia. The speeches we have heard from honourable members opposite go to show, if not conclusively, at any rate to some extent^ that the motion is well justified. The right honourable member for Swan, going into the merits, referred to the obvious absurdity of the motion, and the honourable member for Darling Downs, by some psychological power which I do not possess, read the mind of the honourable member for Capricornia, for he was able to say, not only that what the honourable member had said, but also that what he intended to say, was an absurdity. The very fact of honourable members opposite rising in their places, and showing that they have been touched and hurt by the criticism of their policy, constitutes one of the strongest reasons why this House should be no party to "" gagging "" itself. As one who has taken the platform, and hopes to take it again",34
155,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! Will the honourable member confine himself to the motion ?,34
156,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"I am trying very hard to confine myself entirely to the question of the powers of the House, and to urge that the Speaker should not set limits upon the power of the House to debate any question. I do not know if I should be in order in calling attention by way of illustration to some of the speeches made in this Chamber by the honourable member for Wentworth. They are splendid examples of the privileges which members enjoy; and, although some of us have often'lamented what we had to suffer in order to preserve the right of free speech, no one has attempted to encroach upon that inalienable right in this Chamber. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - What about the time limit to speeches?",34
157,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"That is a limitation which the House imposed upon itself in the interests of the expeditious discharge of public business, and is by no means a limitation imposed by the Speaker upon the rights, powers, and privileges of the House. It is a limitation imposed by ourselves upon ourselves, which we can remove or modify at our own free will from time to time. We are told that the motion of the honourable member for Capricornia was obviously absurd and frivolous, and that this could be seen before it was heard. I did not see anything very facetious or wildly ridiculous in the attitude of the honourable member as he gave the notice of motion, and I do not think that honourable members opposite saw the fun of it either. They saw that it was a criticism directed at their policy, and at their attitude towards public business in this House recently. At any rate, on the broad and general principle that the onus lies upon Mr Speaker, and upon those who are assisting him in this matter, to show by reference to authority in what way an honourable member is limited, except by the rule which demands that any motion shall be couched in decent and proper language, I say that we, as guardians of our own privileges, and as representatives of the Australian people, are bound to see that our rights are' not invaded. For these reasons, I am in accord with the motion submitted by the honourable member for Capricornia. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [5.20] - I think that this discussion will do no harm, because it may help to clear the atmosphere and enable honourable members to know where they stand in regard to their rights and privileges with some approximation to exactitude. The members of the Opposition have frequently felt a great deal of resentment at certain decisions which have been given from the Chair, and which seemed to them to encroach unduly upon their rights. Of course, it may be said-and quite correctly - that if the Opposition feel aggrieved they have the right of moving dissent from the Speaker's ruling. But that is an extreme step, which very few honourable members feel inclined to take, and which will not be resorted to unless it is considered that some exceptionally harsh or unjust ruling has been given from the Chair. There is also the obvious disadvantage that very often a motion for dissent from the ruling of Mr Speaker is decided rather on party lines than on the actual merits of the question. The tendency of the House in a case of that kind would naturally be for the majority-that is the Government-to uphold the ruling, especially if it were to the disadvantage of the minority. May I refer, by way of illustration, to a case in which a ruling was given to the effect that members of the Opposition had no right to discuss either a motion or an amendment before the House, but were confined to discussing a blank ? That ruling made discussion absolutely impossible. There was a strong disposition on the part of a number of members of the Opposition to resent the ruling given.",34
158,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order 1 Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON understood that we were dealing with a question of privilege?,35
159,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable memto ber must confine his remarks to the question raised by the motion. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I have contained no desire to go beyond that, but the tion of the privilege of members is the basis of the motion, and I thought that I might be allowed to refer to an incident that occurred as illustrating what may happen when, as a result of a ruling, cussion is rendered a practical impossirity bility. I am glad that the honourable member for Capricornia and the honormay able member for Batman have shown a desire to resist any encroachments upon rights and privileges of honourable membersthe I have more than once expressed my view that we should not permit any such croachment, except upon very extreme vocation, and should even then be extremely chary about doing so. I have already said that the Opposition have sometimes felt clined to take exception to the rulings given from the Chair. We have not had reraised. course to the method of moving dissent - from' a ruling, because we have felt that would be futile to do so. There were also other reasons-perhap s personal regard for ness or the finality of discussion. Mr Speaker himself, as well as a natural disinclination to call his authority in question. Consequently, we have sometimes put up with what we deemed to be an injustice and an infringement of our rights rather than take the step' permitted by the Standing Orders. But when the honourable member for Batman talks about resenting encroachments upon the right of free speech, I should like to ask him how long he has been of that opinion? It is not long since he voted for a limitation upon the speeches of honourable members. In that way, certainly, an encroachment was made upon the rigbt of free speech. It may be that the honourable member would reply that the House itself imposed a limitation upon its own powers. But that is not quite the correct view, because what happened was that the majority who did not want its measures examined and criticised imposed its will upon the minority. I cannot help thinking it is a pitv that we in this House have not yet' a proper set of Standing Orders. We have not yet had an opportunity of deciding for ourselves what shall be the rules of the House. We are still - I working under temporary Standing Orders, and much has to be left to the discretion of Mr Speaker. Where the Standing Orders do not make specific provision, resort has be had, as far as possible, to rules laid down in May's Parliamentary Practice. I have not always been able to reconcile rules in May with some of the conflictquesing rulings that have been given here, nor to reconcile rulings on the same point given from the Chair in this House. As to who should be the authority on matters of order, I take it that, unquestionably, dis Mr Speaker should be. He is the authowho is called upon at the moment to give a ruling on any question of order that be raised, but, of course, the House itself never parts with its own power, and the can always decide for itself in respect to decisions of Mr Speaker. The House itself is the final authority. I agree with enthe honourable member for Wentworth in prowhat he said concerning the statement of Mr Speaker, that if a motion like that of the honourable member for Capricornia were inpermitted to be submitted, there would be no finality to the discussions that would be I do not know of any practice recorded in May, or any rule in our Standit ing Orders, which gives authority to Mr. Speaker to determine the conduct of busiThe persons ultimately responsible for the conduct of the business of the House cide that. are the Government of the day, and any one, whether he be a member of in the Opposition or Mr Speaker himself, who takes the conduct of business out the hands of the Government practically carries a motion of censure upon them. that case, it is for the Government to in their resignations to His Excellency Governor General. It is not for Mr.them, Speaker, but for the Government, to deterthey mine upon the conduct and duration business in this House. It is not for Speaker to determine upon the matter finality in any discussion. The House has already decided upon that matter by the the Speakerinclusion in the Standing Orders of what is known as the "" gag "" and by the limishould tation of the duration of speeches.",35
160,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"What is the "" g a g "" ? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON- I Darling should be sorry to offend the susceptibilities of the Prime Minister, but I thought was the one honourable member in this House who, more than any other, would be particularly acquainted with that term, seeing that he took such an active making the "" gag "" part of our Standing Orders.",36
161,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Seeing that he was subI jected to the "" gag "" so unfairly. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - That is a matter of opinion. I say again that I regret that the House has not yet had opportunity of dealing with the Standing Orders. This Parliament has been in existence over eleven years, and we are working under temporary Standing Ordersable I think it would be a good thing, even this session, seeing that the business is ceeding so rapidly, if the Government would afford an opportunity for a review of the Standing Orders, and let the House decide upon what procedure is to govern actions.",36
162,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Capricornia) [5.31] - Th honourable member for Darling Downs ber quoted May to show that the Speaker of porting the Chair? the House of Commons had the power to interfere with motions. He read this sageWhen a notice, publicly given, is obviously irregular or unbecoming, the Speaker has posed and the notice is not received in that form. Was there anything irregular or unbecoming ing about the words of the notice of motion which I proposed to read?",36
163,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,Mr Speaker has to de,36
164,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"But if Mr Speaker was the position to decide whether the notice was obviously irregular or unbecoming, was of he right in ruling it out of order? I am not at all surprised that the members of In the Opposition think that the notice was hand obviously irregular and unbecoming. It the was a motion attacking them-gibin g at as it has been put. No wonder that support the view that it was obviously of unbecoming to say anything about the Mr Opposition. They should be allowed, apof parently, to take up the time to an unlimited extent. May also points out that has also directed that a notice of motion not be printed as being obviously designed merely to give annoyance. Why did not the honourable member for Downs mention the footnote to thispage of May, and quote the case where thehe Speaker of the House of Commons decided not to allow a notice of motion toappear on the business-paper because it was obviously intended to cause annoyance ?part in The footnote reads as followsNotice of a return of the conviction of Mr.. King-Harman for an assault, 21st February,. 1880. f I desired to draw attention by calling for a return showing where a member of the House, if there was such a member,, had been guilty of an assault outside, anyan body would be able to say that my motionwas designed merely to cause annoyance to that particular member in his privatestill capacity. I was not dealing with honormembers opposite in their private capain city. I was dealing with them on thenpropublic actions and public speeches. While I am indebted to the Prime Minister for the support which he gives to my motionby saying that he considers that Mr. its Speaker was wrong in not allowing me toread the notice of motion e Mr KELLY - Does the honourable memsay that the Prime Minister is not sup",36
165,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"The Prime Minister said pashe thought that Mr Speaker made a mistake in not allowing me to read the noticeof motion. I dare say that if Mr Speaker interhad allowed me to do that, we could have got over the difficulty in some other way. But it seemed to me that Mr Speaker, havintervened to prevent me from reading the notice, in order to avoid admitting a mistake, had to rule the whole thing out of order. That is the point. The honourable member for Wentworth said that Mr. Speaker ought to be invested with some authority to prevent honourable members from moving motions of a frivolous character and taking up the time of the House. He also said that Mr Speaker - ought to have it in his power to decide whether he would admit motions which could not lead to anything. The Leader - of the Opposition submitted a motion which could not lead to anything, except something to which I shall refer afterwards. That motion occupied the time of this House for no less than twenty-eight days. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - And it was time very well spent.",36
166,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Why was it well spent? The ordinary practice, sir, as you will mit, if it be desired to censure a Government, is to give notice of a motion that Government no longer possesses the confidence of this House. That is all that was; in any of the motions which have ever had any business in them. That is the simple form which they have taken. In my opinion, the Leader of the Opposition had in his mind the same thing as I had in my mind when he submitted his motion. When he thought that the House had no longer any confidence in the Ministry, what did he do? He prepared a placard, a long list of charges",37
167,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member is now going beyond his motion.,37
168,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,I am not discussing whether the charges of the Leader of the - Opposition were right or not-whethe r the Government were guilty of grossly partisan appointments or not. I am only discussing the terms of his motion to show the House that what he was aiming at I was aiming at. He was desirous of putting this party before the country and holding them up to ridicule and contempt. I was desirous of doing the same thing in regard to honourable members opposite.,37
169,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,And you would have - had an easier job.,37
170,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I believe I would. It is unfortunate for me that this question 'has to be decided on the notice of motion which I gave concerning the Opposition. Apparently, honourable members on the - other side are not able to dissociate themselves from the party. I have no feeling in this matter. I sincerely hope that the House will protect the privileges, the powers, and the immunities of individual members. This nation of ours is going to grow into a mighty nation. The parties that are here now will be a mere circumstance to the parties that' will arise in Australia when it has twenty, or thirty, or forty millions of people. We shall have large parties here without a doubt. There may be men, representing only a very small section of the community, and holding very much more advanced ideas than we do; they may come forward with proposals which other members may consider are of a frivolous or objectionable character. If the House gives this power to Mr Speaker, he may be influenced, perhaps, by the fact that he has a large party to support him, because the tendenby of parties is to supad- port the Chair always. Mr Speaker may, on account of having the support of the the majority, be inclined to do a wrong thing to an individual member. In my opinion, there no loss of dignity to the House or l s to Mr Speaker in permitting an individual member to give notice of any motion he likes to introduce, provided that it is couched in ordinary parliamentary language I hope that honourable members will decide this question, not on a partu basis but on the grounds which I have stated.",37
171,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I should like to say a few words before the question is put. Ihe motion moved by the honourable member tor Capricornia this afternoon"" has relation to action taken by me last week when the honourable member was reading a notice of motion. I intervened when the honourable member had read about half of his notice of motion, and thereupon he deliberately turned his back upon me, and refused to obey my call to order, thus committing one of the greatest offences that a member can commit. That matter, however, has been dealt with. As to whether the honourable member was in order m giving the notice of motion which he was reading, I wish to say, first, that my intervention was due solely to a desire to guard the privileges of honourable members, and I have been pleased to hear those who have spoken in favour of the motion now under discussion say that they did not support it because of. any personal feeling in regard to me. I appreciate the consideration that prompted that assurance. Â»hn t S ^ 1 ? f 6 V e r V h o n o r a Â° - e member who thinks that a ruling from the Chair is not in accordance with the Standing Orders, nor likely to conduce to the per conduct of debate, to take an oppormember. tunity to have it discussed, so that the point at issue may be settled definitely the House itself. ' Questions of relevancy, however, are entirely for the Speaker determine, even though nine times out ten he might be wrong. The determination of such questions by the House would be impracticable. It'must be remembered, moreover, that any one making a speech has many ways of evading a ruling gard to relevancy-I may have been guilty myself of doing so in the past-but it the duty of the presiding officer to .see the Standing Order on the subject _ obeyed. The point involved in my action of last week is not dealt with by any standing order, nor has it arisen in practice of the House of Commons, nor of the Parliament of any other Englishstanding speaking community, so that it was left for me to deal with it by the application of common sense. The House is now asked to say whether in its opinion J right or wrong. In my view, were I to permit of notice being given of a motion the character of that which the honourable member for Capricornia wished to place on the business-paper, it would be imment possible for me to prevent notice being given of a similar motion next day, and subsequent sittings, until there would' so many notices of motion of the kind the business-paper that the ordinary notices of motion would be lost sight of. Standing Orders being silent on the ject, and there being no precedent in May, Bourinot, or other parliamentary authoriconduct ties, it was my duty to decide the question as I thought proper. Every Speaker and every Chairman of Committees must from time to time give such a ruling on his own responsibility. Had a member the Opposition risen in his place, and asked if the motion were in order, I should have had to give a ruling on the point, and the position then created would have been similar to that which came about the result of my independent intervention. I saw clearly that if I allowed the notice of motion to be read, I could not prevent another honourable member from reading similar notice of motion, censuring, haps, some member of the House other than the Leader of the Opposition. It is immaterial that the notice of motion was levelled against the Leader of the Opposition; I should have taken the same - ourse had it been levelled Mr Sfeaker. proGovernment, a Minister, or any individual When the Leader ""of the Opposition gives notice of a motion of censure by he takes an action very different from that which the honourable member for Caprito cornia wished to take, because if his of motion is carried the Government, as a consequence, must leave office. Tfie carrying of a motion like that of the honourable member for Capricornia would have no such effect. Indeed, the carrying of the in remotion of the honourable member for Capricornia would have had no effect what is ever. Therefore, there is no similarity that between his motion and that of an ordiis nary motion of censure. Were I to prevent the Leader of the Opposition from giving notice of a motion of censure I the should exceed my powers. ,In this connection I would remind the House of the order which says that an. honourable member may not put questions to other honourable members who are not Ministers, except as to business of which they did have charge. The reason for this standing order is that were one honourable memof ber allowed to put questions of a personal or controversial nature to any other honourable member, the time of Parliamight be entirely taken up with such questions. There is a connection between on that rule and the action which I took last, be week, but I do not lay stress upon it. on What honourable members have now to consider is what is the best rule to follow in The this matter for the proper conduct of our subproceedings. I think that my action was the right one in the interest of the orderlyof debate, but, of course, I am in the hands of the House, and must do what it orders. It is true, as the honourable member for Capricornia has pointed out, that we are guided not only by the of Standing Orders, but also by precedent and custom, and that when I give af ruling, establishing a new precedent, the House is at liberty to dissent from it, in which case. I must follow another course. It is no as reflection upon me should the House in its wisdom desire me to alter my ruling; I am not so egotistical as to think that my individual wisdom is greater than the a collective wisdom of honourable members. perBut in this case I warn the House that should the motion of the honourable member for Capricornia be carried, I shall be compelled to permit every honourable member who desires to do so to place on the notice-paper motions similar to that which, against the he desired to' read.",37
172,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"At the commencement of the debate, Mr Speaker, you said that the honourable member was infringing one of the Standing Orders, the number of which I forget, and that he should have given notice of dissent from your ruling at once in writing, when the debate would have taken place on the following day. Are we to understand that, having allowed the debate to take place so long after the period mentioned, we are establishing a precedent ?",39
173,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"When the honourable member for Capricornia brought up the question of my previous ruling he saw that he was not in order in following the course he proposed, and to put himself in order he read the motion he intended to move, so that the matter might be before the House. In such case the honourable member should have given notice in writing, and the debate would have taken place"" tomorrow; but I desired, and the honourable member concurred-and , I understand, the House assented to that courseto allow the debate to proceed at once.

They will see that we are asking for an amount which it is expected will carry us on until the passing of the Appropriation Bill . If the House passes the three months' Supply asked for, we shall be able to avoid the necessity of coming down month by month to ask for Supply. The proposal is quite in accordance with precedent when we have got well on with the business of the session. It will be an advantage to have arranged for this Supply until the Estimates for the current year have been considered. The Bill is based on last year's Estimates, and! provision is made for a Treasurer's Advance to cover exceptional circumstances.",40
184,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Swan) [6.9] I regret the absence, through indisposition, of the Leader of the Opposition. I hope that the honourable gentleman will soon be his place again. We have to avail ourselves of this Supply motion to speak generally in regard' to matters we consider of portance which it would not have been nesome cessary to refer to on this occasion if vate members' business had not been will, superseded. I am sure that the Leader of the House will recognise that we are entitled to take advantage of this opporpayment tunity to discuss, not merely matters into cluded in the Bill, but other matters which we consider of public importance. asking for Supply to be granted for three months, I think that the Government asking for more than is warranted, under the circumstances. Of course, the Treaorable surer always finds it convenient to obtain ordered ? Supply for as long' a time as possible, but it must be remembered that the Opposition naturally desire the House to retain control of the finances. There is no reason why Australia. the Government should ask for a grant of three months' Supply, seeing that, when they were in Opposition, they always jected to granting Supply for a longer period than one month. I recollect that ference the Treasurer, on one occasion, when the Government of which I was Treasurer asked the House to authorize the grant of two months' Supply, characterized the request as an extraordinary, if not an unpreceGovernment. dented one. I think the Prime Minister will recognise that, if Supply be granted for three months, he will deprive honour the able members of some of their opportunities for criticism.",41
185,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"We are providing an opportunity for the Opposition to appeal the country, if they get a chance.",41
186,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I do not think we have much chance of going to the try for a little while yet. I wish now touch upon a few questions of public portance. The first has reference to the extraordinary delay which is occurring the work of constructing the Kalgoorlie Port Augusta railway. I have no desire to be captious-in fact, I wish to the Government all I can in pushing ward that great undertaking. But, seeing that the Bill authorizing the construction of the line was passed nearly a year it does seem strange that no provision has yet lieen made for the delivery of rails or sleepers on the ground. At Kalgoorlie,. no work is being done, apart from that, which is being accomplished by a few surveyors. I venture to say that there are not more than twenty men employed there. We in have not yet been told whether the railshave been even ordered. Certainly, there arenone upon the water. I believe that animarrangement is in progress under which locally-rolled rails will be obtained at priLithgow - and, although the prices which, have to be paid for them will probably be greater than those at which we could purchase them elsewhere, the additional' of what will practically amount a bonus upon their local production will be amply justified. My complaint is that In the Government are not making sufficient progress. There are no sleepers, no rails., are and no plant upon the ground. Mr W. J. JOHNSON - Has not the honmember heard of any sleepers being:",41
187,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"There are nosleepers on the ground, although there area good many hewers of sleepers in Western' The Government have giventhemselves an immense amount of troubleobby endeavouring to carry out this work, themselves. There is not very much difbetween day labour and contract labour, because, after all, the contractorhas to employ day labour. My chief objection to the day-labour system is that it throws too much detailed work upon theI undertook great public works in Western Australia by day labour, notably the Fremantle harbour works and' Coolgardie water works, so that I have had experience of the day-labour system on> works that can easily be supervised. I believe that great delay will result from the Government endeavouring to do all this work themselves instead of to distributing it under a system which would relieve them of attention to details. Then a most extraordinary decision hascounbeen arrived at in regard to the use of to karri timber. I hope that the powellizing imsystem will prove eminently successful; but I fail to see the wisdom of preferring karri in sleepers to jarrah for this important underto taking. In saying this, I am advocatingalso the interests of the manual labourersassist - of the men who hew these sleepers. forIn Western Australia there is a powerful association known as the Hewers'"" Association- a co-operative enterpriseago, which supplies these sleepers - My"" desire is to obtain the best wood suitable for the purpose at the cheapest possible price. In advocating the use of jarrah in preference to karri, I am acting in the interests of the stability of the work, and also in the interests of the sleeper hewers of Western Australia, many of whom are to be found in my own constituency. I have no hesitation in saying that jarrah sleepers can be supplied as cheaply, if not more cheaply, than can karri. They have a more solidly established reputation Mr W. J. JOHNSON - Hav e the Government ordered some sleepers?",41
188,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"They say that they have. I read the other day a statement by the Premier of Western Australia that his Government had sold to'the Commonwealth 1,500,000 sleepers. When I asked the Minister of Home Affairs a question in regard to that statement, he informed me that he would give me the information in a few days. Mr W. J. JOHNSON - He told the honourable member the same thing as appeared in the press.",42
189,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Then we ought to see the contract.,42
190,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The honourable member may see it.,42
191,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"In preferring karri to jarrah we are taking an unnecessary risk. We know very well that jarrah untreated is vastly superior to karri untreated. If powellized karri is better than unpowellized, then jarrah, if powellized, would be very much better than powellized karri. The only reason' I can give for this action on the part of the Government is that it is anxious to assist the Labour party in Western Australia to establish State sawmills. It seems to me that there must be some idea of the kind in view, but I fail to see how it can be of any advantage to the country. I desire now to refer to a matter to which reference has already been made this afternoon, and which has become a question of public importance. I refer to the position in regard to the Governor General's residence in Sydney. A good many questions have been asked, and there has been a good deal of discussion in the press in regard to it ; but it is to be regretted that the difficulty ever arose, as it ought to have been very easy for the Government to have satisfactorily arranged the matter. I fail to see why it should have been left to the Governor General to say that he was advised before he came here, and also by Ministers after his arrival, that, when in Sydney, he should try to effect an amicable arrangement with the State Government in regard to the matter. It is not a matter on which the Governor General should have been called upon to intervene, save to inform the Prime Minister of his desires in regard to his public duties or personal comfort.",42
192,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Seeing that I have already answered a question dealing with the matter I do not think that it should now be discussed.,42
193,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I propose to discuss it solely as it affects the Government, as I hold that the right honourable member's Government are wholly to blame in this matter. Instead of shielding the Governor General, as they are bound to do, they have humiliated him. What right have we to expect the State of New South Wales to provide free of rent a residence for the Governor General? Do we provide the State Governments with any service free of charge ? I do not know that we do. I do know, however, that we impose duty on goods imported by the States-upo n the very rails imported by them for the development of the Commonwealth. There is a case in point in my own State. The Government of Western Aus-' tralia will have to expend nearly a million in order to continue the Trans-Australian railway on a 4 f t . 8J-in. gauge from Kalgoorlie to Fremantle, and will have to pay an enormous sum by way of duty on the rails required for what is really a great national work-the work of connecting Western Australia with Eastern Australia by means of a broad gauge railway. Then, again, we charge the State Governments postage on all their postal matter, and for their telegraphs and telephones. It seems to me that the time has arrived when the Commonwealth Government and the Governments of the States, working in the closest amity, should pay each other for services rendered. I fail to understand why the Commonwealth Government should refuse to pay rental for the use of Government House, Sydney, if they really desire the Governor General to have a residence in that city. It looks very much as if "" the Caucus "" did not desire the Governor General to retain a residence there. If they were at all anxious in the matter, do honourable members think that they would not be prepared to pay .Â£3,500 per annum for' the use of the State Government House ?",42
194,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Did the Government of which the right honourable member was a member pay any rent for that building?,43
195,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"We were never asked to do so. Had a request been made, I should have advised the Cabinet not only to pay rent for that residence, but to pay for every service rendered by the States. The only safe plan on which good undervernment, standings can be arrived at and maintained Capital. is for the Commonwealth Government and the State Governments to pay for services rendered by the one to the other.",43
196,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,Does not the right honourable member think that the New South Wales Government is a good deal fault in this matter?,43
197,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I am not provide aware of any fault which attaches in connection with their demand that rent should be paid for the use of Government House. We have taken away from the ing free of rent. States a good deal of their revenue that they formerly obtained. Instead of payference ing the States Â£ 2 ios. per head of their population as we used to do up to 1910 we are now paying them only 25s. per head of population.,43

199,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,The right rental. honourable member's Government.,43
200,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Whose agreement was it that provided for a payment of 25s. a services rendered."" head?",43
201,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The agreement that we proposed was not at all in accord with the arrangement made by the right honourable member. Under the present rangement the States have been imwhich poverished, while the Commonwealth has made today. been placed in an affluent position. During the last three years, owing to the alteration, consequent on the termination the Braddon section, the Commonwealth has received Â£14,000,000 which would, if the alteration had not been made, have gone to the States. It seems to me to the height of meanness for the Commontravelling wealth Government to try to make excuses for not paying a rental of Â£3,500 for such a magnificent residence as is the State Government House, Sydney. The ment to rebellion. only inference I can draw from the attiture of the Commonwealth Government, or rather "" the Caucus "" that controls is that they do not wish the Governorto General to remain in Sydney. If they did. they would have at once agreed to pay the moderate rental asked for the residence. If the Government of Victoria demand a rental for the use of Parliament House and for the occupation of Government House by the Governor General, will the Commonwealth Government take up the same attitude, and refuse to pay any rental?",43
202,Mr WISE,Unknown,"The difference is that Melbourne is, and will be, the Seat of Gountil we go to the Federal",43
203,Mr FISHER,Unknown,And there is the further difference that the Victorian State Government have not asked for any rental.,43
204,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The honourable member for Gippsland surely does not wish at to argue that, because Melbourne is the Seat of Government, the State should the Federal Parliament with a Parto them liament House free of rent?",43
205,Mr WISE,Unknown,No ; because the State was good enough to offer the use of this build,43
206,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The only into be drawn from the honourable member's interjection is that, because Melbourne is the Seat of Government, the State is bound to provide us with a Parliament House and the Governor General a residence free of charge. If I were Premier of the State, I should demand a I should say to the Commonwealth, "" You must pay me for all services, rendered, as you expect my Government to pay for postage, Customs duty, and all",43
207,Mr WISE,Unknown,"The right honourable member never offered to pay for these buildings all the years that he was in office, although his arGovernment was making the charges to he refers, just as they are being",43
208,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"We did not go about looking for demands. If the State of Government had made a demand for pay-' ment, I should have advised their being paid. As a matter of fact, whilst we were in office, we paid to the States many thoube sands of pounds for the Governor General's expenses by rail, covering a period of several years, and payment is a year being made at the present time.",43
209,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,This is a public incite,43
210,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"It is an incitement to the Government to do their duty ; it, to pay what they ought fo pay, and not expect the States, whose revenues have been depleted by ,Â£14,000,000 during the last three years to give us, free of rent, a residence for the Governor General or the use of any public building. If there is any one to blame for the situation that has arisen in this regard, it is the Government themselves. I repeat that the only infer-ence I can draw is that ""the Caucus"" - does not wish the Governor General to have a residence in Sydney. The New South Wales Government are only acting reasonably in demanding a moderate rental for the use of Government House by the Governor General, and are justified in asking the Commonwealth to pay for any service rendered by them.",43
211,Unknown,Unknown,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m.,44
212,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Darling Downs) [8.0] I am sorry the Prime Minister has found it necessary to make a demand for practically three months' Supply.,44
213,Mr FISHER,Unknown,It is the usual thing.,44
214,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"It is not. The usual period has been two months. It means ihat for three months we are practically putting it out of the power of the House to have redress of any grievances. That is an unprecedented demand to make of any House, especially when it is remembered that the House is now practically having a continuous sitting from 3 o'clock <Â»n Tuesday afternoon until 4 o'clock on Friday afternoon without a break of any description, except a little for sleep. An - unfortunate delay is taking place in putting before the House the land policy for the development of the Northern Territory. That is one of the most pressing matters with which we can deal. The land policy which was developed previously was put before the House and fully discussed, and now is put aside. There are only about ten weeks of time during which the House can sit this session, yet we have no indication - of any land policy being likely to be placed before us. This is unfortunate also because we see, from a statement made by the Minister this afternoon, that for the time being it is necessary to hang up the whole policy of land settlement in the Territory, and applications cannot be dealt with. The granting of leases has of necessity had to be suspended, because had leases been granted contractual rights would have been conferred which we should have had to recognise. I realise that it something ! - was essential to suspend the policy for the time being, but there has been a long lay in getting going again. It means the regulations have to be reframed and be sent out before people will be able to take advantage, of them, and a delay of several months must take place in land settlement.",44
215,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,There is not a delay of a day. After the lands are surveyed we have to advertise them.,44
216,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"First, regulations must be made, so that people may know the rights they are going to obtain in the Territory. The whole of that time has been lost, but I hope the Minister will realise the position in which he is putting the Territory, and press matters forward in order to get the land policy of the Government before the House as soon as possible. There is another unsatisfactory feature in connection with the administration of the Territory. About March last the Minister announced that it was his policy to appoint a number of experts to iriquire into the question of the railway policy for that part of Australia. The matter came before the House again the other day"", and again the same policy was promised. Yet here we are in October, without even an announcement having been made as to who are to constitute the Commission. All this valuable time is being lost to the development of the Territory. We are continuing to run it under its heavy obligations, with a large staff of officials, who, by virtue of the delay in its development and settlement, are not being given the opportunity of working to their fullest capacity.",44
217,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Are they not? Ask them whether they are working to their full capacity.,44
218,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"They cannot possibly have had opportunities for doing so. We hear of a State school inspector about to be appointed at a salary of Â£500 or Â£600 a year, for a few schools. How is it possible to say that men in such positions will be working to their fullest capacity? I urge the Minister not to delay any longer, but to press forward the Commission, and as soon as possible to let us have some developmental policy for the whole of the Northern Territory. I hope he will understand that I am not raising these points in a spirit of mere captious criticism.",44
219,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Oh , no; you must say",44
220,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"When the Minister gives deus such an opportunity to say something, that we should be guilty of a breach of duty if we did not bring these matters under notice. Although we are sitting in Opposition, we are not without our duty to the country. We have still this large Territory in our possession, and we have not had evidence from the Government of any strong forward policy for its development. It is a fair thing for the Minister to indicate why these two great matters of land settlement, and the appointment of a Royal Commission to push this forward policy along, have been so much delayed. We must all admit that, without a railway policy, we cannot expect those regions towards the interior, that are capable of carrying large quantities of stock, to be properly settled, or worked to their full extent. The announcement of the Prime Minister this afternoon must cause a good deal of disappointment to the sugar growers. When asked as to the Government's policy, with regard to the sugar industry, the Prime Minister mentioned the desirableness of having the Constitution altered so that the Industrial Court might have power to fix other matters than the question of wages. I take that to mean the power to fix the price of cane or other commodities.",44
221,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Any question submitted to it between two parties in the deal.,45
222,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Any matter in dispute, as regards, for instance, the fair price lo be paid by the sugar mill to the grower?",45
223,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Certainly , and the sugar growers are in favour of that.",45
224,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The Prime Minister, and those associated with him, did not wait until a tribunal could be endowed with all powers to deal with these questions. The trouble at the present time is that one factor of the sugai problem was disturbed without any effort being made to adjust the equities of the other factors.",45
225,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The only thing we had power to deal with we have dealt with.,45
226,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The Prime Minister is wrong. The Government have power to do two things, without any alteration to the Constitution, in order to meet the case of the sugar-growers. They have power to equalize the bounty and Excise, and they have power to abolish the bounty and Excise. Either of these things could have been done under the existing powers.",45
227,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,There is not much protection in that suggestion !,45
228,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"It is what the sugarfollowed growers themselves are asking for. All the Government have done up to the preI sent has been to increase the cost of duction to the grower, and give him no possibility of getting an increased price for the article that he produces.",45
229,Mr RILEY,Unknown,The retail price of sugaF to the public has been very much increased.:,45
230,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I am dealing, not with the retailing of sugar, but with the cane grown by the grower. I aro not discussing the fairness or unfairness of the wages. But there are several factors to consider in connection with the sugar problem. There is first the grower, without whom the industry could not be carried on. Secondly, there is the worker, who is also necessary. Then you must have the sugar miller, the refiner, and, last of all, the consumer. The interests of all those five factors must be considered. At present, we are dealing with one factor, the worker. His remuneration has been increased, and the grower has no possibility of improving his position.",45
231,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,He had twelvemonths'' notice.,45
232,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"How can twelve months' notice enable a man who gets only a certain price for his cane to improve his position, when you increase the wages which he has to pay? The cost of production has been increased, and if there are any means by which you can give some compensation to the grower, they should be adopted. The Prime Minister need not wait for an alteration of the Constitution to do this. I should not like to take it from what the right honourable gentleman said today that he has made a final .pronouncement of policy for this Parliament.",45
233,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Is the honourable member objecting to the wages?,45
234,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The Prime Minister has evidently not been listening to the debate. Apparently, he takes so little interest in the sugar industry that he does not pay attention to what is said; because that remark is absolutely unfair. The Prime Minister is usually fair, and if he had listened, he would have heard me say twice that I am not objecting to the wages.",45
235,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The honourable member does not understand the position himself, and he thinks that every one else is in the same position.",45
236,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I am sorry that the Prime Minister should descend to misrepresentations. It is a pity that he has not the debate sufficiently to pay the usual courtesies to those taking part in it. am sorry to say this, because the Prime proMinister and myself have hitherto always been able to carry on discussions without personalities. I hope this remark will close the incident as far as we are concerned.",45
237,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,What does the honourable member suggest?,46
238,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The honourable member for Capricornia sent a telegram to the President of the Chamber of Commerce, Bundaberg, as followsAm by no means certain that abolition of Excise and bounty will improve the growers' position; but if the sugar-growers of Bundaberg and district in public meeting unanimously carry a resolution in favour of the abolition of the Excise and bounty, and the Queensland Parliament passes legislation prohibiting alien labour in the sugar industry, I will support the abolition of the Excise and bounty. Apologising for delay. It is only fair at this stage to remember that the Premier of Queensland wrote the following letter to the Prime MinisterChief Secretary's Office, Brisbane, 5th September, rgi2. SIR,- I have the honour to inform you that my colleague, the Treasurer, on his return to Brisbane, communicated to me (i) your expressed opinion that it would make for the welfare of the sugar industry if both Excise and foounty were abolished, (2) that you would do your best to influence your colleagues to take the same view; and, if successful, would, next session, introduce Bills for the repeal of so much of the Excise and bounty sections as applied to the sugar industry. While thanking you for this attitude on the question, I must say .1 was not unprepared for the information, as I was aware you had on former occasions expressed yourself similarly thereon. co-operation I can give you in the matter will be cheerfully rendered, for I am f u l ly satisfied that along such lines as you suggest lies the only solution of the difficulties which have to be met. I hope, therefore, you will be able to prevail on your colleagues to take action in the direction mentioned, and to take it during the current session of Parliament, for delaying it until next year would entail very serious consequences on the industry, and, among other evils, the intensifying of the present feeling of uncertainty and unrest in those connected with it. If you can give me your assurance on this point J shall undertake to introduce legislation prohibiting Asiatic aliens from engaging or working in the industry, and compensating, such aliens as may be bond fide owners or leaseholders of land now under sugar-cane. people of Australia desire the sugar industry to be a white-labour one, and I gladly give my support to any arrangement which will insure the realization of that desire. It is also their wish that this industry should pay the white labourer the highest wage consistent with its prosperity, and the better to achieve that end, I shall so enlarge the Industrial Peace Bill as to bring sugar-workers (both field and mill hands) under Industrial Boards. I think that will be the most effective means of protecting their interests. I am informed that you have expressed some doubt as to whether the cane-grower would reap any benefit under the altered conditions. On this point, Mr White, M . L . A . , assures me he raised the matter at a meeting of the Sugar Manufacturers' Association, held in Bundaberg on the 2nd September, when it was resolved that, in the event of the Excise and bounty being abolished, the millers will pay the growers of cane 8s. 8d. per ton in place of the 6s. 6d. now paid by the Customs. The Treasurer will also give the growers the full benefit of the difference between Excise and bounty. You are aware of the intention of the Government to erect mills undei the Sugar Works Act i g n , three of which have been approved, and will involve a total expenditure of ^350,000. Other mills are likely to be pressed upon our attention, but I fear that, in the present unsettled state of the sugar industry, the House will not vote the necessary funds. I have been favoured by an authority, whose opinion may be implicity relied on, with the following reasons for the abolition of the sugar Excise and bounty :1. That no other primary industry pays Excise. 2. That the abolition of the Excise and bounty will place the sugar industry on the same footing as other protected industries in the Commonwealth. 3. That the reason for the Excise on sugar does not now exist, as only about 4 per cent, of last year's crop was grown by coloured labour. 4. Tbat the abolition of the Excise and bounty wil l not increase the price of sugar to the consumer. 5. That the abolition of Excise and bounty will create a feeling of security in the sugar industry which does not exist at the present time, and will insure its vigorous development, Whatever whereas the prevalent uncertainty is causing farmers rather to restrict than extend their operations. 6. That as regards other Australian industries, our foreign rivals are manufacturers of goods produced by white labour, but the sugar industry has to compete with the sugar grown and manufactured by cheap coloured labour in other parts of the world. 7. That nearly all the growers throughout the State have dismissed their employees, other than those engaged in harvesting the present crop, and as the time for spring planting is at hand immediate action must be taken if the industry is to be saved from extinction. The I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, D. DENHAM. It is clear that the Premier of Queensland is quite willing to take the action suggested. I may add that the Industrial Peace Bill has been amended on the motion of Colonel Rankin to provide for the creation of the Boards suggested in the letter. The Premier of Queensland is quite willing ...uii! to insert the prohibition although it is considered that, as a matter of constitutional right, the Commonwealth has power, under section 51 of the Constitution, to pass laws dealing with alien races. That is the offer that was distinctly made to the Prime Minister, and I am sorry that, so far, no reply has been sent to it .",46
239,Mr FISHER,Unknown,It is not an of f e r communication; perfectly bona fide.,47
240,Mr GROOM,Unknown,I understand that no liament reply has yet been sent.,47
241,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Does the honourable member mean that the letter has not been acknowledged ?,47
242,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"It may have been knowledged, but no communication has been made as to the policy to be pursued.",47
243,Mr FISHER,Unknown,This Parliament will be the first to be informed of that.,47
244,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,The next move should be made from Brisbane.,47
245,Mr GROOM,Unknown,No ; the Prime Minister says that this Parliament will first be notified.,47
246,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,Why does not Queensland Government do what is suggested ?,47
247,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The Queensland Parliament has carried out the first part of the undertaking, and is willing to pass a prohibition in regard to the employment of coloured labour. But it is quite proper to ask whether the Commonwealth Parliament intends to take action. Surely that is a fair inquiry to address to the Prime Minister, seeing that the power of legislating in connection with the sugar industry rests with this Parliament.",47
248,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,Is the industry of no interest to the Queensland Government?,47
249,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Of course it is, and it is equally of interest to this Parliament. Is it of no interest to the Commonwealth Government? Surely the honourable member sees that there are mutual obligations resting upon both the State and the Commonwealth.",47
250,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,The time of this Parliament is always being taken up with trivial State affairs.,47
251,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Does the honourable member consider the sugar industry of Queensland, which employs thousands of people, a trivial affair? Any Australian industry, whether it be located in Victoria or in Queensland, is dear to me. I do not suggested, think that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports intended his remark to apply to the sugar industry.",47
252,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,I was referring to the present aspect of it .,47
253,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"It is a fair thing for us to ask those intrusted with power what action they propose to take. The honor, it is a able member for Capricornia evidently realized that it was the duty of this Parto take action, otherwise he - would not have received the communication I am about to read from his constituents. I applaud him for the interest which he showed in this matter. He received the following letter from the Secretary to the acBundaberg Chamber of CommerceI am directed by the president (Mr E. T . Amos) to acknowledge your wire of the 18th inst. reading as per copy enclosed. Arrangements were immediately made to hold a public meeting this afternoon, and which is just over, and I was desired to send you a copy of a motion and amendment which were brought forward, which I now have much pleasure in doing. The motion reads as follows :"" That this meeting is of the opinion that it is urgent for the preservation of the the sugar industry to Australia that the Excise and bounty be abolished at the earliest possible date."" The amendment:"" That this meeting is of opinion that the bounty and Excise should be equalized, and that 8s. 8d. should be given back to the grower instead of the 6s. 6d."" On the latter being put to the meeting, at which there were over eighty present, only seventeen voted in favour. The original motion was then put, for which fifty-three voted; it therefore was carried by a very large majority. I am also to mention that, in addition to those present, a written document was handed in at the meeting, signed by fourteen canegrowers in the Yandaran district, and who were unable to attend the meeting, signifying their desire to see the Excise and bounty abolished. The meeting was hurriedly called, as it was desired to reply to your telegram as soon as possible, and many of the growers who live at a distance from Bundaberg, and who only get their mails two or three times a week, could not be communicated with, otherwise we are sure the attendance would have been much larger; and we venture to say the majority in favour of the abolition of the Excise and bounty would have been considerably greater. I should like to point out that in a large meeting of any description it is a particularly hard matter to get any resolution carried unanimously, and would respectfully submit that it this instance, with such a large majority in favour of the abolition of the Excise and bounty, we may legitimately claim your support as our member in the House of Representatives, and ask you to vote in the way indicated. The Honourable the Premier of Queensland having guaranteed the passing of a measure through the State Parliament to prevent the growing of cane by coloured labour, and having also guaranteed to purchase the leases of any alien at present in the industry, there should thus be nothing to prevent the immediate abolition of the Excise and bounty.",47
254,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"The Prime Minister has these communications, which, I understand, are being considered.",48
255,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"-That is so. The honourable member very properly conveyed the opinion of the growers of the Bundaberg district to the Prime Minister. The secretary to the Isis Primary Producers and Cane-growers Association informs me, in a letter dated 23rd September, that, - at a meeting held on the previous Saturday, the Isis cane-growers unanimously passed the following resolutionThat in view of the serious position, of the sugar industry, it is desirable to immediately abolish the Excise and bounty. He writes to me as followsI have been instructed to say that this meeting represented at least 75 per cent, of the whole cane-growers of the Isis, and it was exceedingly unanimous. One and all were of the opinion that it would be far better to turn land to other use than attempt to grow cane profitably to themselves under the present conditions. This Association has made a canvass of the Isis, and has ascertained that the effect of the new regulations is such that at the present time there would be over 100 per cent, more men employed here (outside cane-cutters) in the industry than there is; that is to say, we have evidence that 60 per cent, of farm hands have been dispensed with. The two centres to which I have referred are very large and very important, and I ploying presume that other honourable members another, have received communications expressive of the views of the cane-growers. Here is a ports telegram which has been published today unless from MackayBetween seventy and eighty farmers assembled at the Britannia hall on Saturday to consider the matter of the abolition of the sugar Excise and bounty. Communications were read from eighty-four others expressing themselves favour of abolition. A motion was agreed to urging abolition of Excise and bounty, and legislation on the part of the State Government to exclude aliens from the industry. All these resolutions point to a policy which can be carried out without waiting half of the small cane-growers. for any referenda on the subject, because we have constitutional power at present to act. The resolutions, I repeat, do not refer to any question of lowering wages, but simply put the case of men who, by reason of the increased wages, have been subjected to an increased cost tion. They are simply appealing to their representatives in this Parliament, which alone has the power to remedy the grievance, to put them in a position to meet the additional expenses which they have to bear.",48
256,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Yes ; but what power have we to get these farmers an increased price for the cane?,48
257,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"r-By repealing the Excise and the bounty, the growers would be in a position to get a higher price for the cane. Further, if honourable members do not want to do that, they can equalize the Excise and the bounty, and retain the existing machinery. That would be doing something for the growers, and that is the line of action suggested by the honourable member for Herbert. If honourable members will equalize the Excise and the bounty, they . will put the growers in the position of having so much per ton bounty in excess of what they get today, and, to that extent, give them considerable relief without increasing by a penny the cost of sugar to the consumers. That can easily be done. I ask honourable members to accede to the their request of those who are engaged in the industry, and to abolish the Excise and bounty. I have given two or three instances of this feeling. The failure to give relief is having a varying effect. The reports which have been given to the press by the Minister of Trade and Customs show the effect which it is having upon the industry. For instance, referring to Bundaberg, we"" readGrowers who are in a small way are not emoutside labour, but are assisting one and in other cases are cutting their own cane with the help of their families. The restate that it is rumoured in some quarters, a lower rate of wages is required by the Minister, large areas will be allowed to go out of cultivation.",48
258,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,Then it is a question of wages?,48
259,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Do not let the honorin able member misunderstand me.,48
260,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The Sugar Producers' Association say, in their journal, that they will sack every man they can.",48
261,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I am speaking on beI think that honourable members know that these men represent a very large number of fair minded growers. I believe that the Prime Minister will bear me out that the general desire of the growers, especially the small growers, has been to try to give a fair deal of producto those whom they employ.",48
262,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Yes ; and at a time when very few honourable members on your side would do anything, we assisted the small growers.",49
263,Mr GROOM,Unknown,I do not know whom the right honourable gentleman is referring to. I would remind him that members on this side supported the Barton Government which first passed this legislation.,49
264,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Who ?,49
265,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The honourable member for Ballarat, the honourable member for Kooyong, and others. It is not a question of who did something in the past. We are dealing with the present problem, and we can discuss that, quite apart from party considerations. Here are certain telegrams stating that the small growers have had this increased burden put upon them, and all that they ask is, not that the burden shall be removed, but that when we have the power and the means, we shall put them in a position whereby they can get a fair living in the industry.",49
266,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,The honourable member's time has expired.,49
267,Mr GROOM,Unknown,I regret that I shall have to resume the second chapter at a later stage.,49
268,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"Bass) [8.30] - In this Supply Bill provision is made for the maintenance of the Parliamentary Library. There is filed in that Library a newspaper known as the Hobart Mercury, owned by Messrs. Davies Brothers, Limited, cf 'Hobart, and having a circulation of 10,000 or thereabouts. On Saturday last there was published in its columns a letter criticising the action of this' Government in regard to the Maternity Allowance Bill. The statements made in that letter, and the suggestions it contained, were, in my opinion, scandalous, degrading, and low, and I ask the Prime Minister to have the matter brought before the Library Committee, with a view to the removal of the file of the Mercurv from the Library until an apology has been made to the Government, to this Parliament, and to the women of Australia.",49
269,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"What is in the letter? But, perhaps, if it is indecent the honorbut paper, able member hacl better not read it.",49
270,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,I hand it to the right honourable gentleman. It is deplorably indecent. It is immoral in its statements regarding a section of the women of Australia.,49
271,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Then the newspaper ought not to be in the Library.,49
272,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"That is so. I have risen to draw attention to the matter. The writer goes so far as to say that this Government is deliberately and maliciously introducing legislation to cause degeneration and debauchery. The letter is signed by G. L . A. Field, a fairly large landowner. In justice to the proprietors of the Mercury, 1 should state that they may not have seen the letter, but the editor must take responsibility for its publication, and the proprietors are well-known opponents of the Labour party, one of them being Speaker of the House of Assembly, and the other a member of the Legislative Council of Tasmania. Of all the statements I have read about the Maternity Allowance Bill, this is the most contemptible. 'As there are ladies present I shall not read the letter. It speaks of some of the poor unfortunate women of Australia as beasts of the field. I should not like to use a word that it applies to thern. It is too deplorable, low, and contemptible to appear in print. The Prime Minister has seen the letter, and knows its contents, and, therefore, I ask him to bring the whole matter under the notice of the Library Committee, so that that body may consider the advisability of having the file removed from the building until an apology has been made by the proprietors of the Mercury for the statements they have published about the Government. An apology should also be made to the women of Australia.",49
273,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [8.35] - I have read the letter referred to by the honourable member for Bass, and think that it is of such a character that the whole matter should be referred to the Library Committee. It is one that need hardly be discussed in this Committee. I suggest that the honourable member should forward .1 copy of the newspaper to the Library Committee, with a request that it should consider whether an apology should not be demanded from the proprietors. It must be remembered that the letter may have slipped into the newspaper inadvertently, if it represents the policy of the newsthat paper, in my opinion, ought not to be here.",49
274,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Illawarra) [8.36] - I wish to endorse what has been said by the honourable member for Darling Downs regarding the request of the Government for three months' Supply, which, if granted, will deprive honourable members of opportunities for the discussion of grievances. However, I suppose the Bill will be passed; practically all the Opposition can do is to enter its protest against it.",49
275,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,Honourable members willingly surrendered their powers this afternoon.,50
276,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"-The honourable member for Capricornia must excuse me if I did not regard his motion as seriously as he meant it to be taken. I have risen chiefly to address myself to a subject about which there is a great deal of agitation in New South Wales. To bring it more prominently before the Chamber, I asked the . Prime Minister some questions about it this noon. Honourable members are aware that for some time past communications have been passing between this Government and the Government of New South Wales regarding the removal of the Governor General from Government House, Sydney, with the result that yesterday he was compelled to leave Sydney, an occasion which was used by the people of the State to give him one of the grandest farewells that any Governor General or Governor has ever received. The people of New South Wales have been greatly moved by what has taken place. The Prime Minister informed me, in effect, that it was' understood when Lord Denman accepted the position of Governor General that he would have a residence in Sydney, and the right honourable gentleman said that the circumstance was one which should have weighed with the Government of New South Wales. Speaking at Sydney last night, the Governor General said that there was an understanding when he accepted office that he should have a residence in Melbourne, so that he might be here when Parliament was sitting, and another in Sydney. That statement was endorsed by the Prime Minister this afternoon; but now the right 'honourable gentleman airily says that that was a circumstance which might have influenced the Government of New South Wales. What the Government of New South Wales have done will, I have no doubt, be dealt with in the proper quarter; all I wish to say about them is that they have been extremely short-sighted in not taking every possible opportunity to keep the Governor General in residence there. Time after time, the State Government, instead of endeavouring to keep up the prestige of the old State, have done things that are fast bringing it down to a secondary position; and this is one act added to others. Let the Prime Minister distinctly understand that, while this is a matter affecting the Government of New South Wales, it is one which, in my opinion, and in the opinion of many others, affects himself and his Government.",50
277,Mr FISHER,Unknown,In what way?,50
278,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I shall"" tell the Prime Minister, who need not be so short and sharp.",50
279,Mr FISHER,Unknown,We have had a long journey.,50
280,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"We have both had a long journey; and if I become rather short and sharp, 1 hope he will forgive me, as afterI forgive him. The Commonwealth Government is primarily responsible for the Governor General, and it is the duty of the Prime Minister and his colleagues to see that all the arrangements entered into with His Excellency are carried out. As I have said, the State Government are short sighted in refusing to allow the Governor General to remain in the State Government House; and it is the duty of the Commonwealth Government to see that His Excellency is afforded facilities to reside in New South Wales when he thinks fit. I have heard it said that the Governor General and his lady were looking forward with the greatest pleasure to their residence in the Government House of the Mother State, because of its historic associations. That, however, is at an end. The Prime Minister says that the Government will see fhat, when the Governor General goes to New South Wales, he is properly housed; but there is no place where that can be done except in Government House, on the shores of Port Jackson. If Lord Denman be practically evicted from the State Government House, it will reflect no great credit on the State Government, and certainly. none on the Federal Government. What is all this about? The Prime Minister has told us that it is not a matter of money, but a matter of principle. Where is the principle? It appears to lie in breaking the agreement entered into with the King's representative before he left London. The sum involved is a paltry Â£3,500 a year. Why should that expenditure be stopped at the end of twelve years? Since the expiration of the Braddon section, millions of pounds, which previously went to New South Wales and the other States, have been pouring into the Commonwealth coffers.",50
281,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I know the honourable member does not desire to mislead, but he is suggesting that it was agreed before the Governor General left London that the Commonwealth Government would keep up Sydney Government House.",50
282,Mr FULLER,Unknown,Nothin g of the sort.,51
283,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The language conveys that idea.,51
284,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I said that the ar-. rangement was that, in addition to the residence in Melbourne, there should be the residence in Sydney.",51
285,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"There were two Government Houses, each a g if t from each State.",51
286,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"The Prime Minister, this afternoon, endorsed what I am now saying.",51
287,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The two houses were available under the conditions then made.,51
288,Mr FULLER,Unknown,And the two houses have been occupied by the Governors-General up to the present time.,51
289,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Unti l the conditions were withdrawn.,51
290,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Until the tion arose. My contention is that it is the duty of the Government and this Parliament to see that the agreement made with the Governor General is kept. port of the Governor General's speech be correct, he was advised, not only by the Imperial authorities, but by his Ministers here, to go to New South Wales to see if he could amicably settle the difference. Surely the Commonwealth Government is not so puerile, puny, or pusillanimous that it cannot ai range a simple matter of administration without appealing to the Governor General ?",51
291,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I told the' House today that I did not endorse that view.,51
292,Mr FULLER,Unknown,That is my view.,51
293,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Kee p going.,51
294,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"The Governor General says that he offered to give up a portion of the grounds. His Excellency saw Mr Holman, Mr. Griffith, and others, the pleadings he put before them were absolutely in vain. The Prime Minister and his colleagues should not have allowed the Governor General to be placed in the undignified and humiliating position of practically crawling on his knees to the Ministers of New South Wales and saying, "" Please give me this house while I am in Sydney."" Commonwealth Government ought to have a keener sense of their position, and more feeling towards the Governor General, than to place him in such a position. [146]",51
295,Mr BENNETT,Unknown,Why suggest that the Governor General crawled ?,51
296,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"The Governor General said that he pleaded and strove in vain, and I use the word "" crawling "" because it is the strongest way of putting it. For the Governor General to go to the Ministers of New South Wales, or of any other State, and say, "" Please, if I give up a portion of the grounds, will you allowâ me to remain ''",51
297,Mr RILEY,Unknown,He did not go to the Ministers ; he wrote a letter to the Lord Mayor of Sydney.,51
298,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"The honourable member for South Sydney knows, as I do, that the Governor General saw the State Ministers and pleaded with them. He said in his speech that he offered to give up a big portion of Government House grounds if they would allow him to remain, but they would not.",51
299,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"That was an offer to the present posi- Lord Mayor, by letter.",51
300,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"All I wish io say is that I think the Prime Minister and his colleagues seem to have forgotten their duty If the reto the Governor General, who ought not to have been asked, and, if asked, ought to have refused, to interfere between the two Governments. It is the duty of the Commonwealth Government to arrange these matters, and not to place the Governor General in so humiliating a position. I do not wish to say more than that, however blamable the State Government may be, the responsibility is on the shoulders of the Commonwealth Government to see that the arrangements entered into with the Governor General are properly carried out.",51
301,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"We shall accept the responsibility, and not drag the Governor General into party political warfare.  Although Governor General into party political warfare. I am charging the Prime Minister and his colleagues, including the Honorary Minister, who is so ready with his tongue, with forgetting their duty to the Governor General, and with being so paltry and pusillanimous as to be unable to carry out a simple administrative act. They have had to get behind the Governor General, and send him along to plead with State The Ministers and say, "" Please, gentlemen, will you allow me to remain here, if I agree to do so and so?""",51
302,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,That might be very good stuff for the platform.,51
303,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"If it is good platform stuff, I am not ashamed of having said it. Every l'oyal son of the Empire will agree that I am correct. If the honourable gentleman wants platform stuff, I can give him enough of that sort of thing. I could say that the whole business is part and parcel of a feeling of disloyalty to the Crown of England. The honourable gentleman can have that for the platform.",52
304,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"It is a contemptible way of discussing matters, to bring the Governor General into the discussion.",52
305,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Why does the honourable member permit the Honorary Minister to interrupt me, and say that I am doing platform work ? I object to the honourable member's statement, and I ask that he should be called upon to withdraw the remark that I am dealing with this matter in a contemptible fashion.",52
306,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"If the honourable member for Maribyrnong made that remark, he will certainly withdraw it.",52
307,Mr FENTON,Unknown,I shall withdraw the remark if it is offensive to the honourable ber. 1 would not say anything offensive io him. I shall deal with him a little later on.,52
308,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,The honourable member for Illawarra should now withdraw his charge of disloyalty.,52
309,Mr FULLER,Unknown,1 made no charge of disloyalty.,52
310,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"Yes , the honourable member did.",52
311,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I made no charge of disloyalty against any one here. I spoke of disloyalty in certain quarters. If the lionorable member thinks that iits the party, he can take it. I did not make it against the party.",52
312,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,It does not fit me or f.ie party either.,52
313,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Why should the honourable member ask me to withdraw an acthat cusation which I did not make? I said "" in certain quarters,"" and if the honortend able member thinks that it fits he can take it.",52
314,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"My loyalty is not iri question, or that of the party either.",52
315,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I wish now to refer to dicated another matter, I hope in a calmer fashion, as I was led to speak rather now in consequence of interruptions. We are voting a considerable sum of money every year for the payment of bonuses established at the instance of this Parliahonorable ment. We have what is known as a bonus for wool-tops. We are given to understand that, as the result of the payment of that bonus, an industry has been established in Botany, near Sydney, which gives a certain amount of employment. If the reports we read are correct, those concerned in that industry not only carry on their own business for the manufacture of wool-tops, but in an indirect fashion subsidize what is known as the Colonial Meat Export Company, and so enable it to pay good dividends, and, at the same time, to go into the Flemington sale-yards, in Sydney, as a big buyer, to the very great prejudice indeed of small buyers of sheep in those yards. I put a series of questions to the Minister on the subject today.",52
316,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Would the honourable member mind mentioning the small buyers he refers to?,52
317,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I wish the Minister to find out all about this matter. I have a considerable amount of information on the subject, but I do not wish to put it before the House until I am absolutely certain memthat it is reliable. The Minister of Trade and Customs is in a position to have inquiries made by his expert officers, and that is an advantage denied to a private member of this House. I presume that many honourable members have received a circular on the subject similar to that which has been sent to me. I have noticed statements concerning the matter in the leading daily newspapers of Sydney, and one cannot go into the Stock Exchange there without hearing comments on it. I understand that the bonus ran out on the 30th June last.",52
318,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,No ; it will run on to the the statement end of next year.,52
319,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I hope that, in view of the statements made, the Minister will institute a searching inquiry into the whole business.",52
320,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I announced the other day it was the intention of the Government, when submitting another Bonus Bill, to exthis bonus for another two years. I shall try to get the details for which the honourable member has asked.",52
321,Mr FULLER,Unknown,I hope that before the Minister extends the bonus in the way in,52
322,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Parliamen t will have to do strongly just that, if it is done.",52
323,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I hope that the Minister will give Parliament the fullest information in connection with the matter before members are asked to extend the bonus. I am sure that honourable members on both sides, while they may be prepared to grant bonuses for the encouragement of our industries, desire that the money voted shall be used for the purpose intended. We have the statement made that a company receiving a bonus is working in conjunction with another company, and enabling that company to pay dividends, and to outbid competitors in the ""Sheep market. We should know whether that information is reliable before we are asked to extend this bonus. One very serious statement made in. this matter is that, whilst over Â£30,000 has been paid in the shape of this bonus, the effect has been three-fold. First of all, it has provided cheap wool-tops' for the Japanese; secondly, it has enabled dividends of 10 and 6 per cent, to be paid to the shareholders of the Colonial Meat Export Company; and, thirdly, it has been the means of finding employment for girl labour, with a few odd overseers in one or two combine mills.",52
324,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,Would the honourable member mind saying what paper he is quoting from ? Is it the Newsletter i,53
325,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I am quoting from my own questions on the business-paper, and the statements were not taken from the Newsletter.",53
326,Mr RILEV,Unknown,They appeared in the - Newsletter.,53
327,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Eva i if they did, it is the duty of the Minister to find out whether the statements are correct. I am acting, not only upon letters which I read in the Sydney Morning Herald and Daily Telegraph, but also upon statements made to me by different business men in Sydney.",53
328,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,Does only one company get the bonus?,53
329,Mr RILEY,Unknown,There are two companies manufacturing wool-tops.,53
330,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"There is one company manufacturing wool-tops, and, with one exception, the shareholders of the Colonial Meat Export Company are also shareholders of that company. It is said that the Colonial Meat Export Company is being subsidized by the company manufacturing wool-tops, and is so enabled to pay dividends, and to out-bid their competitors in the markets at Flemington. The company I am speaking of was, I understand, brought into existence by the decision of this Parliament to pay the bonus. The factory is in the constituency of the honourable member for South Sydney, and, possibly, the honourable member knows more about it than does any other member of the Committee. [146]- 2 *",53
331,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,We should know the real effect of the. bounty.,53
332,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"That is all I desire. We are to be asked to extend the bounty later on, and the Minister of Trade and Customs has now an opportunity to make an inquiry into the accusations that are made.",53
333,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,Do no other companies get the bonus?,53
334,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Not so far as I know. The bonus is given only on wool-tops for export. I wish now to express my disappointment that the Minister of External Affairs has not been more expeditious in submitting a statement of his land policy for the Northern Territory. Whether the honourable gentleman proposes to introduce a Bill, or a fresh Land Ordinance, I do not know, but it is some time now since be withdrew the Ordinance he first submitted. We are all most anxious to have the Northern Territory settled at the earliest possible moment. Its unoccupied condition is recognised as a menace to the safety of Australia. Instead of taking action to people the Territory in order to preserve Australia to the white races of the world, we find the Minister of External Affairs wasting week after week, and making no effort to submit a new Land Ordinance which will lead to the settlement of the Territory. All land settlement is practically suspended. I do hope that the Prime Minister will impress upon his colleagues the: necessity, in the interests of defence alone, of submitting the Government policy in this connection at the earliest' possible moment. The next matter to which I desire to tefer is that of the supply of telephonic facilities in the country. I do not know how other honourable, members fare; but, during the past two, years, I have been able to get practically nothing done in the matter of telephonic extension in my constituency.",53
335,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"We are all in tihe same position.. ME. FULLER - I do not know how that may be; but I do know that, every time. I open, the Gazette, I see tenders called for the erection of lines im different parts of Australia. More than two yearshave elapsed since the telephonic extension, from Nowra to Wollongong was approved,. and: yet nothing has been done towards . carrying out the work. The excuse which , iff offered is, that no wire is available. If that be so, there has been gross mismanagement in the Postal Department. N.Â® big eoncerm could carry on business withany, . hope of success if it permitted things to get into such a backward state. One of the matters on which this House has been keenest for some years has been that of providing the fullest telephonic facilities to residents in our back-blocks. For that reason, forward orders should have been despatched for telephones which are required immediately, and for those which will be required in the near future. Only today .1 received another letter from the Department in reference to what are known as guarantee lines. The communication sets out the different amounts which it will be necessary for the people to contribute, and at the bottom of it is the following addendumI may add that even if these terms arc accepted, the erection of the line could not be undertaken at present, owing to the number of works already approved and awaiting attention as opportunity offers. Here is a case in which the residents are actually prepared to supply the necessary number of poles, and to contribute the amount asked by the Department, and yet the work cannot be carried out. I hope that the Minister will be able to give me the information for which I have asked in a series of questions that I placed on the business-paper on Friday last.",53
336,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [9.5] - I should not have spoken, but for the statement pf the honourable member for Illawarra regarding the Governor General. I think it was most unfortunate.",54
337,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"It is quite correct, anyhow.",54
338,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"This afternoon, I gave very full and fair replies to questions put by the honourable member. I stated that I was unable to accept the accuracy of the reports of His Excellency's utterances yesterday in regard to Sydney Government House. _ This Government have never asked His Excellency to undertake any of their duties, and have no intention of doinsr so. That is how they stand. But a Government which would not allow a little latitude to His Excellency the Governor General in the circumstances in which he was placed, and which would not be very grateful for any action that he might take in a friendly way, would be wanting in that courtesy and sane view of their duties which they ought to exhibit. I do not think I need trespass on the time of the Committee further than to say that I hope honourable members on this side of the Chamber - whateve r may be said by honourable members opposite-wil l refrain from discussing the Governor General, as he has no right of reply. Regarding the charge which has been made against the Government, I welcome it. I hope that criticism in connection with this matter will be confined to an attack on the Government for what they have done, or for what they have not done. Their position may be thus stated: When the last Governor General, Lord Dudley, resigned, there was evidently an understanding that Government House, Sydney, would be available to his successor in the same manner, and to the same degree, that it was available to his predecessors. That is to say, the Government of New South Wales placed that residence at his disposal, if he chose to occupy it, for a portion of the yearduring recess. Those conditions were withdrawn, I think, whilst Mr MCGowen, the Premier of New South Wales, and myself, were absent in London. That withdrawal having been notified to us by the owners of the Vice-Regal residence there, we had to recognise it as a fact. Negotiations were therefore begun between the Commonwealth Government andl the Government of New South Wales, with a view to extending the time during which it should be available to the Governor General for the full term of His Excellency Lord Denman's appointment. Those negotiations failed, upon two grounds. The Government of New South Wales asked that the Commonwealth should pay rent for the premises from a certain date. We declined. They asked that we should pay interest on the capital value of the building as a transferred property from a certain date. We declined. We proposed to restore the building, to keep it in good order, and to return it to the New South Wales authorities iri the same condition as we had received it, conditionally upon the old arrangement being allowed to continue. They declined to agree to that proposal, and all negotiations which have since taken place-delicat e and difficult though they have been-hav e been conducted with far more circumspection than has been exhibited here to-night. Nevertheless, they have failed.",54
339,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,The Commonwealth always paid for the up-keep of the Sydney Government House.,54
340,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Not completely. The Government of New South Wales regarded some of the up-keep as extraordinary, and their expenditure was considerable.",54
341,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,What was the average cost of the up-keep per annum?,55
342,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"To the Commonwealth it was about Â£3,000, and to New South Wales, I think, more. What is the position? Victoria- a smaller State-grant s - us the use of this building, which cost, I presume, Â£500,000.",55
343,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"More than JÂ£I,000,000.",55
344,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Le t me assume that it - cost Â£500,000 which, at the present time, is worth Â£20,000 annually by of interest; Victoria also grants us the use of Government House, a splendid buildtion ing, which clearly represents another there Â£5,000 per annum, or a gift of Â£25,000 if thisprovided per annum. Yet some of the representahope tives of New South Wales now indignantly demand that we should pay rent for the of Government House, Sydney.",55
345,Mr FULLER,Unknown,And we ought to pay rent for this building.,55
346,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"No individual and no Government ought to be so lofty as to refuse to accept from another individual or another Government a gift offered in a graceful way. This gift was handsomely use - offered to us, and we accepted it. I do think that we ought to be led by any false pride or dignity to say to the State Government, "" We cannot accept anything from you; we cannot trust you.""",55
347,Mr FENTON,Unknown,The Victorian State Gocause vernment had also to provide for a new State Parliament House.,55
348,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"On which something like 0,000 was spent.",55
349,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I say that the Victorian able State Government acted gracefully and parisons well. It cost them from Â£70,000 to now. It between Â£100,000 to provide a Parliament House the honourable member for the State Legislature, but although I or his father before him; am living here, I have never heard - cial grumble regarding our use of these very large proportion of thisindustry. buildings. Does this cry emanate again from the idea that there are only two States in the Commonwealth ? Ten years ago, we and heard in this House nothing but wrangling between the representatives of two neither States. Surely the Commonwealth ought but to be above that sort of thing. If we are areas. men to pay for the use of Government House, have proved Sydney, by the Governor General, while work. They have the Seat of Government is not in New South Wales, we ought to provide a resithat dence for the Governor General in far tant Queensland, which has a population approaching 700,000; we ought for - same reason to provide one in South Australia, and a residence should also be proconversion. vided for the Governor General in the great State of Western Australia, which is cut off from the people of the East. Likewise, in the delightful island State of Tasmania a residence for the Governor General should be provided. The logical position is that if a residence for the Governor General is to be provided in any State other than that in which the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth exists, a residence ought to be provided for the Governor General in way every State. Indeed, I doubt very much whether in every State where the populais large, and settlement widespread, ought not to be more than one residence for the Governor General theory is to be developed. I do we have heard the last of this, the worse of all parochialism in the two great use centres of Australia. We hear it in no other part of the Commonwealth.",55
350,Mr FULLER,Unknown,Why do not the Government carry out the arrangement that was entered into? That is all that'was asked.,55
351,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"No arrangement was entered into. We had the offer of the free of the building just as this building was not offered to us. When the Government of this State say that they desire us to pay rent for this building, we shall have to accept their decision. The position in that case, however, would be very different, bewe have the uninterrupted use of this building without any interference whatever. Coming now to the matter referred to by the honourable member for Darling Downs in regard to the sugar industry, honorment members who were in the first Parliawill find it interesting to make comwas the discussions then and then held, although not by for Darling Downs, that white labour an officould not carry on the sugar A Parliament declared that the sugar industry could not white would not be carried on successfully by labour. It was said that it was a matter of money nor of economics, that it was a physical impossibility for white to do such work in the tropical Those who took the opposite view that white men can do the shown that they can do which has never been done before by diswhite men in any tropical country.",55
352,Mr FULLER,Unknown,We are all in favour of the the policy of a White Australia.,55
353,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,We recognise your Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - There been no conversion; there was never any difference of opinion on the subject.,55
354,Mr FISHER,Unknown,It is pleasing to hear these statements made after the event.,56
355,Mr FULLER,Unknown,They could not have been made before the event. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Will not the records prove that our statement is corfixed rect?,56
356,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Bot h Houses of the Queensland Parliament declared that the enough. industry would be ruined, and that it was impossible to carry it on by means of labour. The honourable member for Oxley in this House made a speech extending something like four hours, in which he read resolutions passed by nearly every public body in Queensland declaring that the by regulation. ' White Australia policy meant the ruination of the sugar industry.",56
357,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I was speaking of what this House did. - Mr FISHER - This House decided by a majority to adopt the white labour policy, and I should like to ask what party pushed forward that policy. The honourable member for East Sydney at that time, Sir George Reid, who was then Leader of the Opposition-sai d that his justification supporting that policy was that the majority of the representatives of Queensvernment land were members of the Labour party, who had been returned pledged to support it. It was for that reason, and cause he entirely admitted that the work could be done by white labour that he suporable ported the policy. The honourable member for Parkes, to his credit be it said, has stood to his guns from that day to this. Some people denounce him, but I admire then possible. him for his consistency. He says today, as he said in the first Parliament, that policy is an impossible one. As to the cial records, to which reference has been brought in? made, I could point to an official record showing a resolution passed by the Mackaythe Association to the effect that this question of white labour on the cane-fields was an economic one-that it was a physical possibility for white men to do the work. Could a stronger statement be imagined? What has caused the trouble about which we are now hearing so much? It is all a question of wages. There was no trouble until that question arose. The honmember in? orable member for Darling Downs tried to fence the question when he was thundering away",56
358,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I did not. has Mr FISHER - The honourable member was a member qf a Government which madeprovision for the payment of a wage of 22s. 6d. a week on the cane-fields, and for a wage of 25s. per week in the cutting season.",56
359,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"That Government carried out the law, and those wages wereas the result of investigation as to the standard rate of wage prevailing.",56
360,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The wage is not,56
361,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,That is another white point; we were bound by the law.,56
362,Mr FISHER,Unknown,But the honourable memover ber's Government made that law.,56
363,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,We did not.,56
364,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The wages were fixed,56
365,Mr GROOM,Unknown,The right honourable member is wrong. We had power only to require payment of the standard rate of wages in the district.,56
366,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The honourable member and his party had the same power that we have to frame a regulation on the subject.,56
367,Mr GROOM,Unknown,The Minister of Trade and Customs says he has not the power; he simply says that the bounty will not befor imperilled if certain wages are paid.,56
368,Mr FISHER,Unknown,It was open to the Goof which the honourable member was a member to take the step that we have taken to ensure payment of fair and reasonnot beable wages to the sugar workers.,56
369,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,Did not the right honmember support that Government?,56
370,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Yes ; and I should support it again as against the only alternative,56
371,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,But did the right hon.the orable member and his party attack that offiGovernment on the schedule of wages,56
372,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"We did; we supported best we could get. That schedule was the best we could get out of the Governnot ment of the day. If we had adopted the imonly alternative, and supported a Government coming in from the other side, we should probably have got nothing.",56
373,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,But the Labour party could have put them out at any time.' ,56
374,Mr FISHER,Unknown,And put the honourable,56
375,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"We are simply asking for some statement of policy with regard to the Excise. The wages question, has not been raised.",56
376,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"It is not a new question with me. I stated publicly in the sugar districts and other parts of my electorate that the superstructure of Excise and bounty is a mere expedient to accomplish two things. One is the transformation of the industry from a coloured to a white-labour industry, and the settlement by white labour - of the great north-east of Australia, 500 miles in extent, which otherwise would have been under coloured labour and useless to ns. This it has done. The secondis to assure that the small sugar-grower will get a greater return for his raw product than he would otherwise get. By this means his return is separated into a payment by the raw sugar miller to whom he sells his cane, and a payment by the Government, in the shape of a return of three-fourths of the Excise. That, in my opinion, assures a greater amount being paid directly to the grower of sugar-cane than he would otherwise receive. It was, however, never in the mind of any one that that superstructure should continue for ever, and the first amendment made in the law was to lead to the reduction and ultimately the elimination of both the bounty and Excise on a graduated scale. I was not in favour of that. I told my constituents I was not favourable to the elimination of both the Excise and bounty until there was some power or , authority which would protect the white grower against the unfair competition of coloured labour for the same product. The proposal now is that the State Government, which has sovereign powers, and has the right to exclude any class of labour from any portion of the State, should take action. The same Parliament which declared that coloured labour could not be dispensed with now seems to be prepared to pass a law preventing coloured labour being employed in any circumstances on sugar land. When that is done, we shall have white areas where only white people can be employed. That, I admit, lays down a fair basis for considering whether the Excise and bounty should not be eliminated altogether, and provision made by agreement or law-preferabl y by a Court through the law-to assure that the producer of raw sugar-cane will be protected, and also that the small mill-owner will be protected in selling his product to the refiner.",57
377,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Will you apply the same to every other industry ?,57
378,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Yes ; and I have altween ways said so. That is the road of safety And progress. There is, in every industry in Australia that is worth carrying on, a sufficient margin of profit for every one concerned in it, or it ought not to be going on at all.",57
379,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,Has the Prime Minister anything to say about the equalization of the Excise and bounty in the meantime ?,57
380,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"This must be done *' in one act."" The sugar industry is the only one dealt with in this way. I am sure that this Parliament does not desire to continue superstructural legislation of this sort any longer than is necessary. The industry should be placed on the same basis as every other industry as soon as that can be done.",57
381,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"There are only 1,400 coloured men in' the industry altogether.",57
382,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Withdra w the conditions of the bounty and Excise, and you will have 5,000 in three years.",57
383,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Where would they come from't,57
384,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"There are at least 40,000 coloured aliens in Australia. The labour in connection with the sugar-growing industry is more manual than in any other a industry I know of, and those people would undoubtedly soon be found to do that work, ousting the white men in consequence. They would be brought from north, south, east, and west, wherever they could be obtained, and that must be prevented. The big issue, however, is that, if an agreement or understanding can be come to by Commonwealth and State legislation, it will be an advantage to the industry, and no disadvantage to Australia. It will leave the sugar industry on the same basis as other protected industries, and I think the majority of honourable members will not hesitate to say that it is an industry worth .protecting and possessing. Some honourable members think lightly of it ; but, calculating its value and the amount of employment it gives, and the settlement it causes, I presume it ranks practically with the great coal industry of Australia. It is, therefore, no small industry, and it also helps to develop the tropical parts of the continent. If the Commonwealth Parliament had power to pass a law to enable the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration to hear causes between the employ^ and the grower as regards wages and conditions of labour, and be the grower and the small mill-owner, and also between the small mill-owner and the refiner, a solution of the difficulty would be arrived at that would settle the matter for a time.",57
385,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,And those are the powers we are asking for at the referendum.,58
386,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Yes . I am repeating now only what I said publicly when I was previously Prime Minister, and also as a candidate. I still hope that some rearrangement will be arrived at that will satisfactorily safeguard all interests. We must first make sure that it is an absolutely white industry. Secondly, we must assure fair remuneration to the workers, and we must see to it that the grower, who, after all, is, as a rule, as small a man as the smallest struggling farmer in other States, and much in need of assistance and sympathy, has also a due measure of protection in his industry from those above and below him. On those grounds a perfectly safe way out can be found by this Parliament co-operating with any other authority that offers to assist in settling the problem.",58
387,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Franklin) [9.30]. - The question which I put to the Prime Minister was an honest one. I asked where, the coloured labour would come from if the bounty and Excise on sugar were abolished?. It is impossible under our existing law to import coloured labour. Therefore, if coloured labour were to flood the cane-fields, it would have to be that already in Australia. But I say very distinctly and clearly that there ought to be no difference in this respect between the sugar industry and any other industry. For instance, what logic is there in preventing a Chinaman from working in the cane-fields, whilst you allow him to work in the market gardens of the suburbs of Melbourne, Sydney, and Hobart? What difference is there between preventing a Chinaman from working in the cane-fields, and preventing him from working in the banana plantations? The whole trouble in connection with the sugar industry is that we are always placing around it artificial barriers which we do not place around any other industry. On the day when the Kanaka was taken away from Australia the sugar industry ought to have been placed upon the same footing as any other primary industry. There is no more reason today for the bounty and Excise on sugar than there would be for treating it in the same manner as the wheat industry, the fruit industry, the dairying industry, or any other Australian primary industry - Does the Prime Minister think that the Chinese laundrymen of, for instance, Melbourne and Sydney would leave their comfortable livings here to work in the cane fields of Queensland? I r am quite certain that they would not. But even if they.did, is there any more reason why a Chinaman should be allowed to compete in the laundries of our cities, or in our market gardens, than in the sugar industry? Why should you attempt to make one branch of industry sacred? Why should you drive coloured men out of that industry and compel them to compete with white labour in other centres of Australia? There is no logic, justice, or reason in such a policy.",58
388,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Who suggests doing that?,58
389,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"If there were no difference in treatment between cane produced by coloured labour and that produced by white labour, coloured labour would soon predominate in the sugar industry.",58
390,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"How is it, then, that the Chinamen in Victoria, New South Wales, and Tasmania do not predominate in the orchards?",58
391,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Because they can get better money in the cities.,58
392,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"And because they can get better money in the cities than in the cane-fields, is that a reason for preventing them from flooding the canefields of Queensland if they like?",58
393,Mr RILEY,Unknown,They ' are not paying enough to feed a Chinaman there 1,58
394,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"I do not want to be led off the track, because I consider that this is a large and serious question. It is very serious when we find that after a duty of Â£ 6 per ton has been imposed for the benefit of the sugar industry for nearly twelve years- a duty equal to 50 per cent - w e are not even now producing enough sugar to supply the needs of Australia.",58
395,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"Not 50 per cent., surely ?",58
396,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Yes .,58
397,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,On cost price?,58
398,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,We used to be able to land sugar in Sydney and Melbourne in ordinary years for Â£ 1 2 a ton.,58
399,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The duty is now equal to about 45 per cent.,58
400,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Then I am well within the mark in saying that in ordinary years we have been charging a duty of 50 per cent. Nevertheless we find that today we shall have to import more than half the sugar required for our own consumption.,58
401,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I think the duty in America is Â£ 9 per ton.,59
402,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Would the Prime Minister approveof a duty of Â£ 9 per ton here?,59
403,Mr FISHER,Unknown,It is worth thinking over. Mr W. J. JOHNSON - That would settle the jam industry.,59
404,Mr FISHER,Unknown,There is a duty equal to ^Â£14 per ton on jam.,59
405,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"I see that there has been a decrease in the white workers employed in the sugar industry during the last five years of 12,000, and a decrease of 2,200 whites in the mills. That is a very serious position for us to consider.",59
406,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I do not think that the journal from which the honourable member is quoting is very reliable.,59
407,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,Thos e figures are not right.,59
408,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"I am quoting figures given by Senator Chataway in a debate in the Senate eight or ten days ago. Senator Chataway is, I believe, one of the best authorities in Australia today on the conditions prevailing in the sugar industry. The production is not much more than half the consumption of Australia.",59
409,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Unfortunately .,59
410,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,I say distinctly that it is unfortunate.,59
411,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Natur e decreed that, not man.",59
412,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Natur e has not been decreeing that for the last twelve years.,59
413,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The honourable member does not mean to say that we produced less sugar last year than we did twelve years ago?,59
414,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"No , but we produced less than we did five years ago.",59
415,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,That was on account of the season.,59
416,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"The fact remains that, after twelve years of our legislation, we are not today producing half enough sugar to supply the local market. It is quite time that this Parliament took the matter in hand, so that the sugar industry may be removed from the molly-coddling or interference of Parliament, and placed on the same footing as wheat growing or any other of our primary industries.",59
417,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Can the honourable member tell us why they do not grow sugarbeet in Tasmania? The product would have the same consideration as cane sugar receives.,59
418,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"We do not grow beet in Tasmania, because' we find that it pays us better to grow something else. The argument that is always urged in connection with the sugar industry is that, in the greater portion of tropical Queensland, the whole place would return to a state of nature if sugar went out of cultivation, and that nothing else could be grown to take its place. It is because we want to see the northern portions of Australia settled that Parliament has given-the sugar industry certain assistance, but I think that the time has arrived when we should remove the bounty and Excise, and place upon sugar whatever duty the - House in its wisdom may think fit. At the same time, legislative interference, which has been hampering and harassing the industry, should cease. There is one point which the House ought to take into very seriousconsideration, and that is in connection with the Northern Territory. We took over the Northern Territory in 1910 ; we passed the Administration Act in the same year, but up-to-date we have done actually nothing in the way of settling the Territory. We have appointed, it is true, a huge army of very highly-paid officials; but we have not even passed a land law for the Territory. It is not possible for a man to take up a lease or purchase a piece of land there. If the policy of the House is to be a leasehold tenure, let it be so, but today it is not possible for the Government to lease an acre of land to a settler. A Lands Ordinance was brought down here, which was laughed at and ridiculed, practically, by every honourable member who spoke, no matter on which side he saf. I think, sir, that it received no severer criticism from any one than it did from yourself, whose constituency included the Territory before it was taken over by the Commonwealth. The Lands Ordinance was admitted by every speaker, I think, to be useless. It was generally recognised that it would not effect the purpose for which it was framed. It was taken back, but, up to the present time, we have heard no more of it. For three years the Government have been in office; for nearly that period we have held the Territory, and today it is in exactly the same position as it was when it was taken over, with the exception that we have apbased on the census returns. Mr Knibbs pointed a huge army of officials. What their duties are is an enigma to the House. There is another very serious question which I think the House ought to turn its attention at once. Honourable members have seen in the press that, as regards of the States, there is a very serious crepancy between the number of adults the number of persons enrolled. Mr bringing Knibbs, in his corrected statement up 31st March, puts down the adult population of New South Wales at 909,000. Estimattook ing for the arrivals between then and 30th June, the adult population is put down by him at 915,000. These are the figures which this Parliament and this Government accept, and upon which is based the capitamated tion grant of 25s. per head to the State. We accept 915,000 as the figures, but there are 935,744 adults enrolled. In other words, there are 20,744 more persons on are not enrolled. the electoral rolls for New South Wales than there are adults in the State. an exceedingly serious thing.",59
419,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,That is stuffing properly.,60
420,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Do you mean to say that duplication. they are stuffing the rolls with a view to paying the State 25s. a head on the added number?,60
421,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"The CommonMaribyrnong, wealth does not pay on the basis of the electoral enrolment. My point is that Mr. Knibbs is our own Statistician. His figures are those which the House accepts absothe lutely. We accept them in connection with the redistribution of seats.",60
422,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,Were not his figures up to the end of March?,60
423,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,No ; they were entitled to be there. up to the end of June.,60
424,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,Not Mr Knibbs' figures ?,60
425,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"- Mr Knibbs' figures up to 31st March were 909,000; unfortunately and up to 30th June, 915,000. June was just about the time when enrolment place.",60
426,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,What percentage of the population of New South Wales does he rolls. take to arrive at the number of adults?,60
427,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"When the census was taken, the ages of the people were that? given, and it is simply a matter of addition.",60
428,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Does he not base it upon about 56 per cent., approximately?",60
429,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"That may be a general regulation, but these figures r own words are, "" The census figures corrected up to March 31st."" He took the to figures for the last census and corrected them up to 31st March by adding the number of adults who came into the State and two those in the State who had reached the disage of twenty-one years, and thus and he added 6,000 to his March return, the total up to 915,000 as at the to end of June. The point to be remembered is that the enrolment for the Commonwealth place precisely at that time, and that' the the number of persons enrolled in New South Wales is 20,744 more than the entireadult population. But it is admitted that there is always a deficiency, variously estiat from 4^ to i \ per cent., of persons who do not get on the rolls. Every honourable 'member is aware that there isalways a certain proportion of adults who",60

433,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"It is the matter of duplication which I wish to point out. In reply to the honourable member for I would say that we are not getting a better enrolment when we have20,000 more persons on the rolls for New South Wales than the number of adults in State; and if we allow the 5 per cent, for those who are not on the rolls-it runs from 4 to â¬>\ per cent., but I take 5 per1 cent - w e shall get another 45,750 persons,, or 66,494 persons on the rolls who are not of the people who you say should be off the rolls entitled to be there?",60

437,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Mr Knibbs. are would, I think, tell the honourable member that today there are far more persons on the rolls for New South Wales than there are adults in the State. The number of adults in Tasmania-takin g the same dates - wa s given at 101,000. But there are 10 3>5 7 persons on the rolls, or 2,527 more 2 than the number of adults in the State. If we add the deficiency of 5 per cent., we g 7.5771Â° plain English, there are e t about 7 per cent, more people on the rolls of New South Wales and Tasmania than there are adults in the States.",60
438,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,Hav e you taken figures for the other States?,61
439,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"No . We are all interested in having the rolls as perfect as possible, and there is time now to have this matter dealt with. The card system is not porfect. In Victoria alone upwards of 30,000 cards have been returned by the postal authorities, the persons to whom they were addressed not having been found.",61
440,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,Most of them have left Victoria to take up land in New South Wales.,61
441,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Not as many as 30,000.",61
442,Mr CANN,Unknown,The enrolment figures .are not yet complete. I could not ascertain them a fortnight ago.,61
443,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"They have been made public by the Minister and by the - Chief Electoral Officer. Senator MCColl stated that 150 cards had been returned to one small post-office in Victoria, and 200 to another.",61
444,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"In Melbourne about 25 per cent, of the population changes its residence every year.",61
445,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"But 7J per cent, in excess of the total population has been enrolled. It is not enough for the Department to say that all will be right in the end. A general election takes place next year, and we desire that its issues be fought on a fair, clean pure roll.' The figures now available show that either by accident or design the rolls have been .stuffed.",61
446,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,It may be due to the fact that the Fusion has so many paid .agitators going about.,61
447,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"The Honorary Minister, as he represents Adelaide, should, be the last to speak about roll-stuffing. Disclosures took place there recently which show that roll-stuffing has been practiced in that State.",61
448,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,Nothin g of the kind..,61
449,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,The practice was found to exist by a Royal Commission.,61
450,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,It was proved up to the hilt.,61
451,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"There being this enormous discrepancy in the enrolment of two States, it is the duty of the Government to see that the rolls are purged, so that the next election can be fairly contested. The basis of honest parliamentary government is good rolls. In the past the rolls have not been good. Hundreds the of persons who thought that they were enrolled for East Melbourne last week found at the last moment that they were not, and they were therefore disfranchised. That has been a common experience of the past. Some of the States-Tasmania , for example-us e the Commonwealth roll for both Commonwealth and State elections; only one roll is compiled. That arrangement should have been made universal years ago. ""To have two rolls in a State means a waste of money and of time. The reform could be secured by the use of a little common sense. The last Tasmanian election was fought on Ihe roll that had previously been used in the State for the Commonwealth election, with the omissions and additions necessary to bring it up to date. The franchise is practically the same in all the States. Mr ROBERTS.^-H the other States had as much sense as Tasmania, the reform referred to could be brought about within a week.",61
452,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"A little tact would secure the desired end. I am sorry that reference has been made to the removal of the Governor General from Sydney. The wrangle between this Government and the Government of New South Wales was undignified, and the less said about it the better. With regard to the supply of sleepers for the Western Australian railshall way, there cannot be the slightest doubt that the Government of Western Australia has ""taken down"" the Commonwealth over the deal. This Government has purchased 1,500,000 karri sleepers, untried and untested, at ios. each-a n outlay of Â£750,000-althoug h the Government of Western Australia, from whom we are buying, has not a mile of railway laid on o karri sleepers. Every report and experiment has proved that karri is not a suitable timber for railway sleepers.",61
453,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter) [10.0I - I desire to draw the attention of the Prime Minister and the Government to a question that I raised the other day in regard the establishment of a testing station explosives. This is a matter that should not be delayed, because such an establishto ment is necessary, not only for the of life and property, but for the encourageWales ment of the manufacture of explosives within the Commonwealth. To-day plosive can be used in the Newcastle disit trict unless it is on what is known as permitted list, and no explosive can placed on the list unless it passes the imposed by the Board established for that purpose in the Old Country. coal mines in four of the States; and as these mines go to the dip, gas will, in all cannot 'be used. probability, be given b f f . Every caution will be necessary; and any exploHome, sives used under such circumstances ought be free from fire. Only a fortnight ago there was a narrow escape from serious distest from time to time? aster owing to the use of a permitted plosive. In the Pelaw Main mine a shot was fired by an experienced man, and it is stated that the permitted explosive gave fire to such an extent as to cause an plosion and ignite the mine. to be sufficient warning to take action fore we are face to face with some mining disaster equal to those of which we have heard in the Old Country, and which have seen in Australia. It cannot moment be contended that an explosive tested in the Old Country can be stored for months and months without deterioration. An explosive may be stocked in the Old Country, then brought to Australia, and stocked here; and my contention is that ought to have a test on the spot. there is the question of testing all explosives used in Australia, including those used in gold mines. At present we do not know that the explosives used are of the proper standard, and we have to be guided entirely by the analytical chemist. Under the cumstances, a testing station should be explosives generally. established for explosives for all purposes; and, if this were done, we should, without a Tariff, bring about the manufacture explosives in Australia. No one at other end of the world would run the risk of sending explosives to be tested here fore use, but would manufacture them withtralia in the Commonwealth. One factory established, in the Maitland district, with selves. the expenditure of a good deal Here there were some fifty or sixty hands employed, and the belief was was nothing in the way of the factory at once beginning to supply the mine-owners. Mr Charlton. to fact was, however, that unless the explosive for was on the permitted list it could not be used ; and the only course was to send it England to be tested. This was done, safety and the Mines Department of New South rendered every assistance. The explosive was considerably over twelve months no exin the Old Country, and when it was tested was barred. I had the privilege of being the present with two Government inspectors, a be mine manager, and two or three practical test men, when this explosive was tried; and we fired six or eight shots in deep holings, and There are in no case was any flame given off. Yet this explosive, under the present conditions, Even supposing the expreplosives did not deteriorate on the way and passed the test there, can we to suppose that the Board would permit the use of an explosive which they could not I can only says exthat if I were on the Board I would not put an explosive on the list that I was not in a position to test, in view of the risk of off an inferior article being manufactured and exdisaster caused. As I said before, immeThis ought diate action should be taken; and if the beCommonwealth do not intend to move we ought to know the fact. The Minister of Mines in New South Wales, in a letter to we his Government, has urged the necessity for a of establishing a testing station. He believes this to be a Commonwealth matter,, affecting, as it does, more than one State ; and he goes so far as to advise his Government to bear a portion of the cost of establishing a Commonwealth station. If , howwe ever, the Prime Minister does not intend to Then go on with the work, he urges that the. State Government should, as early as possible, provide an establishment of the kind. So far as I can ascertain, the cost would not exceed ,Â£6,000 or .Â£7,000 for coal-mining alone, though, of course, the expenditure cirwould be a little more in connection with However, if anestablishment of the kind would encourage the local manufacture of explosives, it of would be money well spent. We ought to the be self-contained so far as explosives areconcerned, because, as things are at prebesent, I doubt whether, in the case of Ausbeing isolated during war, we should""was find sufficient ammunition to defend ourof'capital.",61
454,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Would one testing stationthat there do for all Australia?,62
455,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"On e would be quiteThe sufficient, and, as New South Wales uses at least one-half of the explosives necessary in mining, I think the testing station ought to be in that State.",62
456,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I think Western Australia uses a large quantity of explosives.,63
457,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I should suppose that New South Wales uses three-fourths or more of the permitted explosives, though I do not mind where the station is, so long as we have one. I admit that explosives cannot be manufactured. that do not emit some fire; but, in gaseous mines, our object should be to reduce the danger to the minimum. Whatever action the Government intend to take ought to be taken at once. They should come to a decision and let the authorities of New South Wales know whether they are going on with the matter. If they are, the sooner they set about the work the better, and if they are not, the sooner the New South Wales Government set about it the better. I do not wish an accident to occur which may lead to the destruction of life and property in the mining industry in New South Wales, or in any other State. I wish to say a word in connection with the delay in the construction of telephone lines referred to by the honourable member for Illawarra. The honourable member made it appear that he is unable to get anything done in this direction in his electorate. I wish to inform him that he is being given about as fair a deal as any other member of the House in this matter. The trouble is that all the big works in connection with telephone construction are held up for the reason the honourable member gave, that we have not a sufficient stock of materials to carry them out.",63
458,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,Why do we not get it?,63
459,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I was going to point out that we have never, since Federation was established, had a sufficient store of material to meet our requirements. Every Government of the Commonwealth has been equally to blame in this matter.",63
460,Mr RILEY,Unknown,There is a big demand all over the world for the wire.,63
461,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,I am aware of that; but that is all the more reason why we should have a stock of it on hand. I believe that the Government should establish bonds or stores in all the different States for storing these supplies.,63
462,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,Why not manufacture the wire locallv?,63
463,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Even if we did that, we should have a stock in each of the States to meet our requirements. I know, for a fact, that today we are short of necessary supplies for the extension of telephone lines. Many lines agreed to in my district, and possibly also in every other district, cannot be carried out because of the lack of material. I believe that the Government should get in a good stock of the materials required in order that the money voted for the purpose may be expended. Since I have been a member of this Parliament, I find that every year votes passed for the purpose remain unexpended. There is something in what the honourable member for Illawarra has said, and I hope that the Postmaster General will secure sufficient supplies as speedily as possible, and give instructions to utilize the money voted for the purpose in carrying out the various extensions agreed to in every part of Australia. If thab is done, the country districts will greatly benefit from the expenditure. Efforts have been made to meet the requirements of country districts for telephone extensions, and the delay in carrying out the extensions agreed upon is solely due to the fact that we have not the necessary material at hand. I hope that the Government will take some notice of what has been said by the honourable member for Illawarra, and other honourable members, and have those very necessary works carried out as speedily as possible.",63
464,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"Wimmera) [10.14] I should like to support the protest of the honourable member for Darling Downs against the delay on the part of the Government in submitting their land policy for the Northern Territory. That great Territory, which has been too long neglected, is apparently still to suffer by this delay. When the Lands Ordinance was before the House, the Minister of External Affairs was treated rather cavilierly, and certainly very unfairly, by a number of his own supporters. The party opposite, apparently, had decreed that there should be leasehold tenure in the Northern Territory ; and when the Minister of External Affairs brought down an Ordinance which embodied the leasehold tenure, a lot of the criticism directed against it from his own side was, in my opinion, quite unmerited. I have certain objections to urge to provisions of that Ordinance, which will tie stated at the proper time, but I think we have now reason to protest against the long delay in having the land policy for the Territory fully discussed and settled by this House. I listened to what was said this evening on the sugar industry in Queensland, and was surprised at the protest made against the action of the Queensland Government in proposing to introduce a Bill in the State Parliament to prevent the employment of coloured labour in the industry. It seems to me that if the Queensland Government had passed such a Bill, honourable members opposite would probably have charged them with interfering with Commonwealth affairs. If the Federal Government propose to direct the policy adopted in connection with the sugar industry, it is their place to communicate with the Government of Queensland, intimating that if they pass certain legislation' the Federal policy with respect to bounty and Excise will be given effect. .1I have to protest once more against the action of the Government in respect to our .immigration policy. We have appointed ,a High Commissioner who, I believe, is doing splendid work on behalf of the Commonwealth, and is adequately representing its great interests in London. We are .paying, for the High Commissioner and his office in London, from ,Â£15,000 to ,Â£20,000 per annum. We are about to erect offices for the Commonwealth in London which will cost hundreds of thousands of pounds, and yet I understand that a paltry ,Â£20,000 ' a year is spent in promoting immigration by advertising the resources of the Commonwealth. In my opinion, the Government have been guilty of flagrant neglect of duty in connection with immigration.",63
465,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,More immigrants have come to Australia since we have been in office than for several years previously.,64
466,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"The Government are, apparently, prepared to claim credit for the wonderful bounties which Providence has showered upon this continent, and now they wish to take credit for the large immigration during their term of office, which has been solely due to the activity of the State Parliaments, which they are constantly condemning.",64
467,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,The State Parliaments are responsible for the fact that thousands of Australians are out of work.,64
468,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,They are responsible for bringing many people to Australia; but we have still a great deal more land than the immigrants coming here are prepared to take up.,64
469,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,How many of them go on to the land ?,64
470,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,It is surely their own affair if they do not.,64
471,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"A percentage of them are, unfortunately, going into the consumptive hospitals.",64
472,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,I think that is an unfair statement to make.,64
473,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"It is most unfair to bring such people out. Mr SAMPSON! - If a number of unhealthy unmi'grants are being admitted, it is due to the failure of the Government to properly administer the Immigration Restriction Act. It is their duty to see that those who are not fit to. mix with our Australian people on the ground of health, should not be admitted. I should be sorry to think that any. more than a very small percentage of those who in- are coming here from the Old Country are disqualified from admission on the score of ill-health. There are thousands and tens of thousands of people willing to come to Australia, but there are no ships available to bring them here. One of the most anti-Imperial policies ever adopted is that of a stolid opposition to any form of immigration such as is presented by the various trade unions throughout the Commonwealth. We know that it is only by building up the strength of the Empire that we can hope to preserve it.",64
474,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,Why do not the States make land available for settlement?,64
475,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"In Victoria there is more land available for settlement than there are persons prepared to take it up. If the Government are anxious to provide land for immigrants, why have they not dealt with the great areas in the Northern Territory ? There is more land available in the various States than there are applicants for it.",64
476,Mr FENTON,Unknown,That is not so.,64
477,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"It is. In Victoria applicants are required at the present time for a large number of blocks which have been purchased by the Closer Settlement Board. The Victorian Government are also prepared to throw open for settlement large areas along the river Murray, adjoining one of the most successful irrigation areas in Australia.",64
478,Mr FENTON,Unknown,The honourable member does not know what he is talking about.,64
479,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,On e of the most successful settlements established on the Murray is adjacent to large areas which can be taken up by any persons who choose to apply for them.,64
480,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,What does the honourable member say to he and I taking up some of those blocks?,65
481,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"Hundred s of thousands of persons are ready to come to Australia, but are unable to do so on account of the shortage of shipping accommodation.",65
482,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Why do not the great ship-owners build ships?,65
483,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"As a Parliament we crease are specially charged with the work directly controlling immigration to. tralia. The present Government are concapable stantly complaining that this Parliament has not sufficient powers under the Conthink stitution, and that we require extended powers in order that we may be able to legislate within the boundaries of Australia. But the most important duty of this Parstated, liament is to shoulder its responsibility connection with immigration. That is one great obligation under the Constitution which the Government have steadfastly and flagrantly neglected. There is no excuse for their inaction. It is only possible consider this great question from an perial stand-point. We have merely to take an Imperial view of it to realise the neglect which can be laid at the door Government for their failure to discharge their responsible duty of attracting grants to Australia. Some time ago quoted figures with a view to showing position as compared with that of other parts of the Empire. In Great Britain there is a congested population of our race. The inhabitants of that country ber 45,000,000. There are other parts the Empire which are crying out for popupounds. lation. We require population more than does any other country in the world. We have a smaller population per square mile than has any other portion of the British Empire. Great Britain has the largest population per square mile of any EuroGovernments spend? pean country. European countries contain wily n 6 persons per square mile, whereas Great Britain contains 375. Russian Asia, where there are large areas fit for wheatyears. growing and dairying, contains only twentytion five persons per square mile.",65
484,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,How many are there in own Patagonia ?,65
485,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"If the Minister of External Affairs considers this frivolous one, I do not. It is a question on which the future of the Empire depends. There is one outlet for the congested lation of Great Britain. It needs to be transferred to the outer Dominions, whose resources require development. That is the only way in which the Empire can be saved. If our population continues to increase at the same rate as it has increased since the establishment of Federation, we shall have very little more than doubled it in 1950. Something like thirty-eight years hence we shall have scarcely more than double our present population if the same ratio of inis preserved. If we believe in this of country as we ought to believe in it, Auswe should push it ahead, and it is ot eventually carrying as great a population as the United States. I do not that; in the variety and wealth of our resources, we can place ourselves second to the United States, which at the present time has a population of 90,000.000. It is on the authority of persons who have in considered this question, that those States the will eventually carry something like 600,000,000 inhabitants, and that they will be able to produce sufficient to support that huge population. If we in Australia value to our resources and do what we can to deImvelop them, we can find room here for tens, perh*a,ps hundreds, of millions of gross people. There is only one way in of the which our resources can be opened up, namely, by the transfer of popuimmilation from the Old Country. Our I natural rate of increase is far too slow. our At the present time we are spending from Â£15.000 to Â£20,000 a year to keep open the High Commissioner's office in London, own and, in addition, it is intended to erect numCommonwealth offices in that centre, at a of - cost of some hundreds of thousands of Yet, during the past two or three years, only the small sum of Â£20,000 annually has been placed upon the Estimates for advertising the resources of Australia.",65

489,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"I am asking the Go* vernment to carry out this work. The popuAge, in commenting on the immigration policy of the States and the Commonwealth, in its issue of 9th January last, statedIn commenting on Saturday upon the advice given by The Times on 'the subject of immigration, the Minister for External Affairs, Mr. Thomas, said that the Commonwealth Ministry was ready at all times to co-operate with the States; but, until that co-operation was sought, the Commonwealth could not interfere. Referring to this yesterday, the Premier, Mr Murray, said, ""When the States are bringing people put themselves, surely the time is ripe for assistance by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth is in no way giving assistance. We have appealed to the Federal Government in vain, and now the States interested in immigration are going on their own. These Commonwealth Labour Ministers are afraid to appear to support immigration."" We have an uncontradicted statement by the Minister of External Affairs that if the States would appeal to the Commonwealth Government for assistance in carrying out the policy of immigration they would respond, and we have the Premier of Victoria stating that such an appeal has been made by his Gotion vernment, and that it has been turned clown. Quite recently the Age published an article from its usually well-informed on London correspondent, the whole of would well repay perusal.",65
490,Mr CANN,Unknown,I did not know that they had one there.,66
491,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"Then the honourable member does not attend to his newspaper reading as diligently as he does to most tinuesother matters. This is really a South .Australian authority. The article sets forth thatOne of the many authorities consulted by the London newspapers is Mr A. A. Kirkpatrick, 'Agent-General for South Australia. He states that emigrants who cannot get passages to Australia, and are unable to wait, go to Argentina. That is confirmed by Mr J. E. Ridgway, a leading shipping agent of London and Manchester. "" So anxious are English immigrants ' to go to Australia now,"" he says, "" that often when the shipping companies notify me the evening before the ship sails that a berth has fallen vacant, I telegraph to a man in the north of England, and he travels all night to seize the opportunity of sailing.",66
492,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,This shows what the Labour Government has done. The Opposition said that if we got into power people would leave the country.,66
493,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"We shall see presently what the various writers on this question think of the action of the Federal Government with respect to immigration. The article continues"" Often, too, men come to the docks and actually wait by the last tender to an emigrant ship in the hope that even at the very last moment they may secure a berth. But they are generally disappointed. The rush to Australia is enormous. There are not nearly enough British ships to carry the passengers. Berths can be found more easily in German ships, and the North German Lloyd Company will pay an emigrant's fare to Antwerp so that he can embark there; but an Englishman prefers to travel in British boats. He cannot afford to wait four months. He has got to pay half-fare as deposit on his berth. Often that means a forced sale of his belongings, and while he is waiting he cannot get work. Meanwhile, berths are always ready in the Argentine boats, and hundreds and hundreds of Englishmen are going there rather than wait. The Peruvian Government, too, is trying to attract our men."" Mr Ridgway is satisfied that r/S,ooo suitable English people could be sent to Australia in 1912 if sufficient ship accommodation were available.",66
494,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Is he a ship-owner?,66
495,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"If the honourable member is not prepared to treat this queswith that seriousness which its importance demands, I ask him to cease his interjections. His attitude is a reflection the Parliament. It is deplorable that the Minister of External Affairs, who which should have charge of the immigration policy, who knows the importance of bringing to Australia some of the surplus population of Great Britain, and who should do his test to encourage immigration, and so build up the strength of the Empire, should jeer in this way. The article conThe ship-owners are being given an opportunity to defend themselves against the accusation that they are not sufficiently enterprising. As on other occasions, they blame the Governments for not taking more third-class space and paying for itand so on. There is a reference in this article to a statement made by the Prime Minister. It is said"" It has been estimated by the Australian Prime Minister,"" one ship-owner remarks, "" that every able-bodied man who arrives in Australia is an asset worth at least ^200 to that country. If that be true, Australia is losing ,Â£2,000,000 worth of ready and available capital this year, and we cannot help her without losing money."" The chief emigration officer of the New South Wales Government in London, Mr. Percy Hunter, also comments on the situation. According to this article he declares, after making a round of the provinces, that"" Australia is losing this year tens of thousands of the most desirable settlers through lack of steamer berths. Shipping agents,"" he says. "" get disgusted and say, ' Oh, it's no use talking about' Australia; you must go somewhere else.' No third class passenger today who walks into a shipping office in London with money in his pocket can get a passage to Australia before December."" That is the serious position with which we are faced in connection with this imthe portant question of immigration. responsibility for that situation rests this Parliament, which has specifically delegated to it the power to deal with immigration. We are spending Â£5,000,000 a year to build up a Defence Force. We have in this continent enormous reserves to open up, and we must have people to open them up. We have to develop them in order to provide a foundation for the great defence policy that we are seeking to build up, yet we are flagrantly neglectnecessary ing the very means by which these great aims and objects can be achieved. We neglecting this opportunity to transfer Australia 'some of the brain, bone, and muscle of Great Britain, the transfer of which would help the Old Land,- and we find the Minister charged with this portant duty treating it as a laughing ter, and regarding the future safety and maintenance of this continent for ^ a European people with a flippancy that unworthy of Ministerial office, and indeed an insult to the Empire. Trade We, in Australia, need population more than any other country in the world, not only because we have vast resources to np, and because as part of a great Empire we offer a natural outlet for the surplus population of Great Britain, but also be* cause geographically we stand in a more parlous position than any other country. article if exported. Europe has 119 people per square mile, Asia 55, Africa 13, America 10, and tralia i i . We have it on the authority of Mr Knibbs that if we continue crease our population up to 1950 at rate at which we have increased it Federation, we shall have not more than 8,000,000 people by that date.",66
496,Mr FISHER,Unknown,What would he say he calculated on the rate of increase ing the last two years?,67
497,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"In the last two years the States have clone splendid work, thanks are due to the Commonwealth vernment for it. The danger is that, if Government neglect the present splendid opportunity of bringing people to tralia, now that the tide of immigration has turned in our favour, we may lose opportunity in the. course of a year or and when we seriously require people of our own kith and kin we shall perhaps find it impossible to get them. We are spending Â£20,000,000 per annum in the Commonwealth, one-fourth of it to establish naval and military defence. We know parlous position in which we are likely The to stand, owing to our proximity to the with over-populated countries in the East; we know that Great Britain may be menaced by an enemy at any time, and we know also that the only way in which the strength ot the Empire can be maintained is to distribute over the various Dominions the population in the overpopulated centre. /This Parliament, therefore, with its financial resources, should not delay one day longer in providing the ships that are to bring people of the right class to our shores. I should like to supare port the remarks that have been made to by several speakers with regard to our telephone system. I know there has been some difficulty in getting material, but we might reasonably have expected before this imthat material would be obtained. As my mattime has expired, I hope to have another opportunity of dealing with that question.",67
498,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"South Sydney) [10.45]. is - The honourable member for Illawarra is expressed a hope that the Minister of and Customs would inquire into the question of the bounty for wool-tops, and made certain allegations which I think the open facts will not bear out. The wool-top industry was established in the district of Botany through the action of a previous Parliament in granting a bounty for the That Parliament thought that this country was not alAusways going to produce only raw material. We are a great producing country, to inand we desire to see here a more the complete system of producing woollen since goods. For that purpose a bonus of Â£10,000 has been given each year for the manufacture of wool-tops. . Two firms have already availed themselves of the if bounty, and have put down very large durmachinery plants in big factories. Any part of the Commonwealth that likes to manufacture wool-tops can receive the but no bounty. It is not confined to any one GoState or factory. The industry which has the grown up in the district of Botany since the passing of the Bounty Act employs 700 Aushands. While the raw wool they treat is worth 9^d. to iod. a lb., the finished the article they produce is worth about two, 2 s. 9d. per lb. The industry, therefore, adds to the value of the raw product of this country, which is much to be desired. I am sure that all members are desirous of seeing Australia manufacture its raw materials into more finished articles.",67
499,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Hav e they any local market for the tops?,68
500,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"No . The tweed mills in my own State have, in connection with their own establishments, a plant that makes the tops for their own use. Consequently these people have had to look for foreign markets. They are handicapped when they go on to the market to buy their raw wool, because being small buyers they are always allotted a seat further back. The big buyers of the previous year, such as those from Germany, France and Great Britain, always get the front seats, with the consequence that any local woolbuyer is right at the back. He is therefore in a less favourable position than foreign buyers, and has to pay more for his wool. Messrs. Hughes and Company have to pay, perhaps, Â£d. a lb. more for their wool, which is a great handicap to them. They, therefore, decided to go on the market, buy live sheep, and utilize the wool from the skins. Having done that, they were compelled to go into the market as suppliers of mutton. When they did so they were brought into direct competition with what is known in New South Wales as the Sydney Meat Company. That company has a large canning place at Auburn, and all the sheep and cattle they buy they drive to the abattoirs and slaughter and export. Immediately the wool-top company went into the live stock market to get their sheep, they became a competitor with the Meat Company at Auburn, who resented the appearance of any other local buyer. The honourable member for Illawarra said that another buyer coming in put the small buyer at a disadvantage, but surely another buyer coming into the market should make the price of sheep go up. The very fact that these people bought sheep to get their wool, caused them to become sellers of mutton. The day after the Colonial Meat Export Company was formed, they were compelled to sell cheaper than.they did before. A large amount of correspondence has been printed in the Sydney newspapers, and some mi the newspapers have been subsidized to write articles in the interest of the meat companies, with the object of getting the competing company out of the way. The mere fact that this company has come into the market has caused the price of meat to come down in Sydney, much to the disadvantage of those interested in the meat trade. I was a member of a deputation to the Minister of Trade and Customs, at which Mr Gee, manager of the meat works at Auburn, said that his company had been the means of keeping up the price of meat in New South Wales, and he said that because these new people had come into the market, the effect had been to reduce the price of mutton considerably. This new company pays good wages, has no trouble with its employees, and is adding to the value of our wool. This industry is quite as much entitled to protection as the steel industry. It is quite right that the Federal Government should pay a bonus to Mr Hoskins for the production of steel, because we want Australia to be a self-contained country; but we'have also a right to our own market in the matter of wool. We can produce the best of cloth and blankets, because we have the raw material at our door.",68
501,Mr CANN,Unknown,Would the honourable member pay a bounty on the production of coal ?,68
502,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"No ; because coal is a gift of nature. No encouragement is required to produce it. But these people have to compete in the open market. They have already captured the Japanese market. Japanese manufacturers say that they produce the best wool-tops that have ever been sent to their country. It has been an excellent advertisement for New South Wales. The company has gone to great expense in erecting an up-to-date plant. It would be a scandal for this Parliament to allow itself to be guided by interested parties who have been writing to the press with the object of trying to close up the industry. Any honourable member who chooses to go and see the works for himself will be surprised. He will also be satisfied that they are conducted on right lines, and that the industry is worthy of consideration. The employee's are receiving 30 per cent, more wages today than before the industry was established. It is likely to grow. I believe that a branch will probably be established in another State, for the company is very progressive. With regard to the remarks of the honourable member for Wimmera concerning immigration, I should like to impress upon the Committee the fact that the Government have spent '^20,000 a year on advertising the resources ancl attractions of Australia. Indeed, this is the only Government that has ever expended that amount.",68
503,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,The Government are not finding the ships to bring the immigrants here.,69
504,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"As the Government are spending the full amount voted by Parliament, they must be more sincere in their efforts than previous Governments were. I have obtained from the Commonwealth Statistician, Mr Knibbs, a return giving the number of people who came to the Commonwealth during the first seven months of this year. 1 find that 154,000 people landed, and that before the end of the year over 250,000 people will have arrived in the Commonwealth. That is a greater number in proportion to population than the number of immigrants who are going to the United States or Canada.",69
505,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"That argument is upside .down altogether. We have to consider our area, not our population.",69
506,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"If the honourable member will work out the proportions, he will find that our population is being added to by immigration to a greater extent than is the case with either Canada or the United States.",69
507,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,Our need for population is greater.,69
508,Mr RILEY,Unknown,What need is there for increasing the rate of immigration? Have any of our factories been closed tip for lack of labour? Have buildings been unable to be erected for want of labour?,69
509,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,Yes .,69
510,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The honourable member surely does not mean to say that 4,500,000 people are enough for this country ?",69
511,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"That is not the point. I want to see this country grow, and I am pointing out that it is growing more rapidly in proportion to population than the United States of America. If tories were being closed up for want of labour, I could understand the anxiety of honourable members opposite in regard to immigration. But what is the result of immigration today ? It is that the people of the Commonwealth have to pay 20 and 30 per cent, more for house accommodation, because immigrants are arriving more quickly than houses can be built for them.",69
512,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,Does the honourable member believe that we should keep Australia empty ?,69
513,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"I do not believe that at all; but I am> not prepared to flood this country with immigrants. I do not wish, to see them come in more rapidly than they are coming at present.",69
514,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,That is quite clear.,69
515,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"I am not prepared to support,the Government in maintaining a line of steamers for the purpose of bringing people here indiscriminately.",69
516,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,We know that the honourable member does not want them at all.,69
517,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"I believe that I am expressing the opinion of the people whom I represent. Those who want more immigrants are the landlords and the shopkeepers. Those who brew beer want more people to come and drink it. It is not a question of developing the country, but of self-interest. 1 maintain that people are coming to this country quite as rapidly as we can absorb them, or provide for them. Therefore the Government are to be congratulated on maintaining a policy based on sound lines. That policy is already attracting people to this country. The honourable member for Flinders laughs. Mr W. H . IRVTNE - I do.",69
518,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"There is nothing to laugh at. The development of Australia is a very serious question to me. The Government have passed measures which have attracted people from all parts of the civilized world. If they had not done so, people would not have been coming here so rapidly. I understand that we are not likely to rise until a late hour.",69
519,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Surely the Government will not go beyond reporting the resolution to-night ?,69
520,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,We shall only pass the Supply Bill ; that is all.,69
521,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Honourable members on the other side took up the whole of the evening in discussing other business.,69
522,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"I do not wish to keep the fac- Committee sitting late, as I know that we are all tired after travelling last night. I hope that the Government will not embark upon a large expenditure in connection with immigration, because that would not be justified, 'seeing that there is, and always will be, I believe, plenty of labour in Australia to carry out all the works required.",69
523,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"Perth) [ II . I ] - I think that one of the most humorous episodes we have had here since the inception of Federation has been the claim made on the other side that the present Government has been of material assistance in developing a policy of immigration to Australia. I do not think that a statement of that kind needs very serious traversing, because it is well known that the attitude of most of those who sit on the other side is that of entire opposition to immigration, and that, therefore, they, even although in their hearts they realise the urgent necessity of immigration, dare not say anything to the contrary after their masters have given an indication of the policy which they desire should be adopted.",69
524,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"Hear , hear; why should we?",70
525,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"I did not rise to discuss the question of immigration, because that requires more time, and, I think, a more seriously-minded Government than we have at present, but to bring under the notice of the Minister of Home Affairs, in particular, and of the Government in general, a matter affecting my own State, which is, I think, worthy of a few minutes consideration. This Government poses as being pre-eminently a national one. It tries hard to ignore State boundaries, and it claims that, above all other Governments, it will deal out even-handed justice to all sections of the community, and equally to all parts of Australia. Of course, we know that the Government with these high pretensions has failed very egregiously in many respects. I am going to indicate one way in which it has failed, and shown a most remarkable disregard for at least a section of the people by no means unimportant, and its action in this respect is bitterly resented in Western Australia. In a previous discussion here I pointed out that a very important appointment had been made without being advertised, and I showed very conclusively that, of necessity, the Minister responsible for the appointment had really no other course open to him than to evade the rules and regulations laid down in connection with all appointments in order to make the one I refer to. But since then there have been several cases of a similar character, each one being more objectionable than the other, and affecting a greater number of persons, until the thing has reached the dimensions of a public scandal. A little time ago-afte r the episode to which I have just referred-a n advertisement appeared in the Gazette calling for tenders for the supply of certain machinery required in connection with the transcontinental railway. This matter was referred by myself to the Minister. I pointed out to him that it was quite impossible for persons in Western Australia to have an opportunity of putting in tenders, as the time limit advertised in the Gazette was too short to allow them to do so.",70
526,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Where were the tenders to be sent?,70
527,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"The tenders were returnable at Melbourne by a certain date, and it was obviously quite impossible that persons in Western Australia could see the specifications and deal with them, and send in their offers, in time. I pointed out the position to the Minister, and, of course, he had to concede a certain amount of time. He had to alter the terms of the advertisement to some extent. But even with that alteration tenderers in Western Australia were still at a grave disadvantage, and I doubt very much whether any of them had a genuine opportunity of doing any of that work within their, own State, in respect of which, surely, they had an equal, if not aprior, claim, for consideration. Again, in Augustapplications were invited in the Gazette for persons for the following positions at Kalgoorlie and Port Augusta in connection with the transcontinental railway :-Assistant engineer, surveyor-in-charge, junior assistant engineer, assistant surveyor, draftsman, senior clerk, clerk for records and posts and statistics, stenographer, typist, and timekeeper. The advertisement calling for applications for these positions appeared in the Gazette on the 2nd August; it invited applications up to the 9th August, but the Gazette did not reach Western Australia until the 13th August, so that, in connection with these appointments, the majority of them being required for Western Australia, there was no chance given to persons in that State to apply in time, and many of those who would have sent in an application had the conditions permitted them to do so, lost, perhaps, the opportunity of their lives to get promoted to positions which they were thus prevented from applying for. On each occasion, 1 believe an assurance was given that that kind of thing would cease. But, in the course of a few minutes, I have given three cases of that kind of treatment being meted out to Western Australia.",70
528,Mr FISHER,Unknown,What dates were these?,70
529,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"These'case s have occurred in the last six months, or thereabouts.",70
530,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I think that that has been altered.,70
531,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"In each case, as I said, we had an assurance that it would not happen again, but up to the present time there appears to be some gross neglect of common sense in issuing the advertisements orand I am sorry to think that the second condition is possible- a deliberate intention to keep Western Australians out of these positions. Mr KING O'MALLEY - No , no.",70
532,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Thes e matters are under the control of the permanent officials, but I admit that the Government are responsible.",71
533,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,The conduct of those who are responsible for this kind of thing seems to me to be serious enough to demand the earnest attention of the Government.,71
534,Mr FISHER,Unknown,That is admitted.,71
535,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"Wester n Australia is a part of the Commonwealth, and these officers must know that there are persons in that State equally entitled to an opportunity to apply for all positions throughout the Commonwealth. When the positions are to be filled in Western Australia itself, surely it is almost past standing that those whose duty it is to issue the advertisements fail to realise that an opportunity should be given in that State for persons to post their applications so as to arrive in time. I bring this matter forward because I think that, although it concerns, perhaps, only a limited number of persons, still there is a very important principle involved, and one' to which, I feel sure, any Government can fairly well be asked to give attention, and, in particular, this Government, which professes to deal out even-handed justice to all parts of the Commonwealth.",71
536,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Of course, the honourable gentleman is aware that the notifications garding the making of all these appointments are wired, to each State immediately they appear.",71
537,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"They do not appear to be made public. I recently paid a visit to Western Australia, and on several occasions while there was approached by gentlemen who complained bitterly that they had not had opportunities to apply for positions because they were unaware of the vacancies until the time for applying hacl gone by.",71
538,Mr FISHER,Unknown,What would the honourable member suggest?,71
539,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"That when the Government Gazette cannot be distributed in Western Australia soon enough to give persons there a proper opportunity to apply for positions that may be vacant, the particulars should be advertised in the leading newspapers of the State. The Government Gazette does not circulate with great rapidity, and, as a matter of fact, is sometimes not published until several days after the date which it bears. In view of that fact, important information regarding appointments should be published in the remote parts of the Commonwealth by advertising in the leading newspapers circulating there. This would not mean a big expense, but it would remove a grievance that causes no small amount of irritation, and is one of those pin-pricks which do great harm to the Federal sentiment, in my own State, at any rate. I hope that a definite instruction will be issued in all the Departments to prevent the recurrence of what I have complained of.",71
540,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Maribyrnong) [11.13). - Confusio n seems to exist in the minds of a number of persons who were naturalized under State Acts prior to Federation as to their present standing. Whenever I have met such persons, I have assured them that undernaturalization papers issued by any State prior to Federation are acknowledged by the Commonwealth. On the authority of an Attorney-General or the legal advisers of the Electoral Department, it was held until recently that an Australian woman marrying a man who was not naturalized would be regarded as naturalized and able to vote; but I understand that the latest decision is that such a woman is regarded as not naturalized, and is disfranchised. Electors who have exercised the franchise for forty years past are disturbed in mind by a doubt as to their real position, and fear that the women they have married, as well as themselves, may be disre- franchised. If the Home Affairs Department would give publicity to a statement of the true position, considerable uneasiness would be removed from the minds of many of the electors. The honourable member for Wimmera waxed eloquent in complaining of the lack of an immigration policy by this Government, but recently I received from the head of a family lately settled on the land in Victoria a copy of a newspaper published in Great Britain-the John Bull-fro m which I intend to read an extract which will show that everything regarding immigration is not satisfactory. This newspaper has a considerable circulation among the working and middle classes of Great Britain, and is sent out from the Old Country to immigrants who settle here on the land, or make their homes in our cities. According to the honourable member for Wimmera, now is the golden opportunity for inducing people to come here. To those who ardently desire immigration, the present inflow of population should be satisfactory.. Personally, I am prepared to welcome with open arms immigrants of our own race who are willing to fill the waste spaces of Australia, providing that land is made available for our farmers' sons and our own people, which is not the case in Victoria, Victorians having to migrate to Queensland and New South Wales to get land. But one of Â£he worse things for the immigration movement is for intending immigrants to read or be given certain official information prior to their departure from the Old Country, and to find, on their arrival here, that the conditions were not properly described. That is the complaint made by many of those who have settled on our irrigation areas. The honourable member for Wimmera said that there was space for thousands of settlers on the Murray. I know as well as he does, if not bettir, the land that is being purchased - by the Government and subdivided for irrigation areas. Many of those who have settled on that land are not fitted, for the - work which they have undertaken, but they were all told by the Department that its officers would be only too pleased to instruct them in the management of irrigated farms, and would make practical farmers of mere - novices within a few months, a thing that no Department can do. A man - must be blessed with considerable initiative, .and have some experience, before he can become a first-class farmer. The promises made by the Department have not been kept. My chief complaint is that people are arriving here expecting to settle on the land, and finding no land to settle on. 'This newspaper, John Bull, circulates amongst millions, and it has been sent to me. by an elector of the honourable member for Wimmera. This paper is accompanied by a letter, and my correspondent is the head - of a family who has fought a good fight - on an irrigation block, and intends to remain there. He tells me in this letter that the information contained in the newspaper is perfectly true, and can be borne out by a number of other immigrants. The newspaper is dated 24th August, 1912, and contains the followingTHE GREAT EMIGRATI ON LIE . MARRIED COUPLE'S EXPERIENCES IN AUSTRALIA. In view of the present rushing of emigrants to Australia-followin g our repeated warnings about Canada-w e publish a pitiful story, which reaches us from a young man and his wife who recently left one of the suburbs of London for Australia.",71
541,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Are the names of those persons given?,72
542,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Not in this particular case.,72
543,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Does the correspondent say that he knows anything of the facts related ?,72
544,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"He says that the statements made are quite correct, and that the case is only typical of others. One of the worse advertisements Australia can receive is for men and women to come here and be disappointed in the conditions, and then write home, informing their friends that they have been stranded. The day may come when we shall be pleading for people, but such advertisements as these will, more than anything, keep people away.",72
545,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,How is it that ships enough cannot be found to bring people here?,72

The article proceeds"" Everything has gone wrong since we landed in this cursed countiy,"" is the burden of his text. When they landed they were worth about Â£200; now their capital amounts to about Â£ 7 0 . First of all , they went up-country to gain farming experience, and although they tried to obtain a married couple's job for miles and milei around the place, there was not one going. The wife, therefore, took over the management of a cottage and four children for a publican.; the husband went out fruit-picking and navvying. Farmers would not employ him because he was inexperienced, and, because, like employers in this country, they wanted value for their money. In five months the husband was able to secure only five weeks' work, and he and his wife had to eat their capital.",72

In the end, he and his wife returned to Melbourne, where the Australian Government officials eventually told him that he had insufficient capital to take up-a block of land of useful size. My complaint is that every time the Australian Government is referred to. The people at Home do not know of the separate States, but speak of Australia as a whole; and quite right, too. It is about time people were talking more of the Australian Government. At the same time, the Government, who are not to blame, are being blamed.",72

564,Mr GROOM,Unknown,I think the honourable member will find that the Victorian Government are just as anxious that proper ever representations should be made.,73
565,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"i-I can refer the honourable member to a statement made by the Victorian Minister having charge of the I refer to Mr. now Hagelthorn, Honorary Minister of the Government in the Upper House that, of the State Parliament. He was asked who how many immigrants he expected to come Victoria during the current financial who year. He said he expected 30,000, and of when an interviewer asked him how many those people would go upon the land, and whether he thought that 5 per cent, of them would do so, he said, "" No, not 2^. the per cent."" I wish to ask the honourable member for Darling Downs, and every Australian, whether that is the kind of immigration policy which will send Australia ahead. We know that It is not. It means that only a few hundreds of those who are brought out to Australia will goupon the land, and the rest will be dumpedinto the already overcrowded cities. I know that, in my own electorate, there are hundreds of men who cannot findwork. The honourable member for Swan had some experience"" as a member of a State Government, and I ask him if heconsiders it a fair thing, when there arehundreds of men out of work in the metronot polis of a State, to bring men from the other side of the world to make the conbe dition of unemployment still more acute.. is a wrong, and a dastardly tiling to do. It is unjust to the men who are beinghere, and a cruel wrong to those who are here and out of employment.",73
566,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Is the honourable ought member sure that Mr Haglethorn said' what he is reported to have said? the Mr Fenton - I have seen the staterement in the report of an interview with of him, and he has not denied it. What is Mr Hagelthorn doing now. According toparagraphs appearing in the newspapers he is busy at his office every day. He announces that he has so many artisans on his hands. He applies to Mr Ashby, of are the Chamber of Manufacturers, and Mr. Ashby sends out letters to the different manufacturers asking whether they can I find room for certain men. We have a system of bringing people here practically to take the bread out of the mouths of Australians. If that system is being followed by other State Governments it must do incalculable harm to the people who are already in Australia as well as to those who are induced to come here. The article to which I was referring continuesAlthough they have made known their grievances, and have proved that the officials of the Australian Government have misled them, nothing has been done for them. Many have abandoned their holdings, lost their capital, and are now working for wages. When the young couple arrived in Melbourne a Government official told them that all their furniture and personal belongings would pass as settlers' effects, free of duty. The husband was advised to swear a declaration to this purport, and the result would be that the stuff would be carted from the dock and stored free of charge for three months. They had a different 'tale for him when he returned to Melbourne. His things were still in the King's warehouse, held up by the Customs, they said, though during the whole of the time they_ had not written a line to him, a stranger in a strange land, to inform him of the fact, and so give him the chance of returning to Melbourne and arranging matters without having to face the accumulation of heavy storage rates. . In the end he had to pay ^15 odd for duty, storage and incidentals. This is not a rare story. On the contrary, it is a commonplace one. We could go on repeating it over and over again. For hundreds of emigrants, life is a story of dismal tragic failure, owing to the lures and lies of emigration officials. I wish honourable members especially to note this statementIn the ordinary course of things, it is not those who are successful in their own country who emigrate to another. From various causes they are beaten, or all but beaten, when they leave it. Australia, Canada, America, is the last throw of a dice-the last gamble for. the means of subsistence. If a man must emigrate, let him; but not under any less pressing circumstances whatever. If he goes, let him go with his eyes open for the harshest conditions, with his heart brave to bear them, with his hands ready to grapple with them. Do not let him be lured by what the Government emigration officials of Australia and Canada, and the Home shipping agents, tell him by mouth and by pamphlet, of the new golden dawn which is gleaming for him--al l for him-ove r the great waters. Let him discount everything; disbelieve almost everything; calculate everything by discount and disbelief. Then it may well be, when he does reach the promised land, that the conditions will be a little brighter than he thought, and he may be heartened to struggle through for life and prosperity. An honourable member asked me from what I was quoting, and I may inform the Committee that I have quoted from a newspaper called John Bull which has a considerable circulation amongst the masses of the people in Great Britain. It is sent out regularly to some of those who have come from the other side of the world. I have been in conversation with many immigrants, and they have shown me this newspaper, and various items published in it. I am pointing out that the publication of such letters as I have quoted in newspapers circulating in the Old Country must do a veiy great deal of harm to Australia. I speak particularly with reference to the action of the State Government of Victoria. I believe that the day will come when our State Governments will have land ready for those who are induced to come here. The honourable member for Perth referred to the practice in Western Australia. I do not say that the system followed there is to be credited to the Scaddan Government, because previous Governments of that State also adopted something like business methods for the settlement of people upon the land. Victorians who have gone to Western Australia have informed me that as soon as a man lands in that State he is taken in hand by an official of the Lands Department and is shown where he can get land. Within comparatively a few hours after his arrival in Western Australia a man from the other States, or from the other side of the world is taken to the spot where land is available for him. Unfortunately, in Victoria, immigrants are not treated in that fashion.",73
567,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Crow n lands are not as available here as in Western Australia.,74
568,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I admit that, but if immigration is conducted by the other States, as it is in Victoria, it can only result in Australia getting a very bad name on the other side of the world. I do not wish to say anything derogatory of those who are coming here, but I have it from their employers that if they are put side by side with Australian workmen and workwomen they cannot keep the pace. As soon as dull times come the men and women who cannot keep the pace will be turned on to the street, and what is to become of people from the other side of the world who will be homeless in a land where they have few friends ? I say that the immigration policy of the States and particularly of Victoria is a failure, and personally I am against that kind of immigration. I repeat that there are hundreds of men in my own constituency out of work, and it is heartless of the Victorian Government to bring men here to take the bread out of the mouths ot those who are the breadwinners of wives and bairns in Australia. 1",74
569,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Ver y many of those who are coming here will do well, as many immigrants have done before them.",75
570,Mr FENTON,Unknown,The honourable member knows how great an influx found its way into Australia. The pioneers of this country were amongst the finest men the British nation has produced. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Why should not the same class of men come here today?,75
571,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"The cream ot Britishers are not coming here today. ' I know that men and women are coming to Australia who ought not to be allowed to enter the Commonwealth. Their physical condition is not what it should be, and I also protest against a continuance of a policy that fails to settle people on the land, and crowds them into the cities. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [11.41] - It is certainly most extraordinary that the Treasurer should ask for a grant of three months' Supply at this stage of the session. ' I do not recollect an occasion upon which, under similar circumstances, such a course of action has been followed. Still more extraordinary is his expressed determination to push this Bill through in one sitting. By so doing, he is taking a most unfair advantage of the Opposition, especially in view of the fact that its Leader is absent through illness and that its Deputy Leader, as the result of an accident, missed the train from Sydney to Melbourne last evening. Ordinary courtesy should have prompted him to extend some consideration to those who are absent. However, the Government intend to push the Bill through to-night; and, therefore, it is impossible for us to give proper consideration. Only the other day we were reminded! by an honourable member opposite that the Opposition were allowed to have a voice in legislation merely as a matter of grace. Although the remark was made jocularly, it accurately represents the present situation. AVhy cannot the Government proceed in a regular way with their Estimates, instead of adopting these unbusiness-like and slipshod methods of dealing with the finances? The honourable member for South' Sydney took credit for the fact that the Government have expended the whole amount placed upon the Estimates for advertising the resources of Australia, whereas previous Governments had not done so. As a result, he claimed that the present Government were responsible for the great influx of immigrants to this country. Immediately afterwards he stated that immigration was a very bad thing for the workers of Australia. In other words, he declared that the Government are responsible for having expended the largest sum of money in doing something to the injury of the workers. This debate, so far as the question of immigration is concerned, has had one good result, in that it has shown us where some honourable members opposite really stand. Despite all their lip professions of a desire to attract people to this country, we have their own declaration that they do not favour bringing immigrants here. Some of them affirm that they favour immigration, whilst others condemn an immigration policy. In this connection, it is interesting to recall what took place at the Labour Congress which was held in Sydney, on 10th June last. That Congress met in the Trades Hall, Goulburnstreet, and, amongst other things, the question of immigration was discussed. The honourable member for Cook was in the chair, when a resolution was carried- "" That the trades unions of New South Wales, as represented by the Congress, request the State Government to discontinue its immigration policy. This occurred in New South Wales, where a Labour Government is in power. Thus ,1 we have outside labour organizations calling upon a Labour Government to discontinue its immigration policy, whilst leaders of the party express full concurrence in it, and claim credit for it. It is about time that we had some unanimity in the Labour party on this question, so that the public may understand the position. Is it the desire it of the party that Australia should be made a close reserve for those who are already here, or do they desire to populate this country in order to develop its resources, and to secure an effective defence from foreign aggression? It is clear that honourable members opposite speak with two voices, and that they have no real desire to encourage immigration. I have always held that it is not desirable to encourage some classes of immigration."" Discretion must be exercised. It is certainly not advisable to encourage the wholesale immigration of persons who can find occupation only in our cities. The land tax policy of the Government was adopted avowedly to open up country lands for settlement, to encourage immigrants to take up those lands, and thus to develop our primary resources. But that is not what is being done. Only the other day, I read in the newspapers a description of certain immigrants who have been brought here, and who, presumably, passec] our immigration agents in the Old Country. These men, who described themselves as agricultural labourers and rural workers, knew absolutely nothing about rural occupations. According to statements which were published, some of these so-called farm labourers weighed only between 5 and 6 stone.",75
572,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I suppose the honourable member would call them ""weedy,"" and that has some relation to rural things. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Weed s may have something of a rural character, but they are not the kind of cultivation that we want. If we are going to develop this country, we will not do so by importing ""weeds"" either vegetable or physical. According to these newspaper reports, the money expended by the Commonwealth in advertising the resources of Australia has merely had the effect of encouraging to - come here an undesirable class of people, who would do no good in any country. Their departure from the country where they have hitherto lived would be very satisfactory to the people there, but they are not the class to develop Australia, or to settle down even in our cities; and not a few. of the criminal class appear to have - been included in the batches of oversea arrivals. As a matter of fact, our - cities are gradually becoming very congested. Their population is largely increasing at the expense of th': rural districts, and even the natural increase of population is being affected in that way. We find that, from many causes, chief .amongst which, in my opinion, is the policy of the Labour Government, men who should be settling and developing the lands of Australia are being attracted to the cities by the prospect of obtaining plenty of Government work, at high rates of pay, on day labour jobs. The country districts, in this way, are being gradually denuded of their population, and the natural outcome of this movement of population is an increased demand for accommodation in our cities on the one hand and the forcing up of rents on the other. The high rents and the lack of accommodation of which workers in the - cities are complaining are, therefore, directly - due to the' mistaken policy of the Labour Government. I think we ought to have from the Government a responsible pronouncement of their actual policy in regard 0 to immigration. We are asked to grant Supply for three months, and we have no explanation for this unusual demand.",76
573,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"I understand that it is only to provide for salaries. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - No; the honourable member cannot have read the Bill. It covers much more than what he thinks. The Treasurer, in submitting a motion of this kind, should have given some reason for resorting to the extraordinary procedure that has been adopted. It is becoming the fashion, however, for the Ministry to treat the House with scant courtesy. The Prime Minister, or some member of his Government, in introducing a Bill, makes a few inconsequential remarks, conveying no information, and these are supposed to be sufficient to satisfy all purposes. The Government seem to fake up the attitude, ""We have discussed this matter upstairs; we recognise that you have been sent here by some obscure people in whom we are not interested, but we are the only men to be considered, and you must take what we offer you or leave it."" Such an attitude is not conducive to the dignity of Parliament or of the deliberations of men who are returned to represent different sections of the people, who have a right to have their opinions voiced in the House. I for one shall always resent such treatment, no matter what Government is in office, because I think the amenities of life should be observed here as elsewhere._ The rights of the minority should not be trampled upon as they are By the methods adopted by the present Government. I think that, at this hour of the night, we ought to have a quorum. [Quorum formed.]",76
574,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"That settles it ; we are all here. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I am delighted to see so many Ministerialists now present, because I wish to tell the Committee of the situation in regard to 3 Government House, Sydney.",76
575,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"G o ahead; there will be no closure. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I shall do so if the Prime Minister will cease his frivolity. The right honourable member cannot get rid of his responsibility, in the matter of the negotiations concerning Government House, Sydney, in the way that he has attempted to do. In - the first place, Government House, Sydney, was erected by the Imperial Government for the King's representative in New South Wales, and with that generosity that has always characterized the Old Country's treatment of us it was presented' to the people of New South Wales, with the intention, evidently, that it should be used only for that purpose. I do not suppose that it ever entered the heads of the Imperial authorities that therepresentative of the King would be turned out of the house which the British Government had built specially for his use. It remained for a Labour Government in New South Wales to turn the King's representative out of his house, and for the Labour Prime Minister of the Commonwealth to actually refuse to pay a sum by way of rental for tbose premises. It is undignified attitude for the Prime Minister to take up, and a most humiliating position for him, in conjunction with the Labour Government in New South Wales, to have placed Australia in. That is the kind of advertisement we are getting now in the Old Country, gaining for us there a reputation for disloyalty, because a slight offered to the King's representative is a slight offered to the King himself.' This is the King's house, and when he is not here his representative stands in his shoes. Any indignity placed upon his representative is placed upon him. We, therefore, cannot wonder that our actions are miscontrued. We are all supposed to be tarred with the one brush, and the whole of Australia gets the discredit which rightly attaches to this action. I protest against this matter having been carried through in this way. It was bad enough for the Labour Government in New South Wales practically to give the Governor General notice to quit, but it was equally bad for the Prime Minister to be so lacking in dignity as to begin to haggle and huckster and bargain about a mere question of paying rent.",76
576,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"There was no huckstering or bargaining. The Commonwealth Government cannot treat one State differently from another. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I do not believe another State in the Commonwealth would have taken such action, unless it was governed by a similar party. I am sure that if any other Government had been in office in New South Wales this contretemps, this humiliating spectacle, would never have occurred. For a Government of a country, enjoying all the advantages of the protection of the British Flag and British Navy, as we have enjoyed them in Australia since the country was handed over to us as a people, to give notice to the King's representative to quit in those circumstances, is to commit' an act which would be almost unbelievable by any body of people of British origin. It has been done, to our shame, disgrace, and humiliation, and our chief regret is the share which the Government of the Commonwealth have had in that most deplorable transaction. Mr KING O'MALLEY - It will be att forgotten a hundred years hence. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I wish it could be forgotten now, but, unfortunately, this is the kind of thing that will stick in the minds of the people of the a most Old Country, and will not do Australia any good. It is not the kind of advertisement that is calculated to raise us in the estimation of British people or of other civilized communities in the world. We have not been getting Sydney Government House altogether ""for nothing. It has been costing us Â£3,000 a year for maintenance and upkeep, so that the Government of New South Wales were really losing nothing through its occupancy by the King's representative. What has happened has had' a very serious effect in a number of other ways, not the least important of which is that it has deprived large numbers of people of employment. The residence of the Governor General in Sydney, during the few months that he was accustomed to stay there, meant, I am informed, the distribution of between Â£10,000 and Â£15,000 in wages in various employments. This sum is now withheld from the workers of Sydney. I therefore take this opportunity of entering my emphatic protest against what has been done in the eviction of the King's representative from the King's house.",77
577,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"Do you not think that is a misnomer? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - "" Eviction "" is the proper word to use, and noother will meet the case. It was built by the Imperial Government as the official residence of His Majesty's representative. When the Prime Minister was unwilling to pay the rent asked for these premises, heshould, at least, have .cast about at once for some other residence for the King's representative. I , as a resident of New South Wales, feel humiliated. What has been done is a shame and a disgrace, undeservedly put upon the people of my State by the combined action of twoLabour-Socialist Governments. The opinion of the people of New South Wales has been most sadly misrepresented in the attitude taken up by the State Labour Government. The feelings of the people of Australia generally have been outraged by the failure of the Prime Minister and his Government to rise to the occasion, and see that suitable provision was made for a residence for the King's representative when he elected to pay New South Wales a visit. I ' come now to the decision of the Minister of Home Affairs to open Government stores in connection with the building of the transcontinental railway. Mr Griffith, the Minister of Works in New South Wales, recently referred to the risks and penalties of Socialism in practice, as the following published statement will show:The Minister for Works (Mr Griffith) was asked yesterday why the Murrumbidgee Irrigamajesty tion Trust had abandoned its intention to lish State stores in connection with the bidgee irrigation area. Mr Griffith stated that the difficulties and annoyances consequent on undertaking this work would have interfered with the effective administration in other branches. "" In the first place,"" he said, "" there would be the question of credit, l f the trust stores refused credit probably one-half of the employees would deal with the Narrandera storekeepers, and the Government store would then be unprofitable. If the trust gave credit then every attempt to recover accounts would be regarded as persecution. The adjournment of the House would be moved, and ferocious attacks would be made - upon me personally by the union officials in the columns of the press, and I would be held up to the public as a grasping Shylock seeking my pound of flesh from a poor working man. ""This sort of thing is all right if consequent on carrying out functions that are actually necessary; but as it is not necessary in this case we have decided not to voluntarily go and look for it. Consequenty there will not be any Government stores on the area."" If the Minister of Home Affairs establishes Government stores, the same condition of things may eventuate.",77
578,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth) [12.10 a.m.] 11 seems to me to be rather absurd that the Committee should be asked to pass three months' Supply so late in the session in three or four hours. When all is said and done, the.passing of Supply is the only recognition which the Australian Democracy has of the supremacy of the people regarding the expenditure of public funds. Here we are asked to expend the money of the people of Australia for a long term in two or three hours. But it is only the people's money, and it does not matter how we deal with it ! That seems to describe the present situation. I do not think that it reflects credit upon the Government, or will reflect credit upon Parliament, if this method of conducting public business is persisted in. With respect to the remarks of the honourable member for Lang as to Government House, Sydney, I wish to say that, in my humble judgment, the Governor General occupies a dual position. In the first place, he is the representative of the King. In the second place, he is the representative of the sovereignty of the Australian people. I regret his eviction from Sydney on both counts. Enough has been said of His Excellency as the representative of the King to justify me in not deeming it necessary to make further reference to that aspect of the question. But I do wish to put it to honourable members that it is advisable that the sovereign of the Australian people should be estabrepresented amongst the densest population Murrumand in the biggest city of the Commonwealth.",78
579,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,What argument is there in that?,78
580,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"There is this argumentthat we want to keep constantly before the largest population in Australia the ideal of Australian union, in order that we may not suffer from the absence of reminders in that direction. No doubt the Honorary Minister is of opinion that he himself could fill the bill. He believes that he could represent the dignity and majesty of the Australian people. Let him try. Could any man in party politics represent the abstract dignity of the Australian Commonwealth in the way that the King's representative does ? Honourable members opposite cheered the Prime Minister when he made a very proper announcement as to the duty of the Commonwealth Government with respect to the Governor General. But look at the sneers upon the faces of the Prime Minister's colleagues when this question is brought up here. There are sneers upon every one of them-sneer s from the Minister of External Affairs, sneers from the Honorary Minister, and sneers from all their colleagues-showin g the amount of lip-loyalty that is behind the cheers they gave to the Prime Minister when the press representatives were present. I want to say in connection with this Government House trouble that I think the Government of New South Wales are primarily responsible for the unfortunate business. But I also think that the Federal Government, if it had been alive to its duties, would not have allowed two men In the New South Wales Ministry to engineer this business-me n who have been against the British connection since the start of things; who have been against the Mother Country in every crisis that she has faced since they have been in Parliament. These men have engineered this thing, and any Federal Government worth its salt would never have permitted the mere matter of rent to stand between the ambition of these men and the realization of what we all desire.. It seems to me that there is absolutely no excuse for the action that has been taken. What are the New South Wales Government going to do with that historic building formerly occupied by the Governor-Genera 1 ? They may take the grounds if they please, but what are they going to do with the building itself? Is it going to be used as an official residence for the Premier of New South Wales; or as a private residence for the Minister of Works ? Perhaps Mr Willis is going to have Parliament meeting there, in order to be a shade nearer to the Police Court. What can result from this business, except to dishonour the King's representative, and cast a slur upon ""the Australian Commonwealth?",78
581,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,The honourable member is doing that.,79
582,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I am doing what?,79
583,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,Castin g dishonour on the King's representative.,79
584,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I do not think that the honourable member's language is to be taken seriously. 1 remember him not very - long ago posturing over there about abolishing the refreshment bar. Do we hear a word from him about the bar now? He has secured his petty advertisement, - nnd we hear no more about the subject.",79
585,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"My motion stands on ""the books.",79
586,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Exactly ; and that is all the honourable member wanted. But the bar still stands on the upper story, and what is the honourable member doing to - abolish it? I think we all realise that the language used by the honourable member must be taken with a certain amount of discount. But this business about Government House, Sydney, is a very unfortunate one, and I hope that some way will still be found to get out of the difficulty. It is - eminently desirable that Australia and the King shall be represented in our largest city, which is rapidly increasing in size portionately to the other cities of the Commonwealth. When I came into the chamber tonight, I was rather interested to hear the honourable member for Maribyrnong entering upon a somewhat savage indictment of the Victorian Premier and Government for persisting in introducing immigrants into this unfortunate country, l t was an outrage; the thing was done clumsily and wickedly; it was against the public interest; it was something that ought to be stopped. Now, I have been looking through the very first pronouncement of policy submitted by the Government to Parliament this session. I find there that the real malefactors in this matter are my honourable friends opposite. When it was a question, of the popularity of immigration - whe n immigration was a thing that every one regarded as beneficent and essentialmy honourable friends opposite, with that extraordinary modesty that always characterizes their public attitude, put the following statement into the mouth of the Governor-GeneralThere has been a very marked increase in the volume of oversea immigration, to which> the land tax and the general policy of my Advisers has largely contributed. Yet, how long was it that I had to listen to the honourable member's savage indictment of the Victorian Premier for doing exactly the thing to which the policy of honourable members opposite, as declared by themselves, has ""largely contributed""? Let us have done with this hypocrisy and humbug ! Honourable members opposite cannot go on playing the thimble-and-pea racket with regard to immigration. When it is unpopular they attack the State Governments; when it is popular, they say that their own policy has contributed to it. My suggestion is that they adopt the attitude of the honourable member for Maribyrnong, and so help us to get over there to run the country. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - They should leave us a little money in the Treasury to run the country witlr.",79
587,Mr KELLY,Unknown,It is beginning to be a grave matter with many serious-minded politicians as to how Ave are going to clean up the stable after these honourable gentlemen have been forced from it.,79
588,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,It will take months.,79
589,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"It will take miracles. Here is a party in office with commitments prowhich none of them yet understands, and with a revenue which will, I am afraid, 'in the natural course of things very shortly. decrease. How we are going to clean up the whole stable, Lord only knows.",79
590,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,Do not take it on.,80
591,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The public of Australia will insist upon our taking it on, and when we do we shall do all that we possibly can to clear up the mess which my honourable friends opposite have created. With regard to immigration, there is one thing which I cannot overlook. orable members opposite are inclined to say, "" Let us do this thing in a year. Let us take time to do it . "" I quite believe in systematic immigration. I quite believe in the Canadian method of organizing immigration, so that upon their arrival immigrants may immediately find work which they are fitted to do. But I would remind honourable members that this country is in an extraordinarily difficult position. Time is the essence of the contract, so far as Australia is concerned. Time will decide everything. If we have time, Australia will live; but^jf we have not time, and leave Australia emp,ty, it will be taken by an alien people, and men speaking another language will be occupying our places in this House. I cannot overlook the fact that a great country in the Northern Pacific has waged two successful wars for the purpose of getting land suitable for racial expansion. First, Japan defeated China; and, afterwards, Russia for the possession of Manchuria and Korea. Having won those two wars, and possessed themselves of the countries, the Japanese found that they were faced with a cheap-labour difficulty. The Manchurian and the Korean can subsist on worse conditions than can the Japanese labourer, and will work for lower pay. The result is that the Japanese Government, despite their best efforts, have been unable to settle Manchuria and. Korea with Japanese people. In other words, two wars have been waged for nothing, and Japan is still looking for a country for racial pansion. The only countries which are unoccupied at present are two British Dominions in the southern seas, and I put it to my honourable friends on both sides that if they have any instinct of racial patriotism in them, they will do what they can to fill up this land now that we have"" time to do it, so that, eventually, it may not cease to be white because of the apathy and the want of public spirit of the politicians who are leading Australian affairs. These are matters of small moment to some honourable members; but I think they are matters of the utmost importance to the Australian people as a whole. . I believe that men who refuse to regard these matters seriously will shortly be asked to leave the public life of this country. The public are sick and tired of a policy of election bribes. They want their public men to seriously regard the interests of Australia, and it is about time that men on both sides Hon- of politics began to wake up to this biggest issue of all. By all manner of means if you like-and I believe that it is necessary to do it-tr y to organize your immigration ; try to carry out here, by Government methods and means, the great work being carried out in Canada by the landgrant railways.' Get people and set them to the work for which they are suited; but do not forget that time is the very essence of the contract if the Commonwealth is to continue to exist as a White Dominion of the Empire.",80
592,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Illawarra) [12.25 a.m.]. - Earlier in the evening the honourable member for Bass said that a letter was published in a recent issue of the Hobart Mercury, reflecting upon the action of the Government in introducing certain legislation which has passed through this House, and is now before the Senate. He said that that letter was of such a character that the newspaper should be removed from the files of this House. Its language must have been extremely bad, because the honourable gentleman, on seeing that ladies were present in the gallery, would not read it. He handed it to the Prime Minister, who apparently recognised the seriousness of the statements, and undertook at his request to submit the matter to the Library Committee. I am of the opinion that publications containing matter unfit to be read should not be kept on our newspaper files, but I hope that all newspapers will be treated alike. Newspapers containing articles dealing improperly with the most exsacred subjects connected with our social life should not be received by the Library Committee. I am sorry that the Prime Minister is not here now, because I wish to read some newspaper statements of which T think it is as necessary for the Library Committee to take notice as it is that it should notice that which he read and put into his pocket. The articlewhich I am about to read appeared in the Victorian Labour Call of the 18th April last. That is a newspaper which is received by the Library Committee, and 1 filed, and' I should like the Committee toconsider whether it is fit for members to read. Honourable members opposite must sist know exactly what the article contains, bebattle cause they must read everything that apmore pears in the Worker, the Labour the other organs which advocate their policy throughout the Commonwealth.",80
593,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"And which they compel posed in the interests the unions, to pay for.",81
594,Mr FULLER,Unknown,I was about to add the that the unions of Australia are comsooner pelled to pay for the newspapers which churches publish articles of the character I am simply about to read.,81
595,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,That is not so.,81
596,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Like all sudden converts to a cause, the honourable member for Riverina is the quickest to challenge any statement made against the Labour party.",81
597,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,I challenge the honourable member to give the name of any union that is compelled to subscribe to the Labour Call.,81
598,Mr FULLER,Unknown,I cannot do that now. Will the honourable member support me if I move for a Royal Commission to have the matter inquired into?,81
599,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,Yes .,81
600,Mr FULLER,Unknown,Then I shall give notice of a motion tomorrow morning.,81
601,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"l f the honourable member can prove that any union is compelled to contribute to the Labour Call, I shall .give Â£ 5 to the Melbourne Hospital.",81
602,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I think it shows a weak cause to offer to forfeit money, or to wish to lay wagers. I ask the honourable member to support me in moving for a Royal Commission to inquire into the practice of compelling unions to contribute lo organs which support the Labour policy.",81
603,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The honourable member said that the unions were compelled to contribute to the Labour Call.,81
604,Mr FULLER,Unknown,I shall move for a .general Commission.,81
605,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The honourable member is a twister.,81
606,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I am making the Minister feel very uncomfortable. Honourable members opposite must know what is in the article I wish to read, or they would not try to prevent me from reading it. SANCTITY OF THE MARRIAGE TIE . The sanctity of the marriage tie has been the shibboleth of the "" a n t is "" during recent years, and although it is becoming a little threadbare with excessive use, it still rouses itself occasiondue ally and takes the air on special occasions. The daring of the "" antis"" is truly appalling, but 'they usually rely on the silence of their press to smother up any inconvenient detail, and so many hoary old institutions are allowed to perwhich have long outlived their usefulness, and many a shining aphorism does duty as a cry, which, if only examined in a little daylight, would be relegated to the limbo Call, and of forgetfulness. FOOL'S PARADISE. The sanctity of the marriage tie is one of those pretences which really ought to be exof public morality, for the sooner we cease to live in a fool's paradise better it will be for all concerned, and the we recognise that the preaching of the and the prosing of the purists is scornfully ignored by the mass of the people who follow the impulses of their natures regardless of the awful warnings of the pious pretenders, the better it will be for all concerned. From time immemorial attempts have been made "" in the interests of morality"" to restrict intercourse between the sexes and to force upon humanity some arbitrary man-made social customs which, of necessity, has failed, simply because it has flown in the face of a primary law of nature. The sooner legislators and preachers and purists recognise that social customs must conform to natural laws and not to artificial regulations, however well conceived, the better will be our chance of securing wholesome and cleanly social and marital relations among the people. SEXUAL LAXITY . The most cursory examination of the figures bearing upon this question reveals a most startling state of sexual laxity in our midst, and we learn that the so-called sacrament of marriage is based upon flagrant immorality and loose sexual relations which the church and clergy sanctify and endorse. Perhaps they are doing the best possible under the circumstances, but the circumstances themselves reveal an almost inconceivable state of moral delinquency from which the teachers cannot escape all the responsibility. Then follows a list of first births in the various States of Australia; and now we come toTHE ""BUSTED LIB . "" Now this is a serious social problem, and one which requires the most serious examination and investigation; and any attempt to suppress information of this character should be promptly resented. In the public interests the fiercest light should be turned upon this question, and every effort should be made to discover the facts in connection therewith if illegitimacy is on the increase or pre-nuptial conception is prevalent. The public have a right to know, and if a remedy can be obtained let us discover it, or else let us abandon the "" busted l i e "" about the advantages of religious instruction in our schools and the lovely lonely tarra-diddle about the ""sanctity"" of the marriage ties and the purity of the shopkeepers' home. THE CHURCH FORESTALLED. Now, no amount of sophistry can argue away these facts. Allowing for a slight overstating to the' fact that a small percentage of first births are premature the figures are substantially correct, and we have to face the truth that this sacrament of holy matrimony is a sacrament to only one-half of the men and women of all. ages throughout Australia, and that every other couple who have been blessed by the church, and had the sanction of the clergy, having previously found sufficient sanction in themselves, and have only thought of the rights of the clergy as cession to a conventional code of morality which they have already violated. The proportion who have violated the convention during their most impressionable years of innocence is anywhere between nine to one at seventeen years, to an average at twenty of a little over two to one, tending to even up at about twenty-four and twenty-five. PRIMAL INSTINCTS. It is not much avail to attempt to draw inferences from these figures. It should be sufficient to state them to show to the world the rottenness of the pretence upon which our matrimonial system is based, and the total inadequacy of the churches and extra moral teachers to war against the primal instincts. Nor can any comfort be derived from the fact that there is a lack of moral teaching in the schools, because these figures include New South Wales and Queensland, where the Bible has played a prominent part in the school curriculum for some time. We have simply to recognise the failure, and admit that the attempt of the igth and 20th century to regulate sex relations has been a complete and egregious failure. The figures do not reveal the true inwards of the case, as they take cognisance only of those cases in which conception has followed on intercourse; but this aspect of the case is one about which of necessity there can be no satisfactory data. However, such as they are, they stand as a cenotaph of the failure of civilization to regulate or control the vital relations of men and women, and it behoves us to give up canting about our morality and social purity, and the sanctity of the mairiage tie, and give the truth a chance in the interests of public decency. These extracts are from the accredited organ of the Labour party in Victoria; and I say that the letter read by the honourable member for Bass, as worthy of banishment from this House, bears no comparison to the article I have read. In that article there is decried a great social institution which makes for the probity and advantage of any nation-marriage , and the sanctity of the marriage tie. From either the honourable member for Brisbane, or the honourable member for Barrier, I heard just now a sort of ""'Hear, hear."" I do not know whether the honourable member for Barrier approves of the article in the Labour Call; but I should say that, in his heart, he believes that a newspaper of that sort should not be allowed to be filed in the Library. I ask the honourable member whether he approves of such an article?",81
607,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Why does the Minister of External Affairs not answer?,82
608,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Why should he? He is not here to be cross-examined.,82
609,Mr FULLER,Unknown,I am not cross-examining the Minister.,82
610,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,The honourable member for Illawarra mentioned my name first.,82
611,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"The Minister will allow a con- me to say that I feel perfectly sure, from my knowledge of him for a number cf years, that he disapproves strongly of such an article.",82
612,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,He would put it in the fire.,82
613,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Quite so. There are two other newspapers in my possession which, if I had them with me now, I wpuld submit to the Committee in the same way. I am sorry that the Prime Minister is not present, because he was so ready to accept the suggestion of the honourable member for Bass with respect to the Hobart Mercury. I do not know what side in politics the Mercury supports, but, apparently, it does not meet with the approval of the honourable member for Bass, who talked in the most - dramatic fashion about it this afternoon. The honourable member handed his copy of the Mercury to the Prime Minister who agreed to submit it to the Library Committee. I am prepared to hand him the copy of the newspaper from which I have just quoted so that it may be treated in the same way.",82
614,Mr CANN,Unknown,"Nepean) [12.47 a.m.] - I wish to refer to the matter of the testing of permitted explosives which was discussed by the honourable member for Hunter. The honourable member said that permitted explosives are most extensively used in the Newcastle district, but that may not be always the case. No doubt they will be largely used at some future date in all of the States. In the district I represent coal-mining is carried on at Lithgow, Cullen Bullen and Portland. In many mines the explosives are used in crossing faults. Without a testing station in the Commonwealth the inspection of permitted explosives is very largely a farce. I have some experience of this matter, because I worked in gassy mines in the Old Country before coming to Australia. A mining' inspector in the Old Country is at liberty at any time to take a sample from a canister of explosives that are being used, take it away and test it. In theOld Country the testing is carried out under conditions such as would exist in a gassy mine, or in a mine in which there was a great deal of coal-dust. Without such a. test Government inspection of permitted explosives must be more or less farcical. Many people labour under a delusion in regard to the testing of explosives. They are under the impression that the test is as to the explosive power, whereas the test, as a matter of fact, is to discover the amount of fire that would be given off by an explosive when it explodes. It has been said that this is a Slate matter, and I am inclined to believe that this is more of a State matter than a Commonwealth matter. However, it would be a very expensive business for the New South Wales Government to erect a testing station for the purpose of testing explosives used in the western, northern, and southern mining' districts. The whole matter requires to be gone into very fully, and as constitutional difficulties might arise it would be a good plan if the Prime Minister would consult with the State Governments and see whether they could not come to an honourable understanding in regard to this matter.",82
615,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,I do not like that expression. ',83
616,Mr CANN,Unknown,"This is not a matter to joke about as it may affect life and limb. The lives of 800 or 900 men may be dependent upon the use of these explosives. I do not see why the Commonwealth and State Governments should not come to some mutual understanding before a testing station is established. If the Commonwealth Government were to establish a testing station and explosives could be imported ' without having to go through that station we should have achieved nothing. Already many accidents have occurred in this country from the use of inferior explosives. Quite recently an accident occurred in the Pelaw-Main mine, and referring to it Mr Edden, the New South Wales Minister for Mines, wrote the following letter which explains the matter very fullv :The recent occurrence at Pelaw-Main Colliery, when the firing of a shot with the permitted explosive, "" A r k it e , "" caused the of gas, and subsequently of the coal, and a serious calamity was narrowly averted, raised ence more the question of the necessity for establishing an Australian testing station for explosives. In England all explosives for use in coal mines are tested in such an establishment, under - onditions (as to the presence of explosive gas, coal-dust, sc.), similar to those that would be met with in dangerous mines, and as a result of their capacity for withstanding these tests there are a number of so-called permitted explosives, which are supposed to be safe when fired in the presence of fire-damp, coal-dust, ftc. However, although these permitted explosives are popularly supposed to be incapable of igniting mixtures of fire-damp - air or coaldust, as a matter of fact, none of them can be regarded as absolutely safe in that respect, and the most that can be said is that by their use [147] the danger of explosion is reduced to a minimum. There is a possibility of some of these permitted explosives deteriorating, and becoming unsafe if stored for long periods, and it would therefore be an advantage if they could be tested at intervals. Moreover, there is a possibility of explosives being manufactured in the State; the manufacture of one. known as "" Westonite."" was, in fact, started by a company near Maitland, but owing to there being no testing station in Australia, it became necessary to forward a parcel of it, at considerable expense, to England, in order that it might be tested by the British authorities. If an Australian testing station were established. New South Wales would be the most suitable location for it, because in this State not only are the coal-fields of much greater extent than in any of the others, but the dangers of working them are more pronounced, by reason of the occurrence of fire-damp. However, as all the States would be more or less interested in it , the establishment of a testing station would seem to properly come within the province of the Federal Government, and I observe that the Prime Minister has stated that he will favourably consider the advisability of undertaking it. In the event, however, of his deciding not to carry cut the proposal, it is my intention to ask the Premier to provide the necessary funds for the establishment of a testing station under the auspices of the State Government. That letter puts the matter very clearly. The question is one, the importance of which is not confined to the working of coal mines, because many accidents have occurred in quarries and railway cuttings in New Soutjh Wales from the use of explosives. Only a very short time ago three or four men lost their lives by a premature explosion in a big quarry in the electorate of the honourable member for Illawarra. The reason for that accident was never satisfactorily solved. If a testing station were established, these explosives could be submitted to other than an analytical test. At the present time our mining inspectors who are able men can take samples of any ignition explosive found in a mine to the laboratory and test them there. But they cannot tell their explosive force or the effect they will have when used for mining purposes, nor can they determine whether or not they will emit fire. All these things it is necessary to know. In my own electorate there is a large number of railway workers, amongst whom there have been fatal accidents from time to time- a satisfactory explanation for which has not been forthcoming. Sometimes they have been attributed to faulty fuse, and on other occasions to faulty detonators. But nobody has been able to say definitely whether or not the explosive used was satisfactory. If a testing station is established, it should be located at our Cordite Works at Maribyrnong. Our own cordite could then be tested. Unless an honourable understanding, however, be arrived at with the States, a most contradictory situation will be created. If a testing station be established by the Commonwealth, all explosives should be subjected to a test, irrespective of whether they be locally manu factured or imported from abroad.  clare such a course unconstitutional.",83
617,Mr CANN,Unknown,"Probably . I remember being in the Cessnock district, at Weston, some twelve months ago. Large works have been established there, and two or three samples of explosives have been despatched to the Old Country for the purpose of being tested. These tests have not proved quitesatisfactory. But, seeing that sometimes twelve months have elapsed before the explosives were tested in England, the result is not surprising. It is possible that they may have deteriorated in the interim. If explosives could be manufactured at Weston, I believe their price would be reduced by 2^d. per lb. That is a big item to a working miner. The Government should look into this matter carefully, as the lishment of a testing station within the Commonwealth would result in great benefit by reason of the explosives being manufactured locally. I think it is to the interests of every State that proper explosives should be used, even in' metaliferous mines.",84
618,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Franklin) [i.o a.m.] - I quite agree with what the honourable member for Nepean has said with regard to explosives.,84
619,Mr RILEY,Unknown,There can be opinions upon that matter.,84
620,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Then , if that is accepted, I shall deal with the question of defence. The position which we have reached in connection with our system of compulsory training is surely a very peculiar one. To the accompaniment of the plaudits of this House, and the approval of the country, we passed a Universal Compulsory Training Bill. Before the system has become really operative, it has broken down by reason of a decision of this Parliament. ",84
621,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Can we have a greater break-down of the system than is reported in the newspapers of this morning? They record the fact that a boy was brought before the Court for not putting in the necessary number of drills. The magistrate inquired of the officer, "" What am I to do with him ? '"" The officer replied, "" Fine him, "" and asked for the imposition of a penalty of Â£ 5 . Thereupon the magistrate asked, "" What is the use of doing that, seeing that we cannot enforce it ? "" The officer replied, "" Fine him Â£ 5 , anyhow."" It will be seen, therefore, that military officers are haling lads before the Court, and asking magistrates to fine them, knowing full well that the proceeding is an absolute farce, because the penalty cannot be enforced.  member do with them?",84
622,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"I would not bring them before the Court at all to make the officers ridiculous, and the defence system a derision. The method which is now being adopted is bringing our defence system into ridicule. The matter is being dealt with in the British newspapers. When we recollect that the Minister of Defence, who posed in Great Britain as the author and creator of the compulsory system",84
623,Mr FENTON,Unknown,He never did that.,84
624,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,He did. Let estab- the honourable member ask any honourable member who visited England in connection with the Coronation celebrations.  went Home posed in some capacity or other.,84
625,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"I think they all did. Before our defence system has got thoroughly into operation we have hauled down the flag of compulsory training so that today the whole thing is regarded as a farce. I 3o not. say that the training no two is a farce, but when a magistrate tells a military officer that it is idle to fine a cadet who has failed to put in the statutory number of drills it must be recognised that the system has utterly broken down. There is not a cadet who does not know that we cannot enforce any penalty which may be inflicted.",84
626,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Whose fault is that?,84
627,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"It is that of the Government, and of this House.  know what a fine of Â£ 5 means to a working man or woman?",84
628,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Yes .,84
629,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,Does the honourable member want the fine to be enforced?,84
630,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"The lads should not be dragged into the Police Court, and the farce of a trial and fining gone through, when all concerned know that the whole of the proceedings are farcical. It is wrong to fine a parent, who really cannot afford to pay, because his boy refuses to attend drills. The system, however, is provided for on our statute-book. have in force a compulsory training system in connection with which officers from day to day bring boys before .the Court for failing to attend the requisite number of drills. The boys stand outside the Court joking at the whole procedure, and when they are called before the magistrate, the absurdity of the whole arrangement is pointed out. The officer, however, says, "" Impose a fine of Â£ 5 "" The defence of Australia is costing ,Â£5,000,000, so that one-fourth of the entire expenditure of the Commonwealth is really on its trial.",84
631,Mr RILEY,Unknown,It is mostly on the Navy.,85
632,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"I think I am correct in saying that hot one-half of it is on the Navy. Our defence expenditure per head of the population is, with the exception of that of Great Britain, the heaviest in the world. We are depending almost entirely on our system of compulsory training, and that system is ridiculed from one end of Australia to the other, and, indeed, wherever it is considered outside.  of compulsory education.",85
633,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"There is power to punish those who do not observe the provisions of the compulsory education system. If that power were abolished, the system would? be a farce.",85
634,Mr BENNETT,Unknown,Then the honourable member believes in the old law remaining? He believes that parents should be fined Â£ 5 for the non-attendance of their boys at drill ?,85
635,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"If the Government are going to have a compulsory system, let them be honest and say so - Do not repeat the farce of dragging boys before the Police Court day after day, of having their names recorded on the chargesheet as defaulters, and of imposing penalties, when the boys themselves know that the penalties cannot be recovered. I do not think it is possible to find, in the history of any compulsory system, whether it be of defence or education, a case in which, whilst the pretence of compulsion is retained, the power to enforce is either abolished or withheld. I ask the Committee, in all seriousness, to consider the position of our compulsory training system. It cannot be allowed to continue as it is. [147]- 2 It cannot be allowed to continue a compulsory system with no power of enforcement, ridiculed by the boys themselves. The Government are doing more We to destroy discipline, and to take away the credit of the defence system, by the utterabsurdity of the procedure they have adopted, than by. anything else that is obtaining in connection with the Defence Act today. Whilst we have this pretence of compulsory training, we find that the boy who attends drill is in exactly the same position as the boy who does not. From a return that I obtained a few days ago, I learned that, of the many, hundreds or thousands who had been fined, only eleven parents had actually paid thefinesimposed.",85
636,Mr RILEY,Unknown,That is eleven too many.,85
637,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"It is, if the remaining thousands are to be allowed to escape. Cannot honourable members recognise the absurdity of asking the magistrates to impose fines, when every one knows that there is no power to enforce the punishment? The practice is really bringing the whole military system of Australia into disrepute; and if it were not for the enormous cost that our defence system involves, the people might be inclined to regard it as a joke. But when we know that we are spending over ,Â£5,000,000 a year on our defence system, and that our land defences are based on this compulsory training system, we ought not to allow the contemptible position of affairs that has arisen to remain a minute longer than we can possibly help.
