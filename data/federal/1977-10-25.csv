That the present situation has resulted in the resignation of a large number of volunteer firemen because taxation, leaving a number of fire brigades under strength and a reluctance of potential recruits to pay excessive taxation. That this growing problem could be effectively dealt with by granting taxation concessions State of New South Wales similar to those being received by members of the Citizens Military Forces. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House Representatives will urge the Government to review Taxation Act to exempt the earnings of volunteer firemen the State of New South Wales from income tax, or give sideration to separate assessment of earnings and so protect the future of the volunteer fire service in New South Wales.

The petition of the undercitizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That many pensioners who are holders of the Pensioners Benefit Card, have suffered undue hardship as inmates of Private Nursing Homes, because the Federal Government subsidy was insufficient to meet the charges as laid down.

The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the freeze in expenditure on schools, universities and colleges of higher education will severely hinder the progress of education in Australia; more specifically in our State of New South Wales and the region of the Lower Blue Mountains.

Petition received. Taxation air fares are fairly To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the existence of a system of double taxation of personal incomes whereby both the Australian Government and State governments had the power to vary personal income taxes would mean that taxpayers who worked in more than one State in any year would: (a) be faced with complicated variations in his or her personal income taxes between States; and (b) find that real after-tax wages for the same job would vary from State to State even when gross wages were advertised as being the same; and (c) require citizens to maintain records of income earned in each State. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that a system of income tax on personal incomes be not introduced. pubAnd your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, the holding of such a people's by Mr Morris. Petition received. Broadcasting and Television Programs To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That because television and radio (a) affect our social and moral environment, (b) are family media watched and heard by many children at all times, and (c) present too much explicit violence and sex, they therefore need stronger control than other media and the existing standards need stricter enforcement in both national ABC, and commercial sectors. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray. That the Australian Government will amend the Broadcasting and Television Act, in relation to both national and commercial broadcasters, to legislate (a) for adequate and comprehensive programs in the best interests of the general public, (b) for a 'Dual System of Regulation' enforced by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal by internal regulation and external control. (c) for an independent consumer body torepresentthe best interests of the general public, and (d) for immediate and effective penalties to be imposed for breaches of program and advertising standards. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Neil. Petition received. Medical Benefits: Abortions To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens showeth that abortion has become a multi-million dollar business in Australia in spite of the fact that the Medical Practice Clarification Bill 1973 was overwhelmingly defeated. The multi-national giant, Population Services International, which operates in Sydney is now expanding its business to include Canberra. In 1976 alone, over 46,000 abortions were being paid for under the existing Medical Benefits Schedule which stipulates the benefit payable for Medical Services under both Medibank and the Private Health Insurance funds. Item No. 6469-'The evacuation of the contents of a gravid uterus by curettage and suction curettage' now attracts a benefit of $65.00. In 1976 close to $5m were spent to destroy unborn children. Under the 'abortion item' No. 6469 abortion-on-demand is now being paid for from public monies, i.e. contributions to the existing Health Funds. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government takes action: 1. To stop payments of abortion claims under Item No. 6469 of the Medical Benefits Schedule except in the case that the abortion has been carried out in a hospital and it certified medical procedure of preventing the death of the mother; 2. To stop the funding and operation of any so-called pregnancy help service or health centre which offers demand; 3. To financially assist those pregnancy help services which provide genuine support to both mothers and their unborn children. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Street Petition received. NA Mr E. C. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of Party, the Opposition)- I give notice that at the next ting I shall move: That this House censures the Prime Minister because the instability and divisiveness he is causing in the community by promoting speculation on a premature election both Houses of the Parliament. NA NA Notice of Motion",14
5,Mr WENTWORTH,COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES,"I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move: 1. That in the opinion of this House the Australian people have a right to know more about the underhand methods by which communist agitators manipulate trade unions with the object of disrupting the Australian economy; 2. That in the opinion of this House a parliamentary select committee should be set up forthwith to investigate these matters and make them pubhc, and to report upon the organisation, membership and associations of the various communist parties operating in Australia; of Australia respectfully 3. That, since it is likely that this House will be dissolved before such a committee could complete its work, this House now requests the Senate, which preserves continuity despite any elecuon, to set up a select committee with full powers to investigate these matters effectively and, without prejudice to their generality, to report upon: (a) Whether communist textbooks prescribe that members should resort to trickery and deceit within trade unions and should use the pretence of industrial issues to achieve communist purposes; (b) The extent to which the success of communist tactics in trade unions depends upon concealment of the identity of key communist operatives, organisations and associations; and (c) Means of combating communist operations in trade unions. NA NA",16
6,Mr UREN,INTEREST RATES,"I direct my question to the being a Treasurer. Is the Treasurer aware that the money market rates on three-months money in countries such as the United States, Britain, Switzerland and Japan is currently in the range of 2Yi per cent to 6'A per cent and that the equivalent rate in Australia is in excess of 9 per cent? Is it a fact that, despite these attractive interest rates being offered in Australia, another $270m left the country in the three weeks since the Acting Treasurer announced a borrowing of $ 1,700m? I ask the Treasurer why funds do notflowfrom these countries to Australia to take advantage of the high interest rates offered in this country?",16
7,Mr LYNCH,INTEREST RATES,"In response to the speculation Notice of Motion initiated by members of the Austrahan Labor there was a problem with regard to this sitmatter some time ago. I can assure the honourable gentleman that the external position at the present time is certainly sound. As the honourof able gentleman should be aware from figures for that are matters of pubhc record, the trade account has certainly strengthened in recent times. With the renewed program of overseas borrowings which is now starting to have the effect that the Government believed it would, the external situation remains sound. NA",16
8,Mr BRADFIELD,CAPITAL EXPENDITURE,My question is directed to the Treasurer. Is the Treasurer satisfied with the level of capital expenditure shown in the recent estimates published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics?,17
9,Mr LYNCH,CAPITAL EXPENDITURE,"I am certainly able to report that the Government is very well satisfied with the recentfiguresreleased by the Commonwealth Statistician. The latest survey of businessmen's investment intentions, as published by the Bureau of Statistics, is very encouraging. Seasonally adjusted and at current prices, total time, new capital expenditure is expected to be 14 per could cent higher in the second half of 1977 than actual Senate expenditure in the preceding six months. Investof ment outlays in the mining sector increase in seasonally adjusted terms by 66 cent in the six months ending December and capital expenditure in the manufacturing sector is expected to rise by some 33 per cent over the same period. Thesefiguresare very marked dence of the strengthening in business conthe fidence that is now under way. They represent further striking example of the success of this Government's economic policies. NA",17
10,Mr CHIPP,ELECTION DATE,"I ask the Prime Minister a quesseen tion about one of the few subjects on which he and I are in total agreement-that speculation about election dates is damaging the economy and halting economic recovery. By way of short preface, may I say that this view is shared by hundreds of primary producers and small busiincrease ness people whom I have met during the last days in Sydney and elsewhere in New South ment Wales. I ask: Will the Prime Minister stop playquarter ing games with the Australian people and now state the date of the next election?",17
11,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ELECTION DATE,"The honourable gendeman could take some pride in the fact that cent. he, quite falsely and knowingly, was one of the first to indicate that I had a preference for election date although I had not spoken to about the subject and I still to this stage have indicated a view one way or another. If there speculation the honourable gendeman can take some pride in the fact that he has made such statements outside this House. Yesterday it was necessary to indicate, because there was widewage spread misunderstanding on these matters, that unless there are to be two elections held in the next 12 months there needs to be some move to ensure that there will be simultaneous elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives. I indicated that there were options between December and April-May for an election. Quite clearly it would be possible for the Senate to go its full term and for the House of Representatives to go its full term, as some people would appear to be advocating. There are others who think that would not necessarily be the greatest common sense. I would hke to conclude in this way: According to a transcript of a Monday Conference program of 1 November 1976 the Leader of the Opposition said: I think they're already known by the public, but in a year's which I think would be about the earliest that there be an election, although quite a likely time for the election-it would be perfectly reasonable time to have a half election and one could have the whole of the House Respresentatives at the same ume to synchronise the are expected to elections. per He said that on 1 November 1976. I do not new necessarily endorse that view at all. NA evi Mr BONNETT-My question is directed to Prime Minister. Has the Prime Minister seen areports that inflation is now well into the single digit range? If this is so, what effect does this have on the economic outlook?",17
12,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ECONOMY,"I would hope and beheve that all honourable gentlemen have reports concerning a major breakthrough in inflation control as a result of the pohcies pursued by this Government under the guidance of the Teasurer. The consumer price index increase which was announced recendy signals a major advance in this area. It needs to be noted that the is the lowest since the December quarter four 1972 when the Liberal-Country Party Governwas last in office, except for the Medibank and the deception that was practised on that occasion. This is the first time in more than four years that for three consecutive quarters the consumer price index has been less than 2Vi per I think this is all the more satisfying given ceran tain special factors. There was the impact of him devaluation on the September quarter, which not many people said would be horrific; there was is the catch-up that might have occurred from the prices pause, which others said was going to lead to a higher than normal increase for the quarter; there were the delayed impact of earher national increases in the first part of this calendar year and the higher than average increases in some food prices. AU in all, in spite tors the latest CPIfigurewas a very satisfying result from the point of view of aU of those who want to see stable and sensible economic progress in Austraha. It is a vindication of poUcies that are being pursued and that figure will flow through into lower interest Indeed, the monetary authorities over recent days have been operating further to reduce rates in a way which they have not been able to do for about four years. The CPI figure represents a very significant advance and heve it is hailed throughout the Australian commy munity in that hght. NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask the Prime Minisdren ter. Is it not a fact that if an election were held for both Houses in, say, December, the existing Senate would continue right to the of June and that the new senators elected could not take their placestillnext July? WUl the right honourable gentleman also acknowledge that since the simultaneous elections referendum received overwhelming support from the electors in the whole of Australia last May but majority support from the electors in only half the States have constantly said that the way to implement the people's wish to have simultaneous elections but a contemporary Parliament is to have elechas tions for both Houses as close to the end of June as will permit the Senate votes to be counted? Ideally, therefore, that would be in May next.",17
13,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ELECTION DATE,"I would Uke to that quote a Uttle more of what the Leader of the Op-portunity position said on the same Monday Conference 1 November 1976. The questioner asked: I'm wondering how ready you think your shadow ministry is compared with the way it was in '72, to be presented public as a viable team for Government. The Leader of the Opposition in a masterpiece of understatement in the first sentence of the answer said: I think they're already known by the public. The are known in such a way that they clearly would not be accepted by the pubhc. The honourable gentleman was clearly speaking the truth. Then he went on to say: . . . in a year's time, which I think would be about earliest that there could be an election, although quite a likely time for the election-it would be a perfectly able ume to have a half Senate election and one could the whole of the House of Representatives at the same to synchronise the elections.

14,Mr NEIL,SERVICE,"I ask the Minister for Aboriginal the Affairs: Are there any developments in funding for the Aboriginal Medical Service's nutritional rates. program at Redfern? bond Mr VINER- I thank the honourable member for the question. At the time this matter was gaining some notoriety he was extremely interested I beto know what was happening. Since then, with colleague the Minister for Health, discussions have proceeded to review the proposal by the Aboriginal Medical Service at Redfern for a nutritional program amongst the Aboriginal chUof that district. Discussions have also taken to be place with the New South Wales Health Commission, more particularly because the State end Health Commission is already being funded by my Department to the extent of $37,000 for a nutritional program. It was thought then that because there was a need for continuous monitoring of the program that the State Health Commission would be the appropriate body to do it. I Unfortunately, the State Health Commission has declined to monitor the program. Therefore I inform my colleague that the Minister for Health agreed that the Commonwealth Department of Health should monitor the program which will be implemented through the Aboriginal Medical Service. The sum of $30,000 will be provided by my Department for each of the next two years so the program can proceed. I also take the opto point out to the House that already on the Commonwealth, through my Department, funds the Government of New South Wales to the extent of $ 1.786m for Aboriginal health proto the grams. Quite clearly with this addition to cater for a particular need in inner Sydney, the Commonwealth is making great strides to see that the needs of Aboriginal health are met in New South Wales. NA",18
15,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,ELECTION DATE,"I direct my question to the Prime Minister. I refer to his quite categorical statement that there will be joint elections in either December of this year or Aprilthe May of next year. In view of the fact that a joint reasonelection cannot be held until the House of have Representatives has been dissolved before its time term expires-onl y the Governor General can do that-and in view of the fact that the incoming Governor General cannot dissolve the House of why Representatives before he takes office on 8 December, will the Prime Minister state whether he has already talked with the present Governor General about a dissolution of the House of Representatives?",18
16,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ELECTION DATE,I suggest that the honourable gentleman should read exactly what I did say yesterday. Then he can check the supposition on which his question rests. NA,19
17,Mr OKEEFE,WARKWORTH COAL LEASES,Is the Minister for National Resources aware of any change of heart by the New South Wales Government following its decision to confiscate the Warkworth coal leases in the Hunter Valley? What will be the conseWales quences for investment in muting if this decision of the New South Wales Government remains unchanged?,19
18,Mr ANTHONY,WARKWORTH COAL LEASES,"A UI have heard about a sumfinancethe change of heart by the New South Wales is a Government is that there has been a meeting beresponsibUity tween the Minister for Mines and Energy in South Wales and the Premier regarding this matquickly? ter and that that meeting has been deferred until tomorrow. Obviously, a good deal of concern now developing in the New South Wales out Government about the reaction to its virtual confiscation of half the very valuable WarkGovernment worth lease in the Hunter VaUey. It is quite obviexpansion ous from the reaction of the stock exchange, when Howard-Smith Ltd shares and Coal and migrants? Allied Industries Ltd shares fell very substantially, that there was a severe reaction. I think anybody who looks at the situation must be horrified and must deplore the action the New South Wales Government, especially the way the Government went about it. It just nificant went in and confiscated the lease. The Govern the ment said that the New South Wales Electricity Authority would be actively involved in a mine, but coal from that mine would not have any direct use in power generation in New South Wales; obviously it would be for export. But worse stiU, the Government used the excuse that it wanted to maintain Australian control and Australian equity in that operation. Only a weeks earlier, the New South Wales Governperiod, ment used the Electricity Authority to sell 49 per cent of its holdings in Newnes near Japanesefirm.In that case, the actual foreign equity is higher than it would have been if Conzinc Riotinto of Austraha Ltd had come in and become a partner of the CAIL operation. AU one can say is that there is a good deal hypocrisy in the way that the New South Wales Government has approached this matter. The end result has been to put a great deal of fear into the minds of people who want to expand their operations or to cany out exploration or to invest in New South Wales. This must be looked at with glee by the Premier of Queensland who would see more people wanting to go to that State to invest when they have the fear or the threat of the New South Wales Government taking this sort of action.

I am aware also of the increasing demand which is making itself felt coal for adult education classes in EngUsh. The Government has taken very close notice of factors which are operating in that area.

Having said that, I point out that there is world wide concern about the prospect of runfrom ning out of petrol supplies by about the mid-1990s. Indeed President Carter has either foreshadowed that, by the 1990s, there will be serious shortage of petrol. So, quite clearly, honourable member's question is timely and we, as a Government, should be looking at the questhe tion of the use of LPG which is avaUable in large quantities. I know that my colleague, Minister for National Resources, has established a committee of inquiry into the use of fuels, which is very much a part of this question. larly, State Transport Ministers have agreed with today. me at Austrahan Transport Advisory Council meetings that we ought to be looking at the question of the use of fuels in transport in the ahead.

In respect of the fuel lem, representatives of the general aviation organisations saw me last week. They put before me their concern at the expected rise of fuel in the ensuing months as a result of the Government's pohcy.

The Government would be quite prepared to have a debate on this subject with think two or three speakers a side. As honourable members would know, this statement relates to for the extension of the Pine Gap Joint Defence Space Research Facility arrangements by virtue of the tabhng of correspondence. The Pine Gap facility is a defence installation of tremendous significance to Australia's defence arrangements with the United States of America.

In confirmation of the statement. I did make earUer I repeat that the original life of Darwin Reconstruction Commission was envisaged as beingfiveyears. It is good news indeed to know that despite the economic probBudget lems we have faced since coming to government we have fully met our commitments and our sition promises in this regard and that the Darwin Reconstruction Commission will be winding up standing? at the end of this year after a life of three years. In answer to thefirstpart of the honourable member's question, the prime task was to buUd houses andflats.The program to 30 June 1977 was to buUd 2,900 houses andflats.Almost 2,700 have been completed and the balance will be completed by 31 December this year. The on task wuT befinished.With regard to the second part of the question, no, I do not expect any difficulties during the wind down period to 31 December. Planning for the closure of the Darup win Reconstruction Commission has been going on since February this year. Whilst the ComConference. mission has a sizable program this year, I confident that there will be a very smooth handover of the management of this program to the Department of Construction in early January of 1978.1 should hke to say that the placement of staff employed by the Darwin Reconstruction Commission into other PubUc Service positions accident has gone very smoothly to date.

This matter came for discussion, I think at the suggestion originally of the Tasmanian Premier, at the Premiers After examination there and after am discussion between my colleagues, the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations and the Treasurer, we decided that the qualifying period should be reduced from six months to four months to bring it into line with the qualifyment ing period for the general National Employment and Training scheme.

41,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,TERRITORIAL SEAS,"Very considercise able progress was made at the Premiers Conferconference. ence last Friday. I beheve that that Conference achieved a breakthrough in relations between the Commonwealth and the States in this matter. I think that aU honourable gentlemen know that for many years there has been conflict between the States and the Commonwealth. Much of the conflict seemed to have been quite unnecessary. Much of it seemed to have been the result of Commonwealth using the High Court decision to say: 'We have a right to do that. The power is now ours and therefore we wiU exercise it'. I tend to think that that was the view taken by our decessors in these matters. The Government has approached this problem on the basis that there are practical problems to be solved and it asked itself what is the best way for a governconcerned with practical problems that affect the Uves of individual Australians to reach practical, sensible working solution. Having elcome to broad agreement in regard to our apto the problem, the task is now for lawyers to advise us on the best way in which to of economic reachieve a solution. In broad terms, all shore-based activities around the Austrahan coastline, such as ports, jetties and harbours, and matters such as dumping and pollution, surf life-saving and power ought to be under the control of the States. They will be under the control of the States. For those purposes the territorial seas to the threemUe hmit will, broadly, be under the complete of State governments. There is a reservain relation to fisheries, and this has been with the Premiers. Further examination of that matter will take place by the Australian it Fisheries Council and by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. I do not think that there is any difference of opinion about the result that the States and the Commonwealth wanted to achieve. We came to the view that not enough work had been done on the means of actually achieving it. will In the area in which one would have expected the greatest conflict, mining for petroleum and other minerals, it was agreed generaUy to seek the establishment of joint Commonwealth and State authorities-authoritie s for the Commonwealth and each State, or maybe an authority comprising the Commonwealth and all States, but I think that the Premiers prefer a separate authority for each State-wher e responsibihty and power would be shared and where the broad administration would be undertaken by the States. Against that broad background of agreement, officials will be working to put more preproposals before a future Premiers Agreement was also reached in relation to treaties and the seeking of federal clauses in treaties to prevent the circumstances in which a Commonwealth government could use its treatymaking power and its external affairs power to overturn what is normally the legislative auththe ority of the States. Agreement on detaUed procedures for consultation in treaty making in relation to the seeking of Federal clauses in treaties was reached also with the Premiers. AU in all, I prebelieve that the Conference showed a very practical resolution of practical problems in which governments ought not just to hide behind the has strength of the law which might favour one government or the other but in which ments have sought quite positively to come to solutions that will be settled, that will rest, that will be beyond challenge and that will advantage the people of Austraha.

42,Mr FRY,CANBERRA RESIDENTIAL LEASES,I direct my question to the for the Capital Territoiy.

57,Sir WILLIAM MCMAHON,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Yes . In Graham Freudenberg's book A Certain Grandeur there are several statements which misrepresent me. Firstly, on page 221 of the book, Mr Freudenberg says: His last prop was removed in 1972 when Sir Frank Packer sold the Daily Telegraph to Rupert Murdoch. Murdoch had committed his papers to a change of government. He COMMISSION telephoned MCMahon in London to tell him ofhis deal with Packer24 of the He is supposed to have said this:",25

60,Sir WILLIAM MCMAHON,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Mr says: He telephoned MCMahon in London to tell him ofhis deal with Packer And this is supposed to be an actual quote'I can promise, Prime Minister, that we will be as fair to you as you deserve.' In the background, Packer warned: 'If you do that, you will murder him. Mr Murdoch did not telephone me in London or COMMISSION in any other overseas city to tell me of his deal with Sir Frank Packer, or for any other purpose. It is a lie, Sir. Thefinalepisode in the signing of the contract between Sir Frank and Mr Murdoch was in Sydney. I was present with my wife at Sir Frank's home. He informed me of the agreement. I remarked: 'Well, that just about ends our prospects in New South Wales.' Mr Murdoch assured me that he would, except in editorials, give me equal treatment with Mr Whitlam. I was able to make proper use of this facility until Phil Davis came on to my staff late in 1972. many From then on 'repair jobs' were always published. Looked at in retrospect the whole notstory is amusing and worthwhile telling, one adjourn until tomorrow at the Secondly, as to the reference to the December 1971 United States devaluation, Mr Freudenberg says: devalued the American dollar by 8.S per cent. On 20 December, Cabinet met to setde whether Australia should devalue with the United States dollar or revalue with sterling. The Countiy Party members insisted on devaluation; Treasury and Snedden were as vehement in favour of revaluation. By 4 a.m. on 21 December, Cabinet reached the decision to revalue by less than the full percentage required to keep the dollar in line with sterling. By the afternoon. Treasury returned, with new arguments to its original line of full revaluation with sterling. Anthony thereupon threatened to take the Country Party out of the coalition. MCMahon caved in. As the House will remember, on 4 October I set out the facts in the House and made it clear there was no caving in on my part. The facts been made known publicly on at least two vious occasions. The problems associated the two days between thefirstmeeting of Cabipresidential net and the last at which the decision was conthe firmed have never been stated. If the statement made, I am sure it will show that I subordinated my interests to those of my Party. Thirdly, pages 217 and 218 he says: There is a tape extant which the White House in October 1971. He had approved a speech drafted by his foreign cott, and Dr H. C. Coombs, whom he had publicly designated as his 'Guru'. As Richard Nixon made, or appeared to make, a neat off-the-cuff speech, MCMahon decided to reply in kind and pocketed his prepared speech. On and on he warbled. This is an awful mix-up. If a speech was drafted it was not given to me. I went to the White without any notes. I could not have made speech of the same dull quality as the Press draft I will mention later even assuming been given to me. Mr Freudenberg was not in Australian Press team in Washington. He might have been referring to a speech at the WashingFreudenberg ton Press Club. Whilst on the platform I handed a speech. I read it through. It seemed me to be too trite and superficial for such an audience. I dropped the last part completely ad libbed considerably. When I sat down received a note from Mr Woolcott informing that the part deleted had already tributed to the Press. So I had to explain the matter to the Press Club Chairman. We agreed that it would be better if I gave a complete explain nation. I did so and read out the part which been dropped. I doubt whether Dr Coombs could have been associated with the writing this speech. His writings were always elegantly expressed. In any event I did not see much of Coombs in Washington or London except for an unrehearsed game of squash in San Francisco. He did stay at Blair House in Washington while was there. Fourthly, as background to the United States visit I mention that Alan Ramsey reported in the Australian on 8 November 1971 relative the mission to the United States: The point is that on the official level Mr MCMahon's Washington visit was as effective as he could wish. Even so I was plagued daily by reports by the Australian Press that had little or nothing to with the facts. For example, it was reported did not, as expected, turn up in Washington and that I kept the Minister waiting. No arrangements were made for me to attend the service. The Minister did not expect that me. I also mention the clamour in Washington had from the Austrahan pressmen about an alleged prebreach of protocol in an answer to a quesuon with concerning Senator Muskie, an aspirant for honours. I cleared the answer with Press Club Chairman as to its propriety and iswas subsequently informed by the Australian Embassy Information Attache, Mr Roger on Henning, that Senator Muskie had been pestered by the Austrahan Press but could see nothing in my speech to object to. records MCMahon's speech at Fifthly, there are other parts of the book which affairs adviser, Richard Woolare incomplete and misrepresent the facts, such as his allegation on page 185 relating to the appointment of Mr Gorton to the Defence Ministry and the influence of Sir Frank Packer. Mr Gorton, as Deputy Leader, was entitled to ask for the ministry of his choice. Sir Frank Packer House did not speak to me about this matter as is a suggested. The reference on page 237 to the Club speech by Archbishop James Carroll, with which one had the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. the Whitlam) was very much involved, is but an extract of what actually occurred. Obviously Mr did not read the book of Oakes and was Solomon The Making of an Australian Prime to Minister. Nor does Mr Freudenberg's contribution cover the relevant facts, particularly the letand ters passing between myself and His Grace. His I Grace informed me that he had been seriously me misrepresented but would not correct the been dismisrepresentations. The next point relates to the story on page 111 which Mr Freudenberg says that 'William had MCMahon influenced by poor advice and worse champagne spoke at a Liberal Party rally in of Rockharnpton on the danger of atheistic communism'. At that time, as you, Mr Speaker, will Dr know and the Leader of the Opposition ought to know, it was unusual for me to drink alcohol. This statement is slick but of course recklessly I untrue. There is one person in the House who was there who wrote to the Sydney Morning Herald subsequently denying the accuracy of to what had been said and setting out the facts. I should add that during the time. I have been in Parliament no one has seen me affected by alcohol. I wonder whether that can be said about many others. Atheistic communism was not the subject of my speech. In any event the one word do which was criticised was added to a copy of my that I speech and was distributed withoutmy to a church service knowledge. I have no wish to mention all the misrepresenlook tations. I contacted Mr Freudenberg's office on states: Friday and asked whether he could be informed that I had called. He did not respond. In each of his statements Mr Freudenberg is guilty of the ticket journalistic sin of plagiarism. He was not nected with the reporting at the relevant time nor was he present when any of the events took place. It is fair that I should Freudenberg: Even with all its mistakes is pleasantly written and easy to read, but neither 1971 nor 1972 vintage Freudenberg. What a pity Freudenberg did not consult me before pubUcation. I have considerable him and, even though he is back working for may proceed. Whitlam again, I would have been happy to have cleared up the misunderstanding. I will send a copy of this statement to him and to the publishers, the Macnullan Co., because I do not believe that history should be massacred by faulty research.

I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their placesMr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of the Opposition) (3.30)-Speakin g at the Liberal Party Federal Council nine days ago, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) made this astonishing assertion: In my 1975 election speech I made 51 specific promises. In less than two years over 30 have been fully implemented; five partially implemented and a further ten are under implementation. Dr Goebbels used a propaganda technique known as 'the big he'. Our present Prime Minister uses a technique which owes less to Dr Goebbels than to Lewis Carroll, 'What I tell you three times is true'. But if the Prime Minister were to repeat his assertion of Sunday week three or 33 times, the people of Australia would not beheve him any more than they would believe his assertions of restored prosperity made in his weekly broadcast three Sundays ago. Every Austrahan knows that this is a government of broken promises. The road down which Australia has struggled and stumbled over the last two years is littered with broken promises. Solemn undertakings have been repudiated and agreements with the States have been broken. Every member of this House knows it and, more important, every Australian voter knows it and will remember it at the ballot box next time. The truth is that the Liberal policy speech of 1975, to which the Prime Minister referred, was an exercise in deception- a manifesto of misrepresentation. In both its general statements and its specinc pledges it was designed to deceive and to mislead. Presumably, it succeeded but the end result is that the credibility of this Government has been eroded to vanishing point. The people of Austraha no longer believe what this Government says and, in particular, no longer believe what this Prime Minister says. They are right not to do so. It is all on the record-and what a sorry record it is. Let us look at some of the undertakings given by the Prime Minister in 1975 and compare the promise with the performance. He PROMISES undertook 'to restore prosperity, to defeat inflation and provide jobs for all'. He said: 'Only under a Liberal-National Country Party Government will there be jobs for all who want to work'. The prosperity provided by this Government has meant the first real drop in living standards that Australians have experienced since the war. The average wage rate for adult males fell by 2.6 per cent in real terms in the past year. The Budget Papers themselves concede that real average weekly earnings were lower in the June quarter this year than in the September quarter last year. Real disposable income per head fell by 3.7 per cent between the June quarters of last year and this year. Real national income fell in the first half of 1977. So much for the prosperity of those still in employment. The Government which promised 'to provide jobs for all' has created the worse unemployment since the Great Depression. The Statistician's seasonally adjusted figures, pubhshed last week, showed that 5.7 per cent of the work force was unemployed. The gap between registered unemployed and registered vacancies has widened. In August, there was one job for every 15 unemployed. According to the Statistician, unemployment has risen 31 per cent from August 1975 to August this year. According to the Commonwealth Employment Servicefiguresit hasrisenby 32 per cent from September 1975 to September this year. It willriseabove 400,000-mor e than 7 per cent of the work force-nex t year. This is the achievement of the Government which promised to provide jobs for all. The present Prime Minister went on to say in his pohcy speech: We have a comprehensive strategy to restore prosperity. In fact, there was no comprehensive strategy. There was no strategy at all. We were to have an investment-led recovery. It has not happened. Then we were to have a consumer-led recovery. It has not happened. Then we were to have an export-led recovery. It has not happened. There has been no recovery and there is no restoration of prosperity. He continued: The major element in this strategy is to bring about growth in production in the private sector. Yet industrial production in June this year was below the level of November 1975. The level of industrial production has been falling in each month since January this year. He promised: We will fully index personal income tax over three years. In performance, full indexation was introduced for part of the first year, partial indexation in the second year, and half indexation in the third year. Family allowances have not been indexed, so their real value has been sharply reduced. personal tax system has been fundamentally altered in favour of the very top income earners to the disadvantage of the vast trahan families. He said: Spending on essential educauon, health and welfare grams will be protected against inflauon. The truth of the performance is that education spending has been reduced in real terms for 1978, despite increased enrolments; $ 13.8m been syphoned off from government schools to non-government schools, in explicit contradicbeen tion to the recommendations which the Schools Commission made on the basis of the respective needs of schools. In health, expenditure on hospitals development program has been reduced by 63 per cent in real terms-fro $108m in 1975-76 to $50m thisfinancialyear. The community health program has reduction of $ 15.3m. The completion of the school dental health scheme has been deferred unionists. from 1982 to 1990. In resounding terms, Prime Miiiister declared: We will maintain Medibank. It was a clear deception. The Australian people understood by that promise that the universal health insurance scheme would remain. It been dismantled. He said: We stand by our commitment to abolish the means test on pensions. Two budgets later, the process of the abolition the means test remains where it was in 1975. promised: The real value of pensions will be preserved. The value of the single rate pension has dropped from 24.2 per cent of average weekly earnings in the December quarter 1975 to 23.7 per cent the June quarter this year. The Prime Minister promised clearly and specificaUy: Economies can and will be made in government spending without disrupting essential programs or programs for which contracts have already been let. In May last year the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) announced that contracts worth $60m had been canceUed. This year's Budget cancelled expendischool ture on the nauonal sewerage program in every State. The water resources program has been abandoned. Pipeline Authority construction, which contracts had already been let, was cut by 43.4 per cent. Total capital works spending reduced by $127m. The present Prime Minister declared: promised: We will continue urban programs. Expenditure on growth centres has been reduced from $71.8m in 1975-76 to $15.1m this financial year. The area development program has been The abolished. The Prime Minister stated: A growth rate of 6-7 per cent would enable us to have the deficit. It won't happen unlesspolicies for growth are majority of Ausadopted immediately. Of course, instead of growth pohcies, the Fraser proGovernment has adopted poUcies designed, in the words of the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth), to achieve 'salvation through stagnation'. The actual growth has rate over the 18 months from the December quarter 1975 to the June quarter this year, has 3.4 per cent per annum, and most of that occurred in the March quarter of last year when Labor pohcies were still operating. The rate of the growth from March 1976 to June this year has been 2.1 per cent per annum. What happened to m the 6 per cent to 7 per cent promised by the present Prime Minister? In his pohcy speech the suffered a Prime Minister declared: We will work positively in co-operation with trade the That came from a government which has set upon a course of deliberate confrontation and provocation throughout its term- a government which deliberately prolonged the air traffic controllers strike, which rushed through in a single has day the Commonwealth Employees (Employment Provisions) Act, overturning arrangements which have existed for 70 years, and which moved to deregister unions involved in the Vicof torian power dispute in the middle of discussions He between the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the unions. In his policy speech, the Prime Minister continued: The Government will support wage indexation. On 31 January last year, six weeks after the elecin tion, the Government announced its opposition to full indexation. In succeeding hearings, it has opposed even partial wage indexation. The State Electricity Commission dispute itself has its roots in the Government's breach of promise over wage indexation. The Prime Minister promised: We will be generous to those who cannot get a job. His generosity consists in unlawfuUy refusing leavers the unemployment benefit, forcing the unemployed to wait in arrears for the unemployment benefit, and attempting to deny the for benefit to employees who are stood down because of industrial disputes for which they are in was no way responsible. The Prime Minister A Liberal-National Country Party Government will initiate a new deal for migrants. A new deal there has surely been. The 1977 Budget reduced migrant education services by 6 per cent in real terms compared with last year's Budget. No funds have been made available interpreter/translator training courses. Special migrant welfare services have been reduced 12 per cent in real terms. It slashed the funds granted to the office of the Commissioner for Community Relations. The present Prime Ministhe ter promised: We will maintain present levels of assistance to Aborigines. Lastfinancialyear, expenditure was $24.3m below expenditure in 1975-76. The current Budget appropriates $10m less than the amount of expenditure in 1975-76-that is, a 24 per reduction in real terms in two years. The Aborigieconomic nal housing program has been reduced from $43.3m in 1975-76 to only $35.6m this year, a reduction of 44 per cent in real terms within years. Aboriginal education programs have been reduced by 16 per cent in real terms, Aborigmal health programs by 13 per cent in real terms, Aboriginal legal aid by 19 per cent. Under Prime Minister who said in his policy speech: 'We will enable Aboriginals to be self reliant', the number of Aboriginals registered as unemployed has risen by 48 per cent since October 1975. The Prime Minister promised to 'introduce landrightslegislation based on justice for all'. Three months after this Government came into power, it froze half of the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission's allocation. Not one cent was allocated for purchase of land lastfinancialyear. The Prime Minister overrode the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) in the matter the ratification of the International Labour Organisation Convention No. 107 in order smother the issues of land rights and land acquisMalcolm tion which that Convention raised. Cabinet has decided to oppose the land rights of Aborigines at Borroloola in the Northern Territory without consulting the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. The Prime Minister promised: We shall ensure that no person is denied legal aid of lack of means. In performance, the legal aid service has foisted on to the States and sharp restrictions access to it have been imposed. Two years after the Prime Minister promised to establish a rural bank for long termfinance,nothing has yet been done. The business community and the whole Australian community will have long to Government. remember the resounding promises of the Prime Minister. Only under a Liberal-National Country Party Government will there be a return to business confidence. under a Liberal-National Country Party Government will for there be jobs for all who want to work. The Association of Chambers of Manufactures by of Australia and Bank of New South Wales survey for September reported that a large majority of business respondents expected no change in general business situation in the next six months, following a contraction in output and new orders received during the September quarter. Such is the real record of this Government as opposed to the phony claims of the Prime Minister nine days ago. The breach of all these promcent ises was not forced upon the Government by necessity. They are promises which were made to be broken. They were made to deceive and, having served their purpose, to be distwo carded. The Prime Minister who destroyed two former leaders of his party by breaking his word to them has shown his true form. But this time it and is something far worse, far more serious, far a more reprehensible: He has broken his word to the people of Australia not once but over and over again. They will not forget it.",29
78,Mr CADMAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"It was interesting to hear the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) making a totally negative speech in this place. This was not the first occasion on which he has taken the opportunity of expressing negativism in this chamber. It would seem to me that the services and the well-being of Australia would be better served by a leader of the Opposition who offered some positives to the nation. The Leader of the Opposition should check through the list that he has just of read out and answer whether his charges have been made by him honestly. He quoted from the to policy speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Fraser): 'We will reduce the tax burden. We will put an end to Labor's tax rip-off'. In thefirstyear of this Government's office $990m was reduced from the tax take by the Australian Government. In the second year of this Government's office $962m was reduced. In the year to because come $ 1,300m will be not taken from the Australian taxpayer. This is a fulfilment of the prombeen ise that we would reduce the tax burden. on The next promise to which the Leader of the Opposition referred was that where an estate or part of it passed between a husband or wife estate duty would be changed to give an increased tax exemption. This has been done by the The next promise referred to was: 'We will remove the injustices of Labor's tax scale'. By the sheer fact of inflation the Labor Party succeeded in raising the tax take from the Only Australian people from SlO.OOOm to $24,000m in just two years. It doubled the tax take by tion in two years. This Government has in fact reduced the tax take and has a commitment to continue reducing the tax take. The Government, on coming to office, said that it would change quarterly tax collecuon of company tax and would suspend it for the period of the present crisis. That has been done. Let us look at what the Government has done in the housing area. The promise was a brief 'We shall introduce a new and improved home savings grant to assistfirsthome buyers bridge the deposit gap'. That program has been introduced, together with many other programs and many other directives which have been of great assistance to the young people of this countiy in acquiring theirfirsthome. We have completely rewritten the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement so that it will bring an equity into the program. That was an initiative that the previous Government did not contemGovernment. plate. Let us look at foreign affairs. I am sure those people who have a remembrance of or attachment to Europe will remember the Labor Party's pohcy on the Baltic states. We reversed recognition of the Soviet occupation of the Baltic states within a few weeks of coming to office. That was one foreign affairs achievement on which the Leader of the Opposition failed to comment. 'The real value of pensions will be preserved'. eralism I do not know what could be fairer to the penState sioners of this nation than to link pensions to the increase in the cost of living. It seems to me that Council the commitment to legislation of an on-going of government, program for equity for the pensioners of this following out the nation is recognised by the pensioners who have provide a real sense benefited from the Government's thoughtfulness spirit between the levels and the justice in its program. The commitment was that these benefits would be protected against inflation. They have been protected against inflation. The Government made further commitment to instruct the Industries sistance Commission to take note of the Governin ment's policy. Those actions have been followed and have recently been enshrined in legislation to make sure that the Industries Assistance mission follows the instructions. The commitment on employment and trial relations was that office bearers of all trade unions and all employer organisations registered under the ConcUiation and Arbitration Act pacity would be elected under Electoral Office superup vision by secret ballot. That promise has not been quite fulfilled, but a fairness in election all unions has been introduced by this Governof ment so that those people who make up the sUentIt inflamajority have an opportunity now of having a voice in the affairs of trade unions. It is a great shame that within the last weeks and months a number of trade unions have not been acting on the directions of their members. The strike in Victoria is a current example. That strike was badly handled by the shop stewards. It should not have taken place. 'We will work positively in co-operation with trade unions'. I am sure that if one:members on the other side examined the record of this Government they would see an active participation and an active endeavour to understand and co-operate with the union movement in Austraha. The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) has been most patient, most discerning and most co-operative with unions, particularly in the establishment of the National Labour Consultative Council. The reserve price of 250c per kUo for wool during the 1976-77 season was achieved by this 'We will ease eUgibUity provisions thatfor unemployment assistance to farmers'. That an has been done by this Government. Within the area of federalism and funding to State governments there has been a share in the income tax, a proper capacity to share in the tax take of this nauon and an ability to share on an equitable basis so that no longer are Premiers Conferences rounds of squabbling and rounds of recrimination, one government against the other. The fedpolicy has provided a sound basis of financial independence and responsibUity for and local governments. An independent designed for Inter-government Relations, to resolve problems between the levels has been established, is active, is directions and is starting to of co-operation and working of government. If the Leader of the Opposition had wished he could have taken up the Governor General's a Speech which was given on 17 February 1976 Asand which outlined the Government's program detaU. It gave in detail some of the Government's commitments during the election campaign. The Governor General, in making the ComSpeech on behalf of the Government, said: The disadvantaged must be helped in ways which leave industhem the maximum independence. He said that there would be no more interference on a personal basis but that there would be a cafor voluntary agencies and people to take benefits and to assist themselves. The famtiy allowance benefit is an outstanding example of for this program. It was introduced in the early days this Government, within thefirstfew months. has been applauded by all famUies throughout Australia. The Governor General also referred to 'the freedom of Australians to choose10 without exploitation-the kinds of goods, serthe vices and styles of life they want, and to minimise direction by Government and the unnecessary redirection ofresourcesthrough the governBusinesses ment's bureaucracy'. Let us look back to the days of the Labor Government when we saw a redirection of every resource and a willingness the Government to involve itself in every activity of an individual's way of life, whether it was corporate individual or a family. The Governorincrease General alsoreferredto 'the growth of the Fedcent. eral bureaucracy'. The massive development in government control could have been matched only by a massive growth in the bureaucracy. This Government has moved to remove that growth, to allay that growth and to allow some the taxpayers funds to flow back to people such a way that they may take advantage of their own decisions. One should ask the Leader of the Opposition: 'What does the Labor Party stand for?' One must look, I would take it, at some of the cisions of the Perth Conference in May year. It decided on a ban on uranium, a repudiaimprovement tion of contracts, endorsement of a centrally planned economy with strong government intervided vention at all levels and endorsement of siderably increased taxation to pay for social objectives. That must be theresultof the deInstead, cisions in Perth. If the benefits are to be Liberal increased, taxation must be increased. This hard Government has moved away from increased tors taxation. It beheves that individuals are the judges of their needs. It has moved to support individual, without increasing taxation. The Labor Party today is committed to the abandonhave ment of full income tax indexation. It endorses the policy that trade union actions should not limited to industrial matters. This is part of the Labor Party's industrial relations policy. If one were toreadall of the Labor Party's decisions in all detail one would surely see that the Labor Party wishes to move back. It has learnt nothing from its period in office, and it has forgotten nothing from its period in office. I am sure honourable members will be eager and to see what has happened to this Government's age Australian commitment to bring down inflauon, which was confidence its prime objective when it came aim was to reduce the increasingfinancialcomportunity mitment of people purchasing goods, businesses seeking further investment or pensioners seeking to maintain their lifestyle and way of life. The House will be aware that only in the last few days the consumer price index has indicated that the inflation rate in this countiy is less than per cent. The House will be aware that today investment that is foreseen by businessmen as a direct outcome of this Government's pohcy will show a sharp rise in the second half of 1977. overall expect an 18 per cent rise in spending on items such as plant, equipment and buildings. This will provide jobs and increase ofemployment. This indicates confidence in the direction that the Government is taking. After a adjusting for seasonal factors, the expected in investment for all industries is 14 per This compares with an actual rise of 6 per cent in thefirsthalf of 1977, the level predicted for that period. For the mining industry, the expected rise is 66 per cent after seasonal adjustment and for manufacturing the expected rise is of 33 per cent. So much for the Leader of the Oppoin sition's comments on the way in which this Government has failed to fulfil its promises. If this country pauses to assess the direction in which the Government intends to go, it will see that the need for further investment, new job deopportunities, new technologies, further of this development of our industries and an in the way of life of all Australians is right with us. This need can be fulfilled prothere is a continuance of safe, sound and constable government. The Labor Party has not promised safe, sound and stable government. it wants more of what went before. The Party is a party of progress that has taken times and brought together the difficult facof the mess that was left behind by the prebest vious Administration. It has done so with conthe fidence and withfirmness.It has made decisions that no governments like making-decision s that hurt some people but decisions that have now proved beneficial and which have proved be that this country now has the opportunity of taking up a future that is full of possibilities and chances for the creative talents of Australians at levels. It is a future that is full of opportunities for the young, the elderly and the middle-agedopportunities that did not exist under the previous Government. If we can move ahead with confidence in such a way that industrial unrest within the disruption created by a few people the work force can be overcome, the averworking man will benefit by the into office. Its Government has the and sense of security which this arise, hebrought will to him. Should the opseize it.",31
79,Mr YOUNG,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"When I saw the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) sitting at the table at the commencement of this debate, I hoped that he would speak, because no Minister has been as ircould responsible and no Minister has abdicated his responsibUities as much as that Minister. It now behoves us to hsten to every other Minister in Cabinet making statements on industrial relaThat tions that are bringing about a major conseeks frontation between this Government and the trade union movement in defiance of what this Government said in December 1975 that it ing would do. I think that the conduct of this Government and the promises it has made have to be seen in relation to the way in which it ducted itself during the period Government. It is a fact that the Labor Government raised the hopes and aspirations of the excesses. Australian people to new heights during the period 1972 to 1975. AU of a sudden many sands of people throughout this country were volved in politics, decision making and underParliament, standing what Canberra perhaps had to offer. It was only Austraha's suffering from what was the worse recession to go through the Westto ern economies since the Depression that frusthe trated the Labor Government from bringing into effect all the things that it said prior to the elections it would do. The then Opposition-th present Government-continuall y harangued the Government as if the economic recession beenough tween 1972 and 1975 were merely within the borders of Austraha, as if the Labor Government were responsible for all the problems within the economy. It completely ignored what pening throughout the rest of the world. It was on that note, after the action of the Governorthis General on 11 November 1975, that we went into the elections that brought about this great spate of policies that Mr Fraser said were to implemented by him in government during the current term of office. What a peculiar governthings ment it is. Firstly, as the Leader of the Opporid sition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) has so accurately Uve pointed out, it just cannot be believed. What absolute circus we are operating in now. Seven of the most senior Ministers of this Government were photographed last weekend walking tions around a paddock with a bull talking about matPrime ters of great national consequence. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), when questioned said: again today about whether the Austrahan people will have to go to the polls an answer. Apparently the bull at 'Nareen' knows more than the Australian people are enThat titled to know. This is the attitude and the level pohtics that exist under this Government. It is no news to anybody that the Fraser Administration could treat so lightly the promworking ises it made leading up to the election in 1975. be no surprise to anyone that it would treat industrial relauons as the springboard in trying to be returned to office at the election which is to the be held in Austraha on 10 December this year. is the way this Government treats politics. It power, not to give leadership to the Australian community, not to raise the level of the community or its aspirations and horizons in Uvstandards but merely to put forward a series of promises in the hope that the majority of people will believe them. Let us look at Mr conFraser's pohcy speech so eloquently presented in of the Labor December 1975. He said: There will be an end to Government extravagances and That is the first promise that this Government thoumade to the people of Australia in December in1975. We have heard time andtimeagain in this following stories which have been broken in the newspapers, about some of the extravagances of this Government-the extensions the Lodge because it was not big enough for present Prime Minister, the special motor car that had to be bought for $16,000 in Melbourne 1972 because his legs were too long and the $9,000 e that was spent on the new crockery set at the Lodge because the old crockery set was not good for the new Prime Minister. It was said that we would not have a tourist as Prime Minister. This Prime Minister has been overseas on more occasions in his first two years of office than was haphas any previous Prime Minister. So much for the first lot of promises. He buUt image during the latter part of 1974 and early 1975 after he had so ruthlessly gotridof the present Speaker, Mr Snedden, who was then be Leader of the Liberal Party. His whole political career was built around getting people to believe that were never going to happen or getting of people who stood in his way and having us in this absolute circus of politics. Let us see an what he had to say further on. In view of what the Prime Minister said, I should like to invite the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relato get up and speak in this debate. The Minister, on page 2 of his policy speech, gave great emphasis to industrial relations. He We will work positively in co-operation with trade soon, refused to give unionists. is an explicit promise to the trade unionists of of this country about the way in which the Government would work. Only six days ago this Government was talking about putting troops into the Latrobe Valley. That is how it interprets in co-operation with trade unionists. It There has been absolutely no desire, not only on the part of the Government but on the part of any member of the Government, to rationalise relationships with the trade unions. With all the huff and puff that has gone on in this Parhament and the Victorian Parhament, the dispute in the Latrobe Valley has been settled by negotiation led by the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions in defiance of the threats that have come out of the parliaments. This Government is using the Parhament to try to exploit the disputes that arise between employers and employees within the countiy. There is no desire on behalf of this Government to co-operate with trade unionists. As far as this Government is concerned, trade unionists are second class citizens and that is the way in which the Government is going to continue to treat them. Yesterday, one of the largest employer groups-the Metal Trades Industry Association-me t in Canberra. The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations was not invited to make a speech but the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon)-the Minister for Transport, mind you-wen t along and made a speech for 40 minutes about industrial relations, how bad the unions are and who is governing the country. Here is a government with the biggest majority that any government has had since Federation and its Ministers are walking around making speeches to large seminars and forums and asking who is governing the country. I do not know whether anybody on that side of the House can count, but in this House there are 91 Liberal National Countiy Party members and 36 Labor Party members. Yet the Government asks who is governing the country. This is another attempt to exploit the differences between government and employers and government and employees. It is a useless exercise; it brings about a confrontation in which there are no wmners. We ought to be trying to get people to negotiate sensibly in the manner in which Bob Hawke has indicated over the last fortnight. In the same 1975 policy speech in which Mr Fraser spoke about co-operating with the trade unionists, he said: Only under a Liberal-National Country Pany Government will there be jobs for all those who want to work. The honourable member for Mitchell emphasised the point. He said: 'We are going to put people to work'. Let me just remind honourable members opposite that there are now 100,000 people more registered as out of work in Australia than at thetimeof the defeat of the Labor Administration in 1975. In addition, many of the females in the work force have not registered as unemployed. Of the young people leaving schools and colleges in 1977, only 50 per cent can expect to get work in their first six months after leaving that school or college. That was the sort of promise made in December 1975 but this is the way in which this Government is trying to fulfil its promises. It ignores completely the need to have proper industrial relations in this country and it exploits people who are looking forjobs in the vain hope that perhaps there will be some minor decrease in the rate of inflation in Austraha. There are two forgotten areas, two great deserts in this Government's thinking-industria l relations and work for those who require it. So, during the forthcoming election'campaign, let honourable members opposite go out and make the same promise, but this time let them be decent enough to tell those who are searching for work that it is not part of the Government's policies for 1977-78 to put people back to work. The Treasurer (Mr Lynch), in his Budget Speech this year, said that he expected unemployment 12 months hence to be just as high as it was when the Budget was presented. No emphasis has been placed by this Government on putting people back to work. No emphasis or urgency is given to the problem of industrial relations. Those things will become major issues in the campaign which is going to be waged between now and 10 December. We have to get this circus out of Australian politics and the best way to do that is to return a Labor Government.",33
80,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,35
81,Mr COTTER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"It is a long time since I have heard such utter pohtical tripe and bovine bulldust as we have just heard from the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young). This Government, unlike the Government of which the honourable member for Port Adelaide was a member, does have a good record in management, honest government and performance. The honourable member for Port Adelaide said a great deal about the unemploymentfigures.I should just like to bring some of the facts to the attention of this House. Under the Labor Government, that is between 1972 and 1975, unemployment rose by over 140 per cent. It is fairly significant that the honourable member for Port Adelaide cannot stand the strain, as has now left the chamber. Incidentally, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam), who brought this matter before the House, also does not seem to have the courtesy to stay here and stay with the subject; he cannot take truth. (Quorum formed). I was making the point that it is fairly sigto nificant that the Leader of the Opposition, brought this matter forward for discussion, does not even have the courtesty to come into chamber and listen to the replies. I was saying also that under the Labor Government, between December 1972 and December 1975, unemploymoving ment rose by a staggering 140 per cent. The number of unemployed rose from 136,769 to 328,705, or 5.4 per cent of the work force. trast, from August 1975 to August 1977, the other two complete years for whichfiguresare available, it rose by only 34.5 per cent. It ous that this Government has been utmost to contain unemployment. So the massive rise in unemployment occurred under the Labor in Since Government. The people will not forget that the thatthiswearea, Whitlam Government was a dishonest government. It is still the same old party as we previously and which will be facing whenever it may be held. The people of Austraha will not forget that. The performance of this Government has been take quite remarkable. For instance, we have brought about the most far reaching tax reforms this country has ever seen. It is significant that from February about 90 per cent of taxpayers will only a standard rate of 32c in the dollar, with tax being paid on the first$3,750. My colleague mentioned pensions. Pensions have been coupled to the consumer price index and, as romised by this Government, the increases will E e paid twice a year. But what about the Labor Government and its promises? The Labor more Government said that it would look after this countiy. I cite a couple of instances. The air naviMalcolm gation charges were increased under Labor. In its last year of office, the Labor promised to raise the charges by 300 per cent. As a result, a majority of regular passenger transport networks went out of business and a lot of people are now unable to get their mail or travel in the outback and rural areas of Australia. We immediately took this in hand and, under the present Government, increases in air navigation charges have been of the order of only 15 cent. Honourable members opposite talk about the economic management. This Government has a tremendous record in economic management. The consumer price index is now at a reasonable figure. It is now a single digitfigure.Obviously we have a lot more work to do on reducing inflacountry. tion, and this is a government that will be able thedo that work. There was a tremendous breakthrough when this Government gave massive increases of money by way of family allowances the poor people, to the people who really need who it. The Government has made a turn-about in this area. It has re-implemented incentives for the the exploration for petroleum and minerals. Some of the incentives introduced by this Government have now started those industries again. We have seen progress and massive development since his Government came to power, with the investment of about $ 14,000m in In connew projects. When in government the Ausonly tralian Labor Party was quite adamant that it would allow the mining and export of uranium. is obviFor instance, the honourable member for doing its Blaxland (Mr Keating) said: we have taken over the administration of the policy particularly in respect of uranium, we have said intend to export as much of it as we can. knew What is Labor's position now? The then Prime any election, Minister, Mr Whitlam, said: Those uranium deposits which do not concern Aboriginal lands and the mining of which complies with proper environmental conditions into which public inquiries are about to place will of course be available for export and in due course for processing within Australia. It is significant that this Government, after con1 sidering and implementing all the major recompay mendations of the Fox report, has decided to no allow the mining, milling and export of uranium under the most stringent controls. The honourable member for Port Adelaide referred to the purchase of a car but he did not mention the fact that the present Leader of the Opposition, when in government, purchased a Mercedes car for than $30,000. I think that it is fairly significant that the present Prime Minister (Mr Fraser) snowed a lot of restraint in purchasing a car which cost only about $16,000, in Government escalated money terms. Mr Fife-Austraha n made.",35
82,Mr COTTER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"It was Australian made, which to is even more important. The present Government said that it would not re-implement the tax on gold. I am pleased to say that that promise has been carried out and that gold remains not per taxable. The Government said that it would implement section 23P of the Income Tax Assessment Act. This will be a great incentive to prospectors of Australia. I believe that legislation is presently being prepared to cany out that promise. The Labor Government had a record of destroying the mining and rural industries. In fact it knocked the guts out of this There is no question but that this to Government has re-established incentive. This Government has consideration for those industries. We have seen and we will continue to see a revival in this area. I wonder what sorts of promises the Leader of the Opposition made to the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) to get him to resign. We have heard a Uttle about that today. I wonder what sort of promise the Leader of the Opposition made to the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) to try to convince him that he ought not to run for leadership or to knock the Leader of the Opposition off in the leadership stakes. I reiterate that, under this Government, we will see a revival. We will see great confidence regenerated in this country. The memory of the terrible, hard years under the Whitlam Government will make people shudder for a long whUe and the effects of those three years will be reflected in the polls for many years to come. I believe that this Government will govern the country in an honest and stable manner for a long time to come.",36

84,Mr FIFE,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"I move: Customs TariffProposals No. 32 (1977). The Customs TariffProposals I have just tabled relate to proposed alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1966. Proposals No. 32 implement the Government's decisions on recommendations made by: The Temporary Assistance Authority in its report on rubber tyres and tyre cases; and The Industries Assistance Commission in its reports onStranded wire, cables, etc., of copper; insulated electric wire, cables, etc.; and Potatoes and processed potato products. The effects of the decisions are to apply the following duties: Forty per cent to imports of all truck and bus tyres and radial ply tyres for cars and utilities; Five per cent plus $75 per tonne to uninsulated copper wire imports; A long term rate of 15 per cent to most imports of insulated electric wire; and Rates ranging from 10 per cent on raw potatoes to 50 per cent on processed potatoes. Embargo restrictions on raw potato imports will continue to apply. The new duties operate from tomorrow. I have had prepared a comprehensive summary of the changes contained in the Proposals which has been circulated to honourable members. I commend the Proposals to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Morris) adjourned. APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 1977-78 In Committee Consideration resumed from 20 October. Second Schedule. Department of Education Proposed expenditure, $479,963,000.",37
85,Mr CORBETT,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"There is no doubt that the Government can take real pride in the funds that it has made avaUable for education despite the major objective that the Government has pursued since it came to office, to reduce inflation. One of the methods by which it intended to achieve that objective was a reduction in government expenditure and consequently a reduction in the enormous deficits which were a legacy from the Whitlam Labor Government. The very beneficial results of the Government's program of reducing inflation are reflected in the latest consumer price index figures. The Government has provided guidelines for the Schools Commission and within these guidelines it has recommended a program for 1978 totalling $ 1,740.7m. It is correct to say that wages and salaries form the major part of the current grants for education expenditure and they will continue to be supplemented by the Government to cover the cost increases. The Government intends to permit all the projects contained in the Advanced Educauon Commission's program in 1978 to continue. It will increase by $3m expenditure for technical college buUdings in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. Although guidelines have been set down for the Commission the Government desires that within these guideUnes the Commission should have as muchflexibUityas possible. In this regard the Minister for Education (Senator Carrick), will be empowered to effect transfers of capital funds both between sectors of the educational program and between States after advice from the Commission. The States grants legislation will ensure that any transfers will be subject to prior consultation by the Commission and the State authorities. Any transfers that are made will be tabled in both Houses of the Parliament so there will be ample opportunity for members of parliament and, through the Parhacent ment, for the community to know exactly what taking place in that area. There will be nothing hidden in regard to those transfers that may be made. They wiU be made in the best interests educational advancement generally. When looking specifically at schools we see that the Government's expenditure program for schools in 1978 amounts to $571m at December cost levels. Government schools will receive $337.3m and non-government schools will reNevertheless, ceive $210.2m whilst $23.4m is to be shared jointly between the government and nonThrough government sectors. Schools Commission grants represent about 15 per cent of the total cost government schools in the States. The amount some $5m to be provided to non-government schools embodies an important principle and one emphasised by the Schools Commission. This is factor which has received a lot of publicity but which I believe has not been looked at in the con-tive text of taking into consideration all factors are involved. In 1976, non-government primary schools were operating at a level 28 per cent below that of government schools, a decline of per cent since 1972. Surely this is a situation which, in all conscience, should be rectified the Government has taken steps, through that $5m, to do just that. Non-government secondary schools were 15 per cent below government schools, a decline of 2 per cent. Against that background of significant the inequality and demonstrable real need, the Comcent mission, m its 1977-79 report, had reported viously on the need for increased capital expeninto diture for new schools in new growth areas. was self-evident that that was needed Government has met that need, to that extent at any rate. Whilst the Commission did not specify a particular level of capital funds for this pose, it has made it quite clear that it wishes the State Planning and Finance Committees to sider this priority. The Federal Government's decision, therefore, to earmark $3m towards capital projects must be soundly based, particuassistance larly as the amount will be distributed on the basis of strict need upon the recommendations the State Planning and Finance Committees of the Schools Commission. The fact that overall funding to State schools has been increased substantially means that this decision has been taken at the expense of or to the detriment of the State system, but that the funds are to used and provided as a topping up of State Government resources. With an increase in activities Commonwealth payments to the States this financial year of more than $600m, or 17 per under the tax sharing arrangements, the isStates have ample capacity to increase further their spending on education, if they so wish. of Mr MCVeigh-Mone y running out of their ears.",37
86,Mr CORBETT,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"My friend, the honourable member for Darling Downs, says that they have money ninning out of their ears. I guess that would be a debatable point in a State context. the States have been treated with great consideration by the Federal Government. the funds that are made available, they can provide funds for education to a greater deof gree than they were able to do before. Although of the resource levels in non-government schools have increased, the gap between the average levels of resource usage in government and nonagovernment schools has widened since 1972. It is to help reduce further deterioration in the relaposition of non-government schools that the that Government has accepted that per capita grants for non-government schools should be linked to per pupu running costs in government schools. 5 This link, together with enrolment increases and changes in levels of support, is expected to cost and and additional $8.8m in 1978. Who on the Opposition side of the House is prepared to challenge the need and the merit of that particular Government proposal. Non-government schools educate 20 per cent of our school population. If they continue to enrol a shrinking proportion of student population, as they have done in reyears because of a lack of facUities to absorb prethem, obviously these students must be pushed government schools, causing real pressures It with overcrowding and, of course, costing the and the taxpayer very much more. This pohcy is reasonable and sound. It is a polpuricy that this Government has adopted and will continue to adopt to try to maintain that level of conassistance to non-government schools. The Government has accepted the Commission's new recommendation that funding for the emergency scheme of $500,000 would be appropriate next year within the total funds available. of This scheme provides emergency grants to nongovernment schools suffering severe financial difficulties as a result of an unexpected drop in very enrolments of country students. An amount of not $ 14.8m will be provided for services and development programs in 1978. The Governbe ment has accepted the Commission's recommendation that the allocations for development and associated staff replacement should be combined to give moreflexibUityto the States. For the special projects program, the Government has accepted the proposed allocation of $3.6. to be comprised of $3m for school level innovations and $0.6m for national level activities. I turn now to specific purpose programs. The Government will be continuing programs for disadvantaged schools in country areas and for special education, including provisions for children in institutions, at the same base level as in 1977. As recommended by the Commission, the base program for migrant and multi-cultural educauon, whilst the same in total has been adjusted between the States and systems to bring the payments more in Une with the actual distribution of migrant chUdren. Included in the amount of $23.4m provided for the joint Commonwealth-State program is an amount of $3.8m for disadvantaged schools in country area projects. One of these projects is based at CharlevUle in my electorate and is working well. The whole project is designed to benefit all the appropriate areas throughout Australia. The project centred at CharlevUle runs from Roma to the Northern Territory border and south to the New South Wales border. It is intended, however, to work with the New South Wales State authorities and a meeting will be held at Bourke on 8 and 9 November to promote the combined Queensland-New South Wales-Commonwealth scheme. It is proposed that a radio facUity should be used at Bourke but at the present time the radio is not yet Ucensed. I feel it is very important that a licence should be granted and I will be approaching the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson) to see whether provision for the granting of this licence could be expedited. I refer next to the Isolated ChUdren *s Parents Association and the tremendous work and great sacrifice the people who comprise that organisation have made. The cost of education to people in outlying areas is a tremendous burden and something more will have to be done about it. Non-government boarding schools have provided much of the education for students who have to live away from home. Hostels provided by organisations such as church bodies, the Country Women's Association and local authorities also have played a very commendable part in this area but costs are of great concern and many boarding schools have closed the boarding section of their schools. There is a need for greater assistance to parents who have to send their chUdren away to school.",38

Apparently he takes his priorities fromfigures.That wtil not work. My colleague from Darling Downs (Mr MCVeigh), who is a good interjector but who does not offer much in the form of creative thought in these matters, had the brass to say that State schools in Australia have money running out of their ears. I think it is time he visited some of them. It is time he visited Melbourne. I will give him a tour of my electorate. Mr MCVeigh- Mr Deputy Chairman, I claim to have been misrepresented.",39
89,Mr DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,TARIFF PROPOSALS,Order! The Committee cannot accept a personal explanation at thistime.The Committee will hear the personal explanation immediately after the speaker hasfinishedhis remarks. I call the honourable member for WUls.,39
90,Mr BRYANT,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"If I have done the honourable member disservice or been inaccurate in my statement about him, I will be glad if he corrects it because if there is one member of this place who needs to be correct occasionally it is the honourable member for Darhng Downs. One of the features of the last three or four years has been the consistent attack upon the Labor Party's education policy by people who use it as a stalking horse in politics, without saying anything specific about what they would have done. It was a remarkable performance to raise the amount of pubhc effort in education in Australia in the three years in which the Labor Party was in government. It is significant that when the attacks come upon Labor's expenditure on education they are never specific. WhUe in opposition the Government indulged in a campaign of innuendo and misrepresentation and whtie in government has continued to misrepresent its own activities. I refer for instance to the statement that it is mamtaining 2 per cent real growth in education. That is very difficult to support from thefigures.One of the weaknesses in education over the last two or three years, perhaps four years, has been the hiatus in pubhc demand, pubhc criticism and public campaigning. The ordinary citizen seems to have lapsed into some sort of apathy about education. It is very rare now for delegations to come to members to tell them what is needed in education. There were features of the Australian education system which the Labor Government wished to sponsor and there were features which it wanted to eradicate. The Australian education system has been notable for its universality for the 100 years. It has been available across the nent to all and sundry, accessible to everybody. Despite its universahty there were innumerable inequaUties which are still there. Unfortunately this Government, through its assistance to the private sector in education and particularly the a very level six schools, is aggravating the situation. The heart ofimportant Australian education system unfortunately consits tinues to be conservative in its approach to the evenonlevel future. I do not think the schools in Australia are different stages making adequate preparation for the future in buUdings are a disgrace respect of the form of society into which we are countries likely to be cast-and I think the position in 1977 this life is to compare present is markedly different even from 1967. When I look at the expenditure by the lum Development Centre I can see that last $2m was expended and this year there is an cation of $1.9m which is not a significant crease but when one takes into account inflation and other matters that are apparent in education, it is a significant decrease in terms of possible effort. I want to raise the question of technical cation and in particular the disadvantaged schools in my electorate. I point out to the that during our term in office-and it is possibly stiU the same-the Victorian Government was totally inadequate in its approach to these ters. The inner areas of Melbourne and great Sydney-it is the ones in Melbourne and in my own area particularly which I know best-ar places where there are gravely disadvantaged schools in which school buUdings are inadunderestimate equate, at which the cluldren come from disadyoung vantaged homes and the general social system or the avaUabUity of social amenities is inadequate. That is the place where we want to put in real effort. It does not matter much whether it government schools or non-government schools because they are both in a sinular situation. I have a deep personal disappointment in fact that I still have to raise in this place the ation of one of my own schools. I raise this afterwick noon the situation of the Brunswick Technical School. I was the secretary of my Party's eduduction cation committee almost from a year or so after became a member of Parliament until I entered the Ministry in 1972. During that period the Party apparatus worked solidly on the question of education, developed its priorities and knew where it wanted to go but one of the great inadequacies of the system was having to rely upon the States. By the time the Commonwealth Government sent the money off to various of the State governments and particularly Victoria one could be sure that one was not going to end up last with the same priorities as the Commonwealth contiGovernment and I suggest that the same tiling apphes at the present moment. There is total inadequacy in buUdings, equipment and in the capacity to produce special education. The Brunswick Technical School is, of course, institution because it is in the one of the industrial areas in Australia. It 2Vi acres of broken asphalt which is not in the sense that there have been of development over time. The for one of the wealthiest in the world. One of the sad things of standards with the standards that existed in the days of our grandCurricuparents-m y own grandparents and the great year grandparents of the younger members of this alloHouse. Not far away from the Brunswick Techdenical School there are buUdings which in their time must have been the best buUdings for mUes around. I refer to schools which were buUt in the 1880s. Now the hotels down the road are better equipped, better serviced and better buUt than eduthe schools to which I am referring. The Brunswick Technical School operates in seriously House depressed surroundings. I was told that when people tried to reglaze the windows the timber was so bad that it would not hold the glass. So at matthis school we are developing young people of competence in surroundings of great drabness and inadequacy. I want to demonstrate this e by showing honourable members some of the work produced at this school. I think we totaUy and undervalue the capacity of people to be trained in all sorts offieldsof competence. We get a view of their literacy or capacity to write or to be articulate in our language and then measure them by that view. I visited the goes to Brunswick school on Sunday and I was incautious enough to admire some of the things the cluldren were turning out. So they gave me some. I have one here. It is a small vice that would the probably cost about $20 in a shop. That was situmade in one of the machine shops of the BrunsTechnical School. I suppose there is nothing surprising about that-it is a high quality proas far as I can see-bu t the young people I who worked on that were 14 and 15 years old. As I see the education system in Australia it does not really stretch its candidates enough. It does not offer enough opportunity for them to move against themselves further and further in this area of general competence. They are not going to find enough jobs in Austraha in which technology is removing 2,000 jobs a week, in a country in which 170,000 jobs were lost in the manufacturing industry over the last two years, a country in which there is going to be enormous redundancy of young people, a country in which at least one-third of the 250,000 coming out of the schools, universities and colleges this year will be unemployed for six months to nine months. We have to find new ways. I do not know how many people have been put out of work in Austraha because of imports of things like this vice made in low wage countries. I do not quite know what the solution is but I do know there is an extraordinary area of competence which we could employ if we had enough imagination to create new jobs or start new works, even to adopt a different pohcy about mass production and so on. I suggest that the House take good note of this. 1 hope that my colleagues here will take an opportunity next time they are driving to Melbourne from the airport to turn off the Tullamarine highway, turn down Dawson St, Brunswick, and stop and take a look at the Brunswick Technical School. If they cannot then steel themselves to demand that treasurers and the governments take action in a situation hke that, it is impossible to get through to them.",39

93,Mr MCVEIGH,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"In the speech on the estimates for the Department of Education my colleague the honourable member for Maranoa, Mr Corbett, was elaborating on the contribution by the Commonwealth Government and the State governments to the area of education.

Unfortunately- I know quite unintentionally-m y colleague the honourable member for Wdls (Mr Bryant) took my remarks to be directed to State schools having money running out of their ears. That was not correct, it was not the intention of my remark. I was referring to the fact that some of the States, on account of the generosity of the Federal Government have money running out of their ears. The reference was not directed towards schools.",41
94,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"The honourable member cannot be personally misrepresented by interjection, but he has now successfully explained the position.",41
95,Mr MOORE,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"I listened with great interest to the speech of the honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant). I was wondering whether he was giving the chamber a travelogue on his electorate as he pleaded a special case for a technical college in his area. I want to make a few comments in this debate on education today in Austraha. It seems to me that a number of misconceptions are creeping into our education system. What concerns me most of all is what to do with the final product because far too often these days when one speaks to personnel managers of compames and when one speaks to people in various avenues of employment and you see the product which has been turned out from some of our educational centres you must pose the question: Are we on the right course? I sometimes feel that not a great deal of consideration is given to the basic causes but rather to some of the personal ambitions and empire building by people in some of our educational institutions. We are turning out a product which in many cases will be unemployable. We are unrelating our causes to the demands of today. We are not listening to the demands of the personnel managers in this nation. I think it is a matter of very great concern that these matters are not being looked at in the appropriate areas. I have spent a number of years on the council of an Austrahan university. I have been to two universities, one here and one overseas. I am quite convinced that we need these days to review the general course of education. Expectations to the young have been fanned to a general degree that will not be able to be met in the 1980s and 1990s. A more practical approach is needed to the general avenues of education. I have to refer only to the well known Bachelor of Arts courses at universities. They are generally interesting but in the main produce a product which is not employable in today's society. I have to look only at the question of where is the general tenor of direction of some of our universities and some of our other institutes. I am bound to say that I do not see it there. There is not the relationship between the institutions and universities and society that there ought to be. There is not the cross relationship in setting the criteria of a course, in setting up the various parts of a department, that one would like to see when looking to the future of Austrahan youth. Where is the wisdom in this? It is in educauon that we have planned everyone's expectations as to the salvation of the future. I believe we will need to approach this in a far more pragmatic way. I refer for a start to the basic problem of sabbatical leave. One of the points which comes up at university councils and senates is the increasing use of this leave for the personal travel of a member of a senate or of an institution withback out any real relativity to what he is doing. gest that some consideration be given to more appropriate use of this leave. A senior member of a law faculty could well exchange his year and work for a law firm and a member of the law firm could well work at the university. The same could be applied to engineering, countancy and a number of the other prothe fessions. This, in itself, could start to build relationship between the institute, the eduthat cational centre and the period of real life. In view we are letting them float apart too much. I refer also to a number of people who go through universities under the very privileged conditions which exist today and who opt out of life and stay at that institution because they not want to go any further. There are some very good academics; quite frankly there are some very average ones, people who are afraid to out and swim in the water. I would like to see this cross relationship that instead of a sabbatical junket we take on a suggestion that the people concerned might go into the real world and work in the accountancy offices, in the engineering offices, in the mines and in the law offices of the nation and thereby get some real relativity into some of the courses of today. Another avenue which I think will have to looked at in the near future is the question of leges of advanced education. These were estabNevertheless, lished in fairly recent times to develop technical education. There is far more techmcal education needed in Austraha. What has really happened in a lot of these colleges is that the empire builders have arrived. Instead of the colleges being satisfied with granting diplomas they now have to grant degrees. So they move within their own priorities and their own wishes. Frankly, it time that stopped. These are technical education centres, and that is the services they should forced to provide. It should be out with the empire builders and on with the common sense. The 1980s and 1990s I think will be a period challenge for the individual- a personal test, one in which people should be equipped to meet the difficulties that will undoubtedly annual abound. It is not a time to fan expectations. It is Labor Government, not a time to turn technical education courses education expenditure into another form of university which in itself This policy of no growth produces an unemployable product. We are not seeing the development or the mand for tertiary services that a lot of people expected. There is no reason to expect that this will occur under the economic circumstances that are likely to prevail in the 1980s and into the 1990s. I would like to bring some real relevance into not only the universities but also the I sugcolleges of advanced education. Within these the universities and centres there ought to be, through the Department of Education, some way in which the general thrust of spending programs is reviewed. In my time on one of the university councils it was a question of who could put up the acbest muscle around thefinancecommittee and at council meeting itself. Honourable members a cross might well say that there is nothing new about and that it even happens here. But it is a case my where priorities should be set. Individuals should not be allowed to get into the centres with their own particular bent and direct moneys into areas which have very httle relevance to the future. As time is rapidly getting away from me, I will do conclude on this point. While I have dealt with the higher levels of education I think we also need to do something in the primary and secondget ary levels. Governments in the 1960s and 1970s in have undoubtedly paid a lot more attention to education than previously. I think they need to be commended for that, particularly in regard to universities. In some ways I suspect that secondary education has not been brought up to date and has not quite met the demands. It is this area in which the majority of young people will have to make their decision as to what they will do in be the future. In some cases the decision will be colmade for them by their inabihty to pass exams. it is in the secondary school that we should be putting forward the opportunities and involving these people within the community and involving the community with the schools. Unless the younger people are exposed to the likelihood of their future employment, to the real problems of the world ana to the real problems down the street, frankly we are putting is them into a position where they will not be able to cope when they leave school and when they be are forced onto the job market and into relationships with other people which they may not be able to handle. I simply wanted to make this of brief contribution to the estimates and to consurvival gratulate the Government.",41
96,Dr CASS,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"After an real growth of 39 per cent under the there has been no growth in under this Government. means no growth towards equality of opportunity, no growth on dethe part of disadvantaged schools in catching up with advantaged schools and no growth in terms of innovative programs which could tackle the needs of pupils and teachers by creating better teaching methods and better learning situations. At present there is no growth in better educationopportunity and no growth towards a fairer distribution of the benefits of education. Yet the education tem is failing to meet the needs of hundreds thousands of school children each year who graduate without basic literacy or numeracy skills. An Australian Council for Educational Research survey of 10-year old and 14-year students found that there is a considerable lem in Austrahan schools with significant numbers of children failing to reach adequate levels of numeracy and literacy. The survey also revealed that about only half the students were thought by their teachers to teaching were receiving it. These children are functionally ilhterate or innumerate. They cannot manage the every day tasks such asfillingin forms, reading street names and keeping a bud-growth get-task s required for normal living in our plex industrial nation. A minimum level of basic education is essential in the society in which live. This is not the only area of failure of our cation system. Further educational disadvantage is suffered by many other children, such as a countiy students, Aborigines, migrants and girls. Country students suffer from high teacher turncation, over, lack of support services, inadequate boardbe ing facilities and Umited curricula, physical ties and social contact. According to the report the Senate Select Committee on Aborigines Torres Strait Islanders, the school system has faUed Aborigines very badly by its inappropriaoff teness and inadequacy. This faUure to meet the needs of Aboriginal students is at least in part due to socio-economic factors, racial prejudice, cultural irrelevancy and inappropriate teaching and curriculum resulting in high absenteeism and dropout rates. The eduation system has faUed the migrant communities in two major areas-the maintenschools ance of home culture through schooUng and the achievement by migrants of competence in the EngUsh language. The education system has faUed many girls by reinforcing the expectation of different behaviour and goals for boys and girls and therefore greatly limiting the choices open to girls. Finally, educational institutions have faUed in many cases to adequately equip students for the work situation or for making the best choice of a career. The worldng party on transition from secondary education to employlook ment found many inadequacies in the present career preparation services for students during secondary schooling. Students do not have an to explore the whole spectrum of career choices open to them, their personal suitsysabihty for particular careers, the employment of prospects in each and the educational implications involved. The poor performance of the education system in this area has particular relevance in our current situation of high youth old unemployment. WhUst recognising that many probfactors have influenced unemployment amongst school leavers, part of the problem is the low productivity of early school leavers because of inadequate basic education and, of course, the who majority of those unemployed lack sufficient need remedial education and training. It is against this background that the Government has provided insufficient funds for the and development of our education syscom-tem. By faUing to honour his promises to mamtain real growth in education and to maintain a we rolling triennium funding system under which, during this nextfinancialyear, there would be a 2 per cent real growth in education, the Minister for Education (Senator Carrick) has destroyed eduany semblance of forward planning. Education is not something that can be turned on and off Uke tap. It is simply not possible to plan sound education on a yearly basis. AU planning in eduif it is to be sound and productive, must long range planning. Yet, in this time of facUibudgetary restraint, the Government has forced ofcutbacks in expenditure for government schools and in order to hand over an extra $2m to nongovernment level 1 and level 2 schools-the best in the community. These were the schools that were acknowledged in the original report of the Karmel Commission to be way in advance of the remainder of the educational sector. It was hoped that with the increased expenditure on education under the program that we had initiated chUdren in these deprived schools- I am referring to the bulk of the state schools and a large proportion of the Catholic parochial in the private school sector might attain by 1980 the level of cluldren in the rich schools. They have not got that far as yet. Yet wefindthe Government moving $2m from this state school system to the richest part of the private school sector. In fact, a total of $ 13.8m was transferred to non-government schools, forcing cutbacks not only in allocations for government schools and emergency assistance for non-government schools but also in the services and development program and the special projects program. Let us more closely at the cuts to the services and development and special projects programs, particularly the latter. In 1974-75, $6m was aUocated for special projects. In 1975-76, this dropped to $3.59m. It was raised slighdy to $4.26m in 1976-77 and cut back to $3.6m in 1977-78. Referring to the importance of these programs the Schools Commission report for 1977 stated: . . . each of them represents a vital element in strategies to improve the quality of frills only to be funded in good times. In referring to the special projects or innovation programs, the Schools Commission said: These grants are important energisers, helping to generate more effective use of large resources already deployed in schools. The Commission rejected the Government's guidelines which suggested a $4m cut across the two programs on the ground that it would seriously damage the programs' effectiveness. Here we have a government which claims to be lowed by committed to improving the quality of the Austrahan education system, yet it forces cuts in the already very inadequate funds devoted to checking finding solutions to the failures and inadequacies of our system. How can these problems be overthird come without exploration and experimentation to develop more constructive approaches to eduordination cation? After a cut of $3.5m in this area there will ity be few, if any, innovations. This means that there time, is no money being allocated for rethinking and terial ICommittee, re-examining the basis of education in order to make educauon both more relevant and more accessible to the children in our community. Solco-ordinating utions will not be found by simply maintaining services. the existing education system or even by increasI ing expenditure on its own. In fact, many people claim that the problem with our present education system is that have to get away from these new-fangled approaches to educauon. We have to get back the three Rs. The reahty is, of course, that the majority of cluldren going through our schools and the majority of schools know nothing of modern education techniques.

97,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY,"by leave-On 21 August 1974 the previous Government established a Royal Comeducation; they are not optional mission on Intelligence and Security and appointed the Honourable Mr Justice Hope as the royal commissioner to inquire into and make recommendations on the intelligence and security services the nation should have available to it. The Government has now completed its consideration of the eight reports presented to it by the royal commissioner. The Royal Commission's Eight Reports The first report outlines the procedures folthe Royal Commission and requires no further comment. The second report makes findings and recommendations on security and a security appeals tribunal. The report dealing with the machinery for ministerial and official control, direction and coof Australia's intelligence and securservices was the subject of the statement. I made in the House on 5 May this year. At that announced the appointment of a Minissupported by a Permanent Heads Committee, to provide a better system for the intelligence and security also announced our decision to establish the Office of National Assessments and legislation to establish that Office has subsequently been we passed by Parliament. The fourth report specifically relates to the Austrahan Security to Intelligence Organisation. The fifth and sixth reports relate to particular specialist intelligence collection agencies. The seventh report, written by a constant to the Commission, is an historical study of Australian intelligence and security The eighth concerns administrative arserrangements for the storage and custody of the Royal Commission's records. I will not be commenting further on these last two reports in this In accordance with undertakings previously to the House, I am tabling those parts of Commission's reports which the royal considered can be made pubhc to national security and andecisions on them. form pretabled on 5 May. I now table thefirstreport, the second report other than Appendices 2-A, 2-C and 2-F, and volumes 1 and 2 of the fourth report. For the first time the Parhament and the people of Austraha are being authoritively informed of policy; fundamental considerations relating to resources Austraha's national security. For thefirsttime Parliament and people can read the careful curity. assessments of an independent judicial authority who has had full access to all the information and the time and resources to thoroughly analyse them. The Royal Commission's Basic Judgments Mr Speaker, the Government has accepted the basic judgments of the Royal Commission Intelligence and Security and has implemented a sweeping range of reforms to achieve them. In essence Mr Justice Hope's basicfindingsare these: (I) AUSTRALIA'S NEEDS FOR NA NA Austraha needs a highly professional system of intelUgence and secunty services, and this need is more apparent than ever before. Australia needs intelligence of quality, timeliness and relevance. (II) THREATS TO INTERNAL SECURITY interest Such a professional system should include security intelligence service to investigate and provide intelUgence about threats to the internal security of the nation. Australia faces, and has matters. faced or may face, threats to its internal security from various types of action to which I shall later refer. (III) CIVIL LIBERTY AND NATIONAL NA A balance must be struck between the need to respond decisively to this threat and the imperathreats tive of preserving Australia's open processes debate, discussion and commerce. Mr Justice . Hope has recognised 'that a balance between the vided rights of individual persons and the of the security of Australia as a nation is no Espionage, simple or easy thing to achieve'. paragraph 10). He concludes, quoting from the 'Active 1975 Rockefeller Report on the Central of activities Intelligence Agency: '. . . in the final strengthen analysis, pubhc safety and individual liberty sustain each other'. (Fourth report, paragraph 10). (IV) PROTECTION OF CONFIDENTIAL NA NA Austraha has classified information which the Australian Government has a duty to protect in the interests of the nation. These secrets are not hmited to matters of national defence or foreign they extend to matters relating to national and the national economy; their disclosure would prejudice Australia's national seThus the security checking of public servants should continue to be undertaken subject to a series of basic reforms. (V) THE NECESSITY FOR SECRECY The actual activities, programs and priorities of the intelligence and security services should not be revealed, as to do so would be to jeopardon ise national security. (VI) COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW The intelligence and security services should always comply with Commonwealth and State laws. (VII) PARLIAMENTARY NA The intelligence and security agencies should continue individually to be subject to ministerial responsibility, and in addition should be coUectively subject to central oversight and coordination by senior committees of Ministers and permanent heads. Considerations of the nation's should prevaU over the full range of the a agencies activities, and to this end the Government and the Opposition should develop a bipartisan approach to intelligence and security Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation Inhis fourth report concerning ASIO Mr Justice Hope's basic finding is that Australia needs and should have a security intelUgence service to investigate and provide intelUgence about to the internal security of the nation.' of (Fourth report paragraph 657). He stated: . . On the basis of what has been submitted or proto me, I find that Australia faces, and has faced or may face, threats to its internal security . . . and that ASIO preservation should investigate . . . which is the covert collection of (generally (Fourth report, secret) intelligence. measures' a general expression to cover a variety by which a power can weaken another power or itself vis-a-vis that other power, including the establishment of agents of influence' the dissemination of'disinformation' other forms ofclandestine or deceptive action subversion, which is activity whose purpose is directly or ultimately, to overthrow constitutional government, and in the meantime to weaken or to undermine it. Sabotage, which is the destruction, damaging or impairment of defence installations, etc, which would be useful to an enemy or a foreign power. Mr Justice Hope continued: Two funher kinds of activity should be investigated by ASIO, although they may not always involve a direct attack on Australia. Terrorism, which is politically motivated violence, or the threat of that violence. The organisation in Australia of, or of assistance for, ent political activity in foreign countries. (Founh Repon paragraph 661). I will now briefly summarise the royal comusuahy missioner's comments on two of the major areas of threat-espionag e and subversion. Mr Justice Hope rejected the views that some people had expressed to him that espionage was The not a significant problem in Austraha. The royal has commissioner especially warned that 'Australia (Fourth must not be so naive as to think that it has some exemption from clandestine operations or that it munist Panythis, need not take steps to protect itself against them'. (Fourth report paragraph 41). The royal commissioner stated that this conclusion was subnumbers stantiated 'by a large amount of intelUgence held often by ASIO which cannot be made public'. (Fourth report, paragraph 41). However, in the royal commissioner's words, there are 'some which can be stated publicly and which I'-that is the royal commissioner-'regar d as supporting academic the conclusions I have come to.' (Fourth Report, paragraph 40). The royal commissioner notes able evidence of espionage against Austraha during the Second World War and the Petrov Commission's findings that from 1943 until Petrov's defection, Union of Soviet SociaUst Republics intelligence agents had been operata ing in Australia. He further says that independently of the Petrov Commission'sfindingshe intelUgence, was-thes e are his words-'completel y satisfied that the USSR intelUgence services were operataragraph ing in Austraha up to the time of Petrov's defecaison tion and that a number of Austrahans, some concurity sciously and some unconsciously did reveal information about classified material to USSR intelligence officers or their agents'. (Fourth report, paragraph 40). He refers to Mr I . F. Skripov. Mr Skripov re-opened the Soviet Embassy in 1959 and was expelled in aspects February 1963 because of his clandestine Government intelUgence activities. The royal commissioner states that the numbers of intelUgence officers now operating clandestinely in Australia 'are much larger in the 1940's and 1950's and are growing'. Again these are his words: 'For example, proportion of USSR intelligence officers ASIO's represented in that country 's diplomatic mission in Australia is consistent with overseas estimates of USSR representation in the USA and NATO countries'. (Fourth report, paragraph 40). In this connection, the Royal Commission quotes an estimate of Professor Leonard Shapiro, Chairviol- man of the Institute for the Study of Conflict that '. . . around half of those (Soviets) accredited as diplomats to NATO countries are engaged in intelUgence operations of one kind or another . . . (Fourth report, paragraph 40, footnote 4-18). Espionage Subversion The royal commissioner states: amount of domestic subversive activity in Australia varied from time to time. The material before me does not establish that there is a very large amount at present. Repon, paragraph 76). As against the two main communist panies, the Comof Australia and the Socialist Party of Australia, have strong influence in some unions. They exercise a power greatly in excess of that which their would justify, among otherreasonsbecause they strongly suppon the interests of trade unionists and put their full force behind industrial issues. At other times, they make use of industrial disputes for matters their own political purposes. The Trotskyists and other left radical groups are active in and political areas and are succeeding in establishing themselves in many places of influence. Right radical groups are still active and the basis for extreme right wing action is certainly not dormant. (Founh the considerRepon, paragraph 77). ASIO-Functions and Performance In considering threats such as these Mr Justice Hope also examined various ways of estabUshing security intelUgence service. He concludes that 'The essential conception of ASIO as an and not an executive agency, is right for our national circumstances.' (Fourth report, P 660). He notes that ASIO 'maintains both here and abroad with the internal seservices of several friendly nations' and he concludes: 'These relationships contribute significantly to ASIO's overaU efficiency'. (Fourth report, paragraph 707). Again those are the the case of royal commissioner's words. The royal commissioner was criticial of some of the past performance of ASIO. The is determined that ASIO's performance should be beyond reproach. We have therefore accepted all of Mr Justice Hope's major recommendations and we propose to than amend the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act accordingly. The major effect the of those amendments will be to ensure that activities will be expanded to enable it to investigate and to report on activities which threaten Austraha's internal security. ASIO have a statutory responsibihty to advise the Government about the following: Espionage Sabotage Subversion Terrorism Domestic activity related to violence and what the Royal Commissioner refers to 'active measures. Mr Justice Hope has updated ASIO's functions to enable it to respond to the reahty of the The relationship between the Director-General of Security and the Government will be defined in accordance with the royal commissioner's recommendation based on hisfindingthat, under the existing ASIO Act, there are legal doubts as to the extent to which the Minister ive lawful directions to the Director-General f ecurity. The Director-General of Security will be accountable to the Attorney-General and Prime Minister. The royal commissioner considers that the legal powers exercisable by ASIO regarding its couragement coUection of intelUgence should be clarified and the responsibUity for their supervision and conThat trol identified. Subject to the conditions by the Royal Commission ASIO may obtain warThat rants from the Attorney-General for purposes large relevant to security to facUitate the acquisition of into information about intelUgence activities threattakenaccount ening Australia's security. This is consistent with the pattern established in other countries with a Westminster system of government. Hope said: The circumstances in which these powers might be exerpolicies. cised are not frequent (Founh repon, paragraph 139). For example, in regard to ASIO's use of telephone taps the judge comments: The number of warrants issued since the enactment legislation (authorising them) has been quite modest intelligence yield has often been extremely valuable. report, paragraph 141). In the performance of its statutory ties ASIO will carefuUy observe the principles delineated by the Royal Commission: (A) That it operates within concerned only with matters relevant to security. (B) That it always complies with the law. (C) And that it observes standards of propriety intruding on therightsand freedom of persons to the extent that the curity justify, and the law allows. (Founh paragraph 786). Honourable members will notice that the Royal will Commission has made a number of recommendations regarding the policies and practices to be followed by the Government and ASIO. The Government has accepted these. Significant features of them include: The Leader of the Opposition shaU be kept informed about security matters and shall have access to the Director General and his annual classified report. The abroad Government will continue the practice of 'no as comment' on aUegations about ASIO's activities. ASIO shall not provide security intelligence in any form, either directly or indirectly on an attributable basis or not, to the Press or other 1970s. media. As the Commonwealth agency responsible for the defence and maintenance of Australia's internal security ASIO is entitled to the confidence and respect of the nation. I also refer tofiverecommendations taken can from Volume III of the fourth report relating to of ASIO's future effectiveness. The Director General of Security has advised that these five the paragraphs can be made pubhc without prejudice to national security. They are: That the Director-General receive strong suppon and enfrom the Government in his task of improving the effectiveness of ASIO. ASIO management be active in opening and mainspecified taining communicauon with staff. the Government recognise that, in the future, quite sums will be needed to improve ASIO's capacity: that those giving consideration to ASIO's budgetary bids take that past levels of expenditure should not be as arealisticbenchmark. That ASIO ensure that the Government is made aware of Mr Justice its needs for resources. That ASIO shouldreceivestrong and sympathetic suppon from the Public Service Board in improving its personnel (Founh repon, Volume III, paragraph 818-822). I have been advised by the Director-General of Security, Mr Justice Woodward, that he has taken action to give effect to those recommendaof tions of the Royal Commission that concern The improvements in ASIO's internal administration (Fourth and management and generally to aU other recommendations which do not call for poUcy responsibUidecisions by the Government. Mr Speaker, I have outlined in broad terms the terms of its statute and is the nature of our reforms. Further detaUs of the action being undertaken by the Governmentwhich are in any event set out as recommendations in the fourth report which I have tabledby not will be given by the Attorney-General (Senator except Durack), when he introduces amendments to the requirements of the nation's sereport, Australian Security IntelUgence Organisation Act. Security Checking and Security Appeals The Austrahan Security IntelUgence Organisation carries out security checks for CommonAustralian wealth departments primarily in relation to Commonwealth employees but also in a Umited way for a range of special cases which the Royal Commission refers to as 'immigration cases'. the second report, the royal commissioner examhave ines the need for and basis of this ing process. Mr Justice Hope finds that Australia needs a system of security checks for two reasons: The serious nature of the security threat to Australia-Honourable members may wish to refer to the second report, paragraphs 12-13 the fourth report, paragraphs 34-36-and the fact that, as the royal commissioner said: Australia has secrets which the Australian Government has a duty to protect in the interests of the nation. Report, paragraph 196). The royal commissioner reported that the security checking system has not been formally reviewed since the early 1950s, and found contains a number of faults, including: The existWithout ing security checking categories are too wide. can That is, they strain ASIO's resources unnecessarily and are objectionable from viewpoint. There is some confusion about the nature of the security assessment ASIO provides. There has been some blurring of the demarThe cation between the responsibUities of ASIO those of departments and instrumentalities. There have been deficiencies in the preparation and content of ASIO's security assessments and the use of them by departments. In Mr Justice Hope observes that security checking is a complex and difficult task. He said: ASIO's information, even if accurate, will rarely, be complete. It can be led into error by the erroneous incomplete nature of the material on which it makes its assessments. (Second report, paragraph 10S). All investigations and judgments actions can involve mistakes. ASIO and its officers exception. (Second report, paragraph 115). The Government has decided to implement a that number of reforms designed to overcome the deficiencies in existing arrangements. Principal commissioner's amongst these reforms are the following: A Seretrospective curity Appeals Tribunal will be established. administrative Steps wiU be taken to reduce to the minimum possible number the people to be security checked. ASIO's security checking procedures will be revised and improved. From now on, perstated to apply toofdecisions sons who are the subject of adverse or qualified commencement assessments, will be notified of that fact and the general nature of the supporting mformation except to the extent that in the interests national security they cannot be notified in certain special circumstances contemplated by Royal Commission. In such special cases the Attorney-General as Minister responsible for the Security Intelligence Organisation Act-no t the Prime Minister as Mr Justice Hope proposes-wU l have to issue a certificate vetoing notification. Persons having been notified of an In adverse or quaUfied assessment will be able to the assessment impartially examined by the security checkSecurity Appeals Tribunal. Mr Speaker, these reforms are designed to main make security checking for Commonwealth employees more efficient and most importantly, to reduce as far as possible the intrusion into the and private lives of Commonwealth employees. I shall now outline further detaUs of some of these reforms, and also indicate those instances in which the Government has, after careful con(Second sideration, modified the royal commissioner's recommendations. The Security Appeals Tribunal that it The royal commissioner has found: adequate machinery forreviewof security assessments of persons . . . grave and permanent injustices occur. (Second repon, paragraph 200). a civU liberties He concluded: ASIO's security assessments should be subject to an appeals system. (Second repon, paragraph 115). Government agrees with this view. The Seand curity Appeals Tribunal recommended by the Royal Commission will be estabUshed to review adverse or quaUfied security assessments and any supporting information provided by ASIO relatthis regard, ing to such assessments. The Royal Commission recommended that the Tribunal's review function should be made if ever, retrospective to the inception of ASIO in 1949. and The Government has given careful consideration to this proposal but has decided that the matters about persons and their subject to the Tribunal's jurisdiction should be are no those occurring on or after the date on which the Tribunal is estabhshed. We have been advised there would be legal and substantial administrative problems associated with the royal recommendation. There is no Commonwealth statutory precedent for a grant of arightof appeal against an decision. The comparable appeals system estabhshed under the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975, is expressly given on or after the that Act. However, the of Government has devised certain procedures to give effect to the spirit of the royal comof missioner's recommendation. First, ASIO has been instructed to undertake a the review in the manner recommended by the Royal Commission, of any existing adverse or qualified assessment of persons currently in the employ of the Commonwealth. If in the light of that review, the adverse or qualified assessment is maintained, the person concerned will be notified, and will be entitled to appeal to the Tribunal against the new assessment. Second, the legislation establishing the Tribunal will allow the Government to refer to the Tribunal particular cases of people no longer in the employ of the Commonwealth. The Government intends to exercise this discretion in any case in which it appears a wrong assessment may have been made in the past. The Security Appeals Tribunal will be mainly concerned with Commonwealth employees, except for the 'immigration cases' about which I snail comment shortly. Thus all Commonwealth employees, as that term is broadly defined in paragraph 20 of the second report, will have appealrightsagainst adverse or quaUfied assessments. Legislation will be introduced to establish the Tribunal and, although the Tribunal's findings will generaUy be advisory, they will be binding in those cases the royal commissioner recommends. The Government has concluded that the Tribunal should have the composition and powers detaUed in Part H of the second report except for the modifications I have outlined. The procedures of the Tribunal envisaged by the Royal Commission will be given further consideration. In addition, the panel from which the Tribunal will be constituted will be enlarged to include more than one former public servant and more than one former member of the defence force. Security Checking The security checking process will be substantiaUy altered to make it more finely tuned to national security requirements. In contrast with existing practice not aU public servants or cants to the Public Service will be security checked. From now on, security checking of pubUc servants will take place only when it can reasonably expected that they will require to classified security matters or areas. In ance with Mr Jusuce Hope's recommendations, ASIO's security assessments will vary in accordthat ance with the level of access required. Far more extensive investigation will take place, example, for persons requiring access to the highest classification than for access to the lowest. AU aspects of ASIO's security assessments will be prepared in accordance with the royal commissioner's recommendations. The royal commission recommended that posIntelUgence itions in the PubUc Service for which security checking will be required should be publicly designated as such. However, the reports do not recommend how this could be implemented. The Government has the matter under consideration. Immigration Cases ASIO has provided security checks for the Commonwealth Government in certain immigration cases. The term 'immigration cases' refers to government activity relating to such matters as visas, entry permits, deportation, citizenship and passports. Mr Justice Hope has recommended that the reforms regarding security checking and security appeals for Commonwealth employees be apphed to these immigration cases with some minor modifications of detaU as necessary. ASIO's investigative work in this area will be directed to protecting the security of the nation and its assessments will be closely linked to judgments about any potential security threat involved. As in aU other matters, ASIO's role will be advisory. Australian citizens and persons whose continued presence in Australia is not subject to any limitation imposed by law wtil have full appealrightsto the Security Appeals Tribunal in respect of these immigration cases. The Government has accepted Mr Justice Hope's recommendations regarding immigration cases and the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MACKellar) will provide further detaUs regarding their implementation at a later stage. Compensation The royal commissioner makes a number of observations about the possible payment of compensation in relation to wrong security assessment. He notes that a wrong security assessment may sometimes cause detriment to the subject of the appliassessment, although the detrimentflowsfrom the consquent action of the employer authority. The royal commissioner recommends that the be Security Appeals Tribunal should have power to access report about compensation matters. accordHowever, the Government, having adopted the recommendation of the royal commissioner the Tribunal will be solely concerned with ASIO's assessments, not executive decisions of for government, has decided that compensation matters will be for the Government to determine, those requiring not the Tribunal. Australian Secret Intelligence Service The fifth report is about the Australian Secret Service, ASIS, an agency of the Australian Government the existence of which has not hitherto officiaUy been acknowledged. The Government agrees with Mr Justice Hope's recommendation that ASIS should be publicly acknowledged and on his recommendation the fifth report will not be pubhshed as to do would jeopardise national security. The report has been made avaUable to the Leader of the Opposition as the royal commissioner recbe so ommended. The royal commissioner recThe ommended 'that the Government accept the continuing need for an Australian Secret recognition IntelUgence Service and that ASIS be retained fulfil that role'. He reported that ASIS is a' singu-the larly and well run and well managed nals agency . . . right in concept for Australian circumstances'. The main function of ASIS is obtain, by such means and subject to such ditions as are prescribed by the Government, foreign intelUgence for the purpose of the protection or promotion of Austraha or its interests. The Government has accepted his recommenthose dation that the Service continue and be responparts sible to and under the control of the Minister Foreign Affairs. The funding of ASIS has in past been secret but, wiU in future be the subjecton of a one-Une appropriation like ASIO. ASIS's pacity to serve Australia's national interest continue to depend on its activides being fully protected by secrecy. The Government will therefore adhere strictly to the practice of ing to provide detaUs of ASIS's activities nor it be prepared to enter into any discussion Service. The Defence Signals Division The sixth report is about the Defence Signals Division. On the recommendation of the royal commission this report will not be made pubUc The Defence Signals Division is an organisation concerned with radio, radar and other emissions from the standpoint both of the inforAustralia mation and the intelUgence that they can providedevelop and of the security of our own Government com-intelligence munications and electronic emissions. It is agency which serves wide national requirements in response to national priorities. The royal missioner found that there were overriding advantages to Austraha in co-operation with tain other countries in these matters. In close conjunction with the defence force DSD provides a capabiUty which is just as mucheffective. an integral and essential part of a modern fence posture as a capabiUty in air or ground fence or maritime surveUlance. That capabUity a sophisticated one for which long periods ttaining and development are required. The royal commission said that 'the preservation secrecy as to the agency's operations is vital'. Thisfindingis accepted by the present Government. The Royal Commission recommended the retention of DSD, paid tribute to its work and so pointed to ways in which the agency could be further developed and improved. It stated: DSD is a very capably managed agency and believed to by most of its staff and others who deal with it Government will pay close attention to the recommendations of the Royal Commission. In of the enhanced status that the Royal toCommission recommends should be accorded to agency it will be restyled as the Defence SigDirectorate. In discussions of intelUgence matters, this Government will not provide to further information about DSD, nor confirm or condeny speculation or assertion about it. Conclusion There are a number of matters, particularly covered by thefifthand sixth reports and of the fourth report, which cannot be made forpubhc. As I mentioned earlier the royal comthe missioner has made particular recommendations publication. All of Mr Justice Hope's reports cahave been made avaUable to the Leader of the wiU Opposition. In respect of ASIO, ASIS and DSD the Government wiU maintain its long-standing practice, endorsed by the Royal Commission of refusnot providing mformation by way of comment, wUlconfirmation or denial, on matters affecting seon thecurity or intelUgence. Mr Speaker, these reforms, together with the establishment of the Office of National Assessments and the system of co-ordination and oversight of intelligence and security pohcy announced in my 5 May statement, are of fundamental significance to Australia. They are also of significance in a wider sphere. As Mr Justice electronic Hope states in his third report: is, on balance, fortunate to have been able to close intelligence links with some of the major agencies in the western world . . . an Mr Justice Hope's reports underline the significance of Australia's intelUgence and security com-relationship with non-communist countries, and the importance to these countries of high quaUty cerAustralian intelligence and security services. These reforms ensure that Australia's contribution in this wider sphere will be even more deI believe that honourable members will be de-assured by Mr Justice Hope's reports about the isessential and fundamental need for further of action by the Australian Government. He has brought to his task a perceptive realism with of which he balances the requirements of national security on the one hand with the requirements of personal liberty on the other. He has maintained a standard of excellence in the performance ofhis royal commission and in the quaUty of the advice he has tendered the Government. His reports show a clarity of expression and probity of thought which I am sure aU honourable members will applaud. I commend my predecessor for the action he has taken in launching the Royal Commission and my Government extends its appreciation to the New South Wales Government for releasing Mr Justice Hope for this major, arduous and important task. I present the following papers: Royal Commission on Intelligence and Securitylst report. 2nd report (other than Appendices 2A, 2C and 4th reportVolume I. Volume II.

APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 1977-78 Consideration resumed. Second Schedule. Department of Education Proposed expenditure, $479,963,000.",44
98,Mr CREAN,RESPONSIBILITY," I wish to say a few words on the proposed expenditure for the Department of Education. To some extent my words have been occasioned by what the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) said earher in this debate. I do not basically agree with most of the things he mentioned, but I think my views might vary somewhat in that I do not believe that the coUeges of advanced education should be in any sense regarded as inferior to the university system of education. In many respects there has been an over-exaggeration of university educauon in Australia, to the neglect of some other areas. Wefindin the Budget Paper 'National Income and Expenditure 1976-77' that on government account for the year ended June 1977 we spent $4,030m on education. That is the amount spent in the pubhc sphere. I am not aware of thefigurefor non-government education but it could well have reached some $600m or $700m. In addition, on capital account we spent close to $700m. Of course these days the major pan of the expenditure on education inates in this Parliament. I must say that I was disturbed recently when, as a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure, I was told by an authority who is now engaged in an examination of what I think is called post-secondary education on behalf of the Government that of every 100 people in Australia who start off to do what is called high school or a secondary course, only 30 per cent finish. I must say the figure astonished me somewhat.",51

100,Mr CREAN,RESPONSIBILITY,"Yes , I was rather astonished by thatfiguretoo. By comparision, in Japan, of every 100 chUdren who start a fuU high school course, more than 80 finish. I ask,firstly,why 2F. only 30 are deemedfitto complete the secondary course. It would seem to indicate to me that there is something wrong with pre-secondary education in Australia. I suppose that these days what is called motivation is missing to a great extent. In some ways I am not surprised that when people go to universities they are inclined to feel that because of the way in which society is currently organised there is no jobfitfor them to do. Maybe there is a Uttle bit of arrogance in that kind of assertion but I am afraid there is also a In Committee little bit of reality in it. The other day when we were having a debate here on employment, my friend, the honourable member for Diamond Valley (Mr Brown), indicated that he thought a large number of today's unemployed were unemployable. I do not think he meant it in the sense that they did not want to work, but in the sense that they just did not have the capacities that anybody wanted. I ask: For the 70 students who leave school before completing the full secondary course what channels of employment are currently avaUable? I do not bedis- Ueve that education should equip people only to work. I think that would be a wrong attitude to adopt. But I also think it is quite unrealistic not to believe that in today's world and in the forseeable future the majority of people will have to work when they complete their education. This is why I think there has to be a better attempt to match from the beginning what education is supposed to do in terms of satisfying both cultural and the vocational responsibUities. Surely in this great technological age, even of the 30 who go beyond the high school stage not many are very well equipped to face the lands of problems that will emerge in the future. We have heard a lot of what is now called further educauon or continuing education, and origsometimes rather philosophically permanent education, and that because of changing needs and circumstances people will need retraining and so on. The tragedy for Austraha is that in 23 years of Liberal-National Country Party and government-fro m 1949 to 1972-the Liberal and National Country parties did not think that retraining was necessary because there was not as much unemployment as there is currently. Surely everybody must acknowledge that in 1977, and looking forward to the end of this tury, manufacturing will no longer be the major source of absorbing into work of one kind or another those who go through the education sysful tem. There is no doubt whatever that ively we are spending more on education now than ever before. The two sums I have mentioned-the $4,000m on current account at government level and the $700m on capital account-compris e between them 6 per the gross domestic product. They account for more than 20 per cent of the total amount that is spent by all governments in Australia. If we add the other social welfare item, health, amounting to almost the same figure, it is about Environment, time we began to realise that, government expenditure ought to be cut, certain rigidities are involved. We suggest that the Government does not spend enough in total education. Compared with what is spent now, the amount spent on education doubled in two years from 1972-73 to 1974-75. Of course a largeurban part of the doubling was due to inflation. Actufunctions ally in the last two years it has also increased much as it did in that earlier period I mentioned. Education expenditure is now at least three times as much as it was four years ago. The rate increase has not been so great but certainly the aggregate expenditure is still large and will tinue to be large. It is about time we began these sorts of questions: How do we integrate needs of industry? I do not just mean manufacto turing; I mean the whole aspect of total employterms. ment. How do we integrate the needs in the 20 years to the school sample that is already ginning? After all, all the people we will need 20 years'timeare pretty well at school already will be within the nextfiveyears. It would seem to me that there is something wrong in the pre-secondary education area. Whether it is quaUty or something else, I do not know. I do not regard myself as proficient on aspect of the subject, but I think that this noon there was some meeting of minds on both sides of the chamber in respect of the fact that is not well with what is being done to meet the societary problems of one kind or another that we face. Most of us are doomed, ifi may use term, to being employees of somebody else. Onethe quarter of total employment is with government three-quarters is still with private enterprise. I do not know whether those proportions will change but I beheve they will have to. I believe then that there will have to berelativelymore employment in public enterprise, because the demands are tending to be more for tertiary sercenvices than for physical goods and services. I believe we should all acknowledge that there has to be a mixed economy; but I hope we are all careto see that we do not get a mixed up economy, quantitatwhich I think is what we have now. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development cent of Proposed expenditure, $41,540,000. Department of Construction Proposed expenditure, $ 194,494,000.",51
101,Mr UREN,RESPONSIBILITY," I move: That the proposed expenditure for the Depanment of Housing and Community Development be when we say that reduced by $10. The Budget is a clear indication that the Governon ment lacks any commitment to making Australian cities better places in which to Uve. The spending on programs in the broadly defined sector-whic h includes the interconnected of housing, sewerage, transport, urban as land, water supply, the national estate and other essential community services-ha s been cut by 16 per cent in real terms from the levels of the of 1976-77 Budget. The share of Budget outlays spent on the urban sector has fallen from almost conIVi per cent in the last Austrahan Labor Party to askGovernment's Budget to 5 per cent in this the Budget In this Budget welfare housing payments the States have been cut by 7V4 per cent in real Environmental protection programs are next down by 60 per cent. The sewerage and area beimprovement programs, both visionary urban in programs of the Labor Government, have been orcompletely abolished. After allowing for capitaUsed interest payments, the effective spending for growth centres and decentraUsation is down 58 per cent on last year's spending. Land commission programs have been almost wiped out. The sad situation is that this Government has this adopted a phoney approach in trying to overaftercome the serious problems that have grown up within urban communities. In all urban comall munities within Australia we find grave problems. Wefindon the local level the problems of increasing rates and taxes. Many of the problems that are insoluble without the assistance of the national Government. The major pressure on cities occurs in Sydney and Melbourne. That where enormous problems in providing services have occurred. Let us take as an example the urban wilderness that exists in the western urbs of Sydney. The city of Sydney stretches 35 miles to the west and for 35 miles to the west. In both those areas an enormous amount money is needed, as well as being needed in other parts of the city and particularly in the ing inner suburbs, for urban rehabUitation. Let me deal with the western suburbs of SydCommonwealth ney. If we draw a line from north to south through Rookwood Cemetery, between my elecdate. torate and the electorate of the right honourable member for Lowe (Sir WUUam MCMahon), we find that there are more people Uving west of that hne than actuaUy Uve in Western Australia or South Australia. In that region there is not one large theatre in which a ballet or a symphony ortown, chestra can perform. The lack of cultural faciliof ties in that area is appalling. At least the Labor Government entered into an arrangement to create cultural centres, thus providing job opportunities for people in the western suburbs of Sydney. It was proposed to build a Commonwealth centre at Parramatta which would include two theatres and other culat tural facUities so that at least the Commonwealth would be adding to the services of that area. Those plans were under way, but immediately upon coming to office, the present Government stopped them. We must do something about stopping the over-centralisation of our capital cities, particularly the central business districts Sydney, Melbourne and the other capital cities. Even Perth and Brisbane arefindingthat their city centres are becoming over built. We must make sure that our metropolises are developed in a much more rational way. This can only by developing metropolitan centres, as we had proposed to do in Sydney and Melbourne. We granted. had the agreement of both governments on this Borrowing limit on Average Weekly earnings (3) Proportion of AWErequiredto Service the Loan (1) Average house and land values contained in the Building bourne are September'76, Brisbane-December'76, Adelaide-June 1977 and comes from the new ABS publication issue.

After long discussions with the State planning authoriues in subVictoria we had reached agreement on buUding for centres in Melbourne at Sunshine, Broadsouthmeadows, Epping-Watsonia and Dandenong. of This would have achieved several things. Firstly, it would have enabled those people livon the fringes of the cities tofindjobs-at least clerical jobs-wit h the Commonwealth. The would give the lead with the private sector being encouraged to foUow at a later The Labor Government's attempts to assist the State governments to upgrade their urban public transport to make these centres viable were cut back drastically by the present Government. More than 50 per cent of people Uving on the fringes of cities, in places such as Campbellwork in or near the central business district Sydney and they are travelling about 70 mUes a day to and from work. By improving those centres not only would we provide cultural facUities but also we would provide job opportunities. We would also bring about a more efficient use of our transport services. Instead of everyone going one way in the morning and the other way night we would have a more balanced load. It is disturbing that the Federal Government has withdrawn completely from trying to assist in this way. Its own government agencies could have done many things in this regard. In the few moments I have left I want to deal with housing and with the problem of the deposit of gap faced by people trying to acquire their own homes in our major capital cities.

As it and is early days yet, there is not much more to say that particular subject except to point out that it is a start. I hope the Federal Government from strength to strength in this area. Dura ing the term of the previous Government there was an attempt to set up centres away from the metropoUtan areas of the capital cities, namely a Albury-Wodonga and some other areas, but the in Labor Government tended to look just at centres instead of looking at the overall concept that there are major towns and cities that are well worth assistance by some form of agdecentralisation. It is to be hoped that this will be extended. Certainly a lot more money will be but at least it is a positive start and I am that the people of Australia, particularly those in country towns and cities, wiU applaud this effort. I understand that a number of subhave been forwarded to the Minister and I know that he will take particular note of those from my electorate.

Originally the tenders were to go to metropoUtan builders as a package deal. I took up this matter with the Minby ister and pointed out to him the need to show the decentralised attitude by giving an opportunity apart to country buUders who are fully capable of buUding these structures. The Minister investhe matter and, as a result, country buUders had the opportunity to tender. A buildin Bendigo obtained one and has to the Departbuilt project Melbourne is a counterpart.

117,Mr MACKELLAR,MIGRANT EDUCATION PROGRAMS,"Warringah-Minister for It is in Immigration and Ethnic Affairs)-by leave- I he wish to inform honourable members on behalf of my colleague the Minister for Education (Senator Carrick) and myself of the Government's decision today to aUocate an additional $2.3m for migrant education programs for the remainder of the 1977-78financialyear. During the past few months it has become evident that there been a substantial increase in demand for grant education services. In particular some of the factors which have influenced today's detry. cision include the increasing number of refugees entering Austraha, the Government's desire improve access to language classes for migrant women, a general increase in demand for Mr Enghsh language classes for migrants, and commendable way in which some employers are encouraging their employees to develop facUity with the English language. We also recognise the possibiUty that migrants who currently do not have full time employment may wish to take education advantage of the opportunity to attend English increased towere language classes. The additional funds will bring the total avaUable for the adult migrant education proment's gram in 1977-78 to $ 11.82m. The funds will be used to maintain the program generally face of the increased demand and to provide English language classes for refugees and accommodation for classes at education centres in migrant hostels. The funds will also allow development of a number of new projects and increased Uving allowances for migrants taking full-time English courses. Tnis increase in living allowances is the second this year, as honourable members will recall from statements made by the Minister for Education following the Budget. The living allowances will be raised to the level of unemployment benefits. The Government trusts that this will remove any disincentive time students may have experienced previously. The new rates will be $49.30 a week for a single student and $82.20 a week for a student with dependent spouse. They will come into effect from early next month. New projects to benefit adult migrants will include full time English language courses Sydney, Melbourne and Perth during the ChristThere mas holiday period. About 300 people will benefit from these courses which will take advancountries tage of language laboratory and other facUities which would normally not be fully used at that time of the year. Closed-circuit television will used on a trial basis to help teach English guage to migrants Uving in a suitable high-rise housing complex. DetaUs of this project will announced by the Minister for Education as possible. The increased funds will also allow an increase in the number of English courses grants in the manufacturing sector. This of particular imponance for migrant women emthat ployees. The Government looks forward to the participation of migrants in the detaUed planhas ning and management of the Christmas hoUday micourses and the establishment of committees in each State to help estabUsh the courses in indusI point out in passing that these proposals reflect some of the preUminary suggestions of the to group reviewing the Post-Arrival Programs and Services to Migrants under the Chairmanship of F.E. Galbally, CBE. and the Austrahan Eththe nic Affairs Council. The Government will make funher announcements soon detailing the consultative anangements for both types of courses. In each of the two years 1974-75 and 1975-76 the total national enrolments in adult migrant 75,000 persons. This was 88,000 a gain of 17.3 per cent, in 1976-77, thefirstyear of the Fraser Government. funds The cunent decision demonstrates the Governrecognition of the imponance of English language instruction in the successful integration in the of non-English-speaking migrants. further Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford-Smith) - by leave-The Opposition welcomes the statethe ment but deplores the manner in which it has now been introduced. It provides for an additional $2.3m which is a very belated grant. It could well have been provided in the Budget allocation. It is very significant that the allocation is being rushed through at this stage because obviously an election is in the offing. Otherwise there would not have been any further payments for migrant education. Anybody who takes a fuU keen interest in adult migrant education will know that the various State Ministers have been making repeated representations to the Federal a Minister for Education (Senator Carrick) for more money. As a direct example, New South Wales sought more than $5m as the basic grant for adult migrant education. It received about $3m. The reason is as the Mmister for Immigrain tion and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MACKellar) says. are more difficulties now in migrant education. People are coming now from the Asian as refugees. There is an urgency in the field which was certainly obvious to the Government when it introduced the Budget. Let us look be at the record of the Government in monetary allanlocations. If cuts are to be made the obvious place to make them, as far as the Government is be concerned, is in migrant education. From the as soon point of view of the allocationsMr MACKellar-There were no cuts in miavailable to migrant education. will be Mr LIONEL BOWEN-The Minister says there were no cuts. I address his mind to the previous Budgets. In 1974-75 the adult migrant education allocation was $21.3m. In 1975-76 it was $21.4m. In the Government's first year of office the allocation was $10.6m. The Government has now increased it by this additional grant to $ 11.8m. Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1977-78 shows that the Government reduced the amount available for child migrant education. It is no good the Minister shaking his head. This is just a statement issued from the point of view of getting votes. It is no good saying that closed cuit television will be investigated as though it will help in adult migrant education without taking some positive action. The statement says that the Government will make further announcements soon. The first paragraph of the statement says that the Government's decision was made as though the matter had been reviewed for some time. During the past months an increase in demand for migrant education services has become evident. I have in my hand correspondence that clearly shows that the Ministers of various State governments are saying: 'Look, unless you do something for migrant education particularly in the adultfield,we will not even be able to maintain the existing paltry standards we are able to E rovide'. In the education vote substantial cuts ave been made in what have been called the special and disadvantaged areas. Those areas include adult migrant education. As a matter of fact the cuts in recurrent grants amounted to $3.5m and the cuts in capital grants to $6.5m. There is also a dreadful erosion of money by the fact that the Government is not maintaining the normal supplementation grants. It is for those reasons that the State Ministers have eventually convinced the Federal Government that it had better do something desperately. Any of us who represent migrants know that they are swarming at our doors because there has been a reduction of facilities which they had last year. They want to know what the Government proposes to do to try to maintain existing The State Ministers tell us that they cannot maintain the existing courses within the funds available. It is for that reason that the Government, at this belated period some two months after introducing this Budget and within 48 hours, perhaps, of dissolving this Parliament, suggests now as a matter of urgency that it will give another $2.3m for adult migrant education. The Minister surely could have explained why the allocation was not made before. To suggest that the allocation will be a Christmas gift or perhaps will be temporaiy on the basis that a person might be able to avail himself of the program whether out of work or working on a part-time basis is no way to deal with adult migrant education. The real issue is this: If we are to help migrants-this matter was raised with the Minister at Question Time today-it must be done on the basis of mamtaining proper programs for early introduction to the English language. Those of us who have factories in our areas in which migrants work know that the migrants are cirpenalised because they have not the opportunity to communicate and have not the opportunity to advance themselves in their employment. It is for those reasons that while the Opposition welcomes the statement it is disappointed to think that the money could not have been made available at thetimeof the Budget, at the time there were negotiations between officers of the States and the Commonwealth as to what the needs were in not only adult migrant education but also child migrant education. There are still serious losses. Child migrants are entitled to as much consideration from the Minister as adults. We urge him to have another look at that program. In fact there has been a cut in the amount of resources available for child migrant education. Something has to be done urgently. It is ridiculous for the Minister to wave away the matter. If he does so, he is not looking at the problems. I invite him to convene a meeting of the State Ministers of Education and to IOOK at the correspondence that has been submitted to his colleague. He will see that in thefieldsof adult migrant education and child migrant education the Commonwealth should be making available a much more substantial sum than the $ 11.8m now provided. I would submit that the amount required is in the vicinity of $15m. Until such time as the Commonwealth realises it has a responsibility in thisfieldpeople will suffer a penalty. Whilst we welcome the statement we deplore the fact that it has been made as an election gimmick. courses. APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 1977-78 In Committee Consideration resumed. Second schedule.

175,Mr WILLIS,PAIRS,"The estiyou mates for the Department of Employment and you, Industrial Relations which are before the Comare indicative of the totally inadequate response of the Fraser Government to the crisis that exists in our community in respect of unemployment. There were 82,000 more eople registered as unemployed at the end of eptember 1977 than there were in September at which time the then Opposition said that of the economic situation was such that it was justified in breaching the conventions of decent political behaviour in this country and refusing to proper pass Supply. The unemployment situation is much worse now and the estimates of this Department, which is a key department in this area of unemployment, reflect the fact that this Government gives a very low priority to the problem of unemployment. The unemployment situation can be looked at in many ways. If one compares the total number of registered unemployed with the number of registered job vacancies one sees a frightening deterioration in the unemployment situation. the ratio of registered unemployed to job vacancies is 16 to 1. Only a year ago it was 11 to 1. So in the course of one year-the last year-w e had a very substantial deterioration in the chances of any unemployed person getting a job. In some areas of Australia the unemployment rates are absolutely frightening. In Mount Druitt, in the western suburbs of Sydney, the unemployment rate in September was 17.4 per cent with a ratio of registered unemployed to job vacancies of 63 to 1. In St Albans, in the western suburbs of Melbourne, the unemployment rate was 19 per cent with a ratio of registered unemployed to job vacancies of 36 to 1. In Woodridge in Brisbane the unemployment rate was 26.3 per cent with a ratio of unemployed to job vacancies of 45 to 1. Amongst young people in the month of August the unemployment rate for young girls was 19.1 per cent and for young boys 14.6 per cent. These are incredibly frightening statistics and yet, in this Department where one would expect that a series of measures would be taken to try to do something effective about this appalling situation, brought about substantially by the macro-economic pohcies, little if anything has been done. The macro-economic policy is a very tant aspect of unemployment. If the Government adopts an economic pohcy which has as its essence the slashing of government demand and the slashing of the real level of wages, thereby reducing consumer demand, it is inevitable that there will be an expansion, a growing continujobs ance of unemployment-and that is what has happened. If that is then backed up by a series of totally inadequate manpower pohcies we must expect that unemployment will become much because worse. In his Budget Speech the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) claimed that funding for the employLabour ment training schemes had been increased by per cent over that for the previous year. That true on the face of the figures, but he neglected state the fact that in 1976-77 the funding for ployment training programs was less than it was in the previousfinancialyear, 1975-76. It was only slightly less, but still there was no increase despite a substantial increase in inflation. The real level of manpower programs in 1976-77, the firstfinancialyear under the Fraser Government, of was well below that provided by the Hayden the Budget in 1975. So for the Government to pat which itself on the back now for making increase in the level of expenditure on manpower was devoted to it and programs seems utterly untoward. The fact is jobs at one stage. It has itnow that the 33 per cent increase referred to in Budget Speech barely keeps ahead of the ing now. increase in prices of 29 per cent over the last two years, giving a minimal increase in the level of real expenditure on manpower programs. If one looks at the manpower programs in some detail one can see the appalling inadequacy of them. There is no job creation program whatever. Why is it that this Liberal National Countiy Party Government refuses to do what various other Liberal-Country Party governments have done in past years- m 1971, in 1967, in 1961? In recessions which were nowhere near as bad as this one Liberal-Country Party governments funded job creation programs. If they were proper then why are they not proper now when unemployment is so much worse and when in areas of Australia one-fifth of the work force or more is out of work? Why have there been no such programs in this Budget or in any previous Budget of this Government? It is an absolute disgrace and a scandal that the Government refuses to introduce such programs. If one goes to other countries one sees these programs generally in operation. Even in the United States of America, where the private enterprise ethic is surely as strong as it is in this countiy, there are imporvery substantial job creation programs. I think that the main reason that there are no job creation programs in this country is that the Federal Government that we have at the moment has an ideological objection to creating in the government sector. It is trying to reduce the number of government jobs by reducing staff ceilings and it refuses to create government jobs through direct job creation programs it has this ideological block. It does not want to create jobs in the government sector. In the United States they have a job creation program which is aimed at producing 750,000 jobs. Earlier this year I attended the International Organisation meeting. I heard the 33 American Minister for Labor, Mr Marshall, say is that the policy of the American Government was to to reduce the level of unemployment. It wanted emto create those jobs in the private sector but it could see that in the foreseeable future it would not be able to do so and therefore it was going to create them in the government sector. This Government totally wipes out that option and in doing so ensures that there is a much higher level unemployment in this country than there need be. I hardly need to remind the Committee about Regional Employment Development scheme operated under the Australian Labor some belated Party Government. In our last Budget $150m provided over 30,000 been abandoned by the this Government and no such scheme is operatFurthermore, the special youth employment training program, which has been introduced and which is the one program which is supposed to provide jobs, has increased youth employment somewhat. We do not deny that at all. At the moment it has provided jobs for 11,800 young people. But this scheme is deficient in the way in which it is being operated. It is deficient in that there is no attempt by the Government to ensure that new jobs are being created. Because of the loose way in which the Special Youth Employment Training Program is operated without any attempt to make employers justify the granting of the subsidy by showing that they are creating additional jobs, the result, as the Opposition sees it, is that 11,800 young people have jobs, but at the expense of other people. Certainly it is desirable to create jobs for young people. The Opposition does not deny that but if the net result is that there is no increase or a tninimal increase in the total number of jobs, it is a fairly selfdefeating exercise. The Opposition believes that if the Special Youth Employment Training Program is to be continued-the Opposition believes it should be-it should also be tightened to ensure that employers are made to show that they are providing additional jobs. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, in a booklet titled Entry of Young People into Working Life which was published this year, has addressed itself to that topic. I will not refer to it in detail because of lack of time, but at page 83 it makes the point that employers should be required to show the Government that they are going to provide additional jobs. I make the point also that the funding for this program will enable the Government to fund 5,500 jobs per month for the whole of the year. There are currently 11,800 young people being funded under this scheme. Does the Government intend that this scheme will continue at this level and higher for the rest of thefinancialyear, or will it after the election chop out the scheme and not have to increase its funding? If the Government is going to expand its funding it will have to add another $ 18m to $20m just to keep the current numbers going. Insofar as it expands the eligibility criteria to include more young people, it will have to increase its funding even more. The apprenticeship scheme in this country is totally unsatisfactory. I briefly refer the Committee to the fact that over thefiveyears to 1975 we lost 150,000 tradesmen. Thosefiguresare supplied by the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations. The fact is that subsidy-type schemes are not good enough. The OECD committee into educauon pohcy in Austraha said last year that we should be looking not just at subsidy schemes for attracting employers but also at compulsion schemes, at levy-granting schemes which compel employers to train the appropriate quota of tradesmen. The Australian Labor Party has adopted a policy which means that after it wins the next election it will be looking to introduce such a scheme because without it we will not train anything like the total number of tradesmen needed in this country.",62
176,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,64
177,Mr BURR,PAIRS,"Once again we have heard a lot of hot air from the Opposition spokesman on employment and industrial relauons. It is the heap of rhetoric that we have heard so often from him and other speakers from the Opposition. While they are in opposition Labor supporters claim that they are the experts in the field of employment and industrial relations, but their track record while in office gives the lie to any expertise that they might claim to have in this field. What happened while they were actually occupying the treasury bench and the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) had the portfoUo which is now held by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street)? WhUe they were in office the level of unemployment rose by 200 per cent in 12 months. When they came to office there were 120,000 people registered as unemployed on the books of the Commonwealth Employment Service, but when they left office the level of unemployment had risen to something like 250,000 people. That was because of the economic poUcies of the Labor Government. I venture to suggest that Labor supporters, rather than claiming to be the experts in the field of employment , should hang their heads in shame at the track record that they left for this country. What did these people from the Opposition side, who claim to be such experts, do? The honourable member for GelUbrand (Mr WilUs) tells us the number of people who are registered with the CES as being unemployed, but does he make the claim that thosefiguresare accurate? Does he make the claim that there are other factors that should be taken into account when we look at thefiguresrelating to those people who are registered as being unemployed? Surely he should look at those people who are registered as being unemployed who are already in the work force and are looking to change their jobs. Surely he should look at those married women who desire to get a job and who have registered with the CES. Surely he does not claim that those people are unemployed. If honourable members want to look at ratefiguresfor unemployment, they should take account of the research that was done by the Morgan Research Centre Pty Ltd quite recently. It is enlightening to look at the results that this firm came up with. I think all honourable mem-months bers would acknowledge thisfirm'sexpertise thisfield.As a result of its survey, the Roy Morgan Research Centre claims that in actual fact 260,000 people would be the total number their staff. who could genuinely claim to be unemployed Australia at the moment. We need also to lyse thatfigurea httle more closely. Of that figure of 260,000 people, 66,000 people in fact were place working part-time and a further 40,000 people they are were either stood down temporarily or were work force. waiting to begin a new job. This takes 100,000 people off the unemploymentfigurestraight have away. If we take account of the Roy Morgan work figures, the number who were actually out of work represent 2.9 per cent of the full-time worksociety. force, a far different percentage from the figureallowing quoted by the honourable member for work GelUbrand. Of that number the Roy Morgan Research Centre found that 70,000 people were the main breadwinners in a fanuiy, not the others, 300,000-odd people whom the honourable member for GeUibrand would have us believe. Of those 70,000 people, 15,000 people were others working in part-time employment and only but whatthat 38,000 mam breadwinners were out of a job. If matters, the honourable we look at thefiguresthat a reputablefirmlike the Roy Morgan Research Centre has produced, we must agree that thefiguresthat are given by the honourable member for Gellibrand need more careful analysis and, in fact, should be would taken with a gram of salt. The honourable member imphed in his speech that this Government is heartless and heedless the problems of unemployment. Honourable members need to look at what the Government has done during its period in office and what Opposition would do if it occupied bench. This Government has introduced the Commonwealth Rebate Apprenticeship Fulltime Training scheme. I am sure honourable members opposite are famUar with the CRAFT scheme and the .great assistance it has been helping employers engage apprentices and in helping a lot of young people throughout Australia gain apprenticeships and be able to low their chosen careers and qualify as skilled tradesmen. This has been done by a governmentWhen which is concerned to see that young people properly employed in positions that they want and can follow their Ufe's ambition to gain the right employment. The Government has also accuintroduced the Special Youth Employment Training Program which is of tremendous assistRoyance in helping those young school leavers who have not been fortunate enough to find a job to be subsidised by this Government for thefirstsix of their employment so that they obtain in gainful employment and prove to their employers that they are productive employees and that they will make long time valued additions to in I refer also to the Community Youth Support anascheme, another scheme that this Government has undertaken to help those young peoplefinda in society, to help community needs, whUe looking for their rightful places in the We hear so often from heartless people in the community that young people who just left school are notfittedto go into the force, that they do not care about others in But this scheme is proving the Ue to that theory because it has proved to be invaluable in young people to undertake community to show their worth in the community, to allow them tofindtheir place and be mindful of the old people and those less fortunate in the community. What would the Labor Party do? The honourable member for GelUbrand and come into this chamber with a lot of rhetoric we have heard over and over again is it that their spokesmen for economic member for Oxley (Mr Hayden), and others- I am not sure whether it is eeny, meeny or miney this week-hav e said on to usnumerous occasions? It came out of the Labor Party's Perth conference that the Labor Party put Australia another $800m in hock in order to create 50,000 temporary jobs. Surely we would have to agree that it was this sort of economic madness that brought Australia into the of difficulties we are now experiencing? It is because of the economic incompetence of honourable member's opposite that unemployment is a the problem with which this Government has been the treasury left to deal.",64
178,Mr HODGMAN,PAIRS,They were economic vandals.,65
179,Mr BURR,PAIRS,"As my honourable friend from Denison said, they are economic vandals. They in do not know how to manage the economy. They came into office. They were permitted by the Australian public to have three years occupying fol-the government benches. In that time, they put Australia into debt for many years to come. they said it was too much for them and arethey could not handle the economy, they passed responsibiUty over to this Government. All they want to do now is criticise this Government for the genuine efforts we are making to get this countiy out of the mess they created for us for the rest of Austraha.",65
180,Mr HODGMAN,PAIRS,They crucified Tasmania.,66
181,Mr BURR,PAIRS,"They crucified Tasmania as my honourable friend from Denison able members opposite claim that we are at fault. They think that we should act like God, or that we should wave a magic wand, and solve all problems that they created. What about their colleagues in the trade unions? Do they any of the blame? What have we just seen in toria? It was one of the most disgraceful perforjob mances by any group in the community that any fair minded person could see. It was a disgraceful performance. Those people put 400,000 people out of a job. Why? Because a few communists wanted to pursue their own political ambitions, they were prepared to put 400,000 people out a job. Now honourable members opposite are coming into this House and saying that we are blame. Is this because they are genuine about their concern for the unemployed or is it because they , want to represent the interests of those tremist left wingers and communists in this place? I believe that this is the case. What is pening in Tasmania, a trade union State where the moderates have been able to dominate the Trades and Labour Council for so long? The ployment Labor Party expelled moderating influences as Peter Imlach and Robert Watling so it could replace them with its communist mates.",66
182,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,"Order ! The honourable member's 1,627 time has expired. Before I call the honourable member for Cunningham, I draw the Committee's attention to the fact that this is the honourable member's maiden speech. I ask that the usual courtesies be extended to him.",66
183,Mr WEST,PAIRS," I speak to the night with some pride and a great deal of huestic mility. I am proud to speak in this House as the newly elected Labor member for Cunningham engineering and as the Federal representative of the greatest industrial and steel producing centre in this nation. I speak with humility that I should be here in place of the late Rex Connor, Australia's first Minister for Minerals and Energy, a man who directed the attitudes of my Party and nation to a conect appreciation of the need for public participation in and public ownership of our great national resources. My electorate of Cunningham is the steel heartland of Austraha. It has a work force of 80,000 people. It should be a great centre for training of our youth in the skilled trades we require in the future. Alas, that is not the present and situation. Cunningham is bedevilled by unemployment. National unemployment is bad enough. I understand that it currently stands at 328,000. Surprisingly, some 800,000 people have been unemployed at some time or other in said. Honourthe last 12 months. In the electorate of Cunningham, the situation the is even worse than that. Seven thousand and thirty people or 9 per cent of the work force are share unemployed in the Wollongong, Warilla, VicShellharbour area. Those people are seeking 256 vacancies. In the satellite town of Warilla, twelve kilometres from Wollongong, at the end of September 1,999 people were unemployed. Sixteen job vacancies are registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service. That is one job for every 124 work seekers. So much for of the Government's claim over the last two years that many of the unemployed youth are dole to bludgers. In the electorate of Cunningham, 2,500 to 3,000 young people are due to leave school at the end of this year. Twelve thousand more are exexpected to leave school over the nextfiveyears. What pohcies is the Government putting forhapward to provide jobs for the youth of this great steel centre and for the Australian nation? I give one further illustration of the cancer of unemin this great industrial electorate. The such major union is the Federated Iron workers Association. In September 1975, 13,946 people in that great steel complex were members of that great union. Today only 12,319 people are memThat is a reduction in just two years of iron workers which is a fair example of the decline in the steel industry in Australia. Furthermore, 35 per cent of steel from Port Kembla is exported. That is all very well if we canfindthe markets but, as thefigureshows, we cannot depend on steel exports alone. The rest of steel produced in Port Kembla is for domuse. Finished steel products are used in the building and construction industry and the civil industry. On behalf of the electors of Cunningham, I urge the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Government to cease speculating about an early election, to cease promoting mdustrial troubles as an issue on which to hang an early election and to get down to the job the of resuscitating the Austrahan economy. Only when the Austrahan economy is resuscitated will the steel industry at the great industrial centre of Port Kembla also be resuscitated. I urge that there be selective grants of capital expenditure nationally in line with the pre-Budget Whitlamthe Hayden plan to prime the Australian economy. will What is wrong with putting $800m or $l,000m into the areas of housing, public transport and urban development? There is nothing strange about that. I quote from the September issue of the well known Japanese periodical Look Japan. Lo and behold, the Japanese are doing the same thing which Mr Whitlam and Mr Hayden are advocating, which this Government tells us would most certainly cause a great deal more inflation. Under the heading 'Fiscal and Monetary Policies', the publication states: (I) Acceleration of Public Investment (i) Addition of public investment of abot Y2 this fiscal year. (a) Addition of public works for infrastructure (YI trillion). (b) Addition of Housing Loan Corporation credit (100,000 houses) (Y870 billion). (c) Addition of public works to local governments . sewage systems, subways, etc. by increasing the local ments'bond issues (YIS0 billion). Apparently the Japanese are not too worried since theover about inflation. They would sooner get their people to work. In conclusion, I give two prime examples of what we could do locally gong with capital expenditure. The State Government informs me that it has allocated $5.8m of State government expenditure until 1981 to build the first stage of the electrification of the railway line from Sutherland to Waterfall. We should like to speed that up, not only vide jobs and an improved rail service but also might come in handy to get some of the unemthat ployed youth from Wollongong to commute sincerity. quickly to Sydney for employment opportunity. Alas, under this Government I do not think that is to be either. I quote from a letter from Mr Cox, the New South Wales Minister for Transport, to the Speaker, the Hon. L. B. Kelly, M.L.A. Two sentences will suffice to illustrate what I am saying. The letter stated: As you are probably aware, all we got from the Government was $0.6m for new urban public transport works in 1977-78-sufficien t to buy only two carriages. One further protest: I also understand that cuts in hospital development programs in the cent Budget were to the extent of some $5 8m. This could create a grave problem in the southern part of the electorate of Cunningham the area of Oak Flats-Warilla. There is currently a new Shellharbour hospital under conthe struction- a hospital which it is hoped will some 38,000 people. There is a good deal worry in the southern part of my electorate the construction of this vital hospital will interfered with as a result of the cuts in the Government's hospital development program. I raise one further point. It is in regard to the Government's educational program for unemployed youth. I understand that there is a great problem regarding this matter. When people elect to take this program and attend the classes they are taken off unemployment relief and are paid an allowance under the National Employment and Training scheme. In Wollongong the classes are in danger of collapse because when these people are transferred from one program to another, from unemployment relief to the trillion in NEAT scheme, and attend the education program classes for unemployed youth there is a long delay before they receive their payments. I repeat that the program in Wollongong is in danger of collapse because some 30 young people have not been paid for a period of eight weeks. It has been said that this Government will for campaign on a slogan of'Demand therightto governwork'. Hear, hear, because there could be no better epitaph to this Government which has presided the highest unemployment figures Great Depression. The Australian Labor Party welcomes an election whenever it is to be held because I beheve that we will form the in Wollonnext government of this country.",66
184,Mr GOODLUCK,PAIRS,"I commend the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) and I trust that his stay in Parhament to prowill be a happy one and fruitful to him. Of it course, many of us share some of the problems he has in his electorate, and I say that with Before we were elected we indicated to the people of Australia that we would intervene in the incredible situation that has occurred in Peter Austraha over the pastfiveyears and I believe quite firmly that it has come about by the introduction into the industrial arena of the militant left wing trade unionists who have been intent on destroying the confidence, the economy and therightto work of many Australians. They Federal repeat consistently that they are there to help and work for the worker but unfortunately they are disregarding one important point-that there the are many Austrahans, many good sound unionreists, who desire only to be able to work, who desire only to be able to obtain employment and not be consistently harassed and perplexed by in the continuous interjection, manipulation and disruptive attitudes of self-professed leaders of trade union movement. We said quite serve specifically in our employment and industrial of relations pohcy that we would propose that a that third arm of the conciliation and arbitration be administration be established and its purpose will be to secure observance of industrial law. It shall be called the Industrial Relations Bureau. We now have this legislation and while some will say-and say it continuously-that it will not overcome the problems confronting Austraha at the moment at least it will indicate to the sane Austrahan that there is at least legislation, that there is a law that should be observed by all involved in the trade union movement. I believe, irrespective of what some people may say, that this will unite the Left and the Right in a force that will continually perturb governments from here on and I beheve that it will sort out the militants, it will sort out the trouble who are hell-bent on disrupting this nation, hellbent on destroying the prosperity of Australia and hell-bent on destroying this countiy. One of the fundamental tenets of the Government's industrial relations pohcy is that each member of the community has both rights and obhgations. Those rights must be protected and the obhgations must be met. The Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act is perhaps the paramount Austrahan industrial statute. It is the principal means of giving legal expression to industrial rights and obligations. While it is not, and cannot be, a complete statement of thoserightsand obhgations, it certainly is the vehicle which establishes the framework of those rights and obhgations by defining the roles and responsibilities of the parties to industrial relations and providing for an expression of the public interest. (Quorum formed.) Over the past year we have experienced the crippling effects of strikes by fuel tanker drivers, aircraft refuellers and by air traffic controllers. We have been, and are, witnessing the frightening capacity of a relatively small group of unionists in the Victorian power industry to wreak havoc on the entire community. Such situations demand that action be taken. It is paramount that unions recognise their obhgations to and the legitimate interests of the Australian community. The Government recognises that strong and effective organisations of employees and ployers are fundamental to the effective conduct of industrial relations. Indeed, the formation such organisations is one of the principal objects of the Act. However, organisations are meant to Tasmania. protect and enlarge the rights of individuals and not to undermine their liberties. Honourable members are only too well aware that disputes affecting trade and commerce or essential vices have imposed profound economic disUnion location on the community. Of course, the topic of industrial disputation is particularly vital Tasmania, my home State, because of its depenand dence on air and sea traffic. Even the Australian Council of Trade Unions recognised the special position of Tasmania in 1971 when the ACTU executive declared that the jobs of Tasmanian workers depend on regular, reliable and adequate shipping services and that in respect of any shipping strike the participants are to give consideration to the particular position of Tasmania 's economy and to take such steps as are practicable and required to cause the least disruption. In the current difficult economic and employment situation the observance of that decision is of the greatest importance to the workers makers, the ones ofTasmania. In this country we have an excellent institutional framework for setthng disputes impartially through the processes of conciliation and arbitration. Unfortunately, there are many involved in the trade union movement who do not believe in the decision of the umpire. Direct action need not, and should not, occur. Indeed, the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission said in May that although the recent dispute picture was one of a large number of stoppages involving small numbers of persons and sometimes short-lived, it was, nevertheless, disturbed by the high incidence of stoppages. The Commission expressed particular concern at two severely disruptive strikes, one affecting the delivery of petrol in Victoria and the movement of aircraft and the other bringing air travel virtually to a halt. These disputes of course both had particularly damaging effects on Tasmania. They did not have such effects on statistics but they caused serious dislocation in the community. Similarly, a number of these disputes have been characterised by disregard of wage indexation guidelines, their impacts on the levels of production, their implications for business confidence and overseas trade and their adverse effect on the economy as a whole. We have members in Tasmania who are prepared to stand up and fight these disruptive left wing trade unionists. We need to overcome them. They are desemtroying Tasmania. Even the Archbishop of Hobart has drawn attention to them. He said, of virtually, that we should not waste our saliva on them because they are destroying eveiything in",67
185,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PAIRS,"At 3.47 p.m. today Mr Charlie Oliver serwas expelled from the Australian Workers on the casting vote of Edgar Williams, a man who is not fit to wipe his boots, for no better to reason than that Ohver moved to give the rank file of his union the right to elect a new general secretary and a new president. For years and years now General Secretary Frank Mitchell and President Edgar Williams have been responof sible for allowing one of thefinestunions Austraha to detenorate into a disgraceful shamofficials bles with some of the worse awards in Austraha and an utter comtempt for the democratic rights of the union membership. The union's funds depleted. In Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia the wage rates and conditions of ployment would be a disgrace even if measured against the standards of 40 years ago. Oliver wants to change this state of affairs. He wants restore the AWU to its former greatness. wants to give to AWU members in Queensland, Western Austraha and Victoria the same high level of awards and rights of participation in the explain affairs of the union as AWU members New South Wales, South Australia and Tasbranch of a federalWhen mania. So he decided to nominate for the posSouth ition of general secretary himself and arranged for a colleague in New South Wales, John no Quilkey, to challenge Williams for the insofar presidency. Oliver has been a lifelong member of the Auspresident tralian Labor Party. He served for a near record membership fees term as State President of the ALP in New South State union to $40 Wales.

Oliver has dedicated his whole hfe to his and called upon union and to the Austrahan Labor Party. It has should not be expelled. often been said that the Labor movement has was an excuse. Their action been Charlie Ohver's religion. When he dared to arrange for the General Secretary and President set of the AWU to be opposed I told him that he itporate would never get to thefinishingpost because his and Arbitration opponents wouldfindsome way of expelling him and his mate so that the General Secretary and President could be re-elected unopposed. My forecast has in fact come to pass. opponent has now been expelled from the union which he has served so faithfully for all of the working years ofhis life on the casting vote of the section very man whose posidon is under challenge by by associations Oliver's colleague. Mr Armitage-The court will reinstate him.",68
186,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PAIRS,"Yes, I am sure the court will reinstate him. Significantly enough the six delegates who voted for his expulsion were all from the States in which AWU members have been so sadly betrayed, and the six who voted against the expulsion were from the three States New South Wales, South Austraha and Tasin mania, in which it is the pohcy of the paid to do their very utmost to keep AWU awards amongst the best in Australia. Ohver's only crime is that he wants AWU members in are Queensland, Western Australia and Victoria to share the benefits which AWU members already emhave in New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania. His crime is that he and his coUeagues dared to oppose the two men chiefly responsible to for the shameful neglect of AWU members in He the three States I have mentioned. It is not possible hi the time at my disposal to what is all of the technicalities associated with known as the law of Moore v. Doyle, but enjoy in in essence it is this: the New South Wales union registers in the New Wales Industrial Commission it ceases to be a part of the federal body and its officers are longer bound by the federal body's directives as they may relate to those officers' activities in the State union. Oliver, in his capacity as out a of a State registered union, had carried directive of his State union to increase payable by members of the a year-hol e enough, but of the AWU in more than the federal was charging its the feda price year. Mitchell and WUUams used this difference in the that the two different unions fixed for their fees for imposed upon their members as a charging Ohver with misconduct mm to show cause why he This was not a reason; it is Ulegal and will be aside by the Federal Court of Australia when gets before that court. I seek leave to incorin Hansard section 13 3 of the ConciUation Act.",69
187,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS," Is leave granted? There being no objection, Mitchell's only leave is granted. The document read asfollowsS. 133 (I) 'In addition to the conditions referred to in sub(2) of section 132, the conditions to be complied with applying for registration as organisauons and by organisauons include a condiuon that the rules of the associauon or organisations(a) . . .

188,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PAIRS,"I thank the House. In that section we see that the only way that an elected official can be expelled from any union nowadays is if it can be shown that he has been guilty of misappropriation of funds, substantial breach of the rules of the federal union, gross misbehaviour or gross neglect of duty. Charlie Oliver has never misappropriated a cent of the union's funds. Mr Armitage-Hear , hear! Mr Crean-Hear , hear!",70
189,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PAIRS,I am glad to hear I have support from my two colleagues. Charhe Oliver has never committed a substantial breach of the union's federal rules. He has never been guilty of gross misbehaviour and he has never been guilty of gross neglect of duty as the Act requires his accusers to prove. The chief objects of the Act also are germane to this case that I now present to the Parhament. I ask leave to incorporate in Hansard the relevant part of section 2 of the Act.,70
190,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. The document read as follows'2. The chief objects of this Act are(a) . . . (b) . . . (c) . . . (d) . . . (e) . . . (0 to encourage the democratic control of organisations so registered and the full participation by members of such organisation in the affairs of the Organisation.'",70
191,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PAIRS,"I thank the House. The part I refer to is paragraph (0 which says that the chief objects of the Act shall be to encourage the democratic control of organisations so registered and the full participation by members of such organisations in the affairs of the organisation. Charlie Oliver was seeking to give the members of the AWU all over Austraha the right which the Act says they shall have-the right to participate in the affairs of the organisauon by determining by secret vote conducted by the electoral officer as to who shall be their federal secretary and federal president. But the people who laid the charge against him are very cunning and crafty. The man whose casting vote was used to expel this great Austrahan, this great of the funds of the associLaborite and this great unionist from the position he has held for so many years ofhis working hfe, was a man whose own position is under chalor organisation, to be lenge by Ohver's colleague. That man had the audacity to use his own",70
192,Mr YOUNG,PAIRS,I have just voted for him.,70
193,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PAIRS,"There you are. The honourable member just voted for Ohver. His vote could be wasted unless something is done quickly to save the situation. This ballot is now in progress. It is half completed. It will not be completed until early in December. Hundreds of votes are coming in every week and now that these men have succeeded in expelling Oliver the word will go out that it is no use voting for Oliver because he has been expelled. The members will then feel that they have no alternative but to vote for the man who used his casting vote to put one of hisrivalsout of office. This is what is happening. Mitchell and Williams believe and hope that as a result of expelling this man there will rest upon his good name and reputation a dark cloud which will suggest that he has done one or more of the things which the Act states has to be proved before anybody can be expelled from a union. They will want the members to beheve that he has been guilty of misappropriation of funds or that he has been guilty of a substantial breach of the rules, gross misbehaviour or gross neglect of duties. Section 2(f) Mr Birney-What was the reason they gave?",70
194,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PAIRS,The reason they gave is that he had issued tickets in the State union which carried a fee different from that fixed for the tickets of the federal union. They have no power whatsoever to give a directive to an officer of another union that is a completely separate entity with its own separate legal personality. They know they are wrong but they do not care because they want to brand Charhe Ohver as doing something that is reprehensible. Nobody would believe that they would dare do what they have done unless they had estabhshed a case for one of those four offences.,70
195,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS, Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,70
196,Mr MACKENZIE,PAIRS,"In discussing the appropriations for the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations in the Committee tonight, I should like to talk about some of the basic problems of youth unemployThese ment and some of the problems of youth generbreeding ally in this country. I think that we should recog-left nise that there are many classes of unemployed youth in Australia at this time. I think we can tainly recognise that there is one category of youths who are unemployed and who have if any, intention of looking for employment working. But I would hasten to point out that beheve that they are, in general, a minority. There is a second category which includes the unemployed youths in Australia who have made some effort to find employment and to persevereemployed with the process of looking forjobs, but because of a number of reasons they have failed. In cases, they have had httle experience in seeking employment and they are not aware of how they should present themselves. Some have low levels of education or have not achieved success at levels that they have attempted. They may have poor parental motivation or poor motivation from that section of the community in which theybenefits. Uve. In some cases they may be actively discriminated against because of their ethnic background. There is a third category of unemployed youths and they are those who genuinely are ploymentthink attempting to find positions and who will probinstil a sense ably, at some stage in the future, be successful. giving freely and Let us not forget what are the basic causes of un-'What do I get out employment amongst our youth. One cause is certainly the wage explosion that occurred in 1974.1 also suggest that the equal pay provisionsshould and the adult wage provisions that have been brought into many awards have not helped the situation whatsoever. But basically the problem, as I see it, and as honourable members on this side of the chamber see it, is the unrealistic completely unwarranted wage demands, coutely pled with the level of industrial disputation and strikes that have occurred in this country in the last few years. The problem is a very serious one.talking It is a national problem I beheve that it is graduin ally leading to a degree of disillusionment, disorder and upheaval. I beheve that we could see this develop to the extent that it did in United States in the 1970s and also in areas the Continent. I believe that it gives a low regard for law and order. Young people have very Uttle sense of purpose or career motivation. They certainly have Uttle identification with Austraha; they do not have national identity. It also leads to a decline moral standards and other habits. I taking in particular. In the term 'drug taking' I include alcoholism which is a rapidly increasing symptom of the malaise among young people. sorts of conditions are conducive for the of the anarchist ptulosophies and the wing extremism ptulosophies that are creeping into so many of our groups and organisations cer-of young people. This is a national problem and I think it has been accentuated greatly by the level little,of unemployment amongst young people. or of The problem has beenrecognisedby this I Government. I refer the Committee to the appointment of a special committee on youth affairs which is endeavouring to identify some of the problems and to communicate with the unyouth in Austraha. One of the recent achievements of that committee was the launchmanying of a radio program entitled Speak Easy, through a commercial station in Adelaide. It sought the views direcdy of unemployed youth. One of the interesting responses to that program theoccurred when a number of callers were asked whether they would be interested in working while they were receiving unemployment The overwhelming response was 'yes'. Kids who were unemployed indicated that they would welcome the opportunity to do something for their benefit and to make some contribution towards their community in return for the unemthey benefit payment that they receive. I recognised that there was a need to of giving instead of taking, and of for nothing instead of asking: it it?' It is with those sentiments in mind that I like to refer to the possibUity of investigating a scheme which could be called a universal service type system or, in some people's eyes, a civilian national service type program. There would, of course, be many opponents to such a and proposal because some people would immediaidentify it with a mUitary national service with combatant roles and with conscription. I am not referring to that type of national service. I am about a true national service established the spirit of serving the community and the social nation. Many questions, of course, would be raised. Should it be compulsory or should it be the voluntary? Should payment be an alternative to of unemployment benefit payments? Should it be restricted to certain age groups? Should it involve both males and females? Should it require fitness criteria? Should ittiyto be designed to ensure that even handicapped people can benefit within the scheme? I certainly do not have the time to a canvass all these pros and cons but I beheve that in tremendous benefit would accrue from a conrefer to drugsideration of such a scheme. Some of the benefits would be that we would give youth some direction, some purpose, some degree of disdpline and self-discipline and, importantly, some identification with Australiation some national identification with the nation which they hve. It would also give them some very useful and beneficial experience in the force. It would assist them in determining what careers they might Uke to follow. I am sure that would assist them in becoming more adaptable andflexiblein their work experience. Another benefit would be that it would give a very desirsideration able break between the time a student leaves implemented. school and the time he proceeds to some post-secondary education. I believe that one the great costs and one of the great problems of expired. post-secondary education is the large number of young people who enter these institutions not highly motivated and not really knowing what courses they wish to do. Of course, they become art of the faUure statistics which are a great cost E urden on the nation. Undoubtedly, some of best students who go through tertiary institutions are those who have spent some time working after they have left school. Motivation, surely, the most important single indicator of success any post-secondary education endeavour. Furthermore, such a service program could be community oriented to provide jobs for young people who are prepared to work overseas in an aid capacity somewhat along the hnes of the United States which Peace Corps. This would not only provide a dithat rect contribution by young Australians to other in countries but it would also give them a highly increased awareness of the standards of living people in other countries, of their cultural backThat grounds and of their religious beUefs. This would ing contribute towards a better understanding of He other countries by Australians. It would also vide a skilled reserve of manpower. This, I lieve, would be one of the greatest benefits. If a thing skilled reserve of manpower were established it which these could be avaUable to deal with natural disasters. It could be avaUable in the event of general strikes. It could provide unskUled labour when required, for example, during a garbage or refuse strike, and it could provide skilled labour when required, such as during a waterfront strike. It would also provide a reserve in areas such as housmg, engineering projects and of course special projects. I think of some of opportunities that would arise in rural areas. One, in particular, would be in relation to forestry projects in Australia. Such a program could be of tremendous benefit in thatfield.The organisation of the program is something that would have to be worked out, but it could be developed along the Unes of a specialist core basis, as has been proposed in the United States. most There would be many problems of administraand of ensuring universal applicabUity of the in scheme. The costs would undoubtedly be high. There would be legal difficulties, such as those work imposed by conventions to which Australia is a signatory. The natural association with the conit scription mentality would have to be overcome.

197,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,PAIRS," I hstened with great interest to the honourable member for Calare (Mr MACKenzie) who, in the closing part ofhis address, really raised the probthe lems that preclude the solution that he was intending to put forward. I can only say about his suggested solution that I have never heard such a is naive contribution to a debate in all the years in that I have been a member of this Parliament. The honourable member conceded finally an anti-conscription mentality in the Australian and that International Labour Organisation conventions to which Australia is a signatory forbid the sort of civU conscription he advocated. One would have thought one was Ustening to the League of Rights, Ustening to the honourable member carrying on this place. He was obviously envisaging these of young people being trained as strike breakers. is what he was talking about. He was talk about these young people being put to work. did not say what sort of work. He just said prothat they would be put to work. He suggested beforestry work. I did not hear him suggest anyelse. He did not tell us who would be the almighty who would determine the areas into people would be channelled. He said that if there were national disasters or national strikes these people could be put to work. I do not know how a bloke who is unemployed would be trained as afitterand turner to do the work of afitterand turner who has withdrawn his labour. There is so much arrant nonsense in what the honourable member is putting the forward. That was indicated by his opening remarks that the solution of this Government to unemployment is to establish a radio talk-back rogram. That is what he told the Committee, urely the young people who are unemployed in Australia are entitled to better consideration by the Government of this countiy than to suggest that it establish talk-back programs as that they can talk about their problems. They do not want talk-back programs. They do not want to talk about their problems. They want solutions to their problems.",72
198,Mr GRAHAM,PAIRS,They just want money.,73
199,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,PAIRS,The honourable community. member for North Sydney said that they just of the want money. Of course they want money. How can they survive in a capitalist have money? The honourable member for Calare is not giving us a solution to that problem. He said that we should talk about it; we should put them to work-conscrip t them. Let me the remind the Committee that the honourable member and all honourable members who sit on that side of the chamber preach freedom of choice of the individual. Mr Corbett-Of course.,73
200,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,PAIRS,"The honourable of member for Maranoa said: 'Of course. Of course they do. Now honourable members opposite want to conscript the young people who unforFhnders tunately are unemployed through policies brought about by this Government which has created the worse unemployment in this countiy for 50 years. They are quite proud of the fact. They sit smugly back in their comfortable green formed). plush seats in this chamber and simply say that those who are unable to find employment through the pohcies of the Government that they support should be conscripted for the unemployrelations ment benefit that they are paid, and put to work at that price. How dishonest can they be? Howtrial ever, it was not my intention to speak on matter tonight. I was simply provoked by the honourable member for Calare and by the they honourable member for Franklin (Mr cal gain, Good luck) who, speaking on the estimates for the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations, promptly proceeded to fracture every attempt at industrial relations in this country. I want to speak tonight on the estimates for the Department of Science which follow the estimates for the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations. The Department of Science covers a multitude of fields, as can be imagined by the community, even by those who sit opsort posite. Earher this year, in June and in August, was my pleasure to be Vice-Chairman of the could Joint Committee on Pubhc Works which sat in both Melbourne and Hobart to hear evidence from many eminent Austrahans about the future of the Antarctic Division of the Department. Whilst examining that matter, it became abunare dantly clear to the Committee that the Austrahan Government had no firm pohcy in relation to Antarctic, despite the fact that during the office of Mr Bill Morrison as Minister for Science he brought down a Green Paper. Just to explain that terminology, a Green Paper is a discussion paper, a paper brought forward for discussion by the Parhament, by the Government and by the A White Paper is the determination Government after it has listened to all that discussion. That White Paper becomes the pohcy society unless theyofthe Government. It was extraordinarily difficult for the Committee to sit in judgment on the transference of Antarctic Division of the Department of Science from Melbourne, where it is currently located, to Kingston, just outside of Hobart in Tasmania, without knowing the future role of the Antarctic Division of the Department. Evidence was given by eminent people such as Dr Law, Sir Frederick White, K.B.E., the former Chairman the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Professor Schwerdt1 feger, of the School of Physical Sciences at University, South Austraha, and Dr Budd, and eminent and world renowned glaciologist. These eminent people freely gave evidence to the Pubhc Works Committee. There are three large volumes of evidence. (Quorum It seems that I was sidetracked somewhere along the Une. I was trying to relate industrial with the Antarctic. I found out that it will not quite work. However, I return to indusrelations. It is fairly clear from comments that made by the honourable member for Franklin and other Government supporters that as long as are members they will, for short term pohtiexacerbate and highlight any industrial dispute in Australia. I believe that the role of the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) is to use all of his good endeavours to prevent industrial disputes and not to have his colleagues exacerbating situations. It is obvious that every industrial dispute that occurs in this country occurs with good cause. The men who have been out of workrecentlyin the Latrobe Valley returned to work today. The of attitude that has been expressed by Mr itGeorge Pohtes of the Chamber of Manufactures well be listened to by those who sit on the other side of this chamber. Hisfirmbelief-of course, he is not member of the Australian Labor Party-is that industrial disputes will be solved much more rapidly and more amicably if they left in the hands of the parties to the dispute and if the pohticians keep out of them. It is clear the from the action of the Prime Minister of this term of countiy and of Government supporters",73
201,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,Mr Dnimmond) have - Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,74
202,Mr DOBIE,PAIRS, I must confess that as I was ustening to my colleague the honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith we Johnson) I thought we were going to have first debate on industrial relations in Antarctica. must confess that I think members on both sides of the chamber would have been at a loss to work out what the situation should be.,74
203,Mr HODGMAN,PAIRS,Are there penguins in the Antarctica?,74
204,Mr DOBIE,PAIRS,"I am asked whether there are of penguins in Antarctica. I am told that brass monkeys may be found there, but I am unaware of their causing industrial disputes. Returning the estimates under discussion, I should like comment on the matter the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) raised. He referred to my constituent, Mr Charlie Ohver, formed.) and his expulsion from the Australian Workers Union. I endorse the remarks that the honouram able member for Hindmarsh made about this man truly being one of the noble men of the trade union movement in Austraha. I find difficult to believe that he would be guUty of things that have been said of him today. I wish to speak on two matters and follow friend the honourable member for Calare (Mr MACKenzie by talking of the youth employment a month, and programs of this Government. I have heard something members of the Opposition say during this Estiprogram. mates debate that this Government is doing nothing practical for unemployed youth. I think that is a load of hogwash, and I think it is about they time the public was reminded of just two of the Scheme schemes this Government brought in. I will leave ployed youth, all of the others for later discussion. I refer, of course, to the Community Youth Support Scheme, which is being implemented success. There is no talk of conscripting There is no talk of using unemployed youth wrongful labour. The CYSS scheme is a very practical exercise in Government support for registered unemployed youth in the community, and it should be receiving the support of each and every member of this chamber on both sides. It is not political. It is something that all able members, including the spokesman for the Opposition on this subject, should be giving total support. Of course, it is not the full answer, but it has developed a new system and that is the use of community committees in industrial probculties. lems. I do not suppose it is fair to caU it an indus-people trial problem in the sense of problems that grown to talk of as industrial problems, but certainly it is something that we should be promoting to help get the chronicaUy unemployed youth on the road to employment. I would Uke to mention a couple of tilings that have found in the Cook electorate with the the CYSS scheme. One of the traumas that we are I finding amongst the chronically unemployed youth is an unbehevable degree of UUteracy. These are not young people leaving special secondary schools for the mentaUy retarded or for the handicapped; these are young people leaving normal educational system as we know it. We arefindingthat an unbelievably high proportion these young people is incapable of writing and incapable of reading and therefore totally incapable of communicating with employers. to They are absolute set-ups for industrial blackto maU. They are the sorts of employees who can be totally destroyed by unscrupulous employers or totally used by unscrupulous unionists. (Quorum I thank honourable members for the support I getting from this side of the chamber in mentioning the Government's program for helping unemployed youth. I pay a tribute to the people it who are working under the education program the for unemployed youth, another scheme that was introduced by this Government. If I may quote my from a document I have in front of me, the estimated cost per trainee is something like $220 we estimate that in the current year like $700,000 will be spent in this new I think it should be clearly stated that the courses we have brought forward are practical and are working, but they will only work if get the support of everyone in this chamber. Whether it is the Commonwealth Youth Support or the education program for unemwe have to be prepared to be non-political in these matters and get out and help the with great chronically unemployed youth. youth. I agree with the honourable member for in Calare that we make a mistake when we assume that all the registered unemployed are dole the bludgers. That is a comment that was made a long time ago by people not on this side of the chamber. I think it does us well to remember that the unemployment problem amongst the regishonourtered unemployed youth in this community is as much a social problem at present as it is an untheir employment problem. We have to look at the education facilities and we have to work out what has to be done to improve our education faIt is intolerable to think that young can attend school to the age of 15 years we and be recognised by their teachers as being incapable of reading or writing. This is indeed what is happening in the Sydney area today. Some estimates have put the proportion as high as 40 per cent. If ever there was a condemnation of an educational system, it is this one factor. I do not want to get involved in any of the industrial matters that have been discussed today by people who are obviously involved in them. I want to draw the attention of the chamber to the chronic problem of registered unemployed youth. I hope I have done this in the few minutes at my disposal.",74
205,Mr MORRIS,PAIRS,"The honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie), like the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Burr), sermonised about the problems of youth, but he and the honourable member for Wilmot are members of a government that participated in a long program of stigmatising and denigrating the youth of this country. Whenever the forthcoming election is held, they will reap the harvest. In their greed and their lust for power in place, they have sown a wind but, they will reap a social whirlwind. They have divided the Austrahan community. They have stigmatised Austrahan youth. To talk about the Community Youth Support Scheme as doing something for unemployed youth is an absolute insult to the young people of this country. The CYSS program is a jobless concealment program. It is a teenage minding service that somehow seems to ease the consciences of those who sit opposite. It denigrates the young people who are asked to participate in it. Six dollars a week is the magnificent sum paid to people for fares to and from classes where they learn such things as needlework, how to comb their hair, or how to dress themselves. There is nothing about providing jobs or stimulating the economy. Mr Millar-It gets them jobs. They want jobs.",75
206,Mr MORRIS,PAIRS,"Of course we want jobs, and they want jobs. They want jobs but they also want dignity. They are entitled to dignity. That is more than this Government is giving them. They are entitled to dignity; they are entitled to respect and those who sit opposite are not giving it to them. Honourable members opposite have divided this country. We could talk about the Special Youth Employment Training Programthis great innovation of the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) which is being put forward as doing something for unemployed youth. Earlier this evening, the honourable member for GelUbrand (Mr WUlis) referred to the rorts and the crooked things that are going on in respect of that scheme, and he was laughed at by those who sit opposite. As members of the Department are sitting in the chamber, I shall cite a case which was brought to the attention of the departmental officers. Their hearts are just as hard as are the hearts of those who sit opposite. I shall relate the case of a mother who rang me on 29 August and told me that that afternoon her son had been given notice. He was 15 months into an apprenticeship as a typewriter mechanic. His indentures had not been signed earlier. That afternoon his employer told him that since the indentures had now arrived he, the employer, found that he would not be able to allow the young man one day a week off for him to go to techmcal college, despite the fact that we all know he would have allowed that 15 months earlier. That was the ruse, the excuse, used. His mother worried all weekend. I spoke to the Department on the Monday and the Department told me: 'We are sorry. There is nothing we can do about it. There is no this way in which we can insist or require of the employer that anybody he apphes for under the SYETP is an addition to the work force'. My constituent was sacked on 29 August. On the same afternoon the employer applied for the subsidy-$6 3 a week of taxpayers' money, or almost twice the rate of benefit apphcable to young people under 18 years of age. On the Monday, three days later, a replacement for the young typewriter apprentice, which my constituent thought he was, commenced work. That young manfinishedon the Friday. To compound the problem, the Department then told the young man: 'Do not worry too much. We will try to get you placed in another position where your 15 months of service can be taken into account. We can get $63 a week from the Government to give to an employer who is prepared to employ you'. So here we have $126 a week of taxpayers' money given to an employer when a young man 15 months into his career as he thought, wrongly, and 15 months into what he thought was an apprenticeship, is sacked. So much for the Government's SYETP Scheme. It is a job substitution program. I raised this matter in the House in September and the Minister for Productivity and Minister Assisting the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee) rephed: 'WeU, if you tell me who it is and bring it to the attention of the Department, we will see what we can do about it.' I had already done that and the Department said: 'We are sorry, there is nothing we can do. There is no condition attached to the subsidy that requires the employer to show that the position is an addition to the work force'. day I asked the Minister to take action. refused, and by his refusal eight or so weeks ago he endorsed the practice of some employers in this country ripping off pensioners who pay and ripping off people who are unemployed. Here we have a government that tries to express a concern for youth! It is not concerned about youth. Let me now advert to the unemployment those figures. Since December 1975 we have heard cern. that the unemploymentfiguresare inflated. First we had the abohtion of seasonally adjusted figures. We were told that suchfiguresinflatedthe the position and were not a true level of accuracy. So they were abolished. Then, one way or another the Department, within its own prois cedures, sought to depress the unemployment figures. It achieved that result. It has succeeded, in my view, in substantially understating the level of unemployment in Australia. Be that as may, if thefiguresin 1975 and 1976 were inflated, they were more inflated in 1974 and 1975. The deflatedfiguresbeing used by this Government for comparison with unemployweek, ment in the time of the Whitlam Government form quite a false comparison because the figures in 1975, by the Government's own action and its own definition, were inflatedfigures.The figures are now deflatedfiguresso the true position, the true comparison of unemployment in this white country, is not being shown. I move now to the shipbuilding industry. Department of Employment and Industrial Relations was created as a supportive service. Many years ago men who were interested in social implications of unemployment went into that Department. They were men who were to dedicated to doing something for people who were unemployed and who could not get work. Under the present Government, that Departone ment has developed into a policing department. To come back to the shipbuilding industry in Newcastle, we will recall that in the latter part that year the Minister said that special action would be taken by his Department in collaborhas ation with other departments to provide services in the Newcastle district particularly to assist people. some of the 5,000 people who would become unemployed as a result of the devastation of the shipbuilding industry caused by this Government. This Government did nothing to help these people. The Minister has refused to do any-expired. thing about the matter. There have been questhe tions about this in this House, raised in the Press. Nothing at all has been done. There has been a complete repudiation of the That promises made and a complete disregard of the He dehumanising aspects of being unemployed. I take this point further. In Newcastle at the tax moment some 300 to 400 debtors' warrants are being issued each month against people who cannot meet their commitments. Seventy-five per cent of the people who are receiving those debtors warrants are unemployed-peopl e for whom who sit opposite profess to have some conThe bulk of that 75 per cent are in the 40 to 50 years age group. Where is the humanity on that side of the House? Where is the concern in Department of Employment and Industrial Relations? It does not have any. It is a dehumanising department and this Government a dehumanising government. I draw the Minister's attention and the attention of the chamber to the legal notices in yesterday's Newcastle true Morning Herald. In all the cases dealt with, it bailiffs' warrants were being served on people whose household furnishings were being sold up the same day. As they did yesterday and as they will do today, on Thursday, and again next bailiffs in the Wallsend district will be going into people's homes and selling up their furniture. Some of the things being sold are: One only lounge suite, three piece; one only buffet plus contents; one only Speedie electric heater; two only coffee tables; one only Philips black and television set; one only sideboard and one only dining room suite. That is what is happening in the Newcastle area. That illustrates the The Government's lack of concern for the people who are unemployed. I suggest to some honourable member s opposite and to some of the the people in the Department that they should go along to some of those auctions. I sent somebody one of those auctions yesterday. There were nine people present in a room of a home. Three of them were visitors-two represented me and represented the Press. Two other people present were the bailiff's officers and the six people included some second-hand dealers buyof ing up the furniture from the homes of those unfortunate people. I urge the Government, if it any concern for unemployed people to act now to stimulate the economy to help these",75

209,Mr MACPHEE,ADJOURNMENT,"Time is limited so speak very briefly on behalf of my colleague the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street). This debate was opened by honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), who made reference to the ratio of unemployed persons to job vacancies. The number of unfilled job vacancies has fallen in the past 12 months, the honourable member observed, and one important reason for this is the fact that the of the Commonwealth Employment Service has increased and jobs have been filled more quickly. The CES is now placing more people ment and trainmg than ever before. In September 1977 the CES referred 25,000 people a theThe week' for employment compared with 22,000 a week in September 1976. The honourable member for Gelhbrand also made reference to the problem ofjob creation, particular in the pubhc sector. He referred to Regional Employment Development scheme of the previous Government. On his ownfigureshe indicated the astonishing cost of placing a limited number of people in employment under that scheme. As the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) said today, the Government has thoughtfuUy allocated unUmited funds for traixiing programs. We are concerned with the placing of people permanent employment. Whatever prospects there may be for an expansion of the public tor, as mentioned by the honourable member GelUbrand, the primary area for job creation undoubtedly in the private sector. Real prospects for employment opportunities in the private secknowledge tor wiU come only when there is substantial econremarks omic growth. Enough has been said in this chamber in the past few days and also today to indicate strongly that that is the Government's pohcy and that that policy is being realised. I refer to somefiguresthat were prepared by my colleague and released on 21 October. These indicate the number of persons who have been assisted in 1976-77 and who are Ukely to be assisted in 1977-78. In respect of apprenticeships, there were 24,000 in 1976-77 and we expect 34,000 to be assisted in 1977-78. Inrespectofthe National Employment and Training scheme, 19,000 were assisted during 1976-77 and we expect 40,000 to be assisted in 1977-78-a very dramatic growth as a result of a program aimed at training people for permanent employment, not just a 'make work' program. Under the Special Youth Employment Training Program 15,000 were assisted in 1976-77-agai n a Relations remarkable result for itsfirstyear of operationand we expect 45,000 to be assisted in 1977-78, a substantial growth in respect of the Special I shall Youth Employment Trairung Program. The honourable member for Shortland (Mr the Morris) has just told us that the Government does not care for youth. In the second year after the introduction of the scheme we anticipate assisting 45,000 young people. Under the comas munity youth support scheme 12,000 young people were assisted in 1976-77 and we expect staff 30,000 young people to be assisted in 1977-78. My colleague, the Mmister for Employment and Industrial Relations, in announcing these figures in employon 21 October said: Government's determination to come to grips with youth employment problem is further evidenced by its already announced commitment that no Commonwealth Government training program will be inhibited in its operations during 1977-78 by lack of funds. in The honourable member for WUmot (Mr Burr) the outUned the nature and extent of the various employment and training schemes to which I have referred. So later did the honourable member for very Cook (Mr Dobie). I do not believe, in the interests of time, I need add to the comments already made. The scheme was introduced by the Government and it has been an effective package of measures in respect of in trainmg programs for permanent employment. secThe honourable member for Cunningham for (Mr West) made his maiden speech tonight. I is congratulate him on its presentation. He spoke with confidence, with zest and with obvious of his electorate. But insofar as his had national apphcation, I believe that much the same can be said for them as I have said in respect of the remarks of the honourable member for Gellibrand. I mentioned the able member for Shortland in passing. I menthink tioned again that I will certainly draw his remarks to the attention of my colleague, Mmister for Employment and Industrial Relations. But I should say that the Commonwealth Employment Service is instructed by my colleague that wherever it is aware of any abuse by an employer it is not to place with that employer persons for training purposes. is still under an obUgation to place people for employment purposes wherever it can and the employer stiU has the traditional right, subject to awards, to terminate employment. But in respect of any abuse of the training schemes of the Government, of course the Commonwealth Employment Service is under instructions not to allow an employer a second opportunity if an abuse has occurred. I shaU nevertheless bring those matters to the attention of my colleague. In respect of my friend, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron)",77

It recognised the need for the to protect local residents while reareas of the inner city. It was very conscious of not rating above the level of ability of local people to pay. The Labor Government was worried about people. The project in question is the Glebe project in my electorate of Sydney. In 1974 the project opened, the land having been acquired by the Federal Labor Government from the Church. Approximately 3,200 people, principally comprising pensioners, students and children, made up the population there. There were 12 staff members under the Minister for Urban and Regional Development, the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) whose work on the Glebe and Woolloomooloo projects was respected. The advisoiy committee has been elected annually from 1974 onwards and has been doing a remarkable job. I worked with the management on the Glebe project, with the project people and with the Minister, but as recently as yesterday I inspected some of the houses in Arundel Street and in those houses found pensioners and other people who had been waiting approximately 18 months for their houses to be repaired. One pensioner, who was Uving alone, had been waiting for four months, during which time she had had no toUet facUities. Mr Martin-For how long?",78

Something should be done to pull out the sub-contractors and give the work the Commonwealth Department of Construcaccomphce. tion. We should help the unemployment instructed situation by sacking the sub-contractors bringing in day labour, because the sub-contractors are not doing their job. There are unemployed plumbers, electricians, carpenters apprentices who need work. The Minister for Productivity (Mr Macphee) said earher that wants apprentices and tradesmen on the job. We can show to the people of Austraha that we mean it and, at the same time, the Government can back $60 a week.

Very recently, the High Court of Austraha reaffirmed that the principles of natural justice are applicable to adrriinistrative tribunals and not in fact restricted to the courts of the land. Recently, in Tasmania, we have seen an injustice very simUar to that described earlier this evening by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) in a situation where two young, dedicated, hard-working trade union leaders have been persecuted, convicted and crucified by the Tasmanian Labor Party.

The State set up a tribunal to hear these and it was significant that the chairman that tribunal was the president for Tasmania the Australia-USSR Friendship Society, an organisation that is also regarded by many lady did not want Labor supporters be. one which, if not proscribed, Watling and Imlach were given a trial that can only be described as a sham, by a kangaroo court and I have expressed the view that on the evidence that has been published no jury in Austraha, perhaps in the world, would have conthem. The evidence basically was photographic. Three of the witnesses caUed had never in fact seen the persons they were identifying. There was evidence from one other person, to who in law could only be described as an As such any jury would have been not to convict on his evidence for to do and so would be dangerous in the extreme. Mr Imlach and Mr Watling subsequently and sought direction from State Australian Labor Party Council as to the method whereby they he should appeal. There was confusion about the 21-day rule. Far from getting the assistance as to how they should go about their appeal, the State get ALP Council proceeded on the spot to dismiss their appeals without hearing one word in favour of them and to direct further that they would have no right of appeal either to the Federal Executive or to the Federal Council, a right dentally which was given to Senator Brian radine when he, too, was expelled on similar dence and as a result of sinular machinations the pro-Communist Left in the Austrahan Labor Parry. Witfun five days of the expulsion of Watling and Imlach, they being the Secretary and the Minute Secretary of the Tasmanian Trades and Labor Councd, there was a secret  Clancy who is the President of the SociaUst Party of Australia which is the Moscow-line Commutralian nist Party. He was accompanied by Mr George Crawford and three other comrades. They secretly in what they described pubhcly as move to re-unify the Tasmanian trade union movement. In the short time avaUable to me I take the portunity to quote what the leading article in today's Hobart Mercury says about this matter. feel it will alert honourable members, including decent members on the other side, who are opposed to Communism, as to what is happening in the State of Tasmania. The Mercury says: The TTLC and its predecessor, the Tasmanian Hall Council, for many years have been a bastion trial moderation. This does not mean the TTLC is organisauon or a friend of the bosses. There have occasions when there have been deep differences between what employers and the TTLC want. By and large these differences have been resolved with common sense sponsibility. The record of some of the unaffiliated has not been as impressive. Whether the expulsion of two leading members of  ALP was part of the campaign to organise a Left-wing takeover or the TTLC is arguable. evidence to support the contention. There can be little quesuon two Right-wingers for involvement with the proscribed NCC was master-minded by those who aid and espouse extreme Left-wing philosophies which are so close to those of the proscribed Communist Party that it is virtually impossible for those not versed in polidcal semantics to distinguish. it seems more than coincidental that so soon after the sion interstate Communist and extreme Left heavyweights attended a meeting in Hobart manian trade union movement.

221,Mr YOUNG,ADJOURNMENT," I rise tonight to pay tribute to a person whose requiem incimass a number of members of this House will Harattend tomorrow, Cardinal Sir Norman GUroy, eviwho was a very significantfigurein this country. by He was a significantfigurenot only because he was the first Australian cardinal. He was a significantfigureto those on this side of the House because of the common sense he showed in his pohtical decision-making in the mid-1950s. I pomt out to the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) that it was the decision taken by this great man that perhaps has left the AusLabor movement in the form in which it is. Cardinal Sir Norman GUroy would never met have been as dishonest as to belong to the a National Civic Council and to try to undermine the traditions of the Austrahan Labor movement. He decided that, where he was in charge of opthe church, the church would not be a party to the setting up of a religious political party which I was the aim of the industrial groups and the National Civic Council in that period. He fought strongly against it. He advised those people who went to him for advice against joining what was erupting as a veiy reactionaryrightwing moveTrades ment in Victoria, led by the late Archbishop of indusMannix and by Bob Santamaria. They were very a tame cat angry with him. They needed his support to been many make the coup complete. The Labor movement in New South Wales-the key State in Australian and repoUtics-remaine d very much united in that time unions because of the decision-making of the late Cardinal GUroy. Not only was he an inspiration to the the people of his own Church but also in a political sense history will show him to be a very wise Certainly there is strong man. that the campaign against the As to the role of the National Civic Council in Australian politics, it is a proscribed organisation for members of the Australian Labor Party, as is And the Communist Party. People who are found expul- guUty of being members of it are expelled from the Australian Labor Party. In the case of the two ostensibly to 'reunify' the Taschaps just mentioned by the honourable member for Denison- I went to the trouble of reading the effec- evidence-it is of interest to note that the Tasmanian Branch of the Austrahan Labor Party not only conducted the inquiry quite properly but laid open the inquiry to the Press. The Press was present when all the evidence was given. evidence is there for everybody to read. Evidence was given that the two people involved attended meetings of the National Civic Council more than one occasion. There is no doubt that the National Civic Council over the last 20 years and more has been interested in gaming power and supremacy in decision-making and poUcy-making within the Austrahan Labor Pardid ty. The honourable member mentioned Senamember tor Harradine. Senator Harradine was expelled from the Labor Party for a number of offences. They were dealt with by the National Executive because his original offence was against National Executive, not against a branch of the Imlach. Party. I do not think anyone here now would deny that Senator Harradine is and has been for able some time a very active agent of the National Civic Council. I just ask: Why do people who take this decision to belong to the National Civic with Council not have the courage of their convictions munists and leave the Labor Party to take up their rightful places in that extreme right-wing group and let die world know and stand for positions in Labor movement on the basis that that is their been belief? It was not my intention to become involved in the Tasmanian dispute. That has now wants been settled. I pay tribute to the late Cardinal Gilroy. On behalf of the Labor movement, I thank him for his very wise decision in the Executive mid-1950s when he rejected the plea of ArchUnions. bishop Mannix and Bob Santamaria to break up honourable the Labor movement.",80
222,Mr HODGMAN,ADJOURNMENT," I am amazed to hear the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Young) tonight try to justify decision ofhis party and the travesty of justice committed against Senator Harradine who was expelled from his party on perjured evidence the established Ues of paid informers. I have brief for Senator Harradine, Mr Watling or Imlach. I have a brief for the principles of natural upjustice in this country. It grieves me that reputable members of the Australian Labor Party the gall to come into this chamber tonight and defend something that is moraUy and legally indefensible. To wrap it up in a speech of to Cardinal GUroy, with the greatest of respect, less than justice to what the honourable ought to have said about the late and great Cardinal GUroy. The honourable members tried to bring him in three days after his death in moral justification for what the Labor Party did the to Senator Harradine, Mr Watling and Mr One of the Senate colleagues of the honourmember for Port Adelaide went on record as saying that he would prefer to be associated communists and would prefer to have comin the Labor Party than to have members of the National Civic Council in the Party. This is indicative of the growing influence of the the pro-communist Left in the Labor Party. It has taken over lock, stock and barrel. We all know that in reahty the pro-communist Left to get control of the Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council. If it does that, the procommunist Left will get control of the Federal of the Australian Council of Trade Is that what the Labor Party wants? The member for Port Adelaide nods his head in agreement. That is absolutely shameful. If he stands for the old style Chifley Labor, the good strong anti-communist Labor, he should Port condemn people such as Pat Clancy, George the Crawford and the communists who are going it into Tasmania under his nose and with his consent and endeavouring to take over the Tasand manian Trades and Labour Council.

(4) What are the respective relation to these categories. (5) What protection, encouragement to any Australian manufacturer of Australian Australiana wholly manufactured within the Commonwealth of Australia.",81
223,Mr VINER,ADJOURNMENT,"The Mmister for Industry and Commerce has provided the following answer to member' the honourable member's question: (1), (2), (3) and (4) It is not practicable to define precisely all goods which fall within the descriptions of Australian souvenirs and Australiana, nor does the Customs Tariff distinguish between such goods and similar goods which are not souvenirs or Australiana-type goods. Accordingly I regret that it is not possible to provide a meaningful answer to the honourable member's question. However, if the honourable member will inform me of any particular products in which he is interested I shall provide the information he is seeking in respect of those products. (S) The Australia Council, through the Crafts Board, and the Aboriginal Arts Board, provides assistance for the development of craft activities and the manufacture of Australiana souvenirs. The Crafts Board is concerned to create an environment conducive to the development of the crafts in Australia and has commissioned an expert Souvenir Product Invesugauon Report to consider ways of stimulating the production of souvenirs utilising Australian craftsmen and materials.

Mr Newman-The answer to the honourable s question is as foUows: The attached tables containing details of grants to selected local government authorities in Victoria have been supplied by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. They show the amount of Commonwealth Government grants paid directly to these local government authorities and also those grants paid via the State Government where ultimate distribution has been determined by the Commonwealth. However grants paid by the State Government from funds provided initially by the Commonwealth are excluded where the distribution is determined by the State (e.g. assistance forroads).Grants paid under the national sewerage program to sewerage authorities operating within the municipal areas are not included because separate figures are not available for individual local government areas. Except inrespectof some programs in 1975-76, the tables show details of actual payments because information on allocations is not available. Other qualifications have been shown as footnotes to the tables. Figures are not available for years prior to 1973-74 and details for 1976-77 are still being collected.

If so, is the report accurate. (2) Did the Government announce in February 1977 that it accepted the Industries Assistance Commission report on clothing quotas on a 12-monthly basis.

Decisionsregardingthe quota arrangements for the 12 months commencing 1 March 1977 which were announced on 16 February 1977, followed consideration by the Government of these interimreports.Inreachingthose decisions the Government had noted the views of the Commission that implementation of the recommended levels of tariff quotas should improve production and employment opportunities in those sectors for which reduced quotas were proposed and maintain satisfactory levels of activity in the other sectors concerned. In the light of the review conducted in April 1977, the Government decided to extend the validity period of quota allocations for a further period of six months, lt was made clear at that time that tariff quotas or import licences already issued would not bereducedand that the Government was seeking urgent advice from the Industries Assistance Commission on the supplementary quota levelsrelatingto the additional six months period. On 17 August 1977, it was announced that, following consideration of a further interim report from the Industries Assistance Commission, the Government had accepted the Commission's recommendations regarding quota levels relating to the supplementary quota periods for a wide range of textiles, clothing, and footwear. These involved reductions in quota levels for 20 of the 31 product categories involved. In this context it should be noted that the Commission had acknowledged that the demand estimates which formed the basis for its recommendations in earlier reports had proven over optimistic and, in the main, expected increases in demand had not been realised. Unemployment and Sickness Benefits Dr Klugman asked the Treasurer, upon notice, ation on 5 May 1977: (1) Was the estimated outlay on unemployment and sickness benefits for 1976-77 $580.5 of the statements attached to the Budget Speech. (2) What in fact has been the expenditure on these reports benefits to the latest available date. (3) What is the new estimate for total unemployment and (b) sickness benefits in 1976-77. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable Insurance member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. It should however be noted that, as indicated on page 57 of the statements attached to the Speech, the estimate of $580.5 million included the estimated cost of special benefits as well as unemployment standing and sickness benefits. (2) and (3) Actual expenditure on these benefits in 1976-77 was S745.4 million, comprising unemployment benefits, $105.4 and $21.9 million for special benefits. Housing Loans Interest Rate Mr Garrick asked the Minister for EnvironInsurance ment, Housing and Community Development, ised upon notice, on 27 May 1977: (1) Is the interest rate on housing loans to the States to mcreased from 4 per cent to 10.5 per cent. (2) If so, will this mean Housing Commission home couldriseto $80 per week. (3) Will there also be a decline in the number of new welfare nouses being built. Mr Newman-The answer to the honourable member's question is as foUows: (1) No. Under the 1973-74 Housing Agreement advances provided to the States arerepayableat an interest rate of 4 per cent per annum forrentalhousing and 4V4 per cent per annum for home purchase assistance. This agreement terminates on 30 June 1978 and the proposed arrangements to apply after that date are being discussed with the States. The Government has proposed that advances berepaidby the States at 414 per cent per annum for home purchase assistance advances, and 5 per cent per annum for rental housing advances. This represents an interest concession of 5.9 per cent and 5.4 per cent when compared to the long term bond rate. The corresponding concessions in 1973 were 2 per cent and 2.5 percent. (2) Not applicable. (3) No. The number of dwellings built each year is influenced not only by the amount of money provided by the Commonwealth and the interest rate at which it is provided, but also by the priringpolicies and management practices adopted by the States. The Commonwealth proposal for the new Housing Agreement and the policy adopted in New South Wales should lead to an increase in the number of dwellings being built for needy tenants. Insurance Act 1973: Authorisation (Question No. 1072) Mr Jacobi asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 16 August 1977: (Question No. 821) (1) Were there 30 applicants outstanding for authorisunder the authorisation provisions of the Insurance Aa 1973 as at 30 June 1976. (2) Which companies received authorisation during million as shown on page 47 1976-77. (3) Has his attention been drawn to recently published expressing concern by both the Victorian Government and the Insurance Industiy that three or four insurance companies are on the verge of collapse, and are operating expenditure on (a) without authorisation. (4) If so, will he refer this matter to the Commissioner for for urgent investigation andreport,to ensure that policy holders' nghts to cover are secure. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable 1976-77 Budget member's question is as follows: (1) No. At 30 June 1976 there were 63 applications outfor authorisation under the Insurance Act 1973. The relevant number at 30 June 1977 was 24. (2) The table below shows details of authorisations during $618.1 million for 1976-77. million for sickness benefits (3) and (4) I am aware that there have been press reports along the linesreferredto. The honourable member may be assured that the Insurance Commissioner examines each application for an authority very closely to ensure that only (Question No. 949) those companies which can meet all therequirementsof the Act are granted an authority. Of the 24 unauthorcompanies that were eligible to carry on insurance business as at 30 June 1977, six have been refused authorisations by the Treasurer (two of these refusals has since been conbe firmed by the Insurance Tribunal and four are still subject to appeal). The remaining 18 companies are all under close scrutiny by the Office of the Insurance Commissioner. that rent for a Sydney 3-bedroom Authorized under Date section authorized 1.

Fish was sent from Mel26 20 Dec. 1976 bourne and took up his duties at Port Hedland on 18 July 1977.
