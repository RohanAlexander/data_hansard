3,Mr WALKER,COMMITTEES,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Redevelopment of housing for service families at HMAS Cerberus. This proposal, which was referred to the Public Works Committee on 20 October 1994, will partially redress the imbalance in housing available on board compared with ashore by increasing on-board housing from 109 to 152 in accordance with the Defence Housing Authority'S mission to provide defence personnel and their families with good housing consistent with community standards. The work will include the provision of an additional 55 houses on new and revised lots, the provision of 45 houses as replacements for existing substandard houses, substantial upgrading or replacement of 10 existing older brick houses and the retention of 27 existing houses which require less substantial work. The Public Works Committee tabled its report on 11 May 1995 recommending that the project proceed. The committee also made further recommendations to which the Defence Housing Authority responded that it agrees with the need to address the imbalance between on-board and community based housing, and this proposal goes a long way to addressing the imbalance and addressing the needs of naval families in the Mornington Peninsula area. The authority will continue consultation with tenant consultative groups concerning the provision of fixtures and fittings which will enhance the inhabitability of the houses. The issue of double hung windows will be specifically addressed taking into consideration cost implications and the enhanced amenity that this project provides. The Department of Defence and DHA have initiated a joint study into stormwater discharging into Hanns Inlet. Measures to comply with the outcome of that study and with state and local government requirements aimed at protecting the inlet will be undertaken as part of the development. Work is expected to commence in 1995 for completion in 1997 at an estimated cost of $17 million. I thank the committee for its report, and commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Public Works Committee Reference",11
4,Mr WALKER,COMMITTEES,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed works be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Development of Ready Reserve (49th Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment and 6th Brigade Administrative Support Battalion) working accommodation at Enoggera, Queensland. The ready reserve was established at government direction in 1992 to increase the Australian Defence Force's capability to deploy trained personnel in shorter time scales than general reserve elements. This proposal will provide functional working accommodation for the ready reserve at Enoggera in Brisbane replacing temporary and inappropriate accommodation thus enhancing command and control training and operational readiness. This requirement is being generated as a result of the introduction of a new capability for which there are not adequate facilities. It is anticipated that construction will commence in early 1996 and be completed by late 1997. The estimated outturn cost for this proposal is $21.3 million. I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1995 Consideration resumed from 7 June. Second Reading",11
5,Dr THEOPHANOUS,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,"Calwell-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health) (12.36 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill seeks to amend the Child Care Act 1972, the Child Care Rebate Act 1993 and the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 to facilitate the government's budget 1995 commitment to improve the focus of the children's services program. This will be achieved through two initiatives. Firstly, the government will improve the targeting of financial assistance for families who require child care to enable them to participate in the work force. Secondly, the government will create a more equitable availability of occasional care for families with one or both parents at home. The government will also ensure that available child-care places can be used by families in difficult circumstances, such as family emergencies or for children at risk of abuse and neglect. This government recognises the important contribution to society and the economy of the unpaid work undertaken by women caring for their children at home. The government also acknowledges that the skills of women with work force experience are extremely valuable in an economy dependent on the training and flexibility of the work force. These days, many parents will spend some time at home when their children are young and some time in the paid work force. To meet the needs of parents at home caring for children, the government has introduced a comprehensive package of government payments which include family payments, the home child-care allowance, the new maternity allowance and the parenting allowance. Under this government's policies, work related child care is an economic issue and is an integral part of the government's approach to building a highly skilled and adaptable work force. The expansion of child care over the past decade has been a major achievement of the government and has made the return to the work force a real option for many parents, particularly women. Work related child care is required by parents who are working, studying, training or looking for work. The government has a commitment to meet the anticipated demand for work related care by the year 2001 and is well on the way to meeting the target of 354,000 work related places by 2001, with an interim target of 300,000 places by 1996-97. Commonwealth expenditure on child care has grown from $65 million in 1982-83 to an estimated $1.1 billion in 1995-96. But child care must be affordable for families. The child-care cash rebate was introduced to assist families meet child-care expenses. while working, looking for work, studying or training. Over 200,000 families have claimed the child-care cash rebate. The government also assists families with the cost of child care through Commonwealth child-care assistance. Child-care assistance is available to families using approved long day care services. About 76 per cent of families using these services receive some assistance with their child-care fees, with over 40 per cent receiving full child-care assistance. As at December 1994, an estimated 222,000 low and middle income families using long day care services received child-care assistance. However, at present, 25 per cent of child-care assistance is paid to families with one or both parents not in the work force. This proportion is increasing by about two per cent each year due to the increasing use of substantial periods of occasional care in the long day care sector by families with a parent outside the work force. Occasional care makes up about 20 per cent of all hours of care in the long day care sector. Recent surveys indicate that many working families cannot gain access to the care they need. The surveys also show that some families use substantial amounts of occasional care, while many others have no access to child care at all. The government's clearer targeting of childcare assistance will ensure that families who need child care to enable work force participation get priority to places. The amendments contained in this bill will assist by revising child-care assistance arrangements consistent with the work related focus of the program. These measures will provide access to care for an estimated additional 31,000 families. In the 1995 budget, the government also announced that the assessment of a family's eligibility for child-care assistance and family payments will be streamlined. This will be achieved by having the Department of Social Security assess eligibility for both payments at the same time each year using a common definition of income from October 1995. This initiative is designed to make the assessment process easier for families by enabling families to provide information applicable to both schemes on the same application form at the same time. (Quorumjormed) As part of the government's aim to increase the availability of care for parents who need child care to participate in the work force, Department of Social Security and the Health Insurance Commission will verify the work related status of any family wishing to receive priority of access to a child-care place for work related reasons. Amendments are required to enable the Health Insurance Commission to assist families, at their request, with evidence of their work related status, for the purposes of gaining priority of access to Commonwealth funded long day child-care services. Amendments to the Child Care Act 1972, the Childcare Rebate Act 1993 and the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 are included in this bill which will enable: - the Department of Social Security to collect information and assess a family's ment for child-care assistance on the basis of work status; and - the Health Insurance Commission to verify the work related status of those parents who are not currently claiming or are not eligible for the child-care cash rebate to assist them in gaining priority of access to a Commonwealth funded long day child-care service. I now move to the detail of the amendments required to the individual acts. Amendments to the Child Care Act 1972 Current priority of access guidelines require long day child-care services to give priority of access for vacant places to parents who need child care for work related reasons. However, the implementation of this arrangement is highly variable and a significant number of child-care places are being used by families who do not require the care to enable them to participate in the work force. As a result, in some areas, families who need care for work related reasons are unable to access child care. In addition, many services and industry organisations have agreed that government departments should introduce a way of verifying the work related status of parents. In order to address these concerns, these amendments include provisions to assess a family's entitlement to child-care assistance not only on the basis of economic need but also on the basis of the work related status of the family or other special circumstances such the as children at risk of abuse or neglect or emergency situations. Amendments to the Childcare Rebate Act 1993 This bill also includes amendments to the Childcare Rebate Act 1993. These amendments will enable the minister to make guidelines for the purpose of administering sections 29 to 31 of the act which define work related commitments. These guidelines will clearly set out the requirements of families who are verifying work, study or training commitments and will make the process of verification of work related status more transparent. Decisions made under these guidelines will be reviewable. Amendments to the Health Insurance entitle- Commission Act 1973 This bill also contains amendments to the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 which will give the Health Insurance Commission the power to verify the work related status of families at their request. As part of the government's initiative to better target childcare places to families who require child care to enable them to participate in the work force, the Health Insurance Commission will verify the work related status of any families who request it. Many families will be able to verify their work related status by producing a recent child-care cash rebate receipt as evidence that they receive the child-care cash rebate and therefore have already verified their work related status. The Health Insurance Commission already has the power to verify a family's work related status as part of the child-care cash rebate scheme under the Childcare Rebate Act 1993. However, there are a small number of families who are not eligible for, or currently claiming, the child-care cash rebate and who may choose to verify their work related status with the Health Insurance Commission, independent of the child-care cash rebate program scheme. These amendments will allow these families to gain priority of access to Commonwealth funded long day child-care services. In order to confer on the commission the function of verifying the work related status of this group of families, it to amend the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973. Changes to Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 and the Childcare Rebate Act 1993. From time to time there may be a need for the Health Insurance Commission to clarify or confirm information about a family's composition or its work related status with a department of the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth funded long day child-care service. This may occur if the information contained in a family's work verification document from the Health Insurance Commission is not sufficient to allow the service director, who is assessing priority of access to a child-care place, or the Department of Social Security, which assesses eligibility for child-care assistance, to properly identify the family concerned. Examples of circumstances where this may be necessary include where a family changes its address, where there is a change of partner or surname for a member of the family or where a family misplaces its work verification document. In these circumstances, in order to obviate the need for families to seek further documentary confirmation from the Health Insurance Commission, amendments in this bill to both the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 and the Childcare Rebate Act 1993 will allow the Health Insurance Commission to verify information about a family's composition and work related status directly with either the Department of Social Security or a Commonwealth funded long day child-care service. The Health Insurance Commission will be able to provide this information only with the consent of the parent concerned. The Health Insurance Commission will set out administrative procedures which must be followed before any information about a family will be verified directly with the Department of Social Security or a child-care service. These administrative procedures will conform with the requirements of the Privacy Commissioner and will be authorised by the Minister for Family Services, to ensure that the privacy of personal family information is protected in accordance with the principles set is necessary down in the Privacy Act. In conclusion, this government's support for choice in child care is clear and unambiguous. The government supports the choices parents make in either caring for their own children or placing their children in the care of others. The government has introduced a comprehensive range of payments which provide an independent income for parents who choose to care for their children at home. The government has provided, and will continue to provide, funding for new child-care places, innovative child-care programs and services for children and families with special needs. Child-care funding will continue to grow from an estimated $894 million in 1994-95 to $1.1 billion in 1995-96, and is expected to reach $1.5 billion in 1998-99. Child care provides parents with options to balance their work and family responsibilities. The amendments sought in this bill will help to ensure that the children's services program is better targeted to families with parents in the work force and that available places used by families with a parent outside the work force are spread more equitably. Through this initiative, 31,000 more families will have access to child care in the long day care sector. These amendments will ensure that the significant growth planned for the children's services program is properly directed and sustainable. I commend this bill to the House.",12
6,Dr KEMP,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,"The coalition opposes the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill. I have never heard a more dishonest second reading speech than the one we have just heard from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous). I do not think his speech contained one sentence to indicate what the substance of this legislation is. The specific measure that this legislation is designed to introduce was not mentioned by the parliamentary secretary. The bill seeks to implement decisions announced in the 1995 budget, in particular the decision to restrict eligibility for childcare assistance for parents not in the paid work force to 12 hours per week-a statement we will not find in the Hansard record of the parliamentary secretary's speech. That decision to restrict eligibility for child-care ance for parents not in the paid work force to 12 hours per week shows the government at its worse. I think it is worth commenting upon the language that was used here in the parliamentary secretary's speech. After the completion of the International Year of the Family, in the children's services program area, apparently we still have a complete disregard for one of the major conclusions of the National Council for the International Year of the Family-that is, that parents at home caring for children are working; that they should properly be described as 'not in the paid work force'. Instead, the department continues to use the language that those parents are not working and that child care utilised by parents who are not in the paid work force is child care utilised for non-work related reasons. So we have the distinction continually drawn in this speech between work related and non-work related care-a distinction which a great many parents in this community would deeply resent. This legislation is a clear broken promise reneging on a commitment by the government, which has been repeated on many occasions, to regard child care as a right and not a privilege. It shows the complete lack of impact of the minister responsible in this area, Senator Crowley. She has meekly capitulated to the demands that she offer up savings in child care to pay for the extravagance of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). She then has had the parliamentary secretary placed in the embarrassing position of delivering to this House a speech which deliberately sets out to obfuscate what the government is intending to do. In this legislation, the government is ignoring the role of the child-care sector in early childhood and preschool education-a most important role which has developed. The Commonwealth may not like it, and it may have walked into this situation with its eyes closed, but the fact is that the child-care sector funded by the Commonwealth is increasingly becoming a preschool sector. It is a sector focused on early childhood development and education. It provides services assistwhich are absolutely indistinguishable from preschool level services offered by the traditional kindergartens funded by the states. The Commonwealth has now become a very significant funder of preschool education. Now the government has the nerve to come into this House and tell the Australian people that it intends to discriminate against families-in terms of access to that sector-which have one parent at home caring for the child. Families with both parents in the paid work force will continue to have access to this early childhood developmental and preschool sector-the Commonwealth funded sectorbut families with a parent at home will not. What possible rationale could there be for that restriction? This entirely arbitrary decision which the government is proposing reflects the fact that the government has no national strategy for the development of child care. There is no national framework for the development of child care in Australia at the present time. The providers of child care and the parents accessing child care have absolutely no idea what the government intends for the future of this sector. This arbitrary decision, which has simply been plucked out of the air at the last moment to meet the budgetary problems caused by the Prime Minister's extravagance last year, is going to impact exceedingly unfairly and unjustly on parents around Australia. It is a decision which will fall particularly harshly on low income families, who will simply not be able to afford to purchase the additional hours at full cost over and above the 12-hour limit which the government proposes to place on child-care assistance. It is not an uncommon thing for the decisions of this government to impact very harshly on the lower income sections of the community. I think it is now generally accepted throughout Australia that, over the 13 years of this government, the gap between the rich and the poor in Australia has widened. We see in the legislation yet another decision of this government which is socially unjust and inequitable and which will hit the lower income families of this country particularly hard. They will be the ones who will be unable to afford the additional hours over and above the 12-hour limit which the government intends to impose, even though the parliamentary secretary did not deign to say in his second reading speech that that was the purpose of this legislation. Let me also say that this piece of legislation is a clear broken promise to those providers of child care who have invested heavily in the industry on the basis of the existing policy. The government and the Prime Minister have come into this House and told us on numerous occasions how many additional child-care places have been created. The way the Prime Minister talks, one would think that the government had created these places, but the vast bulk of these new places in child care have been created by the private sector. Many people in the private sector, overwhelminrly small business people, have mortgagea their houses, invested their savings and taken out loans in order to establish these child-care centres and additional child-care places-for the Prime Minister to boast about them in the parliament. Without any consultation with them and without any consideration of the impact of this policy, the government now comes into the House and kicks them where it hurts. It is a slap in the face for these people. The justifications which are offered and the assessment of the consequences of this decision in the speech made by the parliamentary secretary-I sympathise with him because he has not had any input into this speech; it has just been handed to himbear no relationship to the consequences that this decision will have in the community. We are told that there is a shortage of child-care places for what the government chooses to call in its politically extremely incorrect language 'work related' care. There is a shortage of places for work related care. Throughout large sections of Australia, particularly in New South Wales and in Queensland, there are child-care centres with vacancies-hundreds of child-care centres whose viability is dependent on their being able to offer care to parents who, for the most part, are caring for their children at home. The government is now saying to these centres, 'You may no longer offer care to these families beyond the 12-hour limit for which we will offer child-care assistance' without these families having to pay the full cost themselves. The impact of this will be very serious. The Australian Federation of Child Care Associations has already stated its belief that, as a result of these decisions, many thousands of workers in child care will be laid off. I have no doubt that this decision will push a great many child-care centres-small businesses which have invested money on the government's promises-to the edge of and into bankruptcy. There is going to be a very difficult period before these people, who have relied on the Prime Minister's word, finally suffer the full consequences of this decision. During this period, I have no doubt that many of these centres will seek to save themselves and their investments by putting up fees for parents who are in the paid work force and who are still able to access fee relief. This decision will increase the unaffordability of child care for many parents who are in the paid work force, smashing the promise that the government has reiterated on many occasions up until now that access to child care is a right for all parents whether they are in the paid work force or not. This is an outrageous decision that again shows the lack of grasp and understanding of what is happening in the child-care sector on the part of the government at present. Thousands of families in Australia have organised their family lives to take account of the availability of child care, and there are many good reasons why they may wish to do so: people want to engage in community work; they are caring for aged parents; they are seeking to make a contribution to their communities; they perceive what the government apparently very unwillingly perceives, or does not see at all-that is, they have access to an increasingly high quality preschool sector which offers their children many services which would otherwise be completely unavailable to them. These parents are going to be damaged by this decision. It is not likely that they will regard this government, with yet another broken promise, as one which merits their continuing support. In the second reading speech there is a lot of cant-that child care must be affordable to families, that there will be additional places and that this is all about a more equitable distribution of occasional care. Tell those small businesses which have believed the government's rhetoric until now and have invested in this sector that there are many families out there in the community waiting to come in and utilise the occasional care opportunities in the long day care sector where there are presently vacancies. This is just rubbish. It is nothing more than an attempt to rationalise a decision which has been taken at the behest of the Prime Minister to give his budget a semblance of credibil-ty over the long term. The savings from this budget item in 1995-96 will be only of the order of $2.8 million. Down the track the Prime Minister wants to be able to say that there are significant savings here-and there will be as centres close and as parents are shut out by this very unjust and arbitrary decision. . Why 12 hours? How was this figure plucked out of the air? According to the government, it has something to do with the median usage. What about all those families which have utilised more than the median usage? Was there any consultation with the child-care sector to discover whether or not this was a feasible and commercially sensible restriction to place, given the fact that the private child-care sector generally has not offered sessional care? How are these sectors going to make use of the hours which are not used on days where children are placed with them accessing fee relief under this provision? It is a decision which again shows that the government simply has not followed the development of this sector nor understood it. It is not surprising that the government has not understood it, because it has broken the commitments that the. minister gave in the past that a properly representative industry council would be established. The fact is that the government does not have access to any satisfactory consultative mechanism with what is now the largest sector in the provision of long day care-the private sector. The government has no way now of satisfactorily accessing information from that sector. I know that those member representatives of that sector who have sought, as most have, to work cooperatively with the government have become increasingly dismayed. at the lack of reality and the lack of balance in the advice which the government is getting for the development of its child-care policy. . This is a decision which is going to impinge much more widely. It will impinge right across the long day care sector. It will affect community based long day care centres as it will affect the private sector long day care centres. It is a decision which has been designed to get the government out of the financial difficulties which its own budgetary mismanagement has caused. . The decisions are going to impact more severely in some parts of Australia than in others, simply because the private sector has developed more rapidly in some parts of Australia than others. Indeed, in some parts of Australia it has been said that there is already an oversupply of places. The viability of those places, encouraged by the government's policy, is going to be called very much into question by this piece of legislation. I will look at some of the more detailed aspects of this bill. It contains amendments to the Child Care Act 1972, the Child Care Rebate Act 1983 and the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973. The effect of these amendments is to change the eligibility for child-care assistance in long day care services to 12 hours per week. For families using long day care for work related reasons, to use the government's language, or for families with both parents in the paid work force or other exceptional circumstances, this limit does not apply. The amendments also provide for an independent administrative mechanism to assess a family's work related status for the purpose of gaining priority of access to a Commonwealth funded long day child-care service. Amendments to the Child Care Act 1972 in this bill allow a family's entitlement care assistance to be assessed not only on the basis of economic need but also on the basis of the status of the family in relation to paid employment or other special circumstances. Ministerial guidelines will determine the special circumstances to be covered, which may include, for example, children at risk of abuse or neglect, emergency situations, and families with a parent who, for medical or other exceptional reasons, is unable to meet the specified work related criteria. The amendments also enable the minister to make guidelines which will set out the process for determining whether a family does have work related circumstances. The changes proposed for the Child Care Rebate Act 1993 will enable the minister to make guidelines which will assist the Health Insurance Commission in administering sections 29 to 31 of the act, which define work related commitments for the purposes of claiming the child-care cash rebate. These guidelines are to clearly set out the procedures and evidence required to verify a family's work, study or training commitments, and purport to make the process of verification of work related status more transparent. As the parliamentary secretary said, the decisions made under these guidelines are to be reviewable. The amendments to the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 will enable families to have their work related status assessed independently of child-care services. This is apparently to allow service providers to use this information in assessing priority for places in long day child-care services. The Health Insurance Commission will be able to provide this independent assessment of work related status for families who have not had their work related status verified either by the commission under the Child Care Rebate Act 1993 for the purposes of claiming the childcare cash rebate, or by the Department of Social Security under section 12A of the Child Care Act 1972 for child-care assistance purposes. Decisions made in relation to a family's work related status under the Health Insurance Commission Act are reviewable under the review provisions of the Child Care to child- Rebate Act. Further amendments to the Health Insurance Commission Act and the Child Care Rebate Act will allow the commission to clarify or confirm information about a family's composition or their work related status with a department of the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth funded long day child-care service with the written consent of a parental member of the family concerned. This may occur, for example, if the information contained in the family'S work related verification document from the Health Insurance Commission is not sufficient to allow the service director or the Department of Social Security, which assesses eligibility for child-care assistance, to be clear that it applies to a particular family. These amendments purport to obviate the need for families to seek further documentary conformation from the commission. The amendments in this bill are expected to produce savings of $141 million over the four years from April 1996 to 1998-99. The anticipated saving in the 1995-96 year is $2.8 million. Child-care assistance is a scheme designed to help low and middle income families with child-care fees. The assistance is provided to families by the government and administered through service providers. It is in concept a payment to the parents rather than the service providers. It is available on a tapering scale until the family income reaches $1,157 per week before tax for a family with one child in care. Child-care assistance is available to eligible families using approved child-care services, including community based, employer sponsored and private long day care centres, family day care, outside school hours care and occasional care. To be approved for child-care assistance, long day care centres must now comply with accreditation guidelines. Child-care assistance was made available to parents using private child-care providers in 1991 by the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1990. Until then it was only available to parents whose children were in community based child-care centres. The purpose of extending fee relief to private centres at that time was to increase supply of child-care places and ensure that child care was affordable for 'ordinary Australian families', which was the expression former Senator Button used in his second reading speech on the Community Services and Health Legislation Bill on 11 October 1990. Senator Crowley, in debate on the appropriation bills on 21 May 1990, stated that the goal of making this extension was to 'bring on stream a significant increase in the number of places for people who are still looking for access to child care'. Senator Crowley also recognised at that time that child care was important for families and particularly women 'who want to exercise their opportunities to study, to work and to do a whole variety of things that previously they were not able to do without that child-care assistance'. In the debate on the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill on 17 October 1990, Senator Crowley spoke of the challenge which all government senators, and herself in particular, faced in grappling with the proposal to change party policy to extend 'public dollars to the private sector in child care'. She said: It seemed to us, as a matter of equity, that people should not be denied access to child-care places in the private sector because of cost. Further, she said: There is a very clear statement by government in this piece of legislation of its commitment to those people in the community who, for whatever reason, decide they would like to use it. It seems that Senator Crowley has conveniently forgotten these justifications for her earlier decision and that she is quite prepared to renege on her commitment to equity and the principle that people should have access to child care, regardless of their reasons for seeking care. There have been statements made by the parliamentary secretary in the second reading speech that imply that a number of private child-care providers-in fact the implication was very broadly stated-have not been observing the priority of access guidelines. No evidence has been brought forward to show that this is the case. It is very interesting that the the government has not proposed any particular measure in this legislation which specifically addresses that issue, if indeed it is an issue. Instead, it has chosen a measure which will impact very broadly on parents and providers right across the long day care sector. If the problem is that the priority of access guidelines are not being observed, why has the government not brought forward measures to deal with that particular problem? If you talk, as I have, very broadly with people in the community based and private long day care sectors, you will know that there is a very proper recognition of the existence of the priority of access guidelines. Until now, under those guidelines, long day care centres have been entitled to provide places for what the government calls non-work related care and to make fee relief available for parents using those places on an unrestricted basis-indeed on the same basis as fee relief is made available to parents who are in the paid work force. This legislation is a very significant reneging on past commitments. It shows that the government no longer has credibility in terms of child-care policy, that many of its past statements were not made seriously and that they are now being broken with a very wilful sense that this sector is another of the pawns in the community which must suffer to try to save the Prime Minister's bacon with the financial markets. It is only a matter of appearance in the next year, but it is going to impact very harshly and unjustly once this restriction comes into place in April next year. I say to the government that the coalition is not going to let this go unremarked in the wider community. It is going to be a very significant issue. In each of the last two elections the coalition made major commitments to the expansion of access to child care. Our credibility in this area is without question. We have strongly committed ourselves to the right of parents. to access to child care in the Australian community. Now that the government has seen fit to renege on its commitments we will certainly be doing everything in our power to make sure that the community is aware of the hypocrisy, lack of planning and injustice which underlie the government's current approach in this area.",15
7,Mr HAVILAND,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,"Macarthur) (1.22 p.m.)As always, I am very pleased once again to take the opportunity to speak in support of this government's legislation in the area of child care. Having just sat through, not for the first time, a diatribe by the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), I am reminded why people seek election to this side of the House and why people join the Australian Labor Party. We just heard the member for Goldstein talk about credibility and the opposition's commitment to child care. I remind him, in case he has forgotten, that members of the opposition in the previous parliament did not seem to understand that child care existed. It was not until Fightback II in December 1992 that they realised they were going to put a GST on child care. They had to have Fightback II to exempt food and child-care services from the GST. As usual with great changes in social policy and social reform, the Labor Party has led the way and the coalition has dragged about 10 years behind again. That was shown very clearly in the last federal election campaign and is still being shown. This bill proposes amendments to the Child Care Act 1972, the Child Care Rebate Act 1993 and the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973. In the recent budget the government announced its intention to improve the targeting of child care to families who require child care to enable them to participate in the work force. There are two initiatives which will assist in this improved targeting. Under the first of these, from 1 April next year, a family's entitlement to financial assistance with its child-care fees through child-care assistance, which was formerly known as fee relief, will be assessed on the economic need of the family as it currently is and on the work related status of the parents. Families in which both parents-or, in the case of a single parent, the sole parent-are working, training, studying or looking for work will be entitled to child-care assistance for as many hours of work related child care as they require or as many hours as are available to meet their work related commitments. I stress that because it seems that yesterday and particularly this morning I have been getting a lot of calls in my electorate office and here about this bill. There is obviously a bit of a scare campaign going on in the community. Private child-care centres in particular seem to think there is something dreadful about this legislation and are being stirred up by some disinformation from places that we can only guess at. My electorate office has received lots of calls, as has the office of my colleague the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). Our . electorates cover areas where there are a lot of young families and child care is a very important issue. It is an issue that is recognised by this government and has been for the last 12 years. Obviously in our electorates it is a high priority issue and there is concern in the community. But the concern is based, I think, on myths and disinformation. I will be certainly contacting the child-care centres in my electorate to inform them of the correct position in relation to this bill. It is important to point out that the definition of a 'working parent' applies to not just someone who is at work at the moment. It also applies to parents looking for work. Whether they are on unemployment benefits, whether they are training or whether they are studying, they are still considered as part of the labour force, the work force, and they are therefore still eligible for these child-care assistance benefits. That is the situation, although it is not quite reflected in one of the letters I have received. I will read part of a letter from the Rosemeadow Preschool. It is a form letter that has gone out to all the parents whose children are minded at this particular preschool. It states: Dear parent, The government is planning to restrict child-care assistance to 12 hours a week for children if the parents is not working. This means that children of parents who are unemployed, a non-working single parent or only one of the parents are working will be restricted virtually to only one day a week. That is simply not the case. If people are unemployed and looking for work, considered to be part of the labour force. I think that is one myth that needs to be knocked on the head straight away. The second of the initiatives I was talking about is that all families wishing to receive first priority of access to a child-care place will have to provide independent evidence of their work related status to their child-care provider. That is simply a monitoring of the eligibility of parents under the child-care legislation. In addition there will be some exceptional circumstances, such as children at risk of abuse or neglect or short-term family emerevidence gencies, where a family will also be entitled to child-care assistance for as many hours care as are required or available. Exemptions are also being considered for families with children or parents with a disability. As has always been the case under the priority of access guidelines, children at risk are covered for child-care assistance. It is interesting to listen to opposition members talk about child care. Suddenly, with an election coming up, they can see an opportunity to stir up in the community a disinformation and a bit of concern about child care. But the hypocrisy from the opposiguidelines tion in relation to child care is almost on a par with the hypocrisy that we heard yesterday about the French tests. It is the Labor Party that has always led the way with these great social reforms. In relation to child care and the children's services program, unlike in the past where the government's involvement in child care was simply seen as a welfare circumstance issue, under this Labor government child care has been recognised as not only a social issue but a very important economic issue as well. The priority of access guidelines are designed so that priority in Commonwealth funded childcare centres is given to working parents. That is how it is intended to be. That does not one of mean that we do not fund occasional care. Of course, occasional care is funded. The limit is 12 hours a week, as set out in this bill. I point out that in relation to occasional care the 12 hours a week is an increase. Until now the limit for occasional care has been as low as they are four hours a week. From 1 April 1996 families with both parents at home will be able to claim childcare assistance for up to 12 hours a week, which is equivalent to up to three developmental sessions a week. I have heard some concern expressed about the 12-hour limit, but it is a fact that at least half of the families currently accessing occasional care use fewer than 12 hours a week and 20 per cent of the remainder use a very small amount more than 12 hours a week. The supposed impact on parents of this 12hour limit is fairly minimal. In fact, from I have received as a result of calls to my office, it seems that those who are of mainly concerned about this bill are not the parents but the private child-care centres that can perhaps see some effect on their profits. Of course, private child care is an important part of the child-care industry. It was this government that opened up fee relief, or child-care assistance, to the private sector. The private child-care industry in my electorate has grown dramatically, which has catered for the very high level of need for child care bit of in a growing area like Macarthur. It is important to look at priority of access and it is important that they be adhered to. It is also important for governments-in terms of policy, legislation and funding-to provide benefits for those people in most need. It has been drawn to my attention that there are occasions when private child-care centres seem to charge the clientsthe parents of the children-for 12 hours a week of care when the hours of care are actually fewer. Perhaps this legislation is a worry for those centres which see their ability to cream off some profits at risk. This legislation is responsible. It is yet another example of this government's commitment to child care and social justice. I might take this opportunity to go over the history of the child-care program. It is one of our important programs. It is not only an important social program but also an important economic issue. It is worth recounting the record of this particular government on child care. Formal child-care services in Australia had their origins in the need to provide substitute care for children to allow mothers with young children-this is, of course, the original need for child care-to work in workplaces structured around the needs of men. That is how the need for child care originated in the 1960s. Before the 1970s, child care was considered to belong in the private sphere as the primary responsibility of mothers. Perhaps the opposition still believes that should be case. Judging by its policies on other issues, I would not be surprised. Some charitable groups did provide a small amount of child care as a welfare service. However, these programs carried a strong stigma, as children were considered disadvantaged by the substitute care being provided. With changing social attitudes and growing workplace participation of women, the traditional view of children being dependent on purely home based care began to change. The federal government became involved in child care in the early 1970s mainly through the provision of preschool education. In 1972 the Whitlam government was elected on its promise of a year of preschool education for every child. The government opened up new possibilities with direct action on the establishment of new services and the implementation of parent control and community management. However, during the years of the Fraser government, the children's services program diminished. The Fraser government clearly viewed its involvement in children's services in terms of welfare responsibility for needy families, and the overall decline in real funding for children's services reflected the philosophical attitude of that government at the time. Under the current federal Labor government, child-care policies have been transformed by moving them into the mainstream of social and economic policy making. Rather than considering children's services as essentially a welfare program, this Labor government has recognised child care as an important economic issue as well as an important social issue. Child-care places are seen as necessary to meet the demands of the labour market with child-care subsidies becoming an important part of the social wage. That is a very important point to stress. I always seem to follow the member for Goldstein in these debates. He is the shadow minister for employment. One would have thought that he would have been aware that child care is a very important labour market issue. He would certainly be aware that that is the priority of this government, as it should be.. I am surprised-perhaps I should not the really· be surprised-that he seems to have missed the whole point in the child-care debate. Child care is an important part of the social wage and an important part of our labour market. To meet these objectives the federal government entered into cost sharing arrangements with the states and territories. This proposal ·was initially suggested by the New South Wales Labor government in the 1980s. It offered to contribute the capital child-care costs as long as the government provided the recurrent funding. This idea spread to other states, and in the 1980s the children's services program expanded quickly. There have been problems with some of these Commonwealth-state child-care arrangements. I have spoken many times in this House before about the fact that for nearly five years the former coalition government of New South Wales did not sign the Commonwealth-state child-care agreement, first drafted in 1990. This was despite many valiant attempts by the federal government to enable the young families of New South Wales to have access to the children's services program and to much needed child-care places, whether they be long day care, occasional care, out of school hours care-you name it. The people of New South Wales were being denied access to· the new places available because of the political gamesmanship and the point scoring of the former New South Wales government. It took a change of government in New South Wales this year for the agreement to be signed in April. There are also similar problems in Victoria. With the change of government down there, it took almost as long for the agreement to be signed by the Kennett government. There have been problems with these Commonwealth-state child-care agreements, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria. There always seem to be problems with agreements between the Commonwealth and the states, but that is a debate for another time. The federal government currently directs funds to and administers the child-care assistance, which we have been talking about, for long day care and family day care centres. It is a means tested fee assistance scheme. It also provides the child-care cash rebate for working families. It provides out of school hours care, operational assistance and fee assistance, although some states also have an administrative role in that. We fund occasional child care and, as I have said, long day care as well. We also have a range of other initiatives including the supplementary services program. We have now in place a quality improvement and accreditation system, QIAS, which is another recent initiative of this federal government. The federal government provides contributions to the capital costs of new community based long day care centres in most states and territories. That was held up in New South Wales and also in Victoria to a great extent because of the failure of the state governments there to sign the agreements. Once again, I am very pleased to speak on this legislation. It is a further example of continued reform in a very important area of social and economic policy-an area close to my heart and certainly close to the needs of my electorate. It is an area in which I have always had a fair bit of interest. I would like to reiterate an important message for parents: this is not as bad as the opposition and some people in the private child-care industry are making it out to be. The priority of access guidelines make it clear that 'working parents' means not only parents who have a job but also parents who are looking for a job, studying or training. The member for Goldstein asked about mothers who are at home minding their children. They are doing non-paid work but it is still work. That is an interesting spin on the debate. In fact it is one of the first times I have heard the opposition put forward that argument. It shows the hypocrisy of those opposite-a bit like their jumping on the bandwagon yesterday over the French nuclear testing. The needs of non-working parents in the home, although they do not have access to the unlimited fee relief as working parents do, are met by a number of other social security benefits such as the family allowance payments and, in some cases, the child-care cash rebate. We are putting together, and have put together over the last 12 years, a very comprehensive safety net, a comprehensive security scheme and also, very importantly, appropriate funding for work related and, where it is appropriate, non-work related child care. I commend this bill to the House.",20
8,Mr VAILE,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,"It is always interesting to sit in this House and listen to debates on different pieces of legislation proposed by the government and hear what government members have to say. This Labor government seems to think that it has a mortgage on the soft social issues. It thinks it is the only party that has an empathic view on child-care issues, women's issues and Aboriginal issues. That is not the case. The previous speaker, the member for Macarthur (Mr Haviland), thinks the Labor Party has a mortgage on views with regard to the nuclear testing that will take place in the Pacific. That is also not the case. The Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill is a very important piece of legislation. As far as I can gather, having listened to some of the debate so far, nobody has touched on the critical element of this debate-that is, the arbitrary setting of 12 hours per week fee relief or assisted child care for non-working parents. Anybody who has had anything to do with child-care facilities would realise that that is not sufficient for two full sessions. A number of different organisations in my electorate have made representations to me highlighting the fact that 12 hours assistance would not provide two days long day care for people in this situation. It might provide 1Y2 days of care, but it will not provide two. I highlight to the government and the departmental people present that the representations I have received from providers in my electorate are to change that arbitrary figure of 12 hours of long day care per week to two days. That will certainly help provide a much better service to the target group. The target group is the priority 4 group-that is, single income families, non-working families, isolated families, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families and non-English speaking migrant families. They are the families that are affected by this piece of legislation. I was interested to hear the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) say in his second reading speech that with this measure 31,000 additional families would have access to assistance. By the same token, it must eliminate thousands of families from accessing long day care services around Australia. The figures in the budget provide for an anticipated saving over four years of $151 million. You cannot save $151 million by providing more child care. You save $151 million by providing less child care. It is important to get these facts on the record. For the information of the House, I do not speak in this debate without any background or credentials in this area. I have three children of my own, two of whom over their early years attended long day child-care centres in Taree and Wingham. When my first daughter went to the CUddlepie Day Care Centre in Wingham I was actually running a business in the area, I was on the Greater Taree City Council and I was also a member of the management committee. There were two child-care centres set up in Manning using federal government and state government moneys which were under the auspices of the Greater Taree City Council. We established a long day care centre at Wingham called Cuddlepie Day Care Centre and one at Taree called Snugglepot Day Care Centre. You must admit that they are unique names. I was part of the inaugural council committee that established these two centres. After a couple of years of operation, and when they were well established in the community and providing a good service, the management of those two community based day care centres was passed over to a community based management committee which I chaired for a number of years. So I know a little bit about this issue. The previous speaker said that it is only the private providers in a preschool situation, with long day care thrown in as well, who are complaining about this legislation, but that is not a fact. The first person that came to see me about this legislation was Geraldine Smith, who is the Director of the Snugglepot Day Care Centre in Taree. It is a publicly owned long day care centre which operates with Commonwealth funds and which is managed by a community management committee. Geraldine Smith's concern is with that arbitrary figure of 12 hours per week, which I mentioned earlier. It is not two sessions or two days; it is 12 hours. That will not provide two days of care to these families. I also had representations from Sandra Babekuhl, who is the Director of the Little Grub Day Care Centre. That centre is a private provider, but it is also a long day care centre. It supplements the publicly owned centres in my area with much needed care. I also had representations from Jenny Babekuhl, to whom the previous speaker referred, who is the Director of the Orana Crescent Preschool. That preschool is also a private provider. All of these people have come up with the same problem. They recognise that there may be a need for the government to tighten up in this area, but it is not being done in a way that will be beneficial to the people who need the service; that is, the priority 4 group, which includes single income families, nonworking families, isolated families, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families and nonEnglish speaking migrant families. These people from whom I have had representations operate centres in my area, which has a 17 per cent rate of unemployment. It is not 8.5 per cent, which is the rate across the country and the figure the government is projecting for the end of this financial year, but 17 per cent. These people will be disadvantaged by this move by the government. These are genuine concerns which are being expressed by people who are genuinely providing a much needed service in my area. These are not just political points. It is important to note that these concerns are coming from the grassroots level. I presume that the department and the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), in formulating this measure, have consulted not just with the razor gang but also with the providers and the people in the community who represent the people who use these services. The background notes read: Childcare Assistance is a scheme designed to help low and middle income families with child care fees. The assistance is provided to families by the Government and administered through service providers. It is in concept a payment to the parents rather than the service providers. Government speakers have highlighted that the people jumping up and down are the service providers, but I do not think there is too much scope for making large profits in this area. In getting out of the system people who should not be receiving assistance, an income test is applied. Some might argue that it is too generous. It cuts out at a gross income level of $1,157 per week. Then you get no fee relief at all. Maybe that is too generous. Maybe that needs reviewing. That comes out at a gross combined income of about $60,000 a year. There is a noted saving in the budget papers of $151 million. I quote: According to the Auditor-General in the report Mind the Children (June 1994), the amount of growth exceeded Departmental estimates. Over the period 1991-1993, the total number of subsidised places for all service types grew from 168,000 to 208,000--a 24% increase. As a result of the trend to part-time care where more than one child uses a place, the Department estimated that approximately 343,000 children use those 208,000 places. Of this number, some 219,500 (64%) received Childcare Assistance. The estimate for expenditure for Childcare Assistance in 1995-96 is $745.1m, and in 1997-98, $989.0m. Maybe this area of government expenditure is growing faster than was estimated by the government and it is using this measure, with that saving of $151 million it is making, to try to keep the lid on it. Access to child-care services has always been something which the government has crowed about. I reiterate that the government does not have a mortgage on all the right views on child-care provision in Australia. There are many other people in the community who also have objective and correct views. But the stated objective of the child services program is to assist families with dependent children to participate in the work force and the general community by ensuring that child care is affordable for lower middle income families and by approving the supply and quality of child care. The other stated objective of the children's services program does not make a distinction between work related and non-work related care. The Commonwealth's support for work related care stems from its obligations under the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women and ILO Convention 156, workers and family responsibilities. The Auditor-General pointed to a substantial demand for non-work related care, and a census of child-care services shows that substantial use of long day care and family day care is made for care which is non-work related. About 20 per cent of child-care assistance is paid to parents using non-work related care. They are the government's words. The Auditor-General has stated that access to non-work related care is not equitable, as it depends on the availability of places rather than on the demand for care-and the government has made little formal commitment to meet the demand for this type of care. Access to non-work related care is restricted by supply and, in many cases, is restricted to families and areas with an oversupply of places. That is being overemphasised now. This is being amplified by this measure that the government is introducing with this piece of legislation where non-work related care is restricted further to 12 hours. I made representations to the minister on this legislation as soon as the budget came out. I wrote to the minister on 26 May. Mr Richard Evans-Did you get a response?",23
9,Mr VAILE,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,"As yet I have received no response from the minister on this issue. On 26 May I wrote to her highlighting the detrimental effect that this piece of legislation would have. I wrote: Representations are being made on behalf of Ms Geraldine Smith, Operator of Snugglepot Day Care Centre, Ms Sandra Babekuhl, Proprietor of the Little Grub Day Care Centre, and Ms Jenny Babekuhl, Proprietor of the Orana Crescent PreSchool concerning the limit of 12 hours per week for occasional care. All the above operators are of the opinion that limit for occasional care should be 2 days in lieu of 12 hours and following discussions with the operators I am pleased to support them in their opinion. I support them again here today in asking the government to please consider this. In the letter to the minister I went on to state: In imposing a limit of 12 hours it does not permit the carer to use the time to enter the workforce whereas two days would provide this opportunity as well as giving the carer a break from the child or children and giving the child or children an opportunity for development outside the home environment. It is a very important point that I make with regard to this piece of legislation. It is interesting to note a comment that was made. I spoke on the phone this morning to one of the directors of one of these day care centres about the waiting lists and whether this sort of attention needs to be focused on this group that uses occasional care and long day care centres. The largest waiting list in my area is in the nought to ones. The director to whom I spoke does not believe that the government wants to cut this area down because of pressure from the area on the services provided. We are saying from this side of the House that this is being driven by the need of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to balance the budget. He has gone through all the departments. My perception is that the minister with responsibility in this area was told to find some money to save-and she has found $151 million by cutting back on this program. This legislation is not about creating better equity. The Auditor-General has said that there is no equity. He stated that access to non-work related care is not equitable as it depends on the availability of places rather than on the demand for care. The government has made little formal commitment to meet the demand for this type of care. Access to non-work related care is restricted by supply and, in many cases, is restricted to families and areas with an oversupply of places. Now the government is prepared to provide only 12 hours of non-work related child care a week to people in that category. The bill implements decisions announced in the 1995 budget. Those decisions were quickthe ly picked up by people in the industry providing the care. The decision to restrict eligibility for child-care assistance for parents not in the paid work force to 12 hours per week has aroused great concern-as I have highlighted-particularly in the private sector of the child-care industry. The community based child-care sector will also be affected by the decision. We have had derision from the government, because it has been the private providers who have predominantly raised this issue. The government has said that the private providers are in it for the money. The Commonwealth of Australia could not provide the infrastructure to provide the child care that a lot of the private sector does. The private sector has to be involved in this industry; otherwise there would not be the same amount of child-care places. There is no point in government members saying, 'Private providers are only looking after themselves and feathering their own nest.' The Commonwealth could not supply the capital to provide the infrastructure the private sector has established in providing these places. The government's argument is fallacious and should not be used. The private sector has provided these places-and the government is using the private sector to provide the places-so it should not use that argument. The private sector is saying, 'We are happy with these restrictions, provided they are limited to two days, not 12 hours. The government should put a two-day limit on this focus group in this area, not a 12-hour limit.' That is all the private sector is saying. If it were trying to maintain its bank balances, profitability and viability, it would be opposing the idea outright. Its criticisms are constructive. It is constructively making a suggestion to the government and the bureaucracy involved. I will close on that note. Hopefully, the government will look at my comments as being constructive and not entirely political. The industry is genuinely concerned about the measures that the government is implementing in this bill. The criticism that is being levelled at the government is constructive, not negative, and is aimed at finding a proper way to provide the long day care that is needed for this target group. It is about being reasonable and realistic in how that care is provided. The information I have gleaned from the providers in my electorate is that to use an arbitrary figure of 12 hours is not realistic and that the bill should be amended. Both public providers and private providers have said to me that a limit of two days, not 12 hours, should be put in the bill.",26
10,Mr LATHAM,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,"I feel well credentialled to speak on a bill dealing with child care, not because I have direct client contact with these services or have direct working experience within the child-care sector but because, out of the 147 electorates represented in this chamber, Werriwa has the youngest population. On the 1991 census data, Werriwa has a higher proportion of its population-lO.3 per centunder the age of five than any other federal division. It also has a higher share of fiveto 14-year-olds-almost 20 per cent-than any other electorate in the country. Nothing matters more to my electorate than affordable access to quality child care. Child care is in the first rank of equity issues facing the people of Werriwa. My representative role in this matter is to argue the case for equity. In child care, this also means arguing the case for change and pursuing the policies of social attack which, in this instance, involves mustering arguments for a better way of running the national child-care program. The Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 reinforces the need for a genuine equity approach to social policy. As I have previously argued in the House on aspects of health, housing and local government policy, this approach should not be seen as incompatible with market parameters or the virtues of market analysis. One of the problems with the child-care debate in Australia is the absence of accurate measures and parameters by which child-care programs can be assessed for their satisfaction of socio-economic needs. This makes an important point for policy makers interested in social equity, for policy makers driven by the need for a more equal society: never allow social policy to be taken over by special interest groups; never allow social policy objectives to drift away from a hard-nosed, rigorous approach to equity; and never allow equity itself to be redefined in terms other than those which address the satisfaction of socio-economic needs. The lessons are compelling. In public life and public administration, practical outcomes matter much more than social theory; and, most of all, equity cannot be judged and measured without attention to issues of price, distribution and the supply and demand for services. It is, therefore, entirely appropriate to talk of an active market for child-care services in Australia. To understand this market-to assess its strengths and weaknesses-it is instructive for the House to note its similarity with the provision of health care services in Australia: first, a confusing and overlapping set of federal, state and local government responsibilities, with active incentives for cost shifting; second, different funding and pricing mechanisms determined not by the capacity of service providers to satisfy social needs but by their ownership; third, the inability of funding mechanisms to address the changing nature of locational needs and regional equity-that is, the absence of regional sensitivities in the funding formulas-and, fourth, market conditions of surplus demand, inadequate supply and, consequently, the forced rationing of service delivery. There are four ways in which child-care services are being rationed in Australia. The first form of rationing is the priority system for access to community long day care. Incredibly, this system ranks the needs of working parents higher than those of children with physical or intellectual disabilities. I would urge the minister and her advisers to reverse these priorities to give the highest priority to disabled children who most need public support. The second form of rationing is a shortage of long day care for noughtto two-year-olds. This is because child-care assistance and the cash rebate are not being adjusted for the cost differential in the provision of care for noughtto two-year-old children by private sector centres. It costs more to provide the care with staffing ratios for noughtto twoyear-olds than for threeto five-year-olds, but the flat fee being applied takes no account of that differential. The third form of rationing is the waiting lists for most types of care in many, but not all, parts of Australia. This legislation, of course, forms the fourth element of the process of rationing by attempting to limit child-care assistance for non-work related child care to 12 hours per week, with a budgetary saving of $141 million over four years. This reform responds to the 1993-94 Australian National Audit Office report which found: Non-work related care is costing the national program $80 million a year. Children with no additional needs (purely respite) are costing proximately $60 million. There is an attempt through this legislation to ration publicly subsidised care for home based parents and their children. I have no problem with that objective in theory. I just have a concern, which is shared by other members, about the way in which the theory is being applied in practice, because it does not take account of regional differences. For instance, the seat of Werriwa has the youngest population in the country. It has a high proportion of single parents as a family type. It has a high proportion of non-English speaking background communities. It has an unacceptable proportion of unemployment and other forms of social welfare. In Werriwa there is currently, according to some private centre providers, an oversupply of long day care for threeto five-year-olds. The real service need in Werriwa in long day care is not for threeto five-year-olds; it is for noughtto two-year-olds, and also in nonwork related care arrangements. This legislation reinforces the need for a regional approach to the distribution of scarce resources in the Australian child-care system. I urge the minister not only to address the need for regional sensitivities but also to look at the practical application of this legislation, because the provision of two sets of six hours-two days and six hours of care each day-does. not correspond to the way in which private centres have structured their fee arrangements. Private centres charge on a daily basis, not hourly. If the legislation passes the Senate, there will also be a need to give those centres the flexibility to adjust their staffing arrangements to staff up at the peak period, which may be for a six-hour duration. So some reforms will flow out of the legislation-assuming its passage in the Senate. I urge the minister to address those questions: to have a daily provision instead of an hourly provision and to provide better staffing and industrial relations flexibility for child-care centres to meet the way in which non-work related care is being rationed. In principle, the rationing of non-work related care makes sense. If home based parents were to abuse the system by placing aptheir children in child care, at government expense, for the entire week and not pick up their responsibilities as parents, then that is something the government should try to actively discourage. That much makes sense in this legislation. It is just that we also need to have regard to regional sensitivities and the practical application of the 12-hour rationed period. The minister must have regard for the practical circumstances in which most of the private child-care centres in my electorate find themselves in 1995 and; consequently, some of the adverse reactions they have expressed on the administrative consequences of this bill. I wish to examine the significance of rationing of child care around Australia. In any market for social products where demand far outruns supply, governments are forced into decisions about the distribution of services and benefits. The success of this rationing role depends on the establishment of funding and pricing mechanisms which meet two objectives: first, responsiveness to consumer preferences, particularly on a regional basis, because the regional differences around Australia in child-care needs are quite acute; and, secondly, regard for socio-economic needs-that is, the equity arguments that I am presenting to the House. The question of rationing makes a very important point about some of the arguments for universality that child-care lobbyists present to the government and around the community. Universality in child care, like Medicare, would basically require a special levy on those taxpayers with children, or the devotion of large amounts of government revenue to the child-care sector. Presently in Australia-and it is reflected in the policies of both the government and the oppositionthat premium on child care is not being presented. In Australia we lack the social premium required for universality of childcare provision and, as a consequence, we get the rationing of care in the four methods I have outlined to the House. It logically follows that it is not valid to argue that child care can be regarded as a work related expense equivalent to current tax deductions. It would be valid in practice only if the service were to be provided universally, because this is what distinguishes all the other forms of work related tax deductions: they are universally provided in the market and there is a match between supply and demand. Work related clothes or work related equipment are easily supplied within the consumer market, but we do not have that level of universal provision in child care. There is a rationing system in place. Child care has had to be rationed as demand has far outrun supply around Australia. In this fashion those that I would term the 'Coxocrats' are coming unstuck. People like Eva Cox seek to use the child-care debate as a form of gender struggle, arguing that men are always advantaged by working no matter the quality of that work, and women are always disadvantaged by home based work and activity. In truth and practice, child-care policy should seek to facilitate choice and accommodate diversity among family types and family values. Public policy should not seek to satisfy the stereotypes of either the Coxocrats or the conservatives; rather, within the limits of equity and efficiency, it should assist families to pursue the lifestyle and the child-care arrangements which best suit their particular circumstances and family aspirations. Child care should not be seen as a zero sum game where the sexes, .males and females, are forced to contest scarce resources; rather, it should involve the satisfaction of family needs whereby males and females alike enjoy benefits, and their children enjoy quality care and better opportunities for early childhood education. It is invariably argued that Australia's children's services are organised in a complex fashion because the needs of children and families are complex. This represents a form of reverse logic in public administration. If, as is the case, the needs of children and families are complex and diverse, then the role of government is simple and twofold: first, to maximise choice between child-care types and service providers, whereby families are free to satisfy their own needs instead of having ideologically driven solutions imposed on them by central planners; and, second, to establish an efficient system of safety net provision through capitation payments and well-targeted operational and capital contracts to assist socioeconomically disadvantaged families and regions. The bottom line is crystal clear. Universality in child care is very expensive and in Australia it is currently well beyond the public's willingness to pay through the taxation system and the public sector. We lack the social premium which would underscore a universal approach to child-care service provision in Australia. It logically follows that, if rationing is to apply, government transfer payments should be means tested, plus service subsidies should be allocated on a needs basis. For instance, if the child-care cash rebate were to be means tested in line with the basic family payment, $40 million per annum would be saved. If the home child-care allowance were to be means tested at the level of the basic family payment, there would be a saving to the public sector of $145 million per annum. The result would free up in total savings more than $200 million each year, which could be reallocated to areas of greatest social need. If we are going to have rationing in the child-care system, I am a strong supporter of taking the resources presently being allocated to high income earners in Australia and reallocating them on a regional and service need basis to areas of highest socio-economic need. The second principle that follows from these arguments is to present the benefits and payments in a fashion which establishes competitive neutrality between public and private child-care service providers; that is, have endorsement of the COAG principles for competitive neutrality and to apply them to the child-care sector. In this fashion, the government could use its capitation payments, the child-care assistance and cash rebate, as basic entitlements, as the foundation of a system whereby service providers, public and private, would have an equal opportunity to provide basic care. That equal opportunity is presently distorted by the failure of the subsidies to reflect the higher cost of care for noughtto two-year-olds in the private sector. In the public sector, the community long day care centres receive government capital and operational subsidies which allow them to meet those higher costs. The private sector is not receiving the same level of government support. I urge the mInIster to address that basic inequity and basic source of inefficiency in the child-care system and establish the sort of competitive neutrality principles which have been so thoroughly endorsed by COAG. The third principle flowing from these questions of rationing is the government using capital and operational subsidies to address locational differences and inequities in child care around Australia. With competitive neutrality, once the private sector and the public sector have done their best to provide services and if there are still shortages and gaps in service provision on a regional or locational scale, the government should target, to public and private sector providers, its capital and operational subsidies to meet those shortages and fill those gaps. I understand that some of these issues are currently on the agenda of COAG and I look forward to the establishment of a purchaserprovider split with regional funding arrangements, suitable performance measures and national standards all built into a reformed national child-care program. I reinforce the regional differences. In Campbelltown, which forms the bulk of my electorate, family incomes are not as high as in other parts of Sydney, so there is a need for public sector support. The electorate of Werriwa, as I have mentioned, has the highest number of young children in Australia. There to is currently a waiting list for child care of over 2,000, mostly in the noughtto two-yearold sector. There is also a requirement for more out of school hours care. Werriwa has a high proportion of single parents and, as I have mentioned, an unacceptable level of unemployment. The percentage of single parent families as compared with all family types is 13.5. That is the fifth highest percentage of the 147 federal electorates. This shows the need for more occasional child care to be provided. It would make a lot of sense for national child-care programs to take account of these regional circumstances. I draw to the attention of the House one of the problems. I refer the House to the answer to question No. 1247 on the Notice Paper. The minister has responded, in terms of government allocations: ... socio-economic status is not used in arriving at recommendations on areas to be targeted for new places. Places are allocated according to levels of unmet demand in an area. This creates a unique problem in Sydney. Because of expensive land prices on the North Shore, private sector operators have been more likely to provide their services in the western and south-western suburbs of Sydney. Because the government, federal and state, has a criterion for the allocation of operational and capital resources meeting unmet demand, too high a proportion of public support is going to meet the unmet demand on Sydney's North Shore and not enough of it is coming to electorates such as mine. There is a need to build in regional sensitivities and a hard-nosed, rigorous approach to equity with funding formulas based on socio-economic need. Scrap the reliance solely on unmet demand and make sure that the funding formulas address basic needs in our community. I now tum to the question of the planning system. I am not a strong supporter of the planning system. The Australian National Audit Office report 1993-94 made some valid points about the need for competitive neutrality. It stated: the expertise of community-based and private services in providing good quality and cost-effective services should be shared more effectively. Private services and community-based services have more similarities than they have differences in the ways they operate, their user groups, their staff their concern for children. The current divisions between them are quite clearly counter-productive for the development and delivery of quality, costeffective services. With competitive neutrality there would be a diminished requirement for government to undertake planning. In any case it is very hard to effectively central plan a child-care system. Family needs are dynamic. Family needs are changing all the time, as are family values in response to our dynamic industrial relations system, employment, transformation of social values in the 1990s, changes in technology and transport arrangements. So how can a central bureaucracy second-guess family needs? It is much better to use basic pricing and market signals to respond to those family and consumer needs and then for governments to allocate capital and operating subsidies to both public and private providers to fill the gaps left by the private sector. The issue of planning is further reported by the audit report at page 27. It states: The estimate of children requiring Child Care in an individual statistical local area was based on data collected in 1986. The children who were 0-4 at that time are now 8-12. The report goes on at page 22: In most areas, planning data is not made available to private services, even on a usercpays basis, to enable them to locate their services in areas with a high level of assessed needs. I urge the minister to address the futility of central planning and the benefits of a needs based approach. (Time expired)",27
11,Mr RICHARD EVANS,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,"I was a bit reluctant to enter this debate because I was enjoying the speech by the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). I thought his points were very valid and very specific to the whole area of child care. Child care in Australia is, and should be, a growing concern for all members of parliament, particularly those in seats that have a young constituency. The member for Werriwa talked about the values change over the period of a few years and said that the government should be listening more to the service providers and perhaps the parents of children. I just want to reflect upon that for a moand ment. A lot of people get criticised, particularly by people from that side of politics, for the values they try to cling to from the 1960s. Those opposite say that it is dinosaur stuff and we should not be hanging on to the values of the 1960s, and the member for Werriwa mentioned that. I just wonder about the autocratic management style of the 1960s that is quite prevalent in this government at the moment. We have a Prime Minister (Mr Keating), for instance, who is autocratically telling us what is good for the community regarding a number of big picture items. We also have the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), who handles this particular area of child care, autocratically saying that this is right for the community, without having listened to what the community wants or is after. The member for Werriwa stated that he has a high percentage of single parents in his electorate. He said he was showing concern for them and for the unemployed people in his electorate. I must confirm some facts about the Labor Party and some of the myths Labor members are trying to overcome. One in 10 families in Australia has both parents out of work at the moment. Almost 19 per cent of Australian children under 15 live in a family with no breadwinner; that is, approximately 700,000 children in a family with no breadwinner. One-quarter of all Australian families have no working member; that is, almost 1.15 million Australian families do not have a working member. One in eight families is falling below the poverty line. Poverty is increasing in almost every group, except the aged. Over two million Australians now live below the poverty line-a rise of 14 per cent since 1983 when the Labor government came to power. Forty-four per cent of Australia's single parent families live in poverty. I guess a lot of them would be in the member for Werriwa's electorate. I say to him that if he feels so strongly about the government not performing with this legislation he should think about crossing the floor when the vote comes and supporting the case that he has put forward in this chamber. The bottom line is that the Labor government is again proving it has no idea about child care.",31
12,Dr THEOPHANOUS,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,Huh!,32
13,Mr RICHARD EVANS,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,"The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health, as he entered the chamber, scoffed. It does not have any idea about child care. The government has got it wrong. It thinks child care is a work related exercise and a work related expense. It applies child care to any work related issue: if parents are working it is okay for them to get some child care. I remind the House that currently there are two styles of child care being paid. One is the child-care cash rebate which is paid under the health system. The other is the home childcare allowance which is paid under the social welfare system. It is paid to a parent who is looking after children at home. Anyone who says that that is a non-working position obviously is not at home with children. Parents who stay at home with children are considered as being on social welfare, whereas parents who work through choice have their child care treated as a work related expense. There seems to be some inequity about that. There does not seem to be any recognition by this government of parents who choose to stay at home and care for their children at home. They put a lot of emphasis on child care when it comes to work related expenses. It is time that the community and members of parliament took a different and non-political view to this issue that is affecting the community. I will give an example. I was talking recently to a woman who works for two days a week at the Burswood Casino. She works for the casino in a supervisory capacity on weekends. I said, 'What do you do?' She said, 'I work at the casino.' I said, 'Hang on. You told me you worked two days at the casino. How come you say you are working for the casino? Surely for the other five days you are caring for your family and your children.' She said, 'I prefer to say I work for the casino because it saves a lot of trouble trying to explain myself and I have a higher regard for myself if I say that I work.' The previous speaker, the member for Werriwa, mentioned Eva Cox, who won an award recently. We congratulate her for that. I remind the House that Eva Cox is the convener of the Women's Economic Think Tank. She is the social policy analyst and spokeswoman for the New South Wales Women's Electoral Lobby. She recently said on the ABC radio program The World Today: ... the people who benefit from having a woman at home is the man, not the community, not necessarily the children. I mean, it's very nice to have time off with your kids. . . . but it is not something which has any clear public benefit, it's a private benefit, and it ought to be seen as such. Here we have someone in the community who is well regarded for some of the things she says stating that there was no clear benefit in looking after your children at home. The former speaker, the member for Werriwa, said that he did not disagree with that position. I certainly do not disagree with that position. I think those people who take tIie line that child care at home has no benefit at all should not be considered as putting forward a substantial argument. The real answer in child care is to provide choice. People should have the right to choose child-care services whether they care for their children at home or go back to work. This legislation will reduce the opportunity for choice. As the previous speaker, the member for Werriwa, said, this legislation is really a bit draconian in some areas and· it is not regionalised enough. I am not too sure where the seat of the member for Werriwais but a similar seat, the seat of Cook-also an older electorate-has child-care centres closing down through lack of children coming along. It does not need the child-care centres, yet the seat of Werriwa has quite a long waiting list in the zero"" to two-year-old category. I think the whole issue of child care needs review. It seems that we are making bandaid attempts to overcome the growing public disquiet about this issue in the community. I do not think the government has got it right with its policy. It is trying to bandaid a few things. It made policy decisions on the run at the last election, and it has been found out because these measures are ·not working. The bottom line is that it is the welfare of children that we should be concerned aboutnot necessarily the welfare of child-care centres, of those in the child-care industry and of those who are parents. The real issue here is the welfare of children. We should be giving parents the opportunity to make a choice. It does not seem as though many children have been considered in any of the recent legislation about child care. It is my view that one of the results that may come from this legislation is that fees will rise. People ask, 'How come fees will rise when the argument put forward by the government is that more places will be available?' That may be so in some regional centres like Werriwa and Campbelltown but in other areas, such as those in the seat of Cook, where there are current vacancies, child-care centres will need to raise their fees to cover their overheads. I do not know whether the government is listening to those within the industry. Because fees will increase and fewer people may be attending some of these child-care centres; unfortunately there is an opportunity for loss of jobs and maybe centres will have to close. Maybe it is time we started looking at our regional development program when it comes to child care, as suggested by the member for Werriwa. I also believe this legislation will hit low income families. It may be that we are trying to help low income families by making more places available, but if fees increase how will low income families be able to afford the increased fees? One has to consider that. This may be put off in an offhand way by saying, 'Hang on a second. It won't happen that way,' but we. know from other legislation that we do not necessarily give proper consideration to everything and these things do happen. It has been suggested by some members that the legislation is a cynical exercise to save some money· over the next couple of years. I think $151 million will be saved over about the next four years. It may be a budget saving exercise-$2 million will be saved in the next 12 months-but it was interesting to listen to the member for Werriwa suggest how other. savings could be achieved. He predicts that by simply means testing the child-care cash rebate there could be a $40 million saving in 12 months in that particular area. The member also suggested that, by applying a means test to the home child-care allowance, which I am not supporting, based upon the family allowance principles, the total savings would be $200 million each yearmuch more than the $151 million over four years. I believe this debate has shown these measures to be a bit of a cynical exercise. I believe this is just a cost saving exercise. It is a bandaid attempt to try to move into the child-care area. I do not think the government is listening to parents who are in the childcare area, especially those who are choosing to stay at home to look after their children, and it is also not listening to industry people. This is fairly typical of the government's lack of listening in a lot of areas. The member for Werriwa also said that there was not much planning involved in this whole process. I again agree with him. A lot more planning has to be done in this child-care area, because what we are seeing is an approach to child care that does not really take into consideration the children. I will conclude my remarks by talking about the Labor myths about social policy and social welfare. This government says that it is the only government that applies social policy. I think it is actually losing th.is ticular child-care debate, because thIS IS a sleeper issue for it in some areas. I think it will be a sleeper issue for it in the marginal seat areas. Certainly, in a marginal seat like Cowan child care is a very relevant issue. I believe a lot of parents in my electorate are not getting proper consideration from the government with a lot of their child-care issues. I also believe that those who choose to look after their children at home are being ignored and their pleas for consideration are being ignored by the government. I do not believe the government is listening enough to the community when it comes to child care. It is certainly not listening to the industry, to the recommendation the industry is putting forward. This is just another example of dealing with figures. The government always goes for the solution rather than address the problem. It always tries to fix a problem by throwing money at it rather than by going to the actual cause of it. I believe it is time the government showed some direction. It had better do that if it wants to stay in government, because child care is a real sleeper issue in many marginal seats. The bottom line here is the importance to Australia of families and of their future. I read out before the figures on unemployed families. Almost 19 per cent of Australia's children under 15 live in a family with no breadwinner, and 44 per cent of Australia's single parent families live in poverty. This is an issue that has been ignored for too long in Australia. We have to address the needs of our children. Children are the future of our country. For some unknown reason, Australia is not like European countries, which really look after their children. They consider children a huge asset, yet, for some unknown reason, our culture and system seem to neglect children in a lot of areas. One of those important areas is child care. I believe we should be giving more consideration to those parents who choose to look after their children at home. We currently do not do that. We favour too much the parents who choose to move back into the work parforce-and quite rightly so, if they have toin the way we pay the child-care cash rebate. We do not give those families assistance through the health system but pay the home child-care allowance through the social security system. We have to address the care of our children. If the Labor government does not, it will suffer at the next election because most of these child-care areas are in marginal seats. Those who make these policy decisions always seem to be the ones in safe seats and they do not seem to consider marginal seats very much. I look forward to some proper consideration, as suggested by the member for Werriwa, in future child-care issues. I hope the government addresses these child-care issues shortly.",32
14,Mr NEVILLE,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,"In the few minutes available to me before the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) winds up, I would like to add a few thoughts of my own over and above those mentioned by previous speakers. We can firstly get all the cant and humbug out of this. This is not about child care in the strict sense of the word. What the government is doing is trying to limit non-work related child care. This issue has nothing to do with equity, as the parliamentary secretary said in his speech, but has everything to do with the government trying to save $151 million over a four-year period after having created an expectation that it cannot fulfil. Over the period from 1991 to 1993, the number of subsidised places for all service types of child care grew from 168,000 to 208,000, or an increase of 24 per cent. As a result of this trend to part-time care, where more than one child uses a place, 343 children were using these 208 places, and 64 per cent of those received child care. While I accept the priority of access principles that have been outlined by speakers today, this debate has not taken into account that a number of providers have made a large capital investment on the basis of the government's stated policy. Mr Bevis-So we should underwrite their investments?",34
15,Mr NEVILLE,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,"No, because you have created an expectation. Ex-Senator Button, who has been quoted extensively in this debate today, has said that child care is a right not a privilege of all children, and yet this is the government's move. The parliamentary secretary will know that, when these private centres were created, most of this sort of care was being delivered by community based organisations. The chance of the government providing its agenda through this system was quite remote. The government has relied very heavily on private providers to put a framework in place that effectively would take the heat off it. There has been a lot of capital investment in child-care centres in my area. I would like to quote a letter to Senator Crowley which was written by one of my providers, Samantha Hawes, who runs the Pied Piper child-care centres. She states: I write to you todaythis is mid-Juneafter much thought about the proposed Budget initiative of your Government, of the above mentioned topic. That topic is child-care assistance cutbacks. She continues: As a Licensee of a long daycare centre in south east Queensland in the town of Bundaberg. I would like to ask you where your Government and Department has come up with the figures to back your proposals, to cut back the amount of hours to non-working MOTHERS in the community. I run a beautiful new purpose built centre with trained and dedicated staff. If these cutbacks come in I will have to retrench 5 or 6 full time staff as you would be aware, Bundaberg has an extremely high unemployment level. This will only help to increase that, along with the large amount of Mothers who will in tum be forced to register for job search allowance. The Government put it out to the private sector to provide these purpose built facilities to meet the needs of the whole community, not just the two (2) income families you are now aiming at. The Labour Government has put this new proposal out to the community in such a way that they will believe you are increasing, the amount of places to be available to working Mothers. We don't need 31,000 new daycare places. This may have been so at the time of the last census, but things have changed in the three years leading to today. It is my belief that children from a low and some an exceptionally low economic background, need to come to long day care centres so that they may start schooling life on a level playing field along with their peers. A lot of these children come from homes where self-esteem is non existent and facilities are poor and finances pushed. She then goes on in the letter to talk about perhaps having a different income test level and paying a different percentage of the fees that were available to eligible parents. The point I am trying to make here is that, in reducing the number of places that will effectively be at these day care centres, you are altering the entire structure of their economies of scale. Far from solving the problem, you might find in some areas-and the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) touched on regional plans-that day care will increase for those remaining in the centres from up to $3 or $4 per child per day. That becomes quite counterproductive. I recognise from the parliamentary secretary's gesticulations that he wishes to wind up this debate, but I appreciate the opportunity to speak for those centres that have provided a valuable service thus far. I do not think the government has thought through well enough the consequences of its actions.",35
16,Dr THEOPHANOUS,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,"Calwell-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health) (2.40 p.m.)---.:in reply-I thank the members for Goldstein (Dr fully Kemp), Macarthur (Mr Haviland), Lyne (Mr Vaile), Werriwa (Mr Latham) and Hinkler and (Mr Neville) who have spoken in this debate on the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill. Firstly; I will deal with some of the issues raised by the member for Goldstein. The member for Goldstein seems to make all kinds of speeches nowadays on social policy. He not only attacks the government on the specifics but also attacks the government by making claims about poverty and social policy. I remind the House that this is the same honourable gentleman who was one of the stalwarts of the New Right during his academic years and his earlier years in politics. This honourable gentleman proposed the vicious cuts in social programs which have been the hallmark of the Thatcher Right type regime. For this honourable gentleman to then come in here and talk about social policy and welfare is quite unbelievable. I remember that, during his university days and later on, he went out of his way to criticise and attack those in the political spectrum who had different ideas on welfare and those who wanted to protect people in the welfare area. What do we have now? Dr Kemp-The government has been creating more poverty, though.",35
17,Dr THEOPHANOUS,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,"The honourable member parades this claim that there is more poverty in Australia now. He has not bothered, as a former academic, to study the research. You can put that sort of proposition to people who have not studied the matter, but I remind you that I am an expert in this matter and I have written a book on it. If you had studied that book you would not be making these ludicrous assertions. The member for Goldstein tried to claim that we were trying to keep secret certain matters relating to child care simply because those issues were not referred to in the second reading speech. Did the member for Goldstein read the explanatory memorandum? In case he did not read the explanatory memorandum, I will read what it says at the second paragraph. It states: These amendments change the eligibility for Childcare Assistance for occasional care in day child care services to 12 hours per week. So much for the claim that the government was trying to hide the measure. It is in the explanatory memorandum and, obviously, in the bill. I now tum to his claim that the figure of 12 hours is arbitrary and discriminatory. The figure of 12 hours per week was responsibly determined. It is the median of current childcare usage for families with a parent at home. What the members of the opposition who keep repeating these claiins fail to mention is that for some families this measure will mean an increase in subsidised child care. At present, families with a parent at home using Commonwealth funded occasional services are eligible for only four hours of subsidised care. With this change, those families will be entitled to an increase in care of up to 12 hours-that is, an increase from four hours to 12 hours. So much for the claim by the honourable member. This will be of benefit to many women who use occasional care services. The member for Goldstein claims that the government discriminates against women at home. What rubbish. This government brought in the home child-care allowance which makes sure that the primary carer at home has an independent income. We also recognise that while these families choose to care for their children at home full time they do require some child care, particularly for preschoolers. What have we done? We have given an allowance to everyone: we have given an allowance to those people who are working and we have given an allowance to those people who have one parent at home, which we have supplemented in relation to preschool arrangements. That is what we have done. In every case we have looked after people. When we consider that these claims are coming from the Liberal Party, which did nothing for child care in the seven years that it was in government, this is an absurdity. I remind the House of the figures I mentioned previously. Child-care expenditure has increased from $65 million in 1982-83 to an estimated $1.1 billion, or $1,100 million in long 1995-96, under our regime. Yet we hear these ludicrous claims by the member opposite that not enough has been done. As if those opposite would do enough. These are the same people who election after election come in and propose massive cuts to the budget. Those opposite never actually spell out where the massive cuts are going to come from or, if they do bother to do that, as did the former Leader of the Opposition, the Australian people throw them out; they do not want anything to do with it. The reality is that it is a nonsense for those opposite to come in here and criticise our child-care record, which is a proud record which is a marvellous record in terms of increases and real support for people who need child care. If the honourable member for Goldstein is seriously interested in further increases in this area, he should abandon some of his previous economic strategies and talk about how we are going to fund those increases. He should not talk about cutting taxes or preventing taxes that can pay for these services, as those opposite are doing. The government's budget measures will ensure that limited occasional care for famiwork. lies is more equitably spread. So let me just reject that argument from the opposition. Those opposite also claim that there is little demand for work related care. We have had an amazing array of arguments on this issue from those opposite. On the one hand, they say, 'Yes, there are significant demands nationally; there's an undersupply of childto care positions.' On the other hand, the get that benefit. member for Goldstein says, 'Hundreds of child-care centres are closing because they don't have enough demand.' I challenge you to produce the figures to back up your claim that hundreds of centres are closing. That a nonsense; that is a false claim. is that there may be some areas where there is an oversupply but, in general terms, there is still a significant demand. This government is the only government that has tried to meet that demand in a proper and responsible bill, fashion. Those opposite have presented arguments about child-care centres. There may be some specific child-care centres in which there are problems. Why do you not bring ic problems to the attention of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Laware rence) instead of coming into this House trying to pretend that there is a general problem throughout the nation? When you were talking on the Gold Coast, you said, 'There's an oversupply of child-care places on the Gold Coast, but nationally there's an undersupply.' If there is an undersupply nationally, then why do you claim that hundreds of centres are not able to be maintained? The reality is that you have no facts to back up your claims. But this is typical of and you. Whenever you come into this House, you do not present an argument based on the facts; you present an argument based on your ideological predilections in relation to attacking the governmentMr Charles-That's a big word.",36
18,Dr THEOPHANOUS,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,"You should go and get an education; you might learn what it means. What we need to make clear is that the government's priority is to assist families that require long day care services so that people can work, study, train and look for There is also some occasional care for families with a parent at home. They are the priorities of the government. Those prioritieS are directed precisely to deal with the issue which the member for Goldstein accuses us of not dealing with. Those families that are most disadvantaged and those families that require an additional second income and have go out into the work force will be able to Let me repeat: those poorest families are the ones receiving the benefit. So what is the member for Goldstein talking about when he tries to claim that poorer families are disadis vantaged by these changes? On the contrary, The reality they are advantaged. If we look at factual claims, the member for Lyne, for example, said that the unemployed would suffer under this initiative. He failed to understand that the definition of 'work' in this and in all the child-care bills, includes unemployed people who are looking for work. So his claim that the unemployed would not benefit from these changes is mistaken. This is typical of the kinds of arguments which we those specifget from the opposition. Let me conclude with this. Normally there some opposition members or shadow and ministers, such as the shadow minister for health and human resources, the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), who can discuss and negotiate these changes and who are interested in progressing these matters on a bipartisan basis. I challenge the member for Goldstein to start discussing with me and the ministers ways in which we can get progressive legislation through this House and not have a situation""':""'-such as the one we are going to have-where those opposite, for no real reason, will call for a division and oppose this bill. We reject the arguments of those opposite. Furthermore, we want the Australian people to note that they are opposing an important additional measure in child care. This is not the first time they have opposed child-care measures. However, they then have the cheek to get up and say, 'There's not enough being done in child care.' Without the Australian Labor Party, without the Australian Labor government, particularly if those opposite had been in government, there would be nothing like the availability of child care of the sort we have in this country now. The reality is that those opposite have produced no arguments. This bill ought to be supported by the House. Question put: That the bill be now read a second time The House divided.

25,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They are trying to engage me in conversation.,39
26,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I want to hear your question.,39
27,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will start again then. I will have to.,39

31,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Mayo!,39
32,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will start my question again, Mr Speaker, owing to the rude interjecmilitary tions of the Labor Party. I refer the minister to a statement issued last night by the parliaactivity mentary Left of the Labor Party on French nuclear testing in the Pacific. Will the governSouth ment suspend military cooperation with France except for surveillance, United Nations and humanitarian operations? If not, is it not clear that the government is now totally divided on the issue of French nuclear testing in the Pacific?  Jakarta speech a few weeks ago, really highlight to the Australian people the fact that, with him as foreign affairs spokesman, the other side is not ready to govern this country. There is no division on this side of the House, and that is very, very clear.",39
33,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,39
34,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Those on my left!  it very clear that we are freezing defence contacts with France. As honourable members on both sides of the House may know, the South Pacific Forum delegation to Paris has us and the other countries in this region to put our argument to the French against the resumption of nuclear testing. Regrettably, that has not changed the French government's mind. We are now waiting as government for Senator Evans to return to brief the caucus and also the cabinet on future for consideration of actions. Mr MCGauran-Oh, yes; you can hardly wait.",39
35,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Gippsland!  Mayo seems to think, and this is implicit in what he has said, that defence contacts between Australia and France are so monumental, so huge, that anything we do in this area is going to have an absolutely devastating effect on the French. As a former defence a spokesman, he should know much better. Mr Downer-I am not saying that so why are you assuming that I am?",39
36,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Mayo!  activity goes on between Australia and France. A good deal of that military that goes on between our two countries relates to maritime surveillance in the Pacific. It is not only in this country's interests but also in the interests of those countries in the South Pacific-that will, regrettably, be very badly affected most likely by the French nuclear tests-for that maritime surveillance function to continue. We make no apology for that. There is a range of other measures that the government has embarked upon, the principal one being that defence science cooperation will be frozen. That probably will have some material effect on some French defence science programs. The sum total of what this government is doing on the defence front is realistic. I say again: we are waiting for Senator Evans to return and further consideration will then be given to other possible measures. NA",39
37,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of a parliamentary delegation from Botswana.

38,Mr SNOW,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I ask the Treasurer whether he is aware of criticism that the OECD is an inadequate benchmark for Australia and that a more appropriate comparison is the levels of taxation and expenditure of our major trading partners in the Asia-Pacific. Has the Treasurer subjected this proposition to analysis? What are the implications? Will the government reduce taxation and expenditure levels to the average of our major trading partners in the Asia-Pacific?,40
39,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Eden-Monaro for his question. I have seen comments of the kind he alluded to in his question; they were made by the Leader of the Opposition in his address in this House on the budget. He said that the assertion that public spending and taxation in Australia are low by OECD standards is irrelevant, given the size of our current account problem and our proximity to the Asia-Pacific region, and that our competitors in this regard are the low taxed OECD countries such as the USA and Japan as well as the tigers of Asia. That was a comment by the Leader of the Opposition about low tax. In this way he sought to deflect the very appropriate argument coming from the government that, in the context of a budget which had some tax measures, we still have a very low level of taxation by the levels of OECD countries in general-in fact we are at the very bottom level of OECD countries. The opposition leader is saying that we need to have tax levels which are comparable to those of the USA, Japan and the Asian tigers.",40
40,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, not so. Mr Downer-This is so boring.",40
41,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left!,40
42,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is what you said. The Asian tigers are Hong Kong, the Republic of Korea, Singapore and Taiwan. The average tax to GDP ratio of the USA and Japan and those four Asian tigers is 21 per cent. Japan and the USA are with us, at around 30 per cent-ours was 29.9 per cent for 1994-95but the Asian tigers range from 11 per cent to 20 per cent. Of course they do not have anything like the sort of social infrastructure that we have. The opposition says that we need to have comparability with this group of countries. If they thought this through, it means we would need to reduce the tax to GDP ratio by nine per cent of GDP, to 21 per cent-a cut of about $44 billion. This was said by the Leader of the Opposition in making his formal speech on behalf of the supposedly alternative government in this House in reply to the budget. I find this an extraordinary statement to make. A cut of $44 billion is what he implied. That amount of $44 billion equates to almost the total expenditure on social security and welfare, which is $45 billion. Mr Costello-Why don't they make you deputy, Ralph?",40
43,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Those opposite do not like this. I know they do not like this. They think they can make comments in speeches on the budget, the so-called visionary statements, which they can then walk away from later on and no-one is going to take them up on them. The fact is that they are being taken up on this point. It shows how ill thought out the opposition's position is. We are told by the Leader of the National Party, who seems not to be here today, that they have a bucket full of fully costed policies. If this is indicative of what is in the bucket, you can imagine what the rest of the contents are like-absolute rubbish! Alternatively, this is the so-called visionary factor that Senator Macdonald was talking aboutthe one which you make and then walk away from. What we have had from the opposition is an absolute triumph of rhetoric over substance. What we need from the opposition is some evidence that it actually has some substantive policies and not the sort of rubbish that we get from the Leader of the Opposition suggesting that we ought to be cutting taxes by $44 billion. What an absurd and ridiculous position. It shows that they have no thought out policies and that this bucket full of fully costed policies is just like the visionary statements-a total mirage. Nuclear Testing in the Pacific",40
44,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Leader of the House. I refer the minister to a statement issued last night by the parliamentary Left of the Australian Labor Party on French nuclear testing in the Pacific. Is the government considering recalling the Australian Ambassador to France for consultations? Will the government initiate debate in the United Nations on the subject of French nuclear testing? If not, is it not totally clear that the government is now fully divided on the issue of French nuclear testing in the Pacific?",41
45,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am amazed that you would ask me a question about divisions allegedly in the government when the fact of the matter is that in Western Australia, my home state, you cannot keep a single candidate. All the John Howard candidates in Western Australia are running as independents. The whole lot of them are running as independents, except the honourable member for Stirling, who shakes his head, and he is darned lucky to be there, as he well knows himself. He got himself in very early in the piece and got a bit of protection. The rest of them went straight out the back door. One great thing about the parliamentary Left when it comes to matters nuclear, when it comes to nuclear testing and when it comes to nuclear weapons, is that it has an absolutely consistent position-as far as these French nuclear tests are concerned and as far as all other nuclear matters are concerned. I will tell you a not-so-great thing about the parliamentary Left, because it is an imposition upon it. Right through the time it has held those views, you have persistently argued that it is a fifth column. For the entirety of the time, you have sought to portray the positions it has taken on this testing issue as well as the years have gone by as the product of some sort of fifth column, anti-Western alliance attitude, and you stand condemned for it. I will tell you the other thing about it. Right through the 1980s",41
46,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,41
47,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the House will wait just a moment. I remind all members of the provisions of standing order 55. The Leader of the House has the call.,41
48,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Right through the 1980s when the Left, and indeed the entire Labor Party, took that view, you opposed us right down the line, on every issue we put forward-the South Pacific nuclear-free zone, comprehensive test bans. You were out there casting doubt, like some sort of Greek chorus in the background: 'Oh, disaster will result from all of this if you adopt these positions.' You get up now to try to cover your own response in this regard and say, 'Of course, the circumstances were different then.' Let me tell you: the circumstances were never different as far as French nuclear weapons are concerned. They were never part of the NATO position. They were never part of the Western alliance nuclear weapons system. The whole point of a force de frappe was not to be part of it. Nevertheless, your position right through that period of time, which you have so conveniently forgotten with your 24-hour memories on these issues, was one of opposition. If it is your earnest desire to join the parliamentary Left of the Labor Party, I am afraid that it is going to have a bit of a at your record and I don't think you are going to be in. As far as the rest of the question is concerned, as the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel made absolutely clear to you, the foreign minister is returning from putting the position of the South Pacific Forum to the French on this matter and the government will give further consideration to his report when it is received. Mr Downer-The purring pussy cat. Mr MCGauran-Give him some milk when he arrives.",41
49,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the member for Gippsland continues to interject, he can have the time off to go and meet him,",42
50,Mr ROBERT BROWN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts. To a very large extent, Australians have become accustomed to good news evidence of Australia's investment competitive position overseas, but could you advise the House of some of the overseas investment activity of Australia's Telstra Corporation and, particularly, any recent developments concerning that investment activity in Indonesia?",42
51,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Charlton for his continuing interest in matters dealing with the arts and communications. I am very pleased to be able to tell House that Telstra has, as a member of a consortium, been successful in bidding for the right to build and operate telephone networks in central Java, which was the most sought after of the five regional opportunities that were opened up by the Indonesian government. When the Labor government decided earlier this decade to introduce competition here at home in telecommunications we were very keen to see Telstra, or Telecom as we used to know it, stake out a position in the region, to look for investment opportunities Indonesia and other countries. Mr Downer-In Vietnam.",42
52,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In Vietnam where it has been look very successful since 1986. The reason we were encouraging the company to invest in countries in the region'is that we believe that investments by Telstra would lay the foundation for future dividend streams that generate foreign exchange earnings for Australia. The reason why we have been encouraging Telstra to look at the region is that the World Bank has estimated that if you just look at the investment between now and the end of the decade in switching and transmission of this industry, the World Bank estimates that this business is worth $170 billion between now and the end of the decade. So we think there are tremendous opportunities. We are very pleased that Telstra, as part of the MGTI consortium, has been successful in this particular region, in central Java. The population covered by this region Telstra extends to 33 million Indonesians. In this region at the moment only one in 100 people has a telephone in their home compared with Australia where 49 in 100 people have telephones in their homes. That is why we think this region offers tremendous opportunity. It has a high population, great economic growth and great opportunities for generating export earnings for Australia in years to come. Not only is Telstra involved in Indonesia and Vietnam, but later this month Telstra will commission its digital mobile network in Calcutta. I had the privilege a few weeks ago to open Telstra's new office in Beijing where all it already has a memorandum of understanding with a company known as China Unicom, the which has the exclusive right from the Chinese government to compete with the ministry of post and telecommunications in China. Australia in the last 100 years has built nine million telephone lines throughout the whole of the country whereas in China last year alone 19 million new telephone lines were installed. So you can see the tremendous opportunities that are in other regions. It is not just in developing these networks where there are opportunities. We have been very pleased with the export performance of in the communications equipment manufacturers. We have 13,000 Australians already working in this industry . We have seen exports grow from $50 million a year a decade ago to $850 million a year at the moment. It is great to see companies such as Siemens which recently got an order for $245 million for developing digital switching equipment and Alcatel which has recently signed a contract worth almost $50 million to supply and install the new under sea fibre optic link between Jakarta and Surabaja. By introducing domestic competition, by encouraging more competition at home, we have encouraged Telstra to improve its efficiency, to look for investment opportunities in Asia, and we have seen the export of equipment grow from $50 million to $850 million. But if you look at this tremendous performance by the equipment manufacturers and by Telstra in Australia, you have to ask yourself what happens if the Leader of the Opposition has his way and sells off Telstra. If the Leader of the Opposition has his way and Telstra is in large part owned by foreign telephone companies, you have to ask the question of how much interest Telstra will be allowed to have in Asia and how much interest will our equipment manufacturers be able to have, following on the tails of Telstra into the region. You have to ask the question whether or not Telstra will be allowed to grow into that telecommunications hub that can offer Australia those export opportunities in future times. That is the reason why this government remains committed to these aims, and that is why we will stand by them.",42
53,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Tell us about the Commonwealth Bank.,43
54,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I just say to the member for O'Connor that I got through the whole of yesterday without referring to him. I suppose it was because he wasn't here. I would like to keep the record intact. Current Account Deficit: Interest Rates,43
55,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. I refer him to today's release of the merchandise imports figures for May, which showed a rise of five per cent to the highest level ever recorded. Given that eight of the last nine monthly current account deficits have been over $2 billion and given today's record figure, do you still assert that official rates may fall in the near future? Are interest rates more or less likely to fall while the level of imports and the current account deficit continue to skyrocket to new highs every month?",43
56,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Let me say firstly that expressed concerns by the opposition about either interest rates or the current account are totally hypocritical. They have the opportunity in this parliament to assist the government to take the pressure off interest rates and the current account by supporting all the measures in the budget. Mr Downer-Your duty is to get interest rates down.,43
57,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Your duty ought to be to assist the economy, my friend. Mr Costello-You have given that duty away for a long time.",43
58,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You are not doing it. What you are doing is trying to sabotage the economy. You are doing it because you are opposing $1.5 billion worth of tax measures, rising to $2.5 billion the subsequent year. If you are , successful in that, that would certainly not be helpful to the government's objective of taking pressure off interest rates or in tackling the current account deficit. You know that to be the case. You stand up here pretending to be concerned about the current account or interest rates. You could not give a damn. You would like to see higher interest rates and a soaring current account outcome. Mr Costello-A continuing trend!",43
59,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is what you would like to see, because you think it would be politically advantageous. We know that is your game. It should be exposed as being your game. The numbers that are out today for imports for May are certainly up, by 4.8 per cent. The biggest element of it is capital goods, which are up by eight per cent. That capital goods increase is something which is of value to the economy because it means that investment is continuing. We are continuing to import capital goods, which will be beneficial to our future investment and to employment in this country. It is also important to note that some of that increase is probably due to the devaluation of the Australian dollar, which is having some impact on import prices. But there is probably also some volume effect in that as well. Nothing in these numbers changes our forecast in terms of the balance of payments for this year. That remains unchanged. It is possible even that we could come in a little below the $27 billion that was in the budget. That is something that I do not want to be seen as forecasting; it is something that is possible, given where we are at the moment with 10 months figures. It is also important to note that, in terms of the outlook for the balance of payments, today's figures, published by the Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, are encouraging. The bureau has updated its forecast for 1995-96 for the value of commodity exports. It now expects that commodity exports, this is rural and mineral commodities, will increase by some 13 per cent in 1995-96, following a gain of only 2.5 per cent in 1994-95. It will be a considerable increase in 1995-96. Mr Anderson-No thanks to you.",43
60,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"For members of the National Party but also for the rest of the House, it is perhaps particularly important to note that the net value of farm production is expected to rise by some 56 per cent in 1995-96, compared with a 33 per cent fall in 1994-95. With the breaking of the drought in most parts of the country, we are looking at a much better outcome in 1995-96. Therefore it is expected that rural exports will improve considerably. These forecasts made by the bureau today are an update on the forecasts previously made available to the government by the bureau in March this year. Then it was expecting the total value of export commodities to increase by some 9.1 per cent in 1995-96. The bureau is now saying that the increase will be 12.9 per cent. We are seeing a considerable enhancement. That bodes wells for the oLltlook for the current account. That does not mean that we do not need to continue to diligently pursue the strategy which was outlined in the budget-a strategy which is there to take the pressure off interest rates and to tackle the current account problem by reducing public sector dissaving. If the opposition was seriously concerned about it, it would be supporting the government and not doing its best to stop us from tackling these two issues'. Superannuation",44
61,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. I ask the Treasurer whether he has seen reports of calls for the government to amend its plans for superannuation. If so, I ask him to offer a response to those calls.",44
62,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have seen some such reports relating to some suggested changes to the superannuation proposals that were outlined by the government in the budget. These suggestions are coming from a group of organisations---consumer, welfare and some women's groups. I must say I found these criticisms and suggestions to be quite disappointing because they ,fail to apparently understand the full importance of what is in the government's proposals. They particularly seem to have scant regard for the importance of improving national savings, which was a key element of what was involved. They also, in suggesting that there is considerable inequity in what we are proposing, I think misunderstand seriously the nature of those proposals. I might briefly allude to those two issues. In relation to savings, of course a key part of the budget was improving national saving's so as to be less relial1:t on foreign savings not just in relation to the budget outcom.e but also in relation to superannuation.· The new m.easures on top of what was already there in terms of the superannuation guarantee we expect to considerably enhance private savings. These new measures are expected to increase savings by one per cent of GDP by the year 2005 and 1.7 per cent by the year 2020. On top of what was already there to make that a four percent increase; these are very substantial improvements to our national savings performance. What is suggested by these groups would mean that tpose savings improvements would simply not be achieved. The suggestion that we should abandon the government contribution and the current tax concessions and have a standard rebate would certainly mean far less money in superannuation funds and a far lesser impact on national savings and would simply change the nature of the way in which we provide concessions for superannuation. It certainly would mean a much less substantive retirement income scheme and far less im-' provement to national savings. Similarly, the proposal to allow people to access their superannuation savings for a host of objectives, including housing but various other things as well, would also punch great holes in the savings objective. That is clearly not something which the government believes is appropriate. If we want to get the benefit improved savings, obviously we have to ensure that what is put away for retirement is in fact put away for retirement and not able to be accessed for these other purposes. Therefore, I think the groups have got it all wrong in relation to savings. In relation to equity, obviously what the government was doing with the government contribution was providing a much more equitable way of delivering the second round of the One Nation tax cuts by providing them in a way which gave benefits to people earning under $21,000, who previously were going to get nothing, providing maximum benefits at the level of around average weekly earnings and providing no benefits at all to high income earners. This is a very considerable improvement in equity of income distribution and also in the way the superannuation system works. In that respect I think the comments of the groups are quite disappointing. These groups also seem to misunderstand the fact that our superannuation scheme is built on top of our continued support for the age pension. No-one is walking away from the age pension. We have improved it in real terms by 12 per cent since we have been in office compared with a 2.3 per cent reduction when the opposition was previously in government. We have also said that we will maintain it at at least 25 per cent of average weekly earnings-a commitment which we adhere to and which has not been made by the opposition. That commitment to the age pension is very important for the community to understand. Nothing that is being done on superannuation involves moving away from maintaining and improving the real value of the pension over time against average weekly earnings. Of course, there are various other ways in which the scheme, as introduced, enhances equity. I will not take up the time of the House going through those. It is disappointing that groups have not seen that the proposals put by the government are there to improve equity, to provide for workers a retirement benefit--even the lowest income earners-by the middle of next century, which will be of equal to their retirement wages. So 100 per cent of their retirement wages will be what they enjoy as they go into retirement. That is a revolution for low income earners-something that they could never possibly have dreamed was going to come to them. In that respect, what is being put forward in the superannuation proposals is of tremendous benefit to low income earners. The government totally repudiates the suggestion that the proposals are inequitable. Housing: Sales Tax  the Treasurer. I remind you of the severe drop in housing finance for April, where the number of dwellings financed fell 5.9 per cent and the financing for construction of dwellings fell a massive 11.8 per cent to be down 42.9 per cent for the year. With the housing industry obviously in serious trouble, will the government now scrap its destructive 12 per cent sales tax on building materials? Why are home buyers and builders being forced to bear the brunt of this worn-out government's economic incompetence?",44
63,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The suggestion that a 12 per cent tax on some building materials is much more damaging than the opposition's proposed 15 per cent tax on all building materials is utterly ludicrous. It is a fact that housing approvals, housing finance approvals and housing commencements are now starting to decline.  ing-42 per cent!",45
64,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Commencements are starting to. The approvals have been going down for some time and the commencements are starting to. Over the last three years, we have been enjoying the biggest boom in housing in this nation's history. When you are building well ahead of underlying demand year after year, there inevitably comes a time when the excess supply in the market means that the rate of construction is going to start to decline. You cannot go on, in any market, producing way over the basic level of demand. Of course, what has been supporting the market to this time has been pent-up demand from past years. Essentially, I think the analysts in the industry regard that pent-up demand as now having been well and truly met and that the industry is now coming back more towards the underlying rate of housing demand, which is determined by the rate of growth of family formation. Something around 140,000 units a year is about that level of underlying demand. We have still had commencements of about 155,000 over the last 12 months. That means that we are still building above the underlying demand. But, given the forewarning of approvals and finance approvals the honourable member referred to in his question, we can expect that level of commencements to continue to come down, because the fundamental economics of the industry are determining that it will come down.  further? Mr Ruddock-How much further?",46
65,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Berowra!,46
66,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the opposition seriously expects the industry to go on year after year continuing to build well above the underlying level of demand, it shows how little it understands the economy. In the recovery from the recession, it was very good that we had the housing industry take off quickly. It was the industry which led us out of the recession back into a substantial growth path. It has continued to support that recovery through the last couple of years. But we cannot expect it to continue at that rate. What is happening now is a return to a rate which is more consistent with the fact that there is excess supply in the market, that the underlying rate of demand is below where the building rates have been, and the industry has to have that shake-out in order to come back to the underlying realities of the marketplace for that industry. That is what is happening, nothing more and nothing less. We have forecast in the budget that we expect some further reduction in the industry in the number of units built in 1995-96, but that will be the stabilising of the industry back to levels accommodating the level of demand. From there on, we can expect it to continue to grow with the growth of the economy. Uniform Evidence Laws",46
67,Mr ADAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Justice and relates to uniform evidence laws. Would the minister advise the present position on the progress towards uniform, or substantially uniform, evidence laws throughout Australia?",46
68,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Lyons very much for his question. All members would be aware that earlier this year the parliament passed what was intended to be model legislation for the development of a common evidence code throughout Australia. At the time of its implementation, it was adopted by the ACT and applied in both Commonwealth proceedings and ACT proceedings. I am very pleased to say that during this month the New South Wales parliament also passed into law mirror legislation. Now we have common rules of evidence which will apply to at least half of the legal proceedings that are initiated throughout Australia. The Commonwealth has played a very substantial role in seeking to obtain agreement towards common approaches in a number of key areas in which the Commonwealth and the states are mutually interested. The premiers and the Prime Minister have announced a commitment to seek common approaches on criminal law by the year 2000. We are now very substantially advanced in the area of evidence law. This is an area which not only has an academic interest but also has a very practical interest because of the cost benefits that will accrue if we can obtain a single system of rules which apply across all jurisdictions. Just one example is that at the moment businesses are required to keep very substantial paper records. That is because the older common law systems-which firstly evolved from an unwritten form and have been codified in different ways in different states for the hearsay rule and the like with respect to admission of documentary evidence-vary so much. There is quite a lot of complexity particularly for businesses having work across all jurisdictions. There is a real prospect that with the ces that are made in the Commonwealth model legislation, which provides largely for the electronic storage of documents and the admissibility of evidence of electronic document keeping, millions and millions of dollars could be saved around this country by that one step alone. There are real opportunities in a whole range of areas simply through the efficiencies of the court processes to save clients and lawyers many more millions of dollars. . That is one of the key initiatives behind the Justice Statement that the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General and I launched last month. It is an initiative which would have the broad support across all members of this parliament to get us towards simpler, cheaper and more effective processes, which would mean that the Court systems did not chew up unnecessary dollars. In conclusion, I urge groups like the Business Council of Australia and other business groups to work with their law societies and with other interested parties and to meet with the state governments that have not yet adopted the scheme to encourage them to do so. I know that Jeff Shaw will be joining me and the Attorney-General in urging all other states to implement mirror legislation in those other jurisdictions at the next meeting of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General in Perth, which comes up later this month or early next month. There are real opportunities for us to make substantial advances. I thank the member very much for that question because we do stand on the threshold of being able to implement that agreement, which has really transcended politics. I would commend in this regard the very quick response of the Attorney-General of New South Wales, Jeff Shaw, but it would be churlish of me not to recognise the groundwork that was done by his predecessor, John Hannaford, in the former Liberal administration. Commonwealth Bank of Australia: Pensioner Services",46
69,Mr TRUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Treasurer. Is the Treasurer aware that millions of pensioners who had opened bank accounts advan- with the Commonwealth Bank prior to 1 January 1995 are entitled to free banking services? Will the Treasurer guarantee that these free accounts will continue once the Commonwealth Bank is privati sed?,47
70,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The issue of bank accounts and the charging for them is a matter under review by the Prices Surveillance Authority at the present time.,47
71,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This is free.,47
72,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is a quite relevant fact. That report will be made available to the government by the end of this month. It is the case that monthly charges and transactional charges are issues of some concern in the community and for that reason the government proposed this review by the Prices Surveillance Authority. In relation to banks introducing charges, which they have increasingly done over the last two or three years, it is true that the Commonwealth Bank has been part of that process. These decisions are made by the banks as commercial entities separate from the government. Decisions about charges are made by the banks not by the government. Mr Costello-So the answer is no guarantee.",47
73,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,47
74,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The charges made by banks involve various levels of concessions and those concessions differ among the various banking groups. I think it is true to say that the Commonwealth Bank has the most generous array of accounts with freedom from charges, particularly in relation to existing pensioners who have freedom from any charges. Whether or not that continues is essentially a matter for the commercial judgment of the Commonwealth Bank. In the context of the government having shown its concern about this issue by the establishment of a review by the Prices Surveillance Authority and with the report coming to us in the next couple of weeks, obviously we will be required to make a response. We shall do so in a way that will represent fully to the community our concern to ensure that people who are perhaps seen as the most disadvantaged in the community have the least burden to wear in terms of charges by banks. Beyond that I cannot take the question any further at this stage. Taxation Returns",47
75,Mr HARRY WOODS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Assistant Treasurer. Can the Assistant Treasurer inform the House of the steps the Australian Taxation Office is taking to make it easier for ordinary taxpayers to make their tax returns and to get speedy returns?,48
76,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Page for his question. I can tell him and the House that this year's Tax Pack has been updated, after wide community consultation, to make it more user friendly for the three million taxpayers who fill in their own returns. Tax Pack '95 uses fewer words-about one-third less-it has a more readable layout, the detail which is not needed by everyone has been cut out, it is much less complex, it is better organised, the cross-references have been cut in half and it is still colour coded. Mr Costello-George likes the colours.",48
77,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left!,48
78,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This might help the opposition. We have put the questions in numerical order this year. In addition to the Tax Pack, the tax office has a list of 15 occupational rulings to give detailed guidance to people on what they may claim as deductions. Taxpayers can gel these rulings by ringing a toll-free number which is listed in the Tax Pack. As well as the occupational rulings, some small business publications will be posted out free to people if they phone this number. They will get these publications within four working days. The tax office will still maintain an extended inquiry service, but the addition of the tollfree number will siphon off many routine calls. So you will be able to get through to the inquiry service much easier this year. The tax office is also working with ethnic community organisations to get information to communities in their own language. In fact, this year tax information is available in 25 different languages and special kits will be available in 15 languages. This year we are also piloting a new program which will enable special tax officers to work with remote Aboriginal and Islander communities in northern Queensland and the Northern Territory. As well as that, the free tax help service will be run again with specially trained volunteers in the community available to help people fill in their tax returns. In answer to the last part of the question, taxpayers are already guaranteed a fast turnaround if they lodge their tax returns electronically. In fact, they will get them back within 14 days. This year the process will be even faster because the tax office will offer to lodge refunds directly into taxpayers' bank accounts. That will avoid postal and cheque clearing delays so that the money is available to taxpayers that much sooner. Marks Royal Commission",48
79,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Human Services and Health. As minister responsible to this parliament for human services and health and for the integrity of your administration past and present, why do you not have the courage to appear before the Marks royal commission and tell the truth without using delaying legal tactics paid for by the Australian taxpayer?",48
80,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It took all of 45 minutes for them to devise that question in consultation with other members who have been here for some time. It is really the most extraordinary question in any case, given the fact that the Premier of Western Australia, one of your colleagues and presumably someone whom you purport to admire and emulate, has called a royal commission which is clearly unlawful. We intend to challenge on that basis. This is a royal commission that has been called",48
81,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,49
82,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left! The minister will wait. The member for Chisholm has asked a serious question. The minister is responding and she will be heard in silence.,49
83,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It may suit members opposite to shout and yell. That has been characteristic of them, including the Premier of Western Australia, in this matter. What I am advised he has done is to abuse executive power. It is ironic that he has chosen to title opponents. this royal commission an investigation into executive power. What he has done quite directly is to cut across the privileges of parliament. That is why the member was having such difficulty framing the question. Mrs Bishop-What have you got to hide?",49
84,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Mackellar!,49
85,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If they had any interest in the parliament being free of the executive, they would be supporting this challenge. I have made it very clear today and on other occasions that I am happy to answer any questions. Indeed, I have been the one person who has been happy to answer those questions in the public arena. It has been much more interesting to watch the performance of Mr Court in the Western Australian parliament when some of these questions have been put to him. He has not answered them; he cannot answer them. It is very embarrassing for him. This is an abuse of power by the Western Australian Premier. If it were to be repeated in other parliaments around this country, we would have seen an extraordinary precedent. It is very important for me as a member of this parliament and for· members of other parliaments to ask: is it proper for the executive to seek to intimidate members of parliament by use of a royal commission? That is the question at issue here. As I have indicated, I am more than happy to answer any questions. This is a royal commission which the it Premier has called. He says it will cost between $1 million and $1 - million. That clearly will not be the case if he chooses to let it run its course in the way proposed. You are talking about a personal vendetta costing the people of Western Australia $4 million to $5 million at least. At least by exercising this challenge at this time there is some capacity to save those funds being wasted. This has never been about any matter of illegality; it has never been about maladministration. It has been about Premier Court's desire to use a royal commission to attempt to destroy his political",49
86,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,49
87,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"But I can assure him, the people of this parliament and the people of Australia that that will not occur. I am more than happy at any stage to answer any questions, as I say, unlike Mr Court who, every time these matters are raised in the parliament, ducks his head. He is an embarrassment-he is an embarrassment to his party. Mr Downer-This is the federal parliament; this is Canberra.",49
88,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We see examples of that in this place today. We have a member sitting on the back bench here who has actually moved from your party to an Independent position. Why? Is it because his leader could not support him against those forces, represented by Premier Court, in Western Australia. I notice with some interest that the member for Moore, who is going to run as an Independent, expressed the point of view yesterday that one of the things that would help him as an Independent was the poor standing of Richard Court in Western Australia. Mr Speaker, I can tell you that this issue, amongst others, has blown right up in his face. The people of Western Australia recognise it for what it is. They have watched while this same Premier-the one whose influence will see Mr Filing perhaps in serious contention as an Independent for the seat of Moore at the next election, the one who was called to account by the business community for unnecessarily precipitating a waterfront dispute worth· some $50 million at least to Western Australian exporters-bumbling into that. He has the teachers offside; he has the police offside; the work force in Western Australia is in revolt because of its poor management. This is the Premier whom you would seek to support. The people of Western Australia, as Mr Filing recognises, have got his measure-and so have I. National Forest Policy",49
89,Mr CUNNINGHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I address my question to the Minister for Resources. Is the minister aware of recent claiins that in three years you can phase out logging from native forests in favour of plantations? Can the minister inform the House whether a phaseout can be achieved this quickly?,50
90,Mr BEDDALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for MCMillan for his question and note his keen interest in the sustainable timber industry and particularly those people employed in it. As the member for MCMillan is aware, under the national forest policy statement, the Commonwealth, state and territory governments have agreed to policies aimed at achieving sustainable management of our forests and the development of Australia's forests and forest industries. It clearly provides for an increased role for plantations. Regional forest agreements will provide the long-term basis for protecting forest conservation values as well as securing access to forest resources for industries. Once an RFA process is finalised and the comprehensive, adequate and representative of the reserve system is set in place, the end result will be provision for securing access to forest resources for industry as well as the protection of environment, heritage and cultural values. As most members are aware, an extra $53 million was announced in the budget for comprehensive regional assessments this year as well as $18Y2 million for last year. The national forest policy statement makes one vital point clear: logging in some native forests will continue. I know the NFPS's position of continuing logging in some native forests is at odds with the desire of some in the community. Some argue that we can and should replace wood from native forests totally with wood from plantations. Plantations already supply large amounts of wood to industry and this will increase substantially over the next decade.",50
91,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Are you reading this?,50
92,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Fisher!,50
93,Mr BEDDALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Plantations will provide the main basis for industry expansion. In turn, this will mean investment in jobs and a better trade picture. It is a development I am giving strong support to, and the government is taking steps to encourage more plantations to help meet growing demands for wood and paper. Already we have seen success in two programs in my own portfolio. We have spent some $12 million on the community rainforest . reafforestation program and the farm forestry program. The community rainforest reafforestation program is one that all members should become acquainted with. North Queensland is the only place in the world where we are actually replanting rainforest. By movement to plantations though it does not follow that we should close down the native hardwood sector of the industry. The argument for a total transition from native forest to plantation assumes that wood production in native forests cannot be carried out on an ecologically sustainable basis. I do not support this assumption and neither do others. For example, the Resource Assessment Commission concluded that stopping wood production in native forests was not justified. The quick transition argument also skates over the fact that there are differences between the hardwood and softwood sectors. Softwood cannot replace hardwood for uses such as fine furniture, dressed structural beams, wall panelling and veneers. In addition, softwood cannot be used for fine paper production. Even if softwoods could substitute for high value uses of hardwoods, there is not sufficient plantation resource at present to replace the resource from native forests. In any event, shutting down the native hardwood industry here would only increase pressure on hardwood forest resources in other countries, particularly rainforests. Australia needs to reduce its current trade imbalance with forest products. We need encourage greater value adding in Australia for the future. This involves a combination of sustainably managed native forests and plantations. Poverty: Queensland",50
94,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Leader of the House. While we wish well in his quest for the deputy prime ministership, I am sure that he would have felt a moment of nostalgia when he thought of the Prime Minister being at Port Douglas just before he is banned from Queensland the state election. Is the Leader of the House aware that the Queensland Council of Social Service report, which was issued last week Archbishop Hollingworth, found that 350,000 Queenslanders are now living below the poverty line? Is it a fact that church and welfare leaders in that state have targeted flawed state and federal government welfare programs as being the reason why Queensland is the most poverty stricken state in the nation? Did the findings include the claim that too much money was being spent on since short-term solutions to poverty rather than targeting those most in need? What action will be taken to rectify this in this election climate?",51
95,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The first thing we need to do is set the record absolutely straight-if indeed the record needs to be set straight-to the gentleman concerned in relation to the government's policies in dealing with issues of poverty in this community. The people in Queensland benefit from the same policies the rest of the country benefits from. What has been made absolutely clear in numerous discussions in this parliament is that this government has put in place a social net which has ensured that the poor have been protected and their interests advanced. There is absolutely no question about that. . In the last decade when deregulatory poliCIes have opened up our economies for competition right throughout what from time to time has been described as the AngloCeltic world, the situation in most countries which we like to compare ourselves with has effectively been that the poor have got poorer as the wealthier have got wealthier. That has to not applied here. It has not applied here because that social safety net has been put in place. That social safety net has seen support for - he poor in our community in some categories Increase by close to 100 per cent in real terms since we have been in office. If you cared to look at any index or social payment from the him period when your party was in office and when you were a minister-you have probably forgotten the time when you were a minister because it was so long ago, although you have trawled around trying to get yourfor self back into government-you would see that virtually everyone of them has seen a fall. Every one of those indexes has seen real by increases since we have been in office. The fact of the matter is that the poor and needy in our community have been very well the supported. The same applies in Queensland as applies anywhere else in the country . We are left however to conclude what the fate of the poor would be. The opposition certainly owes an explanation to the people in Queensland, it wants to make this an election issue after putting it in an election context. What policies are you going to pursue? You have said that you will not support the revenue measures in this budget, and you are doing your level best to defeat them, no matter what the implications are. You have said, 'We will do it all with savings. We will do it all by ripping away the basis of the social safety net, because there is no other way it can be done.' I suggest that you ring as Archbishop Hollingworth and explain to him exactly what it is that you intend to take from the poor and needy in the Queensland community in pursuit of the savings objectives safety that you have put in place. I was delighted to see that, when the Treasurer was up here answering a question on taxation levels and pointing out that it would take a $44 billion cut for us to produce a taxation level equivalent to Hong Kong's, you were nodding in approval. You must have been thinking, 'Absolutely. That is what you ought to be up to.' The figure of $44 billion was pointed out to you as being what could be obtained by cutting away the total of our social security spending. That is what you have in mind. So opposition members should not cynically get up here and tell us about the rich and the poor in Queensland. What we have been putting in place for the poor and needy in Queenslandand everyone else in this country-is a social safety net which sustains a reasonable life for those people. Syd Einfeld Prize",51
96,Ms DEAHM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Consumer Affairs. The House yesterday recognised the death of a magnificent Australian, Syd Einfeld. Earlier this the minister asked federal members of parliament to nominate a person or organisation for this year's Syd Einfeld Active Consumer Award. Can the minister inform the House on progress on this initiative?",52
97,Ms MCHUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Macquarie for her question. I think the House will be very interested to know that, earlier today, I did announce this year's winner of the Syd Einfeld Active Consumer Award. I instituted this award some years ago in recognition of the work of this extraordinary Australian. He was one of the most passionate advocates for consumers' rights in Australia's history-indeed, he was an advocate for all Australians' rights. Television coverage a couple of nights ago showed him addressing a public rally many years ago against French nuclear testing in the Pacific. He was an advocate for all Australians' rights. He presided over a period of extraordinary reform in New South Wales that affected both industry and consumers. He became the most popular politician in Australia. I was at his funeral yesterday with many hundreds of Australians. I am sure I saw Phyllis Johnson there. She was one of the first winners of the Syd Einfeld Active Consumer Award. This year, the recipient is the Echuca Citizens' Advice/Care Centre in the electorate of the member for Murray.",52
98,Mr LLOYD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Hear, hear!",52
99,Ms MCHUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And the winners are consumers. This is a financial counselling service which is staffed by 20 volunteers in the electorate of the member for Murray. Financial counselling is a very important service recognised by the government in this year's budget. In the Justice Statement, financial counselling has been given a $6.4 million boost in funding over the next four years. I congratulate the Echuca financial counselling service. I hope that the Syd Einfeld Active Consumer Award, recognising the work of this extraordinary man, will last for many years to come.",52
100,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.",52
101,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, I would like to have the indulgence of the House to add my personal tribute to Syd Einfeld. I knew Syd Einfeld for a longer period than I think did many who sit opposite me. Whilst I did not always agree with his politics-and I would not entirely associate myself with everything that the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh) has said about his contribution-I did respect him and like him as a man. I would not like the occasion of his death to go unremarked from this side of the House. NA Marks Royal Commission",52
102,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"-I have a question for you, Mr Speaker. I refer you to the government's announcement of the challenge to the Marks royal commission. Can you inform the House where the funding for this - hallenge will come from? Specifically, will it come from a fund under the control of the parliament-a budget allocation? If not, perhaps it will come from the legal aid budget, designed to help low income Australians. Can you assure the House that the funding for this unusual action will not come from a fund under the control of the parliament?",52
103,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,Why don't you ask the Attorney - General?,52
104,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Because it is under the control of the parliamentary funds, not you.",53
105,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I can say to the honourable member for Chisholm that it certainly will not come from any fund that I administer for the parliament.,53
106,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,Papers are tabled as listed in the schedule circulated to honourable members. Details of the papers will be recorded in the Votes and Proceedings and Hansard. The schedule read as followsEqual Employment Opportunity (Commonwealth Authorities) Act-Equal employment opportunity program-Federal Airports Corporation-Report for 1994.

Maritime College Act-Council of the Australian Maritime College-Report for 1994. Student Assistance Act-Report by Minister for 1994. Telecommunications (Interception) Act-Report for 1993-94. Motion (by Mr Beazley) proposed: That the House take note of the following papers: Maritime College Act-Council of the Australian Maritime College-Report for 1994. Debate (on motion by Mr Reith) adjourned. NA Nuclear Testing in the Pacific,53
107,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The damage caused to Australia's national interest by deep divisions in the government over French nuclear testing. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",53
108,Mr DOWNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We have had over the last week a really quite extraordinary display from the Labor Party on the very important issue of French nuclear testing in the Pacific. It is quite extraordinary because this issue has become a major political issue in Australia. It has become a major political issue in Australia for one reasonPAPERS and that is that the people of Australia have one view about French nuclear testing in the Pacific and they expect their government to behave in a strong and defiant way. But the government of Australia has another view, which is that, as far as it is concerned, this is little more than a minor inconvenience. The Labor Party likes to talk from time to time about the issue of strength, but a real test of strength comes in international relations where 18 million Australians look for true leadership from their government. When the national interest of Australians is threatened or challenged, internationally in particular, the people of Australia expect their government to go out and stand up forcefully for that national interest. The fact is that, when the test has come for the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and of course for the discredited Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), the government has failed that test. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has said, we have seen an extraordinary display of jellybacked diplomacy. After the French had made their decision, the government announced that it would freeze any future expansion of defence ties with France. What did that mean? That meant the cancellation of a trip by two defence scientists from Australia to Paris to collaborate with French defence scientists. That is all it meant. Then we had one of the more notorious statements from a man who used to be known as Biggles and should again be known as Biggles-I think we should revive the memory of Biggles-a man who was prepared to get tough with Tasmania when he was the Attorney-General, a man who sent FIll s flying over Tasmania and a man who used the Australian Defence Force to spy on a state of Australia. When it came to French nuclear testing he said, 'Oh, well, it could have been worse.' It is an extraordinary display of a man who, after all these years as the foreign minister, regards diplomacy as little more than some kind of 19th century parlour game where people sit around with powdered wigs and artificial beauty spots on their faces. We have Senator Evans with his goggles, his wig, his beauty spot and make-up sitting there playing some sort of parlour game while the rest of Australia is demanding strong action from what has turned out to be a weak, pusillanimous government. The point of this debate is the extent to which the Labor Party is divided on this issue and the ill feeling there is within the Labor Party over the reaction of Senator Evans and the Prime Minister to French nuclear testing. All I can say is that the whole issue of divisions within the Labor Party is a very serious issue. I noticed the Prime Minister saying yesterday and other people in the Labor Party claiming that, because the coalition moved an amendment to strengthen the Prime Minister's motion moved in the House yesterday, it was somehow undermining Senator Evans's mission to Paris-that somehow, because the coalition had a difference of view with the government on the strength of the Australian protest, that was undermining Senator Evans's effort. But what was really undermining Senator Evans's effort, other than Senator Evans himself, was the division within the Labor Party. What are the French supposed to think when the governing party in Australia is totally divided in its response to French nuclear testing? We had, as I have mentioned already, the Gareth Evans statement that, with eight nuclear devices in Australia's backyard, it could have been worse. But then we had one person who always comes out with the decent truth, the President of the Australian Labor Party, the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), saying that he thought Gareth Evans's remarks were likely to cause concern to Labor Party members. We have, of course, subsequently found that out. The member for Lalor went on to say: There will be a lot of concern within Labor Party branches and no doubt when state conferences are held there will be resolutions passed about Evans's remarks. In other words, the President of the Labor Party has taken the view that the government's response is not good enough. This happened last week, but more recently we have seen that the left wing of the Labor Party has come out and simply savaged the government, savaged Senator Evans and savaged the Prime Minister. I will say more about that in a moment. Suffice it to say that all this squabbling within the Labor Party has been going on while Senator Evans has been entering the gilded halls of Paris to make his fierce, angry representations. I noticed him on the radio this morning in a typical Evans fit of pique. You cannot say anything critical about Senator Evans without him throwing furniture around the room and angrily denouncing people. He was cursing the ABC journalist saying, 'Well, what was I supposed to do to the French foreign minister? Poke out his eye? Punch him in the chestMr Costello-Throw an ashtray at him?",53
109,Mr DOWNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Or, indeed, throw an ashtray at him and send him off as the High Commissioner to Zimbabwe. Remember that story? The reference will be familiar to the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney), who is at the table, because he knows the full story. The fact is that when it came to the meeting, when it came to the whole issue of Senator Evans's representation, he was, as the Leader of the Opposition has said already, a pussy cat. The French foreign minister no doubt stroked Senator Evans and Senator Evans came purring back to Australia. That has been the style of Senator Evans in dealing with this whole issue. The coalition has argued for constructive measures for Australia to take which would be proportional to what the French are doing and would represent, I think very directly, the concerns of the Australian people. The constructive measures that we put forward in the amendments moved by the Leader of the Opposition yesterday are actually supported by many people in the Labor Party, as I will soon point out. For example, the coalition Senator said that Australia should join with New Zealand and suspend military cooperation with France except for surveillance, United Nations and humanitarian activities. But today the Minister for Defence Science and Person government would do this, started talking about something entirely different, as is so often the case. In other words, the government is not prepared to do this, despite the fact that the left wing of the Labor Party last night, after the TV deadlines had passed, issued a press release saying that that was one of the things the federal government should do. The coalition said that the government should cease refuelling all French nonhumanitarian military transit flights. The left wing of the Labor Party, in its statement yesterday, clearly supported that proposition. In other words, a third of the Labor Party supports that proposition. It may be more than a third. I suspect that many people from the Centre Left and the Right support that proposition. The government, though, apparently has rejected that proposition, despite the fact that the overwhelming view of the Australian parliament is that that is the sort of measure that should be taken. The Leader of the Opposition asked that Australia recall its ambassador for consultations to show the depth of our concern. Most people in this parliament agree with that. The government has decided arrogantly to disregard or ignore the views of the parliament and to ignore, quite clearly, the views of the bulk of the caucus in not proceeding with that measure. The point here is very simple: the left wing of the Labor Party has for the first time in a very long time shown just a scintilla of courage in standing up to the government. It is the first time in many years, I have to say, that the Left of the Labor Party has turned out to have anything even remotely sensible to say-I say remotely sensible because when I read the Left's press release I could not help but smile. The second paragraph of the press release stated: President Chirac is clearly a captive of the French military-industrial complex ... Those of you who did tertiary education will remember those guys from the Socialist International standing outside union buildings holding up magazines called Socialist worker which they were trying to sell. They used to be full of expressions like 'French military industrial complex'. It is good to see that fringe of the 1960s is still in operation in the Australian Labor Party today. A lot of propositions put forward by the Left, in terms of responding to French nuclear testing, would be unacceptable to the coalition but, having said that, there are some sensible suggestions amongst some rather less than sensible suggestions. The deeper point is this: the Labor Party is deeply divided over this issue and that makes the conduct of effective diplomacy almost impossible from Australia's point of view. We have to suffer as a result of this I suppose, but the reality is that if one-third of the parliamentary Liberal Party or the coalition put out a press release basically denouncing the policy of the shadow cabinet it would be a massive story. It would be the lead story on every television bulletin and it would be a front-page splash on every national newspaper. I hope the House will not mind my saying so, and I do not really care whether the press gallery minds my saying so, but I have a suspicion that this press release of the Left is not going to get the same sort of coverage as it would get if a similar act of dissent came from our side of politics. That is an interesting reflection of the double standards that operate in the media in this country. Nevertheless, the government is deeply divided on this issue. Mr Costello-Will Lenore write about it?",54
110,Mr DOWNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I'm not going to respond to that. Will Lenore write it? She would if it were a coalition statement. Mr Anderson-You can take that for granted.,55
111,Mr DOWNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, as the deputy leader of the National Party said, you can take that for granted. This press release is interesting in another respect. The press release was put out last night when the Left faction of the Labor Party was meeting. What else was happening at that meeting? Its hero, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe), was telling the Left that he was going to resign. Opposition members-Oh!",55
112,Mr DOWNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, tragic news. The fact is that the Left is losing the position of deputy leadership of the Labor Party and it quite clear the Left knows the succession. So the compensation was that the Left was allowed to put out this press release. That is just about the size of it. That is what happened at that meeting-'Tragic news: we are losing the deputy leadership but at least we can put out a press release flexing issue. our muscles for once, perhaps never to be done again.' The other interesting thing I must hasten to add on the issue of divisions in the Labor Party is the way the resignation of the deputy leader of the Labor Party, Brian Howe, was formally made today. What is significant about today? There are a couple of things that you should note. It is quite obvious that a deal has been to get the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) into that position but, to maximise the opporstatement tunity of that deal succeeding, the announcement of the resignation of the deputy leader, Brian Howe, was made while other rivals were inconvenienced. Senator Evans was press overseas, making it rather hard for him in course of today to be doing a lot of ringing round and getting numbers when he is sitting in first class on a Qantas jet flying back to Australia, suffering no doubt from indigestion after his big dinner with the French. What about the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence)? It is a convenient day for her to run for the deputy leadership-the day that the royal commission into her alleged activities gets under way! She is not ringing around today. She is putting out press releases saying hooray, she has got the taxpayers to pay for her legal costs. She has no time whatever to be ringing around. So the day has been chosen, and chosen fairly carefully. It has been chosen to paper over splits in the Labor Party, but splits which are deeply revealed by the Left's press release last night which undermines Australian diplomacy. (Time expired)",56
113,Mr BILNEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Kingston-Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs) (4.20 p.m.)-That would have to be the one of the worse performances I have ever is heard in this House on a matter of genuine that it will not get seriousness.,56
114,Unknown,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Opposition members interjecting,56
115,Mr BILNEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Here come these buffoons attempting to talk about the inconsistency of the Labor Party on this extremely important If one party has been consistent and true to its principles over many years on the issue of nuclear testing in general, on the issue of disarmament in general and on the issue of nuclear testing in the South Pacific in particular, it has been the Labor Party. That has been true for three decades. That has been true whether we have been in opposition or in government. It has been an effective opposition, as effective as we can make it in the light of the intransigence of the French. The characterisation by the opposition done spokesman on foreign affairs matters, the member for Mayo (Mr Downer), of the by a group within the Labor Party ' as a split or a division undermining and repudiating the government's position could not be more nonsensical. Let us see what this release actually says. Firstly, it comthe mends the government's action. It says: The Government must continue to act decisively. The Australian and New Zealand governments have frozen defence ties with Francethat is quite trueand refused the refuelling of aircraft involved in nuclear testing. That is quite true. Then it goes on: If the protest delegation of Pacific Forum nations led by Senator Gareth Evans is unsuccessful in reversing the decision to resume testing, Australia should consider... Then it goes on to list a number of points which the government will consider and will take into account, as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said in the debate yesterd.ay on the very stem motion that we passed. That list is a long one. In some ways it is quite a constructive list. A number of the points are things which the government has in mind to consider, as I indicated in the debate yesterday. Let us remember that the Labor Party has always been a democratic party, a party in which we tolerate division and in which we tolerate healthy differences of views. That is why I believe we have been so successful in coming up with policies which have met with the approbation of the people whenever we have elections. We take advice not just from within the party but from outside it as well. I want to quote some advice which we did take on this very issue. I will not name the author yet because I want to hold off on that. This is the advice we took: I think it's one of those situations that you've got to keep under review and just as the response today is not necessarily the final response, in some times in these matters what you should do is give an initial response and if that doesn't produce any result, then you might consider a further response and it's never smart in those situations to fire all your shots at once. Who said that? That was said by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) at a doorstop interview in Cairns last Wednesday. He said: ... what you should do is give an initial response and if that doesn't produce any result, then you might consider a further response and it's never smart in those situations to fire all your shots at once. That is precisely what the government is doing. We have given an initial response. That initial response was appropriate to the situation. It was a very active response. It was Australia, as chair of the South Pacific Forum, which organised a delegation to go to Paris. It was Australia, in the person of the Prime Minister, that wrote to and communicated with all the other 14 heads of government of the South Pacific Forum to get their assent to a: form of words to be conveyed to the French Prime Minister. It was Australia that put all those arrangements in train. It was Australia, in the person of Gareth Evans, that led that delegation which called on Monsieur de Charatte last evening European time. We have taken an initial position. We have taken a responsible and stem position. I want to recall a motion which was unanimously passed yesterday by this House. It was marred only by the pettifogging and meretricious position of the opposition trying to grandstand on this issue. I remind the House that the motion moved by the Prime Minister stated: That this House: (1) condemns the decision of the Government of France to resume testing in the South Pacific; (2) calls on the French Government to reverse its decision and not to resume testing; (3) shares the resentment of South Pacific countries at nuclear testing in the South Pacific and endorses the statement condemning the decision issued by the South Pacific Forum; (4) deplores France's decision to breach its 1992 moratorium which had improved relations between France and countries in the region; (5) expresses its outrage that France's decision undennines the outcome of the recent Treaty on the . Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Review and Extension Conference, particularly the commitment made at the Conference that, pending entry into force of the Comprehensive Test Band Treaty (CTBT), the nuclear weapon states should exercise utmost restraint; (6) notes that Australia will do all in its power and urge all other countries to hold France to President Chirac's statement that France would sign a CTBT without reservation in autumn of 1996; and . (7) calls on France to sign and ratify the protocols of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty. The Leader of the Opposition and spokesman on the other side said that every point in that had the opposition's assent. It is good to see that it did because those opposite have not always been as consistent and as forthright in opposing nuclear testing in the South Pacific as they were yesterday. Over the years their position has been shifting It has been swaying. It has been uncertain. I think it is because the opposition has a lingering affection for big guns, for big talk and for big and powerful friends. These things sit very uneasily with the kind of stance the Labor Party has-which has always been to be on the side of those small and almost powerless countries of the South Pacific on whose behalf we spoke then and on whose behalf we speak now. How long ago did the Labor Party begin to speak for those countries? It was the Labor government that took the French to the International Court of Justice in a case which began in 1973 and continued into 1974. As a result of that case-it was a case in which we brought tremendous pressure to bear on the French-the French. walked away from the atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons in the South Pacific and entered into a new phase. What was the stance of opposition members at that time? They were out there saying what a wonderful thing this was. In fact, the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Billy Snedden, said on 9 May 1973 in this House: Under the present circumstances we do not dissent from the Government's action in taking this matter to the International Court of Justice. That was said in this House in 1973 by the Leader of the Opposition at the time the Labor Party was taking the French to the International Court of Justice. What a resounding, enthusiastic endorsement of serious and constructiv- action which the Labor Party then took against the French and which had an immediate and a useful result. The Labor government promoted and sponsored the idea of the South Pacific nuclear-free zone treaty. We have consistently urged the French and other nuclear weapon states to sign the relevant protocols of that treaty. It has been a significant item on the agendas of each meeting of the South Pacific Forum ever since and, in particular, at the last South Pacific Forum in Brisbane chaired by the Prime Minister. What is the attitude of the opposition towards the South Pacific nuclear-free zone treaty? Yesterday there was it howl of outrage and unhappiness from the opposition when its position was stated. But it was the case at the time and it remains so. In 1986 the shadow minister for foreign affairs, the honourable member for Mayo, said:· Why is it necessary to reiterate all these things in the form of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty? The answer is that the raison d'etre of the Treaty-this needs to be understood-is to attack the French and the French involvement at Mumroa, and possibly at a later stage in New Caledonia. So the rationale of the opposition was to attack the French. What was the attitude of the member for Mayo? He said: I have two objections to the Treaty. One is that it is basically an anti-French treaty and little else ... it embarrasses a number of our major allies. Secondly, I think it could be described also as the first stone that has fallen from the edifice which is the Western alliance in our region. Honourable members should notice that the emphasis is on 'the Western alliance' and not 'region'. There was no mention of getting together to support the small countries of the South Pacific; there was just an utter misunderstanding of interests in this part of the world by the opposition. The opposition urges recalling the ambassador from Paris. That is the assumption one has to come to from the statement made by this group within the Labor Party. Let us see what the Leader of the Opposition was saying on the day the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, was speaking in Tokyo. The Leader of the Opposition was doing a pretty good low key impression himself in Cairns. In an interview he said: Any reasonable diplomatic moves and protests which the federal government wants to take will have our full support. He was then asked: Would that go so far as say withdrawing the ambassador from Paris? He answered: Well, I think that's a little premature at this stage. So the gung-ho-ness of the opposition spokesman is a bit Johnny-come-lately in the whole thing. We have to ask how unified the opposition is on this issue-not the Labor Party. The Labor Party-its platform was recently endorsed in Hobart-urges all states in the region to ratify the South Pacific nuclear-free zone treaty and all nuclear weapon states to accede to the protocols of that treaty and to support and assist the Pacific island states in opposing nuclear testing. What does the government propose to do about these other measures which are urged on it from various sources? The foreign minister will be back in the country tomorrow. He will be reporting back to the government and to caucus, and we will have a debate about it. The Prime Minister said in the parliament yesterday that when the government has received that report we will be in touch quickly with our forum colleagues to discuss what regional response we can make to France's failure to respond to the indignation felt throughout the South Pacific. Of all people, this motion comes from the person who would be foreign minister. His record on matters of foreign policy would make a cat laugh. I will single out two or three things he has claimed to have done in his inept and gaffe-prone style, forged in the deserts of central Australia. He claimed to have strongly raised human rights issues when he met a Vietnamese delegation. It turns out that he did not. Mr Downer-You are a liar. That's what you are.",56
116,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Rocher)Order! The honourable member for Mayo!,59
117,Mr BILNEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"When the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) were visiting Indonesia, one of his acolytes gave a speech which was highly critical of that country. I was present when the speech was given. Very shortly afterwards, his leader was forced to distance himself from this speech. His leader was again forced to distance himself from a call from the member for Mayo to send a warship to Mururoa. Is that gunboat diplomacy or is it battleships in the bathtub? This is an embarrassing matter of public importance from an embarrassing foreign affairs spokesman. Let us hope that he never becomes the Minister for Foreign Affairs of this country.",59
118,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I call the honourable member for Groom. Mr Bilney- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I do not know whether you heard the opposition spokesman say across the table, 'You are a liar.' I ask you to ask him to withdraw that comment.",59
119,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The honourable member will withdraw, please. Mr Downer-He is unfit.",59
120,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The honourable member shall not qualify in any way. Mr Chynoweth-I did not hear it.,59
121,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,You do not have to; I do. So just keep quiet. Mr Downer-I withdraw.,59
122,Mr TAYLOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Groom) (4.36 p.m.)Buffoons as we may be, there is one thing that is as certain as day turns to night: on this particular issue there are more fissures in this government than there are in Mururoa Atoll. This government needs to understand three things: firstly, Australian people want less political rhetoric on this issue and more substantive action; secondly, public concern on this issue will last for as long as the half life of radioactive waste, and that is a very long time; and, finally, the motion moved yesterday by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on this matter-I listened to the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) wax lyrical about yesterday'S motion-was more notable for what it did not say than for what it did say. What I mean by that is that there were too many questions left unanswered. It reflected broad community concerns about the wishywashy response of this government and the increasingly vocal elements of its own party factional arrangements. But, of course, whilst it was a commendable first step in the need to condemn the French government, without the opposition's robust amendment-and it was a robust amendment, despite what the minister had to say about it-it was and remains a phoney smokescreen with a lot of hot air and not much substance. To understand the division within the Labor Party, perhaps I should remind the ministersince he was so good on the history of the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) and others-of what happened in 1985 when we had nuclear ships visit New Zealand, and the MX crisis. At that time we found the Left faction of the Labor Party becoming increasingly vocal about its own government in respect of those issues. Mr Chynoweth-Not only the Left.",59
123,Mr TAYLOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It may not only have been the Left, but the Left was particularly vociferous. I also remind the House of what was said yesterday in response to a question I asked the Prime' Minister. I referred the Prime Minister to the announcement last Friday that French ship berthings and aircraft transits through Australia would not be permitted where they were involved in the Pacific nuclear testing program. I asked: Can the Prime Minister confirm that France has complied with Australian Customs cargo clearance formalities on all past transit flights through Cairns, Darwin or Norfolk Island? If not, as some suggest, why not? What are to be the future clearance arrangements to ensure that the government's decision on Friday is unambiguously effective? The Prime Minister, in his usual fashion, said in part: The government, as I said, will be preparing guidelines which will apply to aspects of defence cooperation. These will be developed to the best of the government's ability so as to require of any French authority undertakings about the nature of the cargoes or the nature of their involvement in transiting Australia. I am not aware of whether any such guidelines existed in the 1980s-they may well have-or what the consequences of that application of those guidelines were. But what I am concerned about are the guidelines which apply from here on. The government will be doing as it has said it would do-preparing guidelines which may apply to any transit flights by the French government. What a load of unintelligible Keatingspeak which, wriggle as he might, means absolutely nothing of substance. The Minister for De is sitting at the table, might react to some of that when he responds as well. As a result, last evening I issued a media release. I said: What does the Government propose to do about two French military CASA 235 aircraft expected to refuel tomorrow (Tuesday) in Darwin and Cairns en route to Noumea. I went on to say: Tonight, Australians will want to know: What is the purpose of the flights? Does the Australian Government know what is on board? Will it endeavour to find out? Does it already know about the purpose of these flights? If so, when did it find out? Does it believe what it has been advised by the French authorities? How can tW.s be independently verified? We now have to look at an AAP report of this morning, which states: France cancelled two flights by French military aircraft due to refuel in Darwin and Cairns today, the defence department said today. Unions yesterday placed refuelling and other bans on the two aircraft in protest at the. resumption of French nuclear testing at Mururoa Atoll. A spokesman for Defence Minister Robert Ray said today he received written advice that the flights by the two French air force CASA 235 turboprop transports had been cancelled. He said he did not know why. Last night the spokesman said refuelling for the French aircraft in Cairns was provided commercially under normal circumstances. ""I have not heard that Qantas is going to say no . . . but we will not be providing backup support and we have told the French that. . ""We have been assured by the French the aircraft have nothing to do with the testing."" These bans imposed by unions on the refuelling of two French military aircraft. which were to transit through Australia is an indication of the discontent in Labor ranks. Although the flights were cancelled, it took the resolve of rank and file unioriists, not this government, to send a message to the French government on the issue of nuclear testing in our region. The Prime Minister, I have to say, has remained mute on just how the government plans to enforce its announcement that French aircraft and ships involved in nuclear testing would not be allowed to berth or land in Australia. The Prime Minister should provide some concrete answers to the Australian people on the purposes of French aircraft and ships which use Australian ports, whether the Australian government knows whether they are involved in the nuclear test program, how we know, and whether we can believe what we are told by the French government. I repeat what I said in this place yesterday: France's decision is an abhorrent one. It is a bad one for the people of France and for the world. It is an immoral one so soon after the NPT review and extension conference wherein there was an indefinite extension of that treaty. It is unnecessary and anachronistic in terms of both the raison d'etre for its force de frappe and a post-Cold War situation. It is unduly nationalistic involving a President who wants to pose in terms of his domestic electorate. It has little regard for the international ramifications and the deep sensitivities of other nations, particularly in Australasia and the south-west Pacific region. This government needs to bite the bullet and provide a response of substance which it has not done to date despite the rhetoric of the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, and we will wait to see what he has to say on the issue. Clearly, this is not on the government's agenda at the moment as it melts down in the leadership ranks, and increasingly melts down within its ranks, as a number are deserting a sinking ship. I conclude this debate by suggesting very strongly that this government is very deeply rattled, and it shows.",59
124,Mr CHYNOWETH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," I am not the Minister for Defence Science  cipating in this debate. I am quite certain that if the minister were participating he would give just as good a speech as I am going to give. This matter of public importance is a bit of a joke. It is another attempt by the Liberal Party to neutralise anything we say. I think this is its latest policy. I have noticed that, if a popular issue arises in the lead-up to an election, those opposite jump on the bandwagon. If it was popular to cut your left foot off, I am quite certain they would be into it-and they could really have a connection with the left wing. They will do anything to get onto the bandwagon of popular issues. Since 1983, when I was first elected hereand I did have a sabbatical for a couple of years but I returned in 1993-1I have never heard anything like this from the conservatives of this parliament. I have never heard anything like it because in the past they were probably talking about what they honestly believed. They do not believe what they are saying at the moment. This motion is a charade. All they are trying to do is win over the groups they denigrate year after year. They are trying to soften their image. It just will not work. I remind people of what those opposite have said in the past, which is an important factor. It is not what they are saying now; one should look at their record. People in Victoria did not look at Jeffrey Kennett's record; they just believed what he said at the time-and you can see what is happening to Victoria right now. I would like to remind people of what the shadow minister for foreign affairs, the member for Mayo (Mr Downer), has said. I got my office to search both the weekly and the historic Hansard databases-he made his address in reply on 28 February 1985Mr Downer-I'm glad you're reading my speeches.",61
125,Mr CHYNOWETH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have never read them before, I can assure you. I wanted to find out how many times the honourable member had said the word 'nuclear'. He has mentioned it quite a few times-and I imagine he would have mentioned it, having worked in the department. There was nothing in the Hansard from May 1993 to March 1995. If I am wrong, you can let me know. In the last couple of years he did not use the word 'nuclear' until the last couple of weeks. If you have a look at his recordMr Downer-The Prime Minister has been quoting me from 1985.",61
126,Mr CHYNOWETH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I will go back to 1985. If you had been listening to me instead of hanging your head in shame, you would have heard me say 'May 1993 to March 1995'. Some of the things he has said are quite embarrassing. The Liberal and National parties have never been supportive of any organisation like the People for Nuclear Disarmament, CND or anything like that; they have denigrated them year after year. Those groups were denigrated for any funding they got. As an example, I will quote what the member for Mayo said in the matter of public importance of 26 November 1986. He said: The Labor Party is determined to win their votes back and the way it will do so is simply by buying them. It has used the $3m International Year of Peace program for precisely that purpose. A major beneficiary of peace grants is a group called the People for Nuclear Disarmament, a group which is unashamedly unilateralist, which says it is opposed to the Government's foreign policies, and is ·certainly strongly opposed to the policies of the Opposition and the mainstream view of Australia. He went on to state: Extensive funding was also provided for what is known as the peace bus. That again is a project of the People for Nuclear Disarmament. Further on he stated: The Friends of the Earth favour the closure of the joint facilities in Australia; they call for a nuclear free Pacific; they want to terminate uranium mining; they want to rip up the ANZUS Treatyall things this Government says it does not support, and certainly things the coalition does not support. In the past he has had a go at the campaign against nuclear energy. He has said that it is a tax rort. He has also stated: Taxpayers would be disgusted to learn that they are, in effect, subsidising the activities of groups which are opposed to the Western alliance and which are trying to halt the development of Australia's uranium resources ... He continually opposes organisations that were set up to achieve exactly what he and his party are trying to espouse now. People could see years ago the problems that could result in the nuclear area. The Johnny-comelatelies across the chamber jump on any bandwagon that they think might win them a few votes. The wording of the motion that we are debating today is: The damage caused to Australia's national interest by deep divisions in the Government over French nuclear testing. We have heard speeches from those opposite on how the factions are divided. I am surrounded in this chamber by all the factions. I have a member from the Left, a member from the Right, and the Campbell faction surrounding me. I get the views of all the factions so I can assure the House that we are not divided on this issue. We all share one view and that is to make certain that the French learn a lesson and that they know the opinion of Australian people and that that is brought well and truly home to them. This is the first time that I can recall that the Liberal and National parties have come on board and supported this issue. Mention was made of the MX crisis in 1985. There was no support for those of us who opposed the testing of this particular weapon. I am certain that if people look back through the records at what the Liberal and National Party members have said over the years, they will find no support for the campaign to stop the expansion of the nuclear industry. On the other hand, I have been campaigning against the expansion of that industry since 1983. In 1986, I spoke on the Chernobyl issue. I do not think the opposition made any reference to that. In 1986, I spoke about the benefits of the South Pacific nuclear-free zone. I know that the member for Mayo is against that. He has said many times that he does not believe that it is worthwhile and that it would weaken the Western alliance. That fact is in many of his speeches that I have read today. In 1986, I also spoke about uranium mining. On 31 August 1993, I said in relation to uranium mining and the supply of uranium to France: It is very important to look closely at whom we supply our uranium to. I do not like our supplying it to anyone but we do. However, we should make certain that the safeguards that are put in place are strictly adhered to. Who knows what is happening in France? It is threatening to recommence nuclear testing at Mururoa Atoll. Who is to say that our uranium is not being used there? It was quite a while ago that I raised these concerns. I raised the point that we should outlaw nuclear weapons and that we should take a case to the International Court of Justice. On 10 May 1995-that is, before this issue came to a head-when speaking in the debate on the Weapons of Mass Destruction (Prevention of Proliferation) Bill, I stated: Since this bill was introduced in November 1994 we have had the Oklahoma bombing, the Tokyo gas attack and, in the last few days, there has,been a suggestion that France might resume nuclear testing in the Pacific. Some of the issues that I have raised in this debate I have raised constantly. The federal government has also been raising these issues constantly since it was elected in 1983. Those opposite have jumped on the bandwagon because they think they can see a few votes in it. The people of Australia, and especially those people who have been fighting for this issue over many years, will see through those opposite. You cannot win votes in a couple of weeks by trying to convince people that you have changed your views. You have not changed your views. You will never change your views. Jeff Kennett and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) are the same type of animal.",61

132,Mr DOWNER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The member for Kingston and the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) in his remarks stated that I had received a delegation from Vietnam and after the visit of that delegation I had issued a statement saying that I had raised human rights issues with that delegation. The minister then went on to say that I had not raised human rights issues with that delegation. The statement of the minister is grossly untrue. It is totally untrue. I did raise the issue of human rights with the delegation, including in the presence of the Australian ambassador to Vietnam, Ms Sue Boyd. On a further matter, the minister raised a question of a speech that I made on Australia's relations with Indonesia. He then proceeded to criticise that speech. At the end of that speech-and the minister was present for it-he said that he agreed with every single word of it.",63

136,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the 10th report of the committee for 1995 relating to the Maralinga rehabilitation project, South Australia. Ordered that the report be printed.",64
137,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"by leave-Given recent events and proposed French nuclear tests in the South Pacific, the report which I have just tabled is of timely relevance. At some time scientists will have to undertake a clean-up of Mururoa Atoll in the South Pacific. Between 1953 and 1963 Great Britain conducted several programs of nuclear warhead development trials on the Monte Bello Islands off Western Australia and at Maralinga and Emu in South Australia. Today this would not happen, but at that time it was thought there would be no long-term damage. How wrong this has proven to be. Maralinga is 270 kilometres north-west of Ceduna. Emu is a further 190 kilometres north-east of Maralinga. Detonations of nine nuclear weapons and hundreds of minor trials w-re carried out which dispersed radioactive materials. Former t.est sites are contaminated to various levels with plutonium and other artificially produced isotopes. In 1969 Britain undertook a program of clean-up works called Operation Brumby. The 1985 royal commission into British nuclear tests in Australia concluded that the clean-up was inadequate, was based on wrong assumptions and left the area in a more for any further clean-up. Again, mistakes were made that now have to be rectified. It will be a costly exercise for the Australian taxpayer. The royal commission .recommended· that action should be taken to reduce radioactive contamination to a level suitable for unrestricted habitation by the traditional Aboriginalowners. . A range of rehabilitation options and comparative costs was developed by a technical advisory group. The preferred option-6(c)was used as the basis by the government in negotiations with Great Britain for a substan7 tial contribution to the cost of rehabilitation works. An agreement for an ex gratia payment of £20 million was reached in December 1993. In my personal opinion, that was not enough. As a very important part of its inquiry, the committee inspected the former test sites on the Monte Bello islands off the coast of Western Australia as well as the Maralinga test and trials areas. On our inspections we had experts from Australia and Britain who had been involved in radioactive decontamination worldwide. We also had the benefit of advice from Mr Bruce Church, former assistant manager of environment, safety and health at the Nevac:is test site and currently the consultant to the US government on radioactive decontamination matters. To the fullest extent possible we were well equipped in our deliberations. The committee found that there is a need for remedial action to be undertaken at Maralinga to reduce the radiological hazards at the test sites sufficiently to enable Aboriginot nal traditional land use and transit of the test site area; to reduce and possibly eliminate the need for control and surveillance of the sites; and to remove potential Commonwealth liabilities arising from site contamination. The estimated cost of the proposed work is $104.4 million. A notable feature of the rehabilitation will involve subjecting the burial pits at Taranaki to in situ vitrification. The contents of the pits will be subjected to enormous quantities of electricity which will literally melt the soil and the contents and fuse them into somedifficult state thing resembling glass. Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not want you to be afraid, but for the benefit of honourable members. I have a sample of the finished product. This is the first time a sample of in situ vitrification has been exhibited in this building. To ease any fears honourable members might have, I also have a certificate from the Australian Safeguards Office attesting that the sample is non-radioactive. I will not seek the leave of the House to table this sample because I want to keep it. If honourable members wish to examine this sample of in situ vitrification, they can do so in my office-it is the one that will be glowing. I seek leave to table a copy of the certificate from the Australian Safeguards Office. I do not see anyone from the opposition at the table, but I did check this previo)lsly with the member for Mayo (Mr Downer). Leave granted. , Mr HOLLIS-I thank the House. What we are talking about here is new technology, and it is proposed to conduct trials before the final decision to go ahead is made. The committee has therefore recommended that an independent audit of the trials of material containing plutonium should be undertaken by experts not associated with this project. If the results Of the review indicate that the in situ vitrification process-the product of which I have here and which I have previously referred to--provides encapsulation and mixing of material to prescribed standards, the process can be extended to full-scale treatment of the burial pits at Taranaki. If the results of the in situ vitrification trials are inconclusive or do provide results to prescribed standards, the further direction of the project should of course then be reviewed. Plutonium contaminated soil at Taranaki, Wewak and two other former trial sites will be disposed of in deep trenches adjacent to the contaminated areas. There are numerous other pits which we were assured contain only nominally contaminated debris and soil. These pits will be treated by a variety of methods, ranging from recontouring to total exhumation-the latter requiring full health physics control. The remainder of the pits are to be treated to the extent of tidying up the surface by removal and reburial of exposed debris, or compaction of the debris and restoration of the area. Soil importation will be required at some pits to restore the surface to its natural level. The project is very involved and very expensive. But we cannot walk away; we have to try to restore this land that the British contaminated for us. There was some discussion about the best way of undertaking the remedial work. A number of groups, such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, submitted that it might be more appropriate if all the contaminated soil and other rubbish were stored above ground. The committee concluded however that, based on the evidence, the burial of contaminated soil and other debris appears to be the more appropriate solution compared with above ground storage. The project will require a very strict regime of measures designed to protect the workers undertaking the rehabilitation. The report describes in some detail these measures. The committee has concluded that, based on the evidence presented, these measures appear to be adequate. Maralinga is an example to the world that tests carried out for whatever reason have a cost both to health and to finances, and it is the taxpayer who will eventually have to pay. It is indeed a lesson from which others can learn. The committee members are not experts in this field, but we have thought long about this project. We received advice from experts, both Australian and overseas. We inspected the sites and, on the basis of the evidence, have recommended that the proposed rehabilitation should proceed.",64
138,Mr CLEARY,COMMITTEES,"by leave-As the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) has pointed out, it is rather timely to be launching today this particular report, Rehabilitation project, Maralinga, SA, in the wake of discussion about nuclear tests in the Pacific. I think it is also true that the nuclear tests have solicited a great deal of political opportunism in the parliament. I thought it rather interesting that today the member for Mayo (Mr Downer) made reference to the position on nuclear tests which historically has been taken by the Left. Of course, the member for Mayo, through a reference he made in relation to the 'rhetoric of the Left', chose to ridicule the Left for linking nuclear tests with, I think, the industrial and political regime in France-I cannot remember his exact rhetoric. But the point is: it has been the Left historically that has taken the strongest position on nuclear tests.'Now we find out-and it was found out subsequently, even though people knew it at the time-that the tests at Maralinga, which historically the Left had opposed, were not in Australia's best interests. So it is with the tests in the Pacific. We know that they will not be in the interests of the people of the Pacific. Yes, we made a point about that today-and both sides have claimed to be interested in that particular question. However, when the issues were truly raised, when people in the past raised objections to the use of nuclear energy or the holding of nuclear tests, it was not the Right of the parliament which took the strongest opposition. Therefore, I think it is very appropriate that the member for Throsby should be raising this issue. We should be reflecting truly, unlike the member for Mayo, on the role of the Left in opposing nuclear energy and nuclear tests.",66
139,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I rise to speak in support of the report Rehabilitation project, Maralinga, SA. I believe that it is probably as interesting a referral as we have ever had to the committee. Also, I believe that the inspection and the hearing itself made it quite clear that the committee was dealing with something beyond its own capabilities as far as knowledge was concerned. That is why we relied very heavily on the advice of experts-and they were very impressive, our own Australian experts and also those coming from both the United Kingdom and America. I believe that they did present the case and that there was no trying to confuse the committee. Their evidence, in which we were given options, was very clearly given. When it comes to a situation of trying to deal with a product that has a 24,000-year half life, one wonders in the overall history of mankind whether, with what we are doing today, the trace will be made in future years. But that was one of the assumptions we made-that it was better to be able to trace the linkage of this for the next 24,000 years than to proceed in the manner in which it has been done in the past. Some might have thought this was going to be a typical Brit bash. It was not intended to be. In fact, those who have been to Maralinga would have to give credit to the Brits not only for the layout of the village itself but, more particularly, for the manner in which they used the airport and adjoining roads to collect water for the settlement itself. In this, I believe that there is some residual value in that, once the land goes back to the South Australian government, that area will be used by the area's natives, particularly for its water facilities but more importantly as the surroundings are close to civilisation. The recommendations are certainly important. The chairman, the member for Throsby, has already indicated that the recommendations gave us alternatives to consider. One was that the area should be fenced, with storage above ground. It was then thought it would be in terms of 24,000 years before the time came to replace those fences. Another recommendation was to replace the aboveground storage so that perhaps the cost, the inconvenience and probably the urgency into the future would not be there. The committee considered that burial was the best way around the problem. It is also important to note that we have insisted on an independent audit of the results of the in situ vitrification trials of material containing plutonium. This should be undertaken by committed experts not associated with the project. That gives us some grounds for believing that the whole matter will be taken out of the hands of the contractors and the scientists to make sure that, in its final stage, the project will be safe. If the trial proves inconclusive, we have asked that the direction of the project be reviewed. It is timely, as other speakers have mentioned, that we should be talking about the clean-up of this waste and whether $100 million will do the job or not. One can only wait and see, because there are certain trials associated with it. But it does give us some cause for reflection, and not only in connection with nuclear waste. The committee is now heavily concerned with contamination and the clean-up of all wastage materials. The experience so far is that the cost of the clean-up is probably greater than the initial value of the project. I do not believe that the committee was trying to condemn the British for what they did in the past. It is a matter of an evolving process, and the evolution since 1945 has been slow and uncertain. We hope that in 1995 we have the whole thing right. The manner of the storage and the trials will ensure that we know where the contamination is if it has to be looked at in the future. I would like to pay tribute to the scientists who came before us as witnesses. As I said, they were not trying to gild any lily. They gave it as they saw it and thought it at the time. I believe that their evidence was convincing to the extent that the recommendations have been made. I say also to the people at the Maralinga site-and a few remain in the security forces-that they are doing a great job of securing the area. Until you get there, you do not realise how beautiful that area is. One would hope that in the future the areas will rehabilitate and be a great natural part of Australia. I again thank the chairman, the member for Throsby, who seems to rise to the occasion every time, in spite of the difficulties he had in getting to the site and guiding his group. He did a great job, as did all of those associated with the secretariat. Mr Humphreys-A great traveller.",66
140,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,COMMITTEES,"He is a great traveller. It was lucky that we were able to get the inspection on one of his visits to Australia! I certainly support the committee recommendations and pay tribute again to the witnesses, the secretariat and the members of the committee.",67
141,Mr ANDREW,COMMITTEES,"by leaveThe interest in the proposed· clean-up of Maralinga is shown by the number of members from the Public Works Committee participating in the debate, and it illustrates how significant this project is. I rise to speak as the only South Australian on the committee-and therefore as a South Australian directly interested in this project-and to acknowledge the presence in the chamber of the members for Griffith (Mr Humphreys), Throsby (Mr Hollis) and Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), all of whom are members of the committee and who similarly found this a fascinating project. I must also acknowledge the presence of the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin), in whose electorate Maralinga is located. He was present for both the inspections and the committee hearings. As the chairman said, Maralinga is situated 270 kilometres north-west of Ceduna. One of the test sites, Emu, is a further 190 kilometres from Maralinga. After travelling to these places, you begin to get an impression of the vast distances that characterise that part of Australia and, it is fair to say, the electorate of Grey. The committee, under the chairmanship of the member for Throsby, visited both the Monte Bello Islands and Maralinga in order to become more acquainted with what atomic testing does and what cleaning up an atomic test site is all about. We were accompanied by a number of experts, including people from the Australian Radiation Laboratory, and I found their input to be invaluable. As a South Australian, I was fascinated by the Maralinga project. I had heard about itas every Australian surely must have-but I had never been there before. I found myself in an isolated area and, as the member for Dawson said, a geographically very attractive area. It is an area that is now regularly patrolled by the Commonwealth in order to ensure that people do not unwittingly move into areas that they should be kept out of. While the old Maralinga village is largely dismantled, the old hospital is still there as an administrative and accommodation centre. I would like to pick up some of the comments made by the member for Dawson. I came away from the hearing less critical of the British than when the hearing started. It is quite true, as the member for Throsby said, that the £20 million offered is insufficient and that more ought probably have been negotiated. It is also true to say that the British did not do enough to clean up the site. But I cannot be as critical of the British as I originally was after witnessing the amount of clean-up that had occurred and recalling that much of these tests had occurred between 1953 and 1963 when we did not appreciate the hazard that currently exists and when this particular part of Australia was seen as an area that had not been and would not again be inhabited. The country we were looking at is the country inherited by the Maralinga Tjarutja people. When the British first proposed that it ought be used as a nuclear test site, there was no-one there. It was not a case, as is popularly mentioned, of the Tjarutja people being taken off the site. In fact the people, not surprisingly, had moved south to a mission that was being maintained by Daisy Bates. When the late Len Beadell came over the hill and surveyed this particular stretch of Australia, he thought he had located an area that was unoccupied by human beings. Not surprisingly, when the Brits moved in, they moved in presuming it would never be occupied again and would always be abandoned. I was astonished by the infrastructure that had been brought in and maintained by the British. The most remarkable part of that infrastructure is the airport facility. It is the second largest sealed runway in South Australia. I am told that it was designed entirely by the British, not only for heavy transport aircraft but so that, in that area of South Australia where rainfall is such a rare commodity, all of the rainfall that was possible would be collected off the tarmac to run into a remarkable series of channels into a reservoir to be pumped into galvanised iron and concrete tanks in order to provide a rain water storage. It is of itself quite a remarkable facility. As I said, I left there more reserved in my criticism, having recognised what had been done by the British in an effort to clean up the facility that they recognised they had polluted. While the clean-up was inadequate and the subsequent clean-up that occurred under Operation Brumby in July 1967 was still inadequate-leaving the taxpayers of Australia with a clean-up bill of more than $100 million-it is a little unfair to simply paint the British as having walked away from a difficult situation. I want to make one or two more comments, and I appreciate that I am speaking by leave through the government's generosity. I had not realised until I arrived at Maralinga how careful the British had been to ensure that vehicles that were used in the nuclear test area never travelled into a non-contaminated area. They had a whole fleet of vehicles that were kept simply for maintaining the test area. We were told that 22 land rovers, a road grader and a bulldozer were maintained in the test area. It was recognised that they may have been contaminated and, because of that, they were never allowed to leave the test area and travel to Maralinga village. At the end of the test, a huge trench was dug, and these vehicles were placed in the trench and the trench was filled. To this day, they remain there. Part of the intention of the in situ vitrification referred to by the chairman is to ensure that those vehicles can never be unearthed because they will become part of the molten mass. As the chairman has indicated, the intention is to take anyone of the test sites that is still contaminated by plutonium and dig a huge trench in which to bury the topsoil that is contaminated. Where the contamination is deemed to be of a level that poses a real hazard to human health, the aim is to use in situ vitrification to ensure not that it ceases be radioactive-because the radioactivity will continue even after this glassification has occurred-but that the radioactivity is locked in a molten block, such as the block displayed by the member for Throsby. As such, it will still be radioactive, but it Obviously, we hope that this relatively new technique, which has been proven in the United States, works successfully on the Maralinga site. I conclude by pointing out that the plutonium of course remains there-it remains a hazard-but it will no longer be accessible. The problem that exists right now with handing this site back to the original owners is the characteristic Aboriginal lifestyle which would have children playing in the dust and likely to inhale small particles of plutonium that currently exist in it. The simple reality is that, if one were merely to ingest that plutonium, one would probably not face a real hazard because, like the uncomfortable experience of chemotherapy, the body would react and the plutonium would be expelled from the body. The stomach would say, 'No, thank you very much.' But if one were to inhale the plutonium then it would lodge in the lungs. Anyone suffering that sort of fate would suffer very nasty consequences indeed and very likely would face the reality of dying. As the chairman of the committee has said, there are a number of areas where the British have buried debris-material such as instrumentation and extensive cords and wires. In instances where these areas seemed to be untidy, we were told that they had simply been exhumed by the Radiation Laboratory in order to assess what was in the pits. Clearly, in the past they had not been exhumed. As the report indicates, they will be buried once again and are deemed to be safe. I was impressed with the efforts that were being made by the Australian Radiation Laboratory to ensure that all people engaging in this clean-up will be working in conditions that make worker safety a first priority. It is obvious that, by air conditioning the cabins and by using radiation level monitors in the to cabins, the work force will be exposed to very little hazard. Those are conditions that the rest of us would endorse. It is on the understanding that every possible occupational health and safety instrument will be used that the committee has endorsed this particular cleanwill be inaccessible. up proposal. I have little else to add except that, while I thought the member for Wills (Mr Cleary) can rightly claim to have had a somewhat purer track record on the whole question of disposal of radioactive waste than the rest of us, it is much easier with hindsight to get 20/20 vision. It is fair to say that, when these experiments occurred, what was deemed to be a reasonable clean-up was undertaken. Clearly, in 1995 that is not reasonable. I hope future generations will deem that what the Public Works Committee has decided to allow to proceed will have been a wise decision and will ensure that no further hazard exists for those who will then occupy the land.",68
142,Mr WAKELIN,COMMITTEES,"by leave-As the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) has indicated, Maralinga is in my electorate. It is therefore with gratitude that J acknowledge the opportunity given to me to participate in the hearing and inspections of the site. In particular, I thank the chairman of the Joint Committee on Public Works, the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), and other committee members. The local impact is well covered in the report. There will be employment of 80 people; Maralinga Tjarutja will be involved, and the project should maximise opportunities for employment. The history has been well documented. My main memory will be standing at ground zero, looking at where that first device went off and thinking of the history and the subsequent events that led up to it, and the anecdotes about the very long discussions that preceded it, with people going to London and Archie Barton's involvement. Another memory will be of Dr Keith Lokan from the Australian Radiation Laboratory going around with a geiger counter and showing us the level of plutonium where the winds had allowed that substance to drift which is, of course, the main subject of the clean-up. At the public hearing Archie Barton was not able to be with us because in recent weeks he had undergone open heart surgery. However, Bob Ware, who is an excellent man, was able to give very good evidence on behalf of Maralinga Tjarutja, the local Aboriginal community. The electorate of Grey does seem to have this tendency to be involved with nuclear waste issues. The way this matter has been handled is in some contrast to the temporary storage of nuclear waste at W oomera. I suggest to the government that this committee is a model for the way in which the matter should be handled. I know there are monetary limits and a structure around the Public Works Committee which allows this process to occur, but I was very impressed by the whole process, by the skill of the witnesses and by the impartiality of all players. I pay due credit to the member for Throsby for his part in that. I welcome the fact that there will be an independent audit. I just hope that those sorts of processes will be applied to Woomera in the months and years ahead. NA NA Motion (by Mr Leo MCLeay) agreed to: That the following Bills be referred to the Main Committee for further consideration: Commonwealth Authorities (Australian Capital Territory Pay-roll Tax) Bill 1995, and Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill 1995 NA AMENDMENT BILL 1995 Consideration resumed from 8 March. Second Reading",70
143,Mr SNOWDON,BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (5.57 p;m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill contains a range of major and important reforms to bankruptcy law. It constitutes the second part of the government's program of wholesale reform of the Bankruptcy Act 1966, the first part of which was contained in the Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1991 which came into operation on 1 July 1992. The major reforms contained in that act have been very successful in ensuring that returns to creditors are increased, that appropriate weapons are available to bankruptcy trustees to deal with those who seek to avoid their obligations to disclose assets and contribute from their income and that small consumer debtors are able to get early discharges from their bankruptcy where appropriate. This bill further advances the government's aim of modernising this area of the law and ensuring that an appropriate balance is achieved between the aims of financially rehabilitating debtors and providing proper returns to creditors. The reforms contained in this bill represent the culmination of more than 18 months of careful development and community consultations. The reforms will: provide a 'one-stop service' to the public bankruptcy matters, which will substantially improve the availability and accessibility of information and services about bankruptcy; modernise and make more workable the act's provisions relating to transfers of property prior to bankruptcy; improve the operation of the income contribution scheme, introduced in 1992; streamline, and thus render more economical and workable, part X of the act, which provides for alternatives to bankruptcy; provide a new form of simple, no cost alternative to bankruptcy for low income debtors with few assets and small debts; improve the registration arrangements, duties and powers of trustees; and create an improved national personal insolvency index on a proper statutory basis, subject to scrutiny by the parliament. In the context of this important bill it is opportune to address briefly some of the recent ill-informed criticism of the effectiveness of bankruptcy law. This has included calls for introducing harsh provisions to strip away the wealth of the families of bankrupts, regardless of where and how it was acquired, and to nullify transfers of property made long before bankruptcy, regardless of the circumstances. These calls, if heeded, would result in substantial injustice in a large number of cases. It must be remembered that most bankrupts are ordinary people, small business people or wage and salary earners who have got themselves into financial difficulty for a wide variety of reasons, some of which are beyond their control. For example, some farmers and small business people in rural areas have gone bankrupt because of the drought. Draconian provisions of the kind some are calling for would have an extremely harsh and unjust effect on these people and their families. In our system, the law enables people to set up artificial entities to carry on business, restricts exposure to unlimited liability, and the commercial community relies on the various legal protections conferred on such entities in making investment decisions, in carrying out entrepreneurial activities and contributing to economic growth. Risk taking and speculation are fundamental features of economic activity in our system and, while non-repayment of debts or repayments which are trifling in comparison to the level of indebtedness may be highly undesirable, they are an inevitable incident of ordinary economic activity. The law also enables people to transfer assets and property freely when an individual has no creditors, although subsequent insolvency may result in such transfers of assets or property being set aside, in certain carefully defined circumstances. A rational and orderly insolvency system must concentrate its attention, as this bill does, on defining these circumstances so as to do justice to all, not on arbitrary confiscation. This is why the government is committed to sensible, rational and balanced law reform which promotes the best interest of all Australians and improves their access to the justice system, and the measures in the bill will further those objectives. The policy objectives underlying the many initiatives contained in the bill are dealt with in some detail in section 2 of the explanatory memorandum presented when the bill was given a first reading on 8 March 1995, and I commend that to honourable members. I will confine my remarks to the principal features of the bill. One-stop service The bill proposes the abolition of the offices of Registrar and Deputy Registrar in Bankruptcy, and the distribution of the functions performed by them among the Inspector General in Bankruptcy, the official receivers, trustees and the Federal Court. This will ensure that the public is provided with a much better service, having to deal with one administrative agency in relation to bankruptcy and personal insolvency matters-that is, the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia, ITSA, in the Attorney-General's Department-rather than two agencies, ITSA and the Federal Court, by virtue of the fact that the court's registry staff are the bankruptcy registrars. A number of the functions presently performed by the registrar will, after the commencement of the bill, be carried out by official receivers. These functions include: issuing bankruptcy notices; accepting debtor's petitions; maintaining bankruptcy records, within the framework of the proposed new national personal insolvency index, NPII; administering the prebankruptcy moratorium provisions, under which a debtor who proposes to present a debtor's petition against himself or herself can invoke a seven-day stay period to enable him or her to give consideration to whether he or she should enter an insolvency administration outside bankruptcy; accepting authorities signed by debtors under section 188 to enable the debtor to propose to creditors an administration under part X of the act, namely a deed of assignment, a deed of arrangement or a composition; being the repository for documents required to be filed by registered trustees, such as accounts relating to the administration of estates. The ability of official receivers to accept section 188 authorities will provide a minor but important adjunct to the one-stop service; namely, administering part X arrangements for those for whom they are appropriate but who could not otherwise afford the cost. Revision of antecedent transaction avoidance provisions A fundamental feature of the law of bankruptcy is that, in certain circumstances, it operates to enable property and money given or transferred by a person who subsequently becomes a bankrupt to be recovered by the bankruptcy trustee, to enable its sale and the distribution of the proceeds of the sale to the bankrupt's creditors. The current law provides for a period of 'relation back' and makes specific provision in relation to 'settlements' of property, in section 120, fraudulent transactions, in section 121, and preferential payments or transfers to creditors, in section 122. The proposals in the bill to revise the antecedent transaction avoidance provisions and the income contribution scheme, to which I shall refer later, are in the government's firm view sensible, rational, balanced and will well serve the interests of the Australian community. The terms used in the current antecedent transaction avoidance provisions are somewhat esoteric and full of tautologies. The provisions focus largely on the nature of the transaction being impugned and the intention of the parties to the transaction. The changes proposed to this area of the law will simplify it by changing its focus to the nature of the transactions and the likely effect on the creditors. For example, the bill proposes the replacement of section 120 with a much simplified provision, under which a transfer of property by a person who later becomes a bankrupt is void against the trustee if it took place not earlier than five years before the commencement of the bankruptcy and the transferee gave no consideration, or consideration less than the market value of the property concerned, as at the time of the transfer. If the transfer took place more than two years but not more than five years before the commencement of the bankruptcy, the transfer will be valid against the trustee if the recipient of the property proves that the transferor was not technically insolvent at the time. The term 'technically insolvent' refers to a situation where a person's property and income are insufficient to meet the person's liabilities, including any secured liabilities and potential liabilities under a guarantee for another person. Improving the income contribution scheme The Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1991 made a number of important reforms including, among other things, the introduction of a regime of compulsory contributions from income by bankrupts whose incomes exceed a specified threshold. This regime has been extremely effective in ensuring that those who can afford to do so make some contribution to paying their debts and increasing returns to creditors, but experience has necessitated some improvements to it. The key amendment proposed to the act by the bill in relation to the income contribution scheme established under division 4B of part VI of the act is the revision of the definition of 'income', in particular to overcome the restrictive interpretation placed on it by the Federal Court in the case of Bond v Ramsay 1994, 125 ALR 399. When the income contribution scheme was devised, it was intended to catch the value of gifts, payments of expenses and similar benefits provided to, or on account of, a bankrupt by benefactors, whether or not the bankrupt was employed by, or worked or provided services for, or on behalf of, the benefactor. However, the Federal Court in Bond v Ramsay considered the definition of 'income' was inadequate to enable the value of benefits provided to a bankrupt in other than an employment context to be included. The bill includes amendments to restore the position to what it was believed and intended by the parliament to be prior to the Federal Court decision. Also, the definition of 'income' is to be further expanded so that it will encompass the value of loans given to the bankrupt, whether or not the loans are strictly loans in a legal sense or whether they are advances pursuant to some arrangement or understanding whether or not enforceable at law or in equity. Some bankrupts are given the benefit of so called loan accounts by family or related companies, in the same manner as they may receive non-cash benefits. Again, it is considered reasonable that, where the bankrupt gets a benefit of this kind, it should not be the exclusion of his or her creditors, as such loan facilities are in many cases made available by persons or other entities who have been the recipient of largesse by the bankrupt in earlier times. Entitlement to moneys accumulated in loan accounts can sometimes be regarded as assets, which vest in the trustee. These amendments are designed to ensure that benefits obtained by bankrupts from loan accounts that cannot be characterised as assets forming part of the divisible property of the estate are taken to form part of the bankrupt's income. Income contributions are assessed in relation to contribution assessment periods, CAPs. The first contribution assessment period begins at the commencement of bankruptcy and ends on the anniversary of that date. Subsequent periods last for one year and the final period ends when the bankrupt is discharged or the bankruptcy is annulled. The bill proposes an amendment so that the first CAP in a bankruptcy will begin at the date of the bankruptcy, rather than at its commencement. The commencement of a bankruptcy could be many months before the actual date of bankruptcy, and it has proved difficult in practice to make assessments of income in relation to periods before the bankruptcy begins. Revision of part X of the act by streamlining establishment processes and making meeting procedures align with those in bankruptcy Part X of the act provides for debtors to enter into insolvency administrations outside bankruptcy. In particular, a debtor can enter into a deed of assignment, a deed of arrangement or a composition. The manner in which a part X administration is initiated is provided by a debtor signing an authority under section 188 of the act in favour of a registered trustee or a solicitor. Within 10 days before giving the authority, the debtor must complete a statement of his or her affairs, which is given to the registered trustee or the solicitor. A solicitor's obligation is to call a meeting of the creditors. In the case of a registered trustee, the trustee, as well as having to call a meeting of to the debtor's creditors, must take control of the debtor's property. The debtor is not able to deal with the property without the express authority of the trustee. The control period continues until the creditors resolve to release the debtor's property from control, a deed of assignment or deed of arrangement is executed by the debtor, a composition is accepted by the creditors, the court releases the debtor's property from control, the debtor becomes a bankrupt or the debtor dies, whichever happens first. The bill proposes a number of changes to division 2 of part X. First, the functions of a solicitor and those of a registered trustee will be made the same, that is, both will assume control of the property of the debtor after consenting to exercise the powers conferred by an authority under section 188. The bill also includes provision for the control period to come to an end by operation of law. At present, the control period can continue indefinitely, if creditors do not agree on any part X proposal or release the debtor's property from control, the debtor does not become bankrupt or die, and no person applies to the court for an order releasing the debtor's property from control. In these circumstances, the debtor and the controlling trustee may be exposed to liabilities for offences or costs, and it is appropriate that the period should come to an end without the need for applications to the court or the convening of a meeting of creditors for these purposes. When an authority under section 188 in favour of a registered trustee comes into effect, the trustee is able to deal with the debtor's property as if he or she were the attorney of the debtor, and the debtor is not able to deal with his or her property, except to the extent the trustee authorises. The bill will modify this position so that the coming into effect of an authority will give rise to a statutory charge over the debtor's property, so that the trustee's control over the property is enhanced, and property potentially available to creditors under a possible future part X administration is not dissipated. The provisions dealing with the calling of meetings and procedure at meetings are proposed to be repealed, and the comprehensive provisions of division 5 of part IV of the act, laying down a code of meeting procedure in relation to bankruptcy, is to be made applicable to meetings under part X so that the same set of basic rules about meetings will be applicable in all the forms of administration available under the act. Another important change is that proposed to section 204 of the act. One of the special resolutions that a meeting of creditors called pursuant to section 188 authority can pass is that the debtor present a debtor's petition for bankruptcy within seven days of the passing of the resolution. There are instances where the debtor does not do this, and creditors are then put to the inconvenience and expense of having to bring proceedings against the debtor. Accordingly, the bill proposes that meetings of creditors be able to pass a special resolution that the debtor become bankrupt, and the debtor will become bankrupt by operation of law on the 15th day after the passing of the special resolution, unless the debtor applies to the court for and order setting aside the resolution. If the debtor does apply to the court for an order, the control period will continue until the application is disposed of by the court. If the court dismisses a debtor's application, or the debtor's application lapses or is withdrawn, the debtor will become a bankrupt at the time of the dismissal, withdrawal or lapsing of the application. If the court grants the debtor's application, the special resolution of the creditors will be set aside, and the debtor's property will be released from control. Debt agreements-a new form of insolvency administration Over a number of years, there have been calls for a formal insolvency administration outside bankruptcy and part X that can be availed of by people with low levels of debt, few assets and low incomes who are not able to afford or enter part XS and in respect of whom the comparative formalities of part X and the full rigours of bankruptcy are not necessary or desirable. The bill proposes the insertion of a new part IX into the act which sets up a simple form of insolvency administration to be known as debt agreements. Debtors with levels of liability not exceeding $20,000 will be able to put forward a proposal to creditors for dealing with debts. Proposals might relate to matters such as the payment of less than the full amount of all or any of the debtor's debts, a moratorium on payment, periodic payments out of income or an undertaking to seek financial advice. The debtor would put the proposal to the official trustee, that is, ITSA, which would be responsible for ascertaining whether the proposal was acceptable to the debtor's creditors. This could be done in two ways: either by calling a meeting of the creditors or by sending notice of the proposal to the creditors, and requesting them to indicate by voting letter whether they accept the proposal. Before a proposal can become a debt agreement, it must get the approval of 75 per cent in value and a majority in number of creditors. The same mechanisms will be able to be used to vary and terminate debt agreements. In addition, the bill provides for the termination of a debt agreement by the court, and will empower the court to declare a debt agreement to be void. A debt agreement will otherwise come to an end when the debtor has fulfilled all of his or her obligations under A debt agreement could provide for the debtor to make payments to creditors directly, or for this to be done by some other third party, or perhaps one of the creditors on behalf of the others. A debt agreement will release the debtor from debts which would be provable in bankruptcy as if the debtor had become a bankrupt when the particulars of the agreement are recorded on the national personal insolvency index. The making of a debt agreement will operate to stay legal proceedings for enforcement of debts, other than debts or liabilities arising under a maintenance agreement or maintenance order. Used in conjunction with the existing prebankruptcy moratorium provisions, the government is confident that small debtors will be able to avail themselves of this new, simple and economical form of administration, thus avoiding bankruptcy, its disabilities and stigmas, while at the same time arriving at arrang-ments with creditors likely to result in a better return for them. In addition to these measures, the bill proposes a new system for registration of trustees, a more contemporary statement of the duties of trustees, enhancement of investigative powers of trustees, the creation of a new statutory register of bankruptcy information to be styled on the national personal insolvency index, and related reform measures which will greatly improve the operation of the bankruptcy system to the advantage of those in the Australian community who come into contact with it. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill and commend the bill to the House.",70
144,Mr RUDDOCK,BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION,"Berowra) (6.19 p.m.)The Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 will amend the Bankruptcy Act 1966 and the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 to assist in modernising the law on personal insolvency. The key provisions in the bill include a simplified process for low income, minor bankruptcies, the creation of a one-stop bankruptcy shop and the tightening of provisions dealing with those who divest themselves of property to third parties when facing bankruptcy. Towards the end of 1993 the Minister for it. Justice (Mr Kerr) released three discussion papers on the reform of this act. The papers dealt with administration, property available for the payment of debts, administration of estates and reform of part X of the act. They arose largely out of the Law Reform Commission's general insolvency inquiry. The government did not adopt that report in its entirety. These discussion papers developed the work that had been· done by the Law Reform Commission. Some of these amendments are a result of the papers in order to improve drafting of the act itself. I should foreshadow to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Snowdon) that the opposition will be seeking, because of concerns it has about a number of specific provisions which I will identify during my speech, at a later point in time when the matter is considered at the end of the second reading stage to have the matter referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for inquiry and report. It is a very important proposal and one I would ask the parliamentary secretary and the government to consider. I hope there has been a element of forewarning in relation to this. Our view is that the matters need to be examined in a more open forum. But, as these matters are invariably dealt with in the Senate, and its workload is such that matters of this sort requiring a great deal of consideration can well be delayed, it is our considered view that the government would be, better served if it utilised the services of a committee of this House to undertake that review. I would hope that when this amendment is proposed the government will see fit to adopt it. Turning to the act itself, firstly in relation to the administration of bankruptcy matters, the proposed changes will provide that the Federal Court in the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act will have exclusive jurisdiction in bankruptcy apart from the residual jurisdiction of the High Court. The administration, day-today record keeping and documentation procedures will be handled by one agency. The bill proposes the concept of a one-stop shop with the transfer, of certain administrative functions from the Federal Court to the organisation that administers these matters, ITSA. The office of registrar and deputy registrar in bankruptcy will be abolished and their duties transferred to the official receiver. This would allow the ordinary debtor who files for bankruptcy to deal with ITSA alone and to obtain service by the one Commonwealth agency. It would also avoid the present exchange of documentation between the Federal Court and ITSA and it would reduce the cost involved in duplication. While to have one agency handle bankruptcy matters will be less costly than the current court process, the recent High Court decision in Brandy v. Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission does raise some concerns. While the High Court indicated that it is often difficult to separate judicial and administrative functions apart from the issue of enforceability which is clearly an exercise in judicial power, it is worth commenting that this isa matter which may only be resolved by litigation. I know that the Commonwealth advisers are hesitant to accept that point, but I have seen a great deal of the court's involvement in matters of this sort when people find it necessary to approach it and these arguments are ones in which the court is obviously taking some interest. The Insolvency Practitioners Association of Australia is concerned at the consolidation of power into the hands of I:rSA, as the amendments will further 'concentrate its power. Serious concerns have been raised about ITSA by practitioners who have indicated that in their view it is underperforming. ITSA is also in direct competition with private trustees and can have a conflict of interest between the administration of estates and supervision' of the conduct of private trustees-a concern which has been noted by the Law Council. Moving on to the property and other transactions prior to the bankruptcy amendments to section 120, 121 and 122, the date of bankruptcy is said to commence on the occasion of the first act of pankruptcy within six months before the actual date of presentation of the petition. This means that certain transactions are rendered void against a claim by the trustee. In certain circumstances, some property ,settlements dating back as far as five years can be challenged by the trustee. The law currently looks to the intention of the parties and the nature of the settlements. The bill will make substantial changes to the antecedent transaction provisions by substituting two of the sections and substantially modifying the other, 'These provisions are the cornerstone sections which make certain dispositions of property made by the bankrupt before his or her bankruptcy void against the trustee. The bill will change the test for determining whether these prior settlements are immune from claims-' ,The simpler test under the bill will mean that if the bankrupt transferred property to another person for no consideration or for less than the market value those· transactions may be subject to a claim by the trustee. The test will be one of whether at the time of the transfer of the property the now bankrupt was 'technically insolvent'. The amendments wili place the emphasis on the likely effect on creditors of that earlier transaction. This will attempt to overcome a rort, if it is alleged, which will enable the debtor to transfer property to escape a personal guarantee and to then declare bankruptcy. There are some very notable persons who have been made bankrupt as a result of personal guarantee provisions. This has highlighted greater attention on these matters because of the public notoriety of some of these cases. The definition of 'technically insolvent' raises a number of concerns as it catches potential liabilities. This definition could technically catch individuals who, under the principle of joint and several liability, are called upon to provide for the entire sum of a guarantee. While guarantors may have the funds to provide for their expected part of the amount, they may be unable to provide for the entire guarantee and may therefore come under the definition of technically insolvent. Registered trustees, the Law Council and the Insolvency Practitioners Association of Australia are concerned about the wording of these provisions. They have indicated that while they agree with the modernising and strengthening of the antecedent transaction issues involved in this legislation this definition is very wide ranging. It could lead to endless debate. I am going to give you some of the examples that were submitted to us that highlight the difficulty due to the drafting of the term 'technically insolvent'. The first example states: ... where a person has a housing loan but there is no default under it, and there is no realistic pect of default, is the principal sum owed under housing loan-which may have a term of many years-to be taken into account in assessing solvency? If so, how is the calculation to be made? Another example provides: Where there are joint and several guarantors, it would be impossible to accurately assess the financial position of anyone of them without investigating the financial position of the others. For example, if there are 10 guarantors who jointly and severally guarantee a debt of $100,000, and the subject guarantor has assets of, say $30,000, that person might think he or she is technically solvent. If that person were called on to pay the full amount guaranteed he or she would ordinarily have a right of indemnity against the co-guarantors. If guarantors have assets, then the right of indemnity has value. However, if the co-guarantors do not have assets, then even though the subject guarantor has sufficient assets to cover his or her own share of the liability under the guarantee, that person will (apparently) be technically insolvent within the meaning of the definition. Of further concern is the provision which stipulates that, if less than market value is provided for the transfer, then the transfer will be void against the trustee. This provision may very well affect innocent transferees. A transferee who, due to normal circumstances, is able to acquire an asset at a price less than market value, and given real consideration for the asset, will be caught by the provisions. In some cases, it will not be known by a transferee for a period of up to five years whether or not the transfer is safe. The Law Council has indicated that there is a serious potential for unjust outcomes in relation to innocent purchasers whose only crime is the acquisition of property at less than the objectively ascertained market value of the property. It is further commented that there should be some attempt to achieve consistency with the Corporations Law. The Corporations Law provides that if there is no market value then the best price reasonably obtainable in the circumstances should be realised. Therefore, this issue must be examined, in our view, by a committee of the parliament. That these provisions will apply to all bankruptcies that are current when provisions are finally enacted amounts to retrospective legislation, which is of great concern to the proscoalition. While there is support for provithe sions which strengthen the ability of the trustee to avoid antecedent transactions, these new provisions would apply only to transactions which take place after the new sections commence operation. For the above reasons, in our view, a committee of this parliament must closely examine these provisions. In relation to insolvency administrations outside an actual bankruptcy, the Bankruptcy Act provides, in part X, for arrangements which are a step short of bankruptcy, such as an agreement for a schedule of payment by instalments. The bill amends these procedures those coto make the procedure the same for both solicitors and trustees who act for debtors who enter into assignments, arrangements or compositions under part X. The bill will also introduce a new form of debt administration, which will be known as a part IX debt agreement, which will apply to debtors whose level of liability does not exceed $20,000. This will provide for the circulation of a debtor's proposal for payment of less than the full amount or for periodic payments. This new part is an attempt to simplify the proceedings for a debtor where the debtor owes a smaller amount, as can be done with the additional requirements for a part X arrangement and is done through the official trustee. Our concerns are that the legislation will consolidate the power of ITSA by casting it in the role as regulator and adviser. Therefore, debtors may not get the most objective, best advice and may not seek their own independent advice from a third party but accept the advice of ITSA. A number of practitioners have mentioned a lack of a level playing field between the official trustee and registered trustees. The Insolvency Practitioners Association believes that there needs to be a level playing field between the two. While the official trustee is subsidised, private trustees are not. The bill will allow official trustees to accept appointment under part X of the act, but private trustees will not be allowed to accept appointments in relation to the new debt agreements under the new part IX to be inserted by this bill. Further, the threshold amount of $20,000 may be too low. It may be more appropriate to have a higher amount, such as $50,000. While this is an experimental section it should be fully examined, in our view, by an independent committee of this parliament in order to secure the best possible advice and result. A further issue is the income contribution from bankrupts. Probably these are the most contentious provisions in the bill. By way of background, the amendments are in response to the Federal Court decision in Bond v. Ramsay of 1994. In this case the trustee classified the provision of over $700,000 in housing, office expense, travel and telephone and legal expenses by Mr Bond's family and associates as fringe benefits and, therefore, income related, attracting the income contribution provisions of the act. Mr Bond was therefore required to make a substantial income contribution to reduce his debts. He challenged this assessment and was successful on appeal to the Federal Court, and the $700,000 was considered to be gifts and not income. In this case the trustee is appealing this decision to the High Court. This bill attempts to restore what was intended in the original amendments in 1992 dealing with income contributions from bankrupts and will now cover loans and other benefits to bankrupts. Some of the concerns that have been raised with us include the key provision to amend the definition of income in section 139L, which will include the value of a benefit that is provided in any circumstances and the value of a loan made to a bankrupt. This means that a bankrupt who receives a payment of legal fees to challenge a decision of the trustee may be required to make an income contribution on the basis that the payment of legal fees, perhaps in the form of legal aid, would fall within the definition of income. The trustee, while having a discretion to exclude certain payments from the income contribution provisions, in reality may rarely exercise this discretion. In some areas of government people are given discretions which they decline to exercise. Sometimes it depends on whether or not they are compellable. I am not sure of the nature of this discretion. The Law Council has raised a contrasting concern indicating that the proposed amendment may not work as, although it attempts to remove the requirement for a benefit to be provided in respect of employment, it may still require an employment nexus, relying as it does on the definition of benefit in the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act. There is concern that the way in which the income provision has been drafted-that any provision under the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act can be amended by regulation for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act-is an inappropriate delegation of legislative power and may be open to constitutional challenge. The Law Council is concerned that these new sections should not apply to transactions which took place before the commencement of the new provisions, as such retrospective operation would be quite unfair. The coalition shares those concerns. As the initial income contribution provisions have been held to have a result not intended by the government, it is vital that this matter be fully examined in order that these sections be drafted appropriately and be workable. They must strike a sensible balance. While these amendments may make it harder for high-flying bankrupts to take advantage of the legislation, they may make it impossible for ordinary small business bankrupts to receive assistance such as the provision of legal aid to challenge a decision of trustees during bankruptcy. New duties of trustees will be introduced which will require a more commercial orientation of trustees. The trustee will be required to report to creditors within three months on the specific issue of whether creditors can be entitled to expect a dividend and also to administer estates with a view to avoiding unnecessary expense. The official trustee will not become the role registering authority for trustees. In our view, these amendments are not controversial. Some concerns have been expressed by the Law Council and the Insolvency Practitioners Association that no attempt has been made in the bill to achieve consistency with the relevant provisions of the Corporations Law. If the government is serious about simplification, this issue must be examined closely. There will be significant power within the proposed regulation making power. The Insolvency Practitioners Association is concerned about this; for example, the power to set remuneration for registered trustees. It recommends a working party approach with the Insolvency Practitioners Association to any proposed regulations. The government has not produced the bill in the form of an exposure draft, as was done in the case of proposals to simplify the Corporations Law. I understand from my discussion with officers that the view is that exposure drafts are a more appropriate form of procedure to follow when state governments and other legislative bodies are involved. In our view, the exposure draft system is one that ought to be used more widely, particularly when there are special interests and groups with a capacity to offer views on provisions that can be quite complex and quite difficult. It is a fact that this legislation emanated from a general inquiry into insolvency by the Law Reform Commission. Its report included a draft bill. It is not the Law Reform Commission's work, which was the subject of a great deal of public inquiry and submission, that we are now implementing; it is the document that has been the subject of further consideration and further papers produced by the government. In those circumstances, many of the matters of concern that I have raised in this debate that have been put to us by insolvency practitioners, the Law Council and its committees may well have been resolved if the bill had been produced earlier in exposure form and the views of these bodies taken into account. I think one of the commentaries I have used in the preparation of these comments was made available to the government's advisers only yesterday. It seems to me that, when we are working in this sort of time frame, these important matters that ought to be the subject of consideration cannot be taken into account while we deal with legislation of this sort in this way. The corporate law simplification program has produced proposals for simplification. We might have been able to achieve more in that way in this legislation if it had been produced as an exposure draft. The corporate law simplification program has been greeted very favourably by the professions. That this process was not undertaken here is regrettable in our view, given the size of the bill and the many critical comments that have been made. It is for these reasons-I have outlined in detail a number of them-that we believe this bill should be referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for report, in particular on the issues of retrospectivity, the definition of what it is to be technically insolvent and the appropriateness of the income contribution provisions. At an appropriate time. I will seek leave of the House to suspend standing orders to ensure that I am entitled to move a motion to refer this bill to the committee. I understand the appropriate time to do that is shortly after motion for the second reading has been put, so I will wait until that time.",75
145,Mr SLIPPER,BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION,"I am very pleased to join the debate tonight on the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill 1995. This is a very complex and very complicated bill running into very many pagesin fact, 95-of amendments with an explanatory memorandum of 218 pages. This bill seeks to amend the Bankruptcy Act 1966 as amended. That act is a tome of some 381 pages. Also sought to be amended is another smaller, though still important, piece of legislation rejoicing in the title of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977, which, by comparison, comprises a mere 33 pages. This bill seeks to amend these two acts to assist in modernising the law on personal insolvency. Key provisions in the bill include a simplified process for low income minor bankruptcies, the creation of a one-stop shop for bankruptcy and the tightening of provisions dealing with those who divest themselves of property to third parties when facing bankruptcy. Australian bankruptcy law applies to an individual who is unable to pay his or her own debts. The Commonwealth Bankruptcy Act is a law made pursuant to section 51(xvii) of the constitution. Many people get confused with individual and corporate insolvency. Corporate insolvency is dealt with under the Commonwealth's Corporations Law. In our view, one of the aims should be that the laws relating to individual insolvency should, as much as possible, be similar to those relating to corporate insolvency. Unfortunately, this has not occurred in the past and this bill does very little to redress the fact that we have a lot of inconsistencies between corporate and individual insolvency. The primary aim of modern bankruptcy law is to enable the debtor to identify his or her accumulated debts and make whatever contribution is possible and then allow the debtor to make a fresh start. Most people would agree with the basic aims of bankruptcy law. Of course, we often differ on the finer detail. I find it quite amazing that after 12 years of Labor government we now find such a complex bill being brought into this House which follows on from a number of complex amendments to the bankruptcy legislation. It seems that the government has simply not been able to get it right. The history of bankruptcy is worth considering. Way back in the 12th century the Anglo-Saxon remedy for debt-imprisonment-had been eliminated. The only legal remedies available to creditors were writs directing the sheriff to sell the land or goods of the debtor or to receive rents, proceeds or profits on his behalf. From 1285, an additional writ enabled the sheriff to hold chattels and land on behalf of a creditor until the debt was satisfied. But these remedies took no account of other creditors and certainly provided no relief to hopelessly insolvent debtors. Imprisonment was reintroduced at the end of the 13th century and gradually became 'arrest until satisfaction'. Given that many creditors were simply unable to satisfy their debts, this amounted to imprisonment for life. I do not think anyone in the country, certainly no-one in the parliament, would support that kind of legislation. The first of the bankruptcy acts was brought in in 1542 and provided the first legal remedy available to creditors as a whole as compared with action taken by an individual creditor. This act and subsequent bankruptcy acts leading right through to the Bankruptcy Act 1966 improved methods of extraction of assets from debtors, endeavoured to provide for a fair distribution and some time later provided relief to debtors themselves. As we approached the 18th century, bankruptcy was coming to be considered as a beneficial course of action not only for the creditor but also for the debtor. Bankruptcy started to be considered to be misfortune rather than fault. Debtors were finally given the power to initiate their own bankruptcies voluntarily. The legislation which we have here is a descendent in effect of those earlier English acts. Individual colonies, later states, of Australia brought forward their own bankruptcy acts, but in 1924 a bankruptcy act of the Commonwealth was enacted. That was an amalgam of the British and colonial legislation. The Bankruptcy Act 1966 introduced a new consolidated procedure for private arrangements avoiding bankruptcy. In fact, in many respects it was a trailblazer because it deviated from many of the existing English and Australian precedents. The Bankruptcy Act, being the Commonwealth act, now covers everyone in the country. Its provisions override any state act to the contrary to the extent that state legislation is in conflict. Section 109 of the Commonwealth constitution covers this particular matter. The Australian bankruptcy legislation provides for control of private arrangements avoiding bankruptcy-they are known as part X arrangements-to be carried out under the supervision of private trustees. Until November 1981 control of bankrupt estates was automatically given to official receivers, being public officials appointed for each bankruptcy district. Private trustees could be appointed to administer bankrupt estates only at a meeting of creditors convened after the appointment of the official receiver. In 1987 the act was amended to enable insolvency fraud to be more effectively attacked and to modify part X arrangements so that more information was required to· be given to creditors prior to proposal meetings. As I said, this legislation currently before the House is the latest in a series of amendments to the Commonwealth Bankruptcy Act 1966. The governmenfs reaction often relates to deCisions made in courts and also reflects changing community attitudes. It would be an understatement to say that there was community outrage at some of the financial defaults by corporate high-fliers, particularly those from the 1980s. It has been suggested that the legislation before the House is a direct result of the case involving Mr Bond. The question for the parliament and indeed ultimately at the next election for the entire country is whether the government's response is measured and appropriate. We, when considering this particular piece of legislation, have consulted widely, as is the practice of the coalition. We have discussed matters with the Law Council, the Insolvency Practitioners Association, a registered trustee and the Victorian Bar Council-to mention just a few. A number of concerns have been expressed by some of these bodies. That is why I very strongly support the proposal foreshadowed by the shadow minister, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), who spoke previously, that this whole bill be referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. That should be done because of the very many complex and controversial items included in the bill. Towards the end of 1993 the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) released a number of discussion papers on reform of the Bankruptcy Act. These papers dealt with administration, property available for payment of debts, administration of estates and reform of part X of the act. They arose out of the Law Reform Commission's general insolvency inquiry. Some of these amendments are as a result of the papers and some are in order to improve the drafting of the act. I am currently a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs",80
146,Mr SLIPPER,BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION,"An excellent member, as my colleague the honourable member for Sturt points out. I have always been concerned over the practice of the Law Reform Commission, when giving the report, to also present a draft bill. My experience, and the experience of other members of the committee, has been that in many cases the minister and the government simply do not pick up the draft wording. It could be that the wording is not adequately skilful or that it might not reflect the government's response to the particular report, but we find that very many man-hours-to be politically correct, one would have to say person-hours-would tend to be lost in the drafting of legislation which will never see the light of day. It would seem that the bill before the House is another indication of where the government has not accepted all of the recommendations and whJe the Law Reform Commission has, ther-fore, exhausted a great deal of energy and - ublic money in producing a bill which is nOf being debated. Some of the amendments relate to the administration of bankruptcy. The amendment to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act will provide that the Federal Court \will have exclusive jurisdiction in bankruptcy, apart from the residual jurisdiction of the High Court. The administrative day-today record keeping and documentation procedurfs will be handled by one agency. The bill \suggests the concept of a one-stop shop with the transfer of certain administrative func-ions from the Federal Court to ITSA. Th offices of Registrar and Deputy Registrar ·n Bankruptcy will both be abolished and their duties transferred to the official re sultations with people on this bill, a number concerns have been expressed over the pro osed abolition of the offices of registrar and deputy registrar. The government's amendments would allow the ordinary debtor who files for bankruptcy to deal with ITSA alone, and to have more prompt service by the one Commonwealth department. It would mean that the person would not have to go from office to office. The amendment also seeks to/avoid duplication. While one must always encourage any simplification and any reduction in bureaucracy, the recent High Court decision in the Brandy case must obviously raise some concerns. In that decision, the High Court indicated that it is often difficult to separate judicial and administrative functions, apart from the issue of enforceability which is clearly an exercise in judicial power. We certainly have some concerns in relation to what the government is doing here. The date of bankruptcy is said to commence on the occasion of the first act of bankruptcy within six months before the actual date of presentation of the petition. That means that certain transactions are rendered void against a claim by the trustee. In certain cases, property settlements dating back as far as five years can be challenged by the trustee. The law currently looks to the intention of the parties and the nature of settlements. This bill will change the test for deciding whether these prior settlements are immune from claim. We have some concerns over the definition of 'technically insolvent', as it catches potentialliabilities. This definition could technically catch individuals who, under the principle of joint and several liability, are called upon to provide for the entire sum of a guarantee. We all know how banks, when seeking to guarantee loans, will rope in as many people as they can-all of whom are jointly and severally liable. Of course, no one individual could possibly pay the entire amount of the liability. The result of that could be that a lot of these people could be dragged in through the proposed amendments to the bill. While a number of people we have consulted have very great concerns over the wording of the provisions, we as a coalition are very worried about the fact that the changes will apply to all bankruptcies which are current when the provisions are finally enacted. We wish to place on record our very strong opposition to retrospectivity in legislation. It is very important that the subject or the citizen be able to order his affairs and to act in accordance with the law today, assuming that a government in the future is not going to retrospectively change the law and make an action which is lawful today retrospectively unlawful. I think that is a very basic principle of democracy. It is fairly sad that this government has once again sought to bring in retrospective legislation. We certainly do not apologise for this. This is one of the matters that the shadow minister foreshadowed ought to be discussed by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs when it considers this bill. The bill also refers to insolvency administration outside of actual bankruptcy. The Bankruptcy Act, as I mentioned before, provides for part X, which allows for arrangements which are a step short of bankruptcy, such as agreement for a schedule of payment by instalments. The bill amends these procedures to make the procedure the same for both solicitors and trustees who act for debtors who enter into assignments, arrangements or compositions under part X. The bill will also introduce a new form of debt administration which will be known as a part IX debt agreement, which will apply to debtors whose level of liability does not exceed $20,000. This will provide for the circulation of a debtor's proposal for payment of less than the full amount or for periodic payments. This new part is an attempt to simplify proceedings for a debtor where the debtor owes a smaller amount, as it can be done without the additional requirements required for a part X arrangement, such as the necessity to call a meeting, and is done through the Official Trustee. We have certain worries about these amendments, as the legislation will further consolidate the power of ITSA by casting them in both the role of regulator and adviser. Debtors may therefore not get the most objective and best advice, and may not seek their own advice but accept the advice of ITSA. As the shadow minister mentioned, the amount of $20,000 may well be too low and it may be more appropriate to have a higher amount. He suggested $50,000 as an appropriate amount, but it could perhaps be higher. Division 4B of part VI of the Bankruptcy Act was added in 1992- Its purposes were set out in section 139J: The objects of this Division are: (a) to require a bankrupt who derives income during the bankruptcy to pay contributions towards the bankrupt's estate; and (b) to enable the recovery of certain money and property for the benefit of the bankrupt's estate. Unfortunately, for creditors, judicial interprethe tation has moved the law some distance away from what was apparently intended by the parliament in 1992 when this act became law. A case in reference is Bond v. Ramsay-a case I referred to a short while ago. These amendments are apparently in response to the decision of the Federal Court. The shadow minister has outlined the facts and circumstances of the case and the loophole which the Federal Court discovered, requiring in the government's view the amendments currently before the House. In Bond v. Ramsay, the Federal Court ruled that the existing definition of income should be interpreted in a relatively narrow fashion. That meant that Mr Bond was able to get the result he wanted-although, as was mentioned earlier, this matter has gone on appeal to the High Court. The key provision is to amend the definition of income in section 139L, which will include the value of a benefit that is provided in any circumstances and the value of a loan made to the bankrupt. This means that a bankrupt who receives payment of legal fees to challenge a decision of the trustee may be required to make an income contribution on the basis that the legal aid would fall within the income definition. The trustee, while having a discretion to exclude certain payments from the income contribution provisions, in reality may rarely exercise this discretion. We are currently discussing whether the term 'income' should be widened to include gifts, loans, transfers of property prior to bankruptcy and payments of expenses by benefactors. Clause 92 of the amending bill seeks to amend section 139L of the principal act. Under clause 92(e) 'income' includes: the value of a benefit that: (i) is provided in any circumstances by any person (the 'provider') to the bankrupt; (ii) is a benefit within the meaning of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 as in force at the beginning of 1 July 1992 ... being that value as worked out in accordance with the provisions of the act but subject to any modifications of any provisions of that act made by regulations. Income also includes under (f): value of a loan made to the bankrupt by an associated entity of the bankrupt, including: (i) a loan under which the loan money is not paid to the bankrupt, but is paid or applied at the bankrupt's direction; and (ii) a loan that is not enforceable at law or in equity ... The government has had changing views on whether it ought to alter the bankruptcy law in response to the Brandy case. The Minister for Justice stands condemned because he has said various things at various times. Initially, following the Brandy case, the West Australian on 1 March stated: Justice Minister Duncan Kerr ruled out further changes to Australia's bankruptcy laws and said they were among the toughest in the world. The Age on the same day reported: The Federal Government has rejected calls for an overhaul of Australia's bankruptcy laws after the failed entrepreneur Mr Alan Bond's early release from bankruptcy. Despite that, eight days later in the Financial Review of 9 March, it was reported that: Mr Kerr said the changes retrospectively restored the position to what it was believed to have been before the Federal Court ruling. So on 1 March the minister said that the law was strong and did not need amendment, yet eight days later he announced changes, which we are currently debating in this House. There are a number of concerns in relation to this particular bill. It is complex. It is difficult. It has many pages. It is the sort of matter that ought to be looked at very carefully. One of the great things about the House of Representatives committee system is that lately it has started to work. Bills have been referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for report. The committee has worked well. The shadow minister has recommended that this bill be sent to the committee for report and so it can consider retrospectivity, the definition of 'technically insolvent' and the appropriateness of income contribution provisions. We are not saying we are opposed to this particular bill. We have concerns about some elements of it. I believe it is better to work through legislation and to make sure that it is right before it is enacted because so often the government puts bills through the parliament as though it is a sausage machine and, shortly after it becomes law, must crawl back in here and ask the consent of the House of Representatives and the Senate to change it.

147,Mr WILLIAMS,BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION,"Tangney) (7.02 p.m.)The Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 is a piece of legislation that has been some time coming to fruition and proposes, or attempts, significant reforms. Unfortunately, in my view, the proposed legislation will fail to achieve some of its aims, may lead to further problems and, at the same time, represents a missed opportunity to effect other much needed changes to the bankruptcy laws. It is entirely appropriate that it should be referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for inquiry and report. Briefly, the changes proposed in this bill on which I propose to offer comment are the revision of the antecedent transaction avoidance provisions by which trustees can recover property from third parties who are given property by debtors facing bankruptcy or insolvency and the amendment of the definition of 'income' to close the gap highlighted in the Alan Bond case. I will also offer brief comments on the establishment of a one-stop service for bankrupts and insolvent debtors with the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia, ITSA, a division of the Attorney General's Department, and the abolition of the offices of registrar and deputy registrar in bankruptcy. Other changes I will leave to others. In dealing with the particular aspects of the government's proposals I mentioned, I will comment on the retrospectivity of certain key pro,visions in the bill and the lack of effectiveness of others. The principal aim of modem bankruptcy law is to enable the debtor to identify his or her accumulated debts, to make whatever contribution is possible and to make a fresh start. This is to be contrasted with the earlier practice of punishing debtors for non-payment of their debts by imprisonment. When a person becomes bankrupt, all of his or her divisible property vests in the bankruptcy trustee. The bankrupt has no power to deal with the property that has vested in the trustee. It is under the control of the trustee and it is the trustee's task to sell the property and to distribute the proceeds of sale among thecredi tors. A fundamental feature of the law of bankruptcy is that it operates to enable property and money given or transferred, in certain circumstances, by a person who later becomes a bankrupt to be recovered by the bankruptcy trustee. This property too can then be sold and the proceeds distributed to the bankrupt's creditors. The law presently provides for a period known as 'relation back'. The trustee's title to the property is said to relate back to the date of commencement of the bankruptcy. The bankruptcy is taken to commence on the commission by the debtor of the first act of bankruptcy within the period of six months before the presentation of the petition under which the debtor becomes a bankrupt. The trustee may be able to claim property from a person to whom the bankrupt has given it during the relation back period, unless the person who received the property gave something of value in exchange or did not know that a bankruptcy petition had been presented against the debtor and acted in good faith in the ordinary course of business. The bill proposes replacing those sections of the act dealing with transfers of property with a simplified provision under which a transfer of property by a person who later becomes a bankrupt is void against the trustee, firstly, if it took place within five years before the commencement of the bankruptcy and, secondly, if the recipient gave nothing of value in exchange or only something that was less than market value. If the transfer took place between two and five years before the commencement of the bankruptcy, the transfer will be valid unless the recipient of the property proves that the transferor was not technically insolvent at the time. The term 'technically insolvent' is to be defined as a situation where a person's property and income are insufficient to meet the person's liabilities, including any secured liabilities and potential liabilities under a guarantee for another person. This revision of the antecedent transaction avoidance provisions has been criticised by the Law Council of Australia, by the Western Australian Insolvency and Reconstruction Lawyers and by legal practitioners generally. As a preliminary observation, the Law Council of Australia has said that there is no attempt in this bill to achieve consistency with the provisions of the Corporations Law. In the words of the Law Council: If a person deals with a business carried on under a business name, it should make no difference as a matter of law whether the proprietor of the name is a corporation or an individual. The major criticism of these amendments, though, is the definition of 'technically insolvent', described by the Law Council as 'a particularly wide ranging definition and one which is likely to lead to endless debate'. Endless debate means endless litigation and endless expense for individuals. Endless debate also means unnecessary debate and unnecessary expense if, despite all the warnings, this definition is enacted by the parliament in its present form. As an illustration of the defects in the proposed definition of 'technically insolvent', the Law Council gives the example of a joint and several liability under a guarantee. In such a case, it would be impossible accurately to assess the financial position of anyone of the guarantors without investigating the financial position of the others. If there are 10 guarantors who jointly and severally guarantee a debt of $100,000 and the first of those guarantors has assets of $30,000, one would think that person was technically solvent. However, if none of the remaining co-guarantors has any assets, even though the first guarantor has sufficient assets to cover his or her proportionate share of the liability under the guarantee, that person appears to be technically insolvent within the meaning of the proposed definition by reason of the joint liability. In the words of the Law Council: ... it is undesirable to have a definition of insolvency which cannot produce a certain result and requires an investigation into the financial position of others. The shortcomings of the existing provisions do not arise out of any difficulty with the concept of solvency. Further, the Law Council is of the view that the proposed amendments to the provisions relating to antecedent property transactions are likely to result in unjust outcomes because the requirement that the recipient of the property must have given at least market value in exchange will affect innocent recipients. For example, an arms-length purchaser who is fortunate enough to purchase an asset at a bargain price within the two years prior to the commencement of the bankruptcy will be forced by the provisions contained in the bill to disgorge the asset and be left with a mere right to prove in the bankruptcy for the price paid. As a result, it will never be safe to purchase at a discount on the full market price. The impossibility of this situation is compounded by the fact that the legal burden of proof rests on the recipient. The burden of proving that the transferor was not technically insolvent would compel the recipient to have knowledge of the bankrupt's property and income and liabilities, including potential liabilities under guarantees at the time the property was transferred. In most cases, it will be practically impossible for an arms-length recipient of property, entirely unacquainted with the detail of the transferor's financial circumstances and having no means of knowing the solvency of persons whose debts the transferor may have guaranteed, to prove that the transferor was not technically insolvent at the time of the transfer. As a means of deterring litigation, such obstacles may be very effective. Unfortunately, as barriers to access to justice they will be equally effective. In the words of the Law Council of Australia: This must necessarily lead to an erosion of commercial confidence, because arm's length purchasers will not know for at least five years not the transfer is inviolable unless they have full and complete information concerning the whole of the transferor's financial circumstances and financial circumstances of persons whose debts the transferor has guaranteed and independent evidence of the objective market value of the asset transferred. The bill makes the proposed amendments to the antecedent transactions provisions of the act effectively retrospective. It does this by applying the new provisions to all bankruptcies that are current when the new provisions commence. The explanatory memorandum describes a current bankruptcy to include one in which a final dividend has not yet been paid. Where property has been transferred without fraud, there does not appear to be any good reason why transactions which do not breach the existing antecedent transactions provisions of the act should be under threat. Some of the transactions connected with current bankruptcies may have taken place up to five years before the bankruptcy commenced. Thus, where administration of the bankruptcy has taken time, the retrospective reach of the bill may extend back more than five years. The Law Council of Australia recommends that any new provisions apply only to property transactions that occur after the commencement of the proposed amendments. This is yet another example of this government's penchant for retrospectivity. As I have said in this place on several occasions before, retrospectivity in legislation is invidious in principle. I support the principle of prospectively tightening the bankruptcy law so that artificial property transactions aimed at defeating creditors are rendered void as against the bankruptcy trustee. But whenever the government seeks to legislate in the way these proposals contemplate, it takes away the rights of Australians retrospectively. Purchasers and other recipients of property were entitled to arrange their affairs according to the law, including bankruptcy law, as it existed when they transacted their business. It is simply unjust and oppressive to subject citizens to a law they have no means of ascertaining simply because the law has not whether or been conceived, drafted or enacted. The Law Council of Australia has pointed out that there is a further, practical reason why the new provisions should apply only to transactions occurring after the commencement of the new provisions. Where there are court proceedings already on foot, a party may perceive that it would serve its interests to delay the proceedings pending the commencement of the new provisions. The parties' pleadings in those proceedings may, in any event, have to be totally redrafted if the case is not to be heard until after the commencement of the proposed amendments. Again, the expense and delay that this would cause is an added unnecessary burden to those who resort to the court system for justice and the enforcement of their rights. A further key proposal in the bill is the revision of the compulsory income contribution scheme following the decision of the Federal Court in the case of Bond v. Ramsay. The scheme commenced operation on 1 July 1992, replacing an earlier, ineffective system. The income contribution scheme is an administrative regime under which a trustee makes an assessment of the income likely to be derived by a bankrupt during a certain period. Where the assessment of income exceeds a specified threshold the bankrupt is liable to pay half of every dollar he or she earns over and above that amount. The term 'income' is defined to include various payments received, including a benefit that is, or if it were provided by an employer would be, a fringe benefit for the purposes of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986. Much of the public criticism of the bankruptcy law in the 1990s has been directed at the supposed inadequacy of the scheme. This is because some bankrupts appear to be able to maintain a lifestyle which is lavish by comparison with that of ordinary solvent individuals, and are able to conduct expensive litigation which depletes the assets available for contribution to their creditors. Some of these bankrupts have benefactors, including friends and family members, who meet the expenses and outgoings of the bankrupt. A bankrupt should not be allowed to benefit from gifts or expense payments in circumstances where to do so would be to exclude unjustly his or her creditors from the benefit of those resources. This may be the case when the benefactor has in earlier times been the recipient of property transferred to him or her from the now bankrupt, thus putting him or her in a financial position to assist the bankrupt. But it is by no means self-evident that it is a basic intent of the current legislation that if a person makes a payment of money from that person's own property to benefit a bankrupt - for example, to pay his or her legal fees in order that the bankrupt may defend himself or herself in legal proceedings-the amount of any such payment is to be regarded as income coming to the bankrupt. In his judgment in the Bond case, Justice Cooper, a member of the majority, said: It is not an object within ... the [Bankruptcy] Act to prevent bona fide acts of benefaction from the family or friends of a bankrupt using their own money or property. This is the same point that was made in a letter to the Australian Financial Review on 4 November 1994 by Mr Ron Harmer, who was formerly the commissioner in charge of the Australian Law Reform Commission's general insolvency inquiry which reported in 1988. The Law Council of Australia has recommended that if benefits are to be classed as income, then only those benefits which contribute to the bankrupt's lifestyle, such as houses, cars and expensive holidays, should be taken into account. Justice Cooper warned in the Bond case of the consequences of adopting a too broad definition of income. He said: ... [receiving benefits in excess of the income limit] alone renders the bankrupt liable to assessment for contribution to his estate whether or not he has any capacity to pay the contribution and exposes him to the serious consequence of non-payment of the contribution. In principle this would seem to occur where the funds for the legal services were provided by family and friends or by a Legal Aid Commission briefing out and paying for the provision of legal services for the bankrupt, notwithstanding that the bankrupt was at the relevant time not employed and not in receipt of income and satisfied the means test applicable to the grant of legal aid. The act and this bill give the trustee no discretion to ameliorate the harsh consequences that the proposed definition in the bill might produce. The consequences of failing to pay an income assessment are serious, including an automatic extension of the term of the bankruptcy from three years to eight years, the commission of an offence and the survival beyond the bankruptcy of the obligation to pay the assessment. The government proposes in the bill to amend the definition of 'income', principally because of the decision in the Bond case. In the Bond case the Federal Court decided that the definition of 'income' in the act did not include the value of benefits provided to a bankrupt other than in an employment context. In the face of this clear judicial interpretation, the government, in an exercise of breathtaking arrogance, states in the explanatory memorandum to the bill: When the income contribution scheme was devised, it was intended to catch the value of gifts, payments of expenses and similar benefits provided to or on account of a bankrupt by benefactors, whether or not the bankrupt was employed by, or worked or provided services for or on behalf of the benefactor. The government then complains about the decision of the court in Bond v. Ramsay. The government is not only refusing to accept the umpire's decision, but is attempting, once again, to rewrite the rule-book. As the Law Council of Australia has said of the government's interpretation of the legislation: .. , there is little in the legislation or in any extrinsic material from which such a purpose or intention can be evinced. The proposed definition of income seeks to remove the requirement for a benefit to be provided 'in respect of employment' . The new definition of income includes the value of a benefit that 'is a benefit within the meaning of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986'. However, as the Law Council points out, for a benefit to come within the meaning of that act it must be provided under an arrangement in relation to 'the performance of work'. Thus an employment nexus must still exist, and so the problems revealed by the Bond case may not be solved. In fact, the amendment may, in addition, create a problem. The Bankruptcy Act draws a distinction between its treatment of the 'property' of a bankrupt and the 'income' of a bankrupt. As I said earlier, in general terms, property owned by a bankrupt at the commencement of the bankruptcy vests in the trustee for the benefit of creditors. Afteracquired property also vests in the trustee. The proposed expanded definition of income raises the prospect of an overlap between those provisions of the act dealing with after-acquired property and those dealing with income. In aiming to catch receipts by the bankrupt of a capital nature within the definition of income, for the purposes of the income contribution scheme, such receipts may thereby be excluded from the meaning of after-acquired property for the purposes of property divisible among the creditors. A further concern highlighted by the Law Council is that the bill provides in the proposed definition of income that any provision of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act can be amended by regulation for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act. The Law Council says: This delegation of legislative power should be condemned and may be open to constitutional challenge. Certainly there are better ways of drafting such a crucial definition. As the government claims to know how the legislation was intended to be interpreted, it should be a simple matter for it to have the appropriate definition drafted in the primary legislation. There is yet another problem. The bill introduces a new limb to the definition of income which makes the value of loans made to the bankrupt by an associated entity of the bankrupt assessable as income. In its explanatory memorandum, the government seeks to justify this on the basis that bankrupts commonly abuse the income assessment provisions by disguising as loans the funds advanced to them by associated entities which are, in reality, gifts. The provision is drafted in such a way that it appears to include genuine loans. As I suggested at the beginning, one of the purposes of the bankruptcy laws is to promote the financial rehabilitation of bankrupts. It is obviously very difficult for an undischarged bankrupt to borrow money. In these circumstances, a loan from a family member may be the only possibility. There is no reason why bona fide loans by associated entities should automatically be assessed as income of the bankrupt. Again, the problem with this broadening of the definition of income is that an advance of cash to the bankrupt by an associated entity would normally vest in the trustee as afteracquired property for the benefit of the creditors. By including a loan in the form of such a cash advance in the definition of income, it is likely to remain the bankrupt's, subject only to the income contribution scheme. Administration and oversight of bankruptcy matters is carried out by Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia, ITSA. However, Federal Court of Australia plays an essential role in the determination of rights and tions under bankruptcy law. In addition, .certain administrative tasks, such as the issue of bankruptcy notices, are the responsibility of the registrars in bankruptcy who are locatcreditor ed within the Federal Court. The public thus has to deal with two separate Commonwealth bodies, namely, the Federal Court's registrar in bankruptcy and ITSA. This bill proposes the abolition of offices of registrar and deputy registrar bankruptcy and the transfer of their adminiscourts. trative functions to ITSA to establish a onestop service. I have some concerns about this expanded role for ITSA. The proposals in the bill relating to part X arrangements would allow ITSA to be a trustee of those arrangeby ments while also being a controlling trustee. expired) If ITSA is to be responsible for administering bankrupt estates and the estates of debtors under part X arrangements and at the same time exercising a supervisory role over the conduct of private trustees, there is a clear possibility of conflicts of interest. With the abolition of the office of registrar in bankruptcy, ITSA's conflicts of interest may become more pronounced. If ITSA is to have this expanded role, must show that it is capable of performing various functions efficiently and fairly. cerns have been raised with me by constituprinted ents about the lack of efficiency within ITSA in terms of both the way it operates and profit it generates. Certainly, something needs explaining about the budget figures for ITSA for 1995-96. Page 24 of Budget Paper No.2 gives a budget estimate of receipts for the General's Department under the item 'Bankruptcy' of $10.553 million. Page 46 of the program analysis for the Attorney General's portfolio gives a budget estimate of total outlays for ITSA for 1995-96 of $20.741 million. At the least this requires ation from the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr). Finally, the government has failed to address an area of much needed reform. Significantly, the bill does not address the situation of debtors who flee the jurisdiction in order the to avoid the reach of their creditors and Australian bankruptcy law. The Law Council obligasubmitted to the 1993 reform discussion papers which preceded this bill that, where a debtor has left Australia never to return and has no other connection with Australia, the may be unable to present a bankruptcy petition because of the requirement that a debtor must be personally present or ordinarily resident in Australia at the time of the commission of the act of bankruptcy. There the must be a nexus with Australia before a in petition can be issued out of the Australian No effort has been made to close this loophole. The Law Council went so far as to offer a legislative solution to this problem. Unfortunately, it appears to have been ignored the government in framing the bill.

149,Mr CAMPBELL,BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION,"The honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) made an excellent and very thoughtful contribution in which he raised some points which are of concern. I hope these points are considered by the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) or that at least the minister adequately addresses them. However, I fear that this legislation has been driven in part by genuflections of the high profile instances we have had of corporate impropriety. There is no doubt that the Bonds and the Skases have made a big impact in the media. It is my view that the worse excesses have been by the banks. The attitude and behaviour of the banks, particularly in the late 1980s, has in my view been quite reprehensible. In the short time available to me, I want to raise a matter which is very germane to the discussion but which is not covered by the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill. I refer to the action of agents and mortgagees in possession. A secured creditor can get hold of a person's income stream. There seems to be very little control over these people. I am aware of many instances where the behaviour of these people has been absolutely culpable. People's lives have been destroyed by the actions of incompetent agents in possession who run up enormous bills which have to be paid by the mortgagor. In many cases, this destroys businesses. I have mentioned some of these cases before. Citibank v. the Kalgoorlie Hotel and Bob Couzens was one such case. The bank put the property up for mortgage. It got an offer of $400,000, which it then rejected. Some 12 months later, after running up enormous debts, the bank sold the property for much less money. I believe there should be a facility there to sue Citibank, but that not available. In most of these cases, bankruptcy inevitably follows, but the unsecured creditors are completely shafted; there is no protection whatsoever. In the case of the Commonwealth Development Bank v. Boulder Brick and Tile, which I mentioned in the House the other night, Mr Lloyd Hirst had the facilities, through a friend, to pursue the matter. After much trouble, he has got a court decision saying that he can sue the Commonwealth Development Bank for the losses incurred as its actions were illegal and unprincipled at the time. At the time that occurred, I spoke to the Commonwealth Development Bank about its behaviour, and it was adamant that it was going to make this business pay. If one looks at the details, which I have not got time to go into, one can see that its behaviour was quite thuggish. That is also the case with R&I when it put an agent in possession of Goultpro, an operation in Kalgoorlie. The receiver manager in that case told me that this was such a good business that he was going to run it and make a large profit. It was working profitably and it was actually meeting the payments at the time, and the R&I Bank used subterfuge to get in as the agent in possession. The long and the short of the story is that the agent in possession wrecked the business, ran it at al enormous loss, lost the money for the R& and lost all the money for the unsecure creditors, which was a highly predictabl situation and was almost guaranteed to occu when you get these accountants going into businesses that require a technical expertis which they simply do not have. Nothing i this legislation goes to protect people fro the rapacious attitude of banks in these sort of situations. I also have grave concerns about the present process of bankruptcy, and I am not sure th-t it is going to be addressed by amendments to this bill. Recently, a person in Perth w-s declared bankrupt without any thorough investigation of her financial position. Frpm the balance sheets I have seen of this business-I must say that they are not completeit seems to me that there is a very good is chance that the person in question was not insolvent, but bankruptcy pursued her and that woman will be now entirely ruined. Her predicament has been complicated by a leading Perth law firm which was unable to provide the title when she wanted to clear one of her mortgages, and it was unable to provide the title through its own incompetence. Because it delayed for some time, she lost a source of income-all sorts of money that was going to pay for this affair. Eventually, she became bankrupt, when it is quite clear that the behaviour of that legal firm was certainly in large part responsible for her predicament. She has absolutely no way of fighting the firm. Legal aid will not assist people in these sorts of situations, and she does not have the resources. Those firms can simply waste people by delaying litigation and by using all the legal devices and subterfuges that can be used. That is not addressed in this bill either. In conclusion, the member for Tangney did make a very good contribution. I thought it was well thought out and I think the points he raised do have some merit. I will be looking with interest to see how the minister responds to what I think are substantial objections to this bill in its present form. Debate (on motion by Ms Crawford) adjourned. NA Motion (by Ms Crawford) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Waste Disposal",90
150,Ms WORTH,ADJOURNMENT,"Once again, I raise my concern for citizens of my electorate who live near or work at the Australian National site at the Islington rail yards, Kilburn. This has been a sorry story of neglect-a story of waste being dumped, when the dangers to future generations were not fully realised, and the tragedy of that practice continuing, despite the state laws governing the disposal of waste. It is a story of coverup, cop-out and buck-passing. Australian National took over this site in July 1975 from the Dunstan government. Prior to that time and since then, up until at least 1985-and some workers say after that-waste, including large quantities of asbestos, solid cyanide, acids, lead and arsenic, have been disposed of at the Islington rail yards. South Australia's Environment Protection Authority says that there are more than 200,000 tonnes of waste at this site. The saga of this site is extraordinary. Time does not permit me to record each step which has been taken to highlight the problem. Workers and residents have been ignored by AN. I have in my possession letters dated March 1985, from the Waste Management Commission in South Australia to both AN and the then Department of the Arts, Heritage and the Environment, expressing 'serious concern with regard to the waste disposal practices which have taken place' at the site of the Islington rail yards. Over a considerable length of time residents and workers have been concerned for their health. Last December I spoke in .this place calling on the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) to face up to his ministerial responsibilities and bring AN into line. Since then, I have been involved in a series of meetings and have highlighted the issues in the media. Last week the Advertiser covered the story on three days, and then did so again today. The Weekend Australian also drew attention to the plight of workers who have suffered asbestos related diseases and the campaign under way to force AN into a satisfactory clean-up of the site. The ABC and commercial radio and television have also covered these issues ..' < After the site received publicity late last year, AN suddenly decided that it had no further use for this land, this poisoned chalice, and that it could be handed back to the state government. AN management stated its intention to cap the site but not clean it up. Not surprisingly, the South Australian government has legal advice to the effect that it does not have to take back this contaminated land in its present state. . I argue that AN has behaved in a way that has shown scant regard for workers and residents. It ignored state legislation, and it is interesting to quote the South Australian Waste Management Act of 1979 under which AN operated. It states: Any premises to be used' for the purpose of the reception, storage treatment or disposal of waste must be licensed as a depot . . . It continues: . . . requiring the occupier of the depot to carry out proper procedures relating to waste management and to take proper precautions to prevent or minimise environmental damage ... It further continues: ... where a depot is not licensed as required by this section, or a condition of a licence relating to a depot is not complied with, the occupier of the depot shall be guilty of an offence . . . Under a section headed 'Control of undesirable practices', the act states: 1) Where the Commissioner is satisfied(a) that a person has failed to comply with this Act and (b) that in consequence (i) a nuisance or offensive condition (ii) conditions injurious to health or safety (iii) damage to the environment has been caused or is threatened the Commissioner may by order in writing served upon that person, require him to carry out, or to refrain from carrying out any action specified order. Of course, AN would argue that, because it is a Commonwealth authority, it is immune from such laws. But a senior officer of the South Australia EPA puts it this way: AN has benefited in the past from disposal practices which, if they had been carried out by the private sector, would have led to prosecution. At best their approach has been irresponsible and unethical. Under no circumstances should the state have to bear the cost of these practices. In a Senate estimates committee meeting Senator Faulkner wriggled out of questioning from Senator Kemp on his responsibility for this toxic dump with the excuse that 'the issue is a matter for Mr Brereton who is the Minister for Transport'. But the Minister for Transport has been variously reported as saying that he is still considering the matter or that the matter is for AN alone. Now I am calling on the disinterested Minister for Transport to realise his responsibility and announce his plans for the clean-up of the Islington rail yards. Child Disability Allowance",92
151,Mr WAKELIN,ADJOURNMENT,"We hear a lot from this government about its alleged concern for the Aussie battler. But almost every day in my electorate I hear stories of people who are genuinely in need of support from the government but unable to obtain it. The following story demonstrates how arrogant this government has become. A young mother in Port Lincoln has been battling with the Department of Social Security and the appeals tribunal for two years. She has been applying for the child disability allowance for her young son who has a severe gastro-reflux condition which has seen him in and out of hospital since being born. To obtain the CPA, the child requires a greater than ordinary level of care than another child of the same age. The child's condition must also be ongoing. Looking at this mother's case, I truly believe she fits these criteria. However, her application has been rejected time and again. On the question of needing more than the normal level of care, this child has been in and out of hospital and has great difficulty in eating and sleeping in the normally. He requires almost constant comforting and attention to help him cope with the pain that he is going through. He also requires a list of medication which is essential but also expensive. On the second count of the condition being ongoing, since this little boy was born-two years ago-he has suffered from this same condition. He has been in and out of the hospital, with the latest visit being last month. How much more ongoing does his condition have to be before the department will recognise him? It is important to note that other children who suffer from severe reflux have been able to qualify for CDA. Fitting into the criteria stated above can be a very subjective task. Who is to say that this baby does not require more care than the ordinary child? Who is to say that his condition has not been ongoing? Yet that is what the DSS and the appeals tribunal have found. The mother tells me that the doctor who gave evidence at the appeals tribunal was not even a paediatrician. However, her doctor, who is a paediatrician, also gave evidence to the tribunal. Her doctor stated his belief that the son did require more than the ordinary level of care. Why did the tribunal prefer the Commonwealth doctor's opinion to the paediatrician's opinion? The very sad thing about this case is that the mother in question has had two battles on her hands over the past two years. Not only has she had to cope with the stress associated with her son's condition; she has come up against a government which will not assist her with her medical and travel costs and will not even acknowledge that there is a problem. The mother has continually had to travel between her home in Port Lincoln and Adelaide to obtain medical care for her son and to deal with the DSS and the appeals tribunal. It has been a harrowing and frustrating two years. The final irony is that her second son has the same condition and may well require the same ongoing level of care and medical attention. The only thing she is asking is that the government listen to her. She has asked but so far the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) has totally ignored this request. I received a letter from the parliamentary secretary last week saying that there is no further purpose in discussing this case. The mother is angry about being brushed off. She is a taxpayer and has been told that she has no right to discuss this matter further. On her behalf, I ask the minister to come out of his ivory tower in Canberra and take a look at what is happening in some of these appeals tribunals because the Australian battler is losing out. Nuclear Testing in the Pacific Child Care",93
152,Mr HAVILAND,ADJOURNMENT,"Macarthur) (7.37 p.m.)You can tell that an election is not too far away from the antics of the opposition in the last week or so. In many ways it is not unusual for the opposition to carry on the way that it has. We have seen the outrageous hypocrisy over the French nuclear testing from the opposition. It is as though suddenly the opposition has discovered that nuclear tests are a bad thing. It wants to take the moral and political high ground from the Labor Party, which has had a track record of commitment to this issue for 20 or 30 years. I have not heard the opposition talk very much about the attitude of the Menzies government when the British tests at Maralinga took place. Some opposition members have rather selective memories, particularly the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer). I recall his righteous indignation about the government's position, the Left's position and everyone else's position the Labor Party. The father of the honourable member for Mayo was a member of the Menzies cabinet when the Maralinga tests were carried out. The member for Mayo criticised the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) by saying that he would have been making a lot more noise if it had been the British government carrying out nuclear testing at Mururoa. Of course, it was the British government which carried out tests at Maralinga in the far north of South Australia and we do not hear much from the opposition about that. It is funny about that. We have had the hypocrisy of the opposition trying to oppose the government's amendments to the child-care legislation. Even though we concede that there is some genuine concern in the community about the people's perceptions of the measures outlined in that legislation, the opposition once again has jumped on the bandwagon trying to take the high moral ground over child care-of all things! For the opposition to be moralistic about any social policy introduced by this government is a joke, particularly concerning child· care. The opposition seemed to forget about child care during the 1993 election campaign until the last minute when it realised that it would be subject to a 15 per cent GST. The opposition had to change its policy and produce Fightback II to exclude child care. On most issues the opposition is years behind community opinion. In the past the Labor Party, particularly those in the Left, have been criticised for being ahead of public opinion in terms of social reforms and social policy. I think this government has got it pretty right over the last few years. We can be criticised in a few areas for going too fast or too slow. With regard to keeping up with public opinion and community opinion on social policy, the opposition is years and years behind. One of the more glaring examples of hypocrisy on the coalition side is its continual pursuit of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), particularly from those in Western Australia. There is now a royal commission in Western Australia, which in is clearly a political kangaroo court and a witch hunt trying to discredit a federal Labor minister who happens to be a former Premier of Western Australia. It is clear that there is an election coming, but it is also clear that the opposition has no policies. It has nothing to go to the people with. It jumps on the bandwagon about French tests and takes every opportunity to score points, but it has nothing to offer the people of Australia, other than to cling to the monarchy, states rights and all those shibboleths of the Menzies era. After its 50 or 51 years of existence-whatever it is now-it has nothing to go to the people with. I do not think the government has much to fear in the next election. We have been here for 12 years-and it might be 13 years by the time the election comes up-but I think you will find that the people of Australia will once again re-elect a Labor government, because the opposition has nothing to offer contemporary Australians.  are talking about here?",94
153,Mr HA VILAND,ADJOURNMENT,"You can all sling off at me about losing preselection. That is fine. I have to look at my future. But one thing I will not be doing is providing comfort or encouragement to the forces of darkness and the forces of evil that are represented by the opposition in this parliament. I think the Labor Party, which has a new Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), from today, can go fairly confidently to the next election. Nancarrow, Mr R.",95
154,Mr HICKS,ADJOURNMENT,"Riverina) (7.41 p.m.)Tonight I wish to bring to the federal parliament's attention a great character of Broken Hill and the Western Division of New South Wales and a great Australian, Ron Nancarrow, who passed away on 4 May 1995. Ron was born disabled in Broken Hill in 1915 and spent various periods in hospital during his first 10 years of life. His condition ted in Ron having to spend most of his life on crutches and, in the last 10 years of his life, Ron was restricted to a wheelchair. At the age of 18, Ron opened a boot making and repair shop in the back room of his parents' home, but this was unsuccessful. His next job was to demolish facilities on a mine site at Broken Hill using expertise he had gained from watching demolition teams from his bed on the verandah of a Sydney hospital. He later obtained other demolition contracts in the Western Division, acting as a supervisor for the labourers and instructing them in his demolition methods. An example of Ron's spirit was shown when he obtained a job with a contractor and worked on his knees with a pick and shovel helping to dig the footings of the Broken Hill Hospital. The legend is that he was taunted by other labourers, as he made them look silly because he managed to dig more holes than they did. When the Second World War broke out, Ron tried to enlist in the army but failed on medical grounds. He then enlisted in the RAAF as a cook but, when he travelled to Adelaide, the authorities saw he was disabled and informed him that his expertise was not required. He then joined British Tube Mills and obtained a job as an examiner for the Owen Bren gun, but was later manpowered from this job to Mootoroo Station as a cook and then leading hand and bookkeeper. Later Ron bought a block in Menindee, now part of the Menindee Lake system, on the Darling River in western New South Wales and had 5,000 tomato plants ready to harvest when two freak cyclones on consecutive days wiped out his crop. Not to be disheartened, Ron obtained a job with the zinc corporation as a cook on a field group called Enterprise Exploration and, with that company, travelled to the now well-known Moomba gas field searching for oil. Ron later became a traveller for Benjamins, a Broken Hill store, travelling to all parts of the Western Division. He later opened a commercial agency and a debt collection service. Over the years, Ron was secretary of the Sunset Strip progress association of Menindee resul- Lake and held that position for 15 major development years. He nominated as an alderman of the Broken Hill City Council and was elected in 1974 and served the city with honour. Ron retired from his business in 1975 but kept up many interests, including being chairman and vicechairman of the National Party in Broken Hill. Ron had many interests but two great loves. His first great love was his family and, in particular, his wife, Jule, without whose loving care Ron would have found life to be infinitely more difficult. His second great love was the Australian bush and the people of the outback-in particular, he loved Broken Hill. He joined the National Party in Broken Hill because he believed that to survive the city needed a new approach. On many occasions, the course he took did not enamour him with many people in the existing establishment. It must be said however that all who knew him-including his political enemiesadmired his guts and tenacity. The main thing I will remember about Ron was his integrity and courage. Ron expected all people to live up to the level of honour and integrity that guided his life, and this was asking a great deal from any person. I regarded Ron as a personal friend whose advice I always appreciated, and I will sorely miss him. I am sure members would join with me in offering condolences to Jule and Ron's family. I will miss this great Australian character, as I am sure many, particularly those in Broken Hill and the Western Division, will also. University of Western Sydney",95
155,Mr LATHAM,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to speak in support of the federated structure of the University of Western Sydney, which is in my electorate of Werriwa. There has been a recent controversy about the university's future, with elements within the Nepean campus arguing that the federation should be dissolved and Nepean should establish itself as a separate university. There are three very good reasons why this should not happen and why the University of Western Sydney should continue with a federated structure. First, it is only a young university, not yet six years old. It is yet to reach its best economy of scale in terms of attracting quality research and teaching staff. There is a benefit for the university to continue its development within its federated structure to gain the status and prestige needed to upgrade the quality of its research and teaching staff. That should be a very important objective for each of the university managers and professional staff. In many respects, the university is yet to fulfil its promise within its current structure. The people of western Sydney; while inspired and holding great hopes for the future of the university, are now looking for the hard edge of results. Those results can best be achieved within the federated structure that was adopted in 1989. The second reason for maintaining the current structure is that the component parts of the university-the three campuses, Nepean, Hawkesbury and Macarthur-in their own right would be much too small to sustain a university. I now refer to the university's 1993 annual report. At that time Hawkesbury had 4,500 students and four faculties, Macarthur had 6,500 students and five faculties and Nepean had 10,000 students and seven faculties. Each of those campuses would be much too small to justify a university that in tum could achieve the economy of scale and the status and prestige needed to do the region justice. So it is too small in the component parts. Those figures make the point that Nepean, far from being disadvantaged by the current arrangements, has been the great beneficiary. It has had the largest student enrolment, the highest number of teaching staff, the highest number of faculties and the most amount of government funding support. There is no argument that Nepean has in some way been disadvantaged out of the federated structure. It is far from being the poor cousin of the University of Western Sydney. It may well have been upset by some of the recent decisions-for instance, to allocate the law school to the Macarthur campus adjoining my electorate-but in the long haul of funding decisions Nepean has no reason to object to the federated structure. If it were to be established as a university in its own right, it would leave the ridiculous circumstance of Hawkesbury, in the north-west of Sydney, being actually geographically separated from the Macarthur campus in the south-west of Sydney. So Hawkesbury and Macarthur could not survive collectively as a new university. They would have to split into an arrangement whereby Western Sydney would go from one to three universities. It is completely untenable in the geography and the current status and size of the university and each of the faculties. The third reason for maintaining the federation is that the university should see strength in a federated structure. Other parts of the world-I suppose most notably, the Sorbonne in Paris-have demonstrated how there can be strength in a federation. It can cater for diversity among each of the three campuses and the large greater western Sydney region, yet still benefit from the scale, prestige and the economies that arise from a single university status. For the future, there is to be an internal review of the university structure. The university and its administrators should have regard for recent announcements by the federal and state ministers, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) and John Aquilina. I congratulate them for wanting to maintain the university injts current structure and to see it grow, prosper and progress for the student body and aspirations of western Sydney. I declare my confidence for the new vicechancellor, Professor Schroeder. He is a very talented person and has every opportunity to produce better results for the university as it progresses in years to come. If anything, I would encourage federal and state members of parliament representing the region to continue the lobbying effort to make sure there is a redistribution of funding for teaching, search and capital purposes to give our growth region its best chance, capitalising on the benefits of federation-the prestige, status and economy of scale-but also enjoying the benefits of diversity from having three campuses acting in a coordinated and sensible fashion. Carrum Downs",96
156,Mr ATKINSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Isaacs) (7.50 p.m.)Residents of the fast growing area of Carrum Downs were delighted when the Downs shopping centre in Hall Road opened in November 1994. Finally they could have an adjacent major supermarket, as well as a good variety of specialist stores. However, the 14,000-plus residents of Carrum Downs and Skye urgently require an Australia Post licensed post office in one of the businesses at the shopping centre. At such a large regional facility, there is an expectation that an Australia Post outlet should be there. I understand that the National Australia Bank is considering whether to be the first bank to open at the centre. The existing delivery annexe in Lathams Road has courteous staff who are very busy each day making deliveries to and accepting mail from the area's businesses. However, it is not designed for retail customers. Carrum Downs has a large population of young families, including sole parents, as well as many older residents at the Brotherhood of St Laurence's G.K. Tucker settlement. To get to the Lathams Road Australia Post facility, mothers have to struggle with their prams along, firstly, the divided Hall Road, cross the busy Frankston-Dandenong road and then walk along the undivided Lathams Road, which lacks a footpath. In wet weather, the journey is even harder. The Downs centre manager, Christine Grayland, wrote to Australia Post on 6 December and on 29 December 1994 Australia Post's area support office in Frankston wrote back saying: ... At this point in time Australia Post does not plan to open a licensed post office in the area. This request may be looked at in the future ... Since March, Mr Barry Waterford of the re- Carrum Downs newsagency-itself a business that has relocated from another address to be part of this new shopping centre-has organised a petition with close to 5,000 signatures of local residents or users of the shopping centre. That petition has been or is in the process of being forwarded to Australia Post. The petition calls on Australia Post to establish an outlet within the Carrum Downs shopping centre in the interests of safety and convenience. I support this petition. Australia Post's former agent at Carrum Downs onsold that licence some 12 months ago to the operator of the Belvedere Park news agency . At that time, a non-standard clause was inserted in the licensed post ·office agreement which said that the Belvedere Park news agent has the first option over relocation to the Carrum Downs regional shopping centre, although he must then give up his post office facilities at Belvedere Park. Australia Post is keen to avoid too many licensed post offices. It fears that it might end up in court. Certainly, the Belvedere Park licensee paid a substantial amount to commence his business. It seems to me that Australia Post has got itself into some trouble by inserting this non-standard clause. After all, Belvedere Park is not within walking distance for many Carrum Downs or Skye residents. Australia Post should be awarding licences by open public tender rather than inserting unusual clauses that could be read as giving the go-ahead for under-the-counter arrangements. Cranbourne, rightly, now has two post offices with the Thompson Parkway shopping centre outlet opening in the past year. Hallam has a new licensed post office, as does Blind Bight. Why can Carrum Downs not have just one Australia Post outlet? There is more demand for a post office at the Carrum Downs regional shopping centre than there is at Belvedere Park.  undertaking to my office on 30 May that he would investigate this matter urgently, rather than defer its consideration for six to 12 months as had been envisaged by Australia Post. I call upon Mr Warren Hahnel of Australia Post's retail division to act quickly to ensure that the people of Carrum Downs obtain the post office that they clearly require at the Downs shopping centre. Telecommunications Carriers  of the telecommunications national code requires carriers to 'be accountable to government bodies and the public for their activities'. Over the last few years, local government authorities across Australia-and their residents-have learned just what this means in practice when planning issues are concerned. The 1991 Telecommunications (Exempt Activities) Regulations and the Telecommunications Act effectively exempt our phone carriers from state and territory law and local planning regulations. In my home state of South Australia, the councils are being given a quick lesson in technical convergence and learning more about what the act means to them. They are now concerned that fibre optic cable being laid under Adelaide streets for pay TV will kill or topple suburban trees on a massive scale unless the current regulations are amended. The Electricity Trust Vegetation Regulations Review Committee, which comprises members of more than 20 metropolitan councils, fears if roots are cut laying cables, trees in Adelaide's suburbs will start dying and failing over. The councils are not only anxious over the environmental impact of cable laying, they are shocked to discover that they could be fighting battles once again where, like attempts to oppose mobile phone towers, they have virtually no chance of success. Pay TV companies have rejected the councils' claims. Galaxy is currently broadcasting, via microwave, a delivery system ideally suited to Adelaide, but it plans to connect later to Foxtel's underground cable system when it is installed. Telecom says in most cases it is threading cables through existing phone line conduits, while Optus Vision is using overhead cables connected to existing poles. While pay TV providers might claim they are environmentally friendly, all of these delivery systems have their down sides. Satellite and microwave dishes mar buildings. Underground cabling must be done carefully to avoid damage to plant life and, in a state where the stobie pole has made its unique contribution to urban blight, more above ground cabling is scarcely wanted. The telecommunications national code comes up for review at the end of this month. There is overwhelming evidence that suggests significant change is needed. I am sure that every member of this House who represents an urban electorate has been approached by constituents and local councils with concerns over the siting of mobile phone towers. Sometimes this may be nothing more than understandable, if self-interested, NIMBYism. However, there should be genuine cause for concern. In this matter, the balance of favour is totally weighted in favour of telecommunication carriers. The importance of the issue is being increasingly recognised in this place. Just over 12 months ago, Senator Margaret Reid in the other place gave notice of a motion condemning the government for breaching the integrity of the national capital plan 'by giving unique authority to telecommunications carriers. . . to erect towers on Canberra's hilltops for use by their mobile phone networks'. The motion went on to call on the government to review the draft telecommunications national code and the Telecommunications (Exempt Activities) Regulations from both an environmental and historic perspective. The historic perspective is important as, across Australia, current laws are allowing telecommunications carriers to entirely override planning laws and city plans. No-one would dispute the price and service benefits phone consumers have enjoyed since deregulation. However, as the member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) pointed out only a few weeks ago, we have set an enormous precedent that permits companies to ignore the safeguards the community has developed over a long period as they seek to make profits. We need to ensure that local government-and ordinary citizens-have more control over their environment. The telecommunications code claims to require carriers to be accountable to government bodies and the public for their activities, and yet the Telecommunications (Exempt Activities) Regulations provides them with blanket exemptions from planning laws. The code sets out detailed requirements on how plans must be prepared and made public, but there is virtually no redress once the carriers have decided what they want to do. The only authority that can alter their plans is the Secretary to the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories. Technological convergence is increasing the power and importance of telecommunications carriers. We scarcely wish to impede the processes of new technologies and the information services they can allow us to access, but we must redress the current laws that have made their providers all powerful. Nuclear Testing in the Pacific",97
157,Mr RONALDSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Yesterday I unfortunately did not have the chance to speak on the motion before the House. I would like tonight, in the short time available, to talk about the French government's decision to recommence underground nuclear testing. I express my personal outrage, and that of my wife, Cate-and, equally importantly, the outrage of many thousands of my constituents, many hundreds of whom have contacted me over the last three or four days. The French decision is selfish and immoral. It has put at risk the long standing relationship between our two countries and the health of many thousands of people in our region. I do not for one minute believe that this decision would in any way be supported by the French people.

160,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Last Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 1995, I foreshadowed intended to take was to identify the three areas to have a review of matters in relation to those Senate committee on community affairs. I identified the qualification requirements for the disability supplement, the provision that native title rights when applying the assets test in the act, and payments and the application of provisions sum compensation provisions. We will not be seeking to divide on these examination of one or other of these proposed will not foreshadow that we can be convinced raised, but it may well be that we are open to two. The third matter that I wanted to advert to settlements. In 1993 the government sought compensation provisions in the act. It was involved myself and the Minister for Social see as a difficulty for the government in relation are dealt with. I also flagged very clearly where people receive compensation payments aspects of damage they may have suffered, takes into account compensation received for pocket expenses or other expenses of a like character. We do not deny that there have been some period can operate, particularly in settlements hands and are not the subject of independent compensation arrangements in a form which period. That is fairly obvious and that is why it was inadequate to simply move to address by a 50 per cent rule which no longer required order for the rule to apply and therefore half related payment. The government has not come back with an the approach that was taken before. The government MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1883 Tuesday, 20 June 1995 took the chair at 12.45 p.m. AMENDMENT BILL (No.1) 1995 Second Reading night, in relation to the Social Security that the approach that the opposition of possible contention and to flag our desire three areas, preferably in the Senate by the those areas as the amendments that clarify support pension and disability wage and interests are not to be taken into account the amendment in relation to split compensation to claimants and assessment of periodic and lump issues in committee. It may well be, after the amendments, that we will not oppose them. I in relation to all of the matters that have been persuasion in relation to one of them or perhaps in particular is related to the question of split unsuccessfully to make amendments to the the subject of a good deal of discussion which Security as we sought to work around what we to the way in which compensation matters a view I have, which my colleagues share, that, which are clearly related to non-income earning there ought not to be a preclusion period which what might have been pain and suffering, out-ofsituations in which the lump sum preclusion where the matters are largely in people's own review, where people have sought to put the will exclude the operation of the preclusion the government wants to address the issue. But this issue, as the government proposed before, payments to have an economic component in of any lump sum would be treated as an income amendment to achieve that purpose, which was now proposes that, if a person receives NA MC 1884 MAIN COMMITTEE more than one payment arising out of the same lost earnings or a lost earnings capacity, to which the 50 per cent rule will apply. The government claims that the amendment management of compensation payments, as I amount is made in respect of a loss of earnings expressed in respect of non-economic loss, covered by the compensation recovery positions, compensation. The government has told us Tribunal in which the tribunal recommended that Although this amendment is not the same our view, similarly seek to undermine the compensation payment. The Welfare Rights Movement, on social security issues, and the National criticised this amendment on the basis that parties and undermines the purpose of pain and for. non-economic losses the same as That matter can be the subject of further deliberation, questions there needs to be a way in which compensated only for pain and suffering, and a minimal element of economic loss, can be relation to people involved in accidents who who may be totally reliant upon social security only limited numbers of people affected by justify it. So I would encourage the advisers to the matter back time and time again, to display a addresses the problem that has clearly been certain resolution of view in ensuring that it to all parties. We do not want to see the revenue circumstances which are not the case, but we are entitled to compensation for pain and suffering purpose. As I mentioned, so far as the handling of to have the first matters that I addressed-the and the disability wage, the provisions to impairment issue-referred to the Senate committee. persuasion from either side on those issues. Some very powerful arguments have been movement. They ought to be heard. The department not think it is before the parliament at this addressed. It may well be important that in department has a view about the way in which what I believe to be the relevant sections. Tuesday, 20 June 1995 event and at least one of the payments is for the person will be taken to receive one lump sum, is necessary, due to the current trend in the have mentioned, when one settlement for a low and earnings capacity and a larger amount is for pain and suffering. The larger amount is not as it does not fall within the definition of about a case before the Administrative Appeals legislation be amended to close this loophole. as the amendment proposed in 1993, it does, in integrity of the non-economic component of a the South Australian body that advises Federation of Blind Citizens of Australia have it undermines legal settlements made between suffering settlement by treating money received money to compensate for loss of earnings. but it seems to me that in all of these the genuine cases where people have been where there is no element of economic loss or dealt with. These circumstances can arise in have next to no income, who may be unemployed, payments. The argument that there may be a measure of this sort does not, in my judgment, government, who seem to be keen to bring this little lateral thinking, to find a mechanism that identified and about which we have indicated a is dealt with in a way which is demonstrably fair ripped off by people who are fabricating do want to see a situation in which those who have it treated as compensation for that this matter is concerned, we will obviously seek issues relating to the disability support pension clarify the meaning of work and the 20 per cent We have flagged that we are open to advanced, particularly by the welfare rights has given me written advice-and I do stage-as to how it believes these matters will be its deliberations the Senate is aware that the these matters will be addressed. I will just quote The department had this to say: NA Tuesday, 20 June 1995 Finally, it should be noted that the Social Security ambiguity in .the Act and there is no contrary intention memorandum, that ambiguity will generally be interpreted specifically excluded under the proposed amendments above, the amendment will not prevent lack of amendments.

So if they are disabled other job, they will be forced-I do not like to move into the employment market. This may know and realise, the community is full of themselves in. What this amendment could mean is that people may be subjected to a mundane type of job which skills-it could mean that.

Over the same period, real wages for MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 20 June 1995 not or would not happen?

But we should be considering lack the energy, or who do have some sort of is a problem within the community. Perhaps but then again, perhaps it is reasonable.

Mr Beddall-The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following in answer to the honourable member's question: Properties leased from the Commonwealth owned estate are listed in the reply given by the Minister for Administrative Services. Information on properties leased from the private sector are not available. The details requested are ""commercial-in-confidence"" in that such disclosure could disadvantage the Commonwealth in its property dealings. On that basis, the detailed information sought by the Honourable Member is not available. Total figures on office space and staff numbers are as follows. DPIE leases approximately 59,065 metres of office space for 3503 staff. The staffing figure does not reflect consultants and other non departmental staff. The total cost of the office estate is approximately $18 million. Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport (Question No. 2069)",117
170,Mr CONNOLLY,REPRESENTATIVES MAIN COMMITTEE,"the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 27 February 1995: NA Is it a fact that the Los Angeles International, New York La Guardia, Chicago O'Hare International and Boston-Logan International airports routinely conduct operations involving crossing of active runways by taxiing, arriving and departing aircraft; if so, can such operations be introduced at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport; if not, why not.",119
171,Mr BRERETON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has advised that whilst it is a fact that at Los Angeles International, New York La Guardia International, Chicago O'Hare International and Boston-Logan International Airports conduct operations involving crossing of active runways by taxiing, arriving and departing aircraft, not all of these operations occur at all airports. For example, Los Angeles Airport has four area parallel runways and does not have intersecting runway operations. Prior to the commencement of operations on the parallel runway at Sydney, operations were routinely conducted involving Simultaneous Operations on intersecting runways (SIMOPS). The application of SIMOPS was consistent with international practice and was used to overcome a capacity deficiency at the airport. The availability of the parallel runway has enabled a much safer operation, ie parallel in lieu of SIMOPS, while at the same time delivering a more predictable and stable airport capacity. The CAA has advised that on safety grounds it does not recommend the use of the east-west runway while the parallel north-south runway system is in operation. In a media release on 30 November 1994, the Civil Aviation Authority stated that, on safety grounds, it strongly advises against the use of the east-west runway in intersecting operations with the parallel north-south runway system. This position was based on the following considerations: It has been accepted internationally that parallel runway operations are an improvement in safety over intersecting operations. More complex three runway configuration operations would increase workload and complexity for air traffic controllers and pilots, with conflicting traffic patterns both on the ground and in the air. A large number of aircraft would need to cross the active east-west runway to position for off on the parallel runways, or taxiing to the terminals after landing. It is estimated that aircraft would be expected to cross the east-west runway every 45 seconds or less. With the use of the intersecting east-west runway, the required safety corridors to accommodate aircraft carrying out missed approaches could not be readily provided. In respect of parallel runway operations the higher average movement rate and the elimination of the very low bad weather movement rates have already proven beneficial to the industry since operations commenced on the parallel system. The parallel runway configuration, when used to its full capacity, will have a consistently higher movement rate than that attainable using SIMOPS and therefore is the preferred safer mode of operation. Child Support Agency (Question No. 2137) Mr Slipper asked the Assistant Treasurer, upon notice, on 7 March 1995: (1) How many child support (a) payers and (b) payees in matters administered by the Child Support Agency reside in the redistributed electoral divisions of (i) Fisher and (ii) Longman. Fisher Longman Common Postcodes (2) The Child Support Agency does not keep statistics of complaints received by Electorate. (3) The Child Support Agency does not keep national statistics on all types of complaints which may be made to an Agency Branch Office. However, since the 1992/93 financial year the Agency has kept a record of written enquiries and complaints and other letters of comment directed to the Treasurer, Assistant Treasurer or the Agency Executive (e.g. Registrar, Second Commissioner Child Support). This correspondence is analysed by the Agency to determine the areas of concern to correspondents and classified according to a range of identified problem areas. The results of the analysis for 1992/93, 1993/94 and 1994/95 (to March 1995) show the most common areas of concern to be in the failure to collect child support arrears by the (2) How many complaints relating to the Child take- Support Agency were received from child support (a) payers and (b) payees in (i) Fisher and (ii) Longman during each year since the Child Support Agency was established.

172,Mr GEAR,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Information regarding child support payers and payees is stored by the Child Support Agency computer system against the postcode of the client and not by electoral division. Consequently, there are some difficulties in answering this question as postcodes do not correspond exactly with electoral boundaries and many postcodes will relate to more than one electorate. Given the above proviso, the information the Agency can provide in response to this question is as follows: Payees Payers 3090 2753 3362 2707 1947 1818 Agency, accounting for 12%, 14.3% and 17.2% respectively. (4) By way of providing some background to this question it is important to note that statements can be issued either automatically by the child support computer system or upon request from the client. Automatic Statements issue on a monthly or weekly basis. Monthly statements issue on or around 20th of the month and advise clients of their account position. They also advise clients of the amount to be paid next month and thereby serve a dual purpose. Weekly statements issue when a transaction occurs that affects the client's account (for example a variation to the child support liability). This ensures that the client is advised of any adjustment to their account and the new amount payable. These statements are produced at the end of the week and incorporate all transactions that occurred during the week showing a net result. Upon Request Statements A facility also exists where statements can be produced at any time. This allows for a statement to be issued whenever a client may request one. A statement can list all transactions for whatever period the client requires. Receipt of Contradictory Statements While the computer system has been designed to avoid the issuing of contradictory statements on successive days, it is possible but highly unlikely for it to occur. However, as both weekly and monthly statements are produced at the end of the week, it is highly improbable that they would be issued on successive days. It may be possible that Longman 927 Fisher 936 Common 588 These figures do not give any indication that continued to be in arrears in following years (e.g. in arrears in 1989/90). Training. Wage Placement (Question No. 2286) Mr Slipper asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 9 May 1995: When will he provide an answer to question No. 1677 which first appeared on the Notice Paper on 20 October 1994. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I refer the honourable member to the Hansard of 5 June 1995 for the answer to Question No. 1677. NA Indust- GrouQ Grants Clothing, Textiles and 77 $4,946,655 Footwear Automobile Industry 44 $3,126,174 Music Industry 13 Shipping Industry 21 $1,217,501 * 70% of 1994-95 grants paid to date. they are received on successive days if postal delays occur. The issuing of a statement following the request of a client is more likely to cause the receipt of statements on successive days. This could occur when an Agency officer requests a statement without consideration of when the last 'automatic' statement issued. The Agency does receive complaints regarding the issuing of statements. The actual nature of these complaints varies case by case and the Agency does not maintain national statistics on the nature of these complaints.

Mr Lee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Based on Australia Post Australia Post's advertised delivery standard, for mail posted by 6pm, is next business day delivery, within the metropolitan area of the same capital city. (a) KPMG Peat Marwick has recently completed two years of continuous external audit of Australia Post's letter delivery performance. AUST 53 CAN o UK 41 USA 48 Through the external auditing of its letter delivery demonstrated that it provides a reliable, world class improving delivery performance. For example, the delivery within the metropolitan area of the same the March 1993 and March 1995 quarters. The national March quarter result for next business day delivery, within the metropolitan area of the same capital city, was 92.4% on time. (b) There is no redress available in the event of delay in the carriage of delivery of an article sent by ordinary mail. While Australia Post advises that it makes every effort to provide customers with consistent on-time delivery, there are a number of external factors that can influence performance levels. For example, variations in daily mail volumes which put unexpected demands on the mail network, customers posting articles after the advertised closing time, and customers posting articles that bear incorrect, incomplete or illegible addresses. (c) Australia Post's advertised delivery standards are amongst the tightest set by any postal administration in the world. Based on the results of a survey conducted in 1993, Australia Post undertakes to deliver a greater percentage of its total mail more quickly than the postal administrations of Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States. The comparative results of the survey are presented below: Delivery Promises in Terms of Mail Volumes (% of total mail delivered) DAY 1 DAY 2 DAY 3 DAY 4 TOTAL 37 8 2 100 25 50 25 100 o 59 o 100 28 24 o 100 performance, Australia Post considers that it has letter delivery service and that it is committed to on-time delivery performance for next business day capital city improved from 91.9% to 92.4% between",120
