1,The SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Neil Andrew) took the chair at 12.30 p.m., and read prayers. NA Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Committee  half of the Standing Committee on Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, I present the committee's report entitled Connecting Australia!-Wireless broadband, together with the minutes of proceedings. Ordered that the report be printed.  flects seven months of intense work involving eight public hearings at major Australian cities, several private briefings by officers government agencies, and the consideration of 60 submissions from the public. These submissions covered a broad range of views. They included industry participants such as Telstra, Optus, Vodafone, Alcatel, ArrayComm Inc., Motorola, Cisco Systems, Nortel, Integrity Data Systems, SR Telecom, m.Net Corporation, Ericsson Australia, AirNet, and Soul Pattinson Telecommunications. They also included community radio groups like Melbourne Wireless and others. We heard also from educational bodies like the Western Australian Department of Education, and the Australian Information and Communications Technology in Education Committee. In addition, we took into account submissions from state, territory and local governments, as well as university researchers. We heard from organisations representing the hearing impaired, including the Australian Association of the Deaf and the Australian Communication Exchange. We also heard from industry commentators and, of course, the Australian Communications Authority. To all of our submitters, we say thank you. We also thank the many people who addressed us at the public hearings. Our report addresses each of the terms of reference that were set by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts when he first suggested the committee initiate an inquiry into wireless broadband technologies. That was in April this year. So, in tabling today, members will appreciate that the committee has moved speedily to bring down this report. I want to thank members and the committee secretariat for their cooperation in this regard. The committee's 14 recommendations are aimed Report at improving the take-up of wireless broadband in Australia, especially in regional areas. The conclusion reached by the committee is that the solution to the last mile service involves a mix of technologies, both wire line and wireless. Clearly, however, for regional and remote Australia, where wire line solutions are not economically viable in the short to medium term, the last mile problem could be addressed by a variety of wireless techniques. Two possibilities are Nortel's of CDMA2000 and Lucent's 450 MHz CDMA. The committee appreciate that spectrum availability for 400-500 MHz is a problem and so we recommend that the ACA consider allocating spectrum in this range for CDMA450 on an experimental basis. Further, a possible way of bringing broadband services to remote areas involves the use of analog TV bands which will not be employed in the future for digital television services in Australia. These TV bands are able to provide long-distance services without the need for expensive infrastructure. They are to be abandoned at the completion of the analog-digital simulcasts, which will occur in 2008 in urban Australia and somewhat later in regional Australia. Some of the bands are available now in certain areas. Several groups are working on developing technologies for these low-frequency bands, including the ANU BushLAN group, Baltech Pty Ltd and ntl, with its Bushnet proposal. The committee recommends that the ACA and the ABA develop a scheme to allow the trial use of unallocated TV channels for rural wireless broadband links with a view to such spectrum being made available if the trials are successful. This has the potential to provide a uniquely Australian solution to the worldwide problem of long-distance last mile Internet provision. Inexpensive wireless technologies such as these longer wavelength technologies and 802.11-WiFi-could be used to ‘pull' broadband 3G wireless and wire line infrastructure to customers by creating the business case for broadband. In this way, a cheap wireless rollout could later be followed by a wire line rollout providing additional or better services. For both urban and regional Australia, the most exciting technology for wireless broadband is 802.11. The elimination of a carrier licence on the ISM bands for both commercial and non-commercial operation would be a simple regulatory change which would unleash its potential, and we recommend that this be done. For those areas of Australia where DSL or other broadband wire line connections are not yet in place, committee recommend that the ACA should consider raising the power limits on the ISM bands to the equipment's rated values. This should encourage the wider availability of broadband services. In view of the interest that these changes may evoke in the community, the committee recommend that the ACA provide educational services to interested parties, whether they be carriers or non-carriers. We also recommend that training programs be developed for prospective wireless operators in relation to the wireless market and to customer requirements. In the event that these measures lead to much greater use of 802.11 equipment, they may result in cochannel interference and hence the need for a conflict resolution service of some kind to be offered by the ACA. That is another recommendation made by the committee. Should an organisation using 802.11 establish a business case in a certain area, then a profitable company operating on the ISM band could be given the opportunity to move to licensed spectrum. This may be, for example, a mechanism to prove a 3G business model. We recommend that the ACA and the ABA develop procedures to facilitate the migration of wireless activities from ISM bands to adjacent licensed spectrum by streamlining equipment qualification procedures. Greater use of the ISM bands increases the possibility that someone might attempt to use them for illegal activities. The committee consider that the ISM band should be treated in the same manner as all other telecommunications with respect to its capability for interception by the police. Therefore we recommend that a standing bureau or a working party be established to maintain a watching brief on the potential for WiFi and other ISM networks to be used for illegal activities. In order to facilitate the provision of Internet services by small wireless service providers, the committee recommends that the ACA and ACCC develop a mechanism to enable such providers to negotiate wholesale prices for Internet backbone connections. This is particularly important for the delivery of broadband services in areas where the DSL/wireline broadband connections do not yet exist. The committee considers that impediments to the interoperation of wireless ISPs and their access to the Internet backbone should be removed. The committee noted concern about the nature of spectrum licensing procedures. Some witnesses were worried that the cost of spectrum licences is excluding small players and that services are not being provided to non-profitable regions that are under a spectrum licence covering a more profitable urbanised area. Some spectrum allocations have not been utilised owing to the fact that the profitability of the business operation on that spectrum does not justify the price of the spectrum licence in the first place. We therefore call on the ACA and the ABA to establish a spectrum bureau to examine these issues, including considering regionally adjusted spectrum auction reserve prices and financing terms. Some submitters expressed serious concern about the tenure of spectrum licences. The committee recommends that the ACA consider improving the system of licence renewal. Given the trend toward closer convergence of broadcasting, telecommunications and information technology issues, the committee calls upon the government to consider replacing the existing regulatory bodies with one central regulator. The committee strongly believes that the benefits of new wireless broadband technology should flow to everyone in the Australian community. In order that the hearing impaired are not excluded, the government may need to provide some specific encouragement to the industry to take their needs into account; and we recommend accordingly. Wireless broadband has an important role to play in extending the reach of broadband services within Australia, but there is no one particular technology that can solve all of our telecommunications problems. A mix of technologies will be required. The market should be permitted to determine, over time, which ones best suit particular applications. The government should maintain a general regulatory policy of technology neutralitynot favouring any particular technology, whether it be wireless or wire line. Within this overall setting, it is desirable for specific measures to be implemented to improve the understanding and takeup of wireless broadband. I believe the committee's recommendations, if adopted by the government, will go a long way toward achieving this desirable end. On another note altogether, I welcome the member for Adelaide back to the House. It is a pleasure to have her back again.",7
2,Mr HATTON,COMMITTEES,"I concur particularly with the last remark made by the member for Sturt, the Chair of the Standing Committee on Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. I fully endorse everything that has been said by him with respect to the findings of committee and also the processes which we undertook. An important element to underline is the fact that, in every one of the 14 recommendations put forward by the committee, the decision was unanimous. As well as being unanimous in its recommendations, this was a committee that worked extremely well throughout its entire period of operation. It was a very quick span of time within which to put a report together. It is an excellent example of how the parliament can work crossparty as a useful tool for the community at large, almost as a fulcrum between the community and the government. It is very important to note, firstly, that that process can work as well as it did, and it did so because of the openness of the members on the committee to look at a completely new and challenging area. Most of the matters we dealt with were entirely new to just about everyone on the committee. The matters were quite complex and technical and people were open to looking at them afresh. Secondly, the secretariat did-as all of our parliamentary committee secretariats do-an enormous job of organising the committee's basic work. Thirdly, the intensity brought by the people giving evidence, and their genuine fervour for this area, helped to enliven the process. There was terrific communciation between those who gave evidence, the members of the committee and the committee support staff. It is a fabulous example, in an area that is challenging and exciting. It is challenging and exciting because it goes to the core of some of the great challenges that face Australia at the moment. We have always had the key problem of the tyranny of distance. The overland telegraph helped to overcome that, lessening the distance between Australia and the rest of the world. We know that broadband communications and the use of Internet technologies can further shrink the distance between Australia and our overseas markets, in particular as we enter a period of economic change. It has really been going on for more than a century, but it is increasingly taking up pace and direction, and that is moving towards selling knowledge goods rather than just selling physical goods. Australia has had a tremendous history of investing our intellectual capital in improving the way we do things in areas of economic activity. However, we have also had a history where a lot of that has been lacking and we have not got as much out of it as we could have. This new area is one where we can take our whole range of capacities and create an Australia that is knitted together more effectively. The core reason that this committee's investigations are important is that broadband has not yet been taken up broadly within Australia. That is the point that we started from. We said that here is an enabling technology-one that can bring Australian people closer together, one that can make our economy work domestically much more effectively and one that can give us a platform of connectivity to the rest of the world to enable us to expand our exporting capacitybut it is one that is not yet working properly in the wired area. So we looked at why that was the case and we looked at the possibilities in the wireless area that would allow a better conjunction of the use of broadband. We found that it was apparent that: (1) you need a cluster of different technical and technological approaches to meet Australia's communication needs, and that developing that cluster is very important; and (2) the price point is probably the key factor determining why we have not had a great uptake of broadband in Australia, and it is one key thing we need to drive towards in the future. On top of that, the next two to five years probably be the greatest for prospectivity, hope and movement we have seen in wireless broadband. Accordingly, this particular report occurs at a time when the future is opening up in the wireless broadband area. We are happy to have received the evidence we had and to have been able to present a report as strong, well developed and thoughtful as this. I commend the report to the House.  Firstly, I support the remarks made by the member for Sturt and the member for Blaxland. In making my remarks today about the report of the Standing Committee on Communications, Information Technology and the Arts titled Connecting Australia!Wireless broadband, I would like to set the scene by touching firstly on the broad area of technology and its value to our society. The Internet has changed the way we live. It has provided people from all walks of life with a true window to the world right from their own lounge room. As we have seen in many areas of technological development, such as television, the video recorder, the compact disc player, the mobile telephone and many more newer inventions, Australians love to embrace new technology. We are seeing this trend yet again with the Internet as Australians increasingly become more and more comfortable with it. We now find that many Australians are frequently utilising it in a myriad of ways on a day-today basis-in fact, on an hour-to-hour basis and a minuteto-minute basis. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics and many industry analysts, in Australia today, with a population of some 19.7 million people and over 7½ million homes, we have over 4½ million homes with a computer and over 3.6 million Internetready households. Of these, there are an estimated 300,000 broadband-enabled households. This means that every second house in Australia has the Internet and that Australia is very well placed to further leverage and maximise the opportunities that come from technological innovation and, in particular, from broadband. There is often confusion, complexity and, will indeed, an element of mystery surrounding the area of technology when one starts to talk about it. This confusion is more real than ever when you get into the area of broadband. Quite simply, broadband is nothing more than the term given to a service that provides quick access to information-it is like having an express checkout lane to the Internet. When we talk about wireless broadband, it is simply accessing information quickly while being mobile; in others words, not being plugged into or hamstrung by a hole in the wall that we typically use for other media services. The presence of broadband itself has significantly increased in Australia in recent times. However, despite the recent growth, there remains discussion around the key areas of broadband price, access, use and, indeed, need. The committee's report will be a valuable vehicle for further discussion around these issues and for the progression of several new initiatives for this important area. As we have heard, the report is the result of over six months work by the committee members and the committee secretariat. The committee received 60 submissions during the inquiry. What is particularly worth noting is the diverse array of people and organisations that made submissions. For example, submissions were received from private individuals with a keen interest in this area through to some of Australia's major corporations. As a result, the committee was provided with a broad range of representations that has led, I believe, to an objective and technologically non-biased report that will prove useful in furthering the debate around this important initiative. The report puts forward a total of 14 recommendations. Importantly, in chapter 8 of the report there is discussion on the trends affecting wireless broadband into the future: trends like the convergence of telecommunications, IT and broadcasting-that worldwide trend that is converging those three areas into the broad area of ICT. Technology and how Australia embraces it and maximises it is a key plank to our future. Broadband, both wire lined and wireless, are a fundamental part of this. I commend the report to the House.

3,Ms GRIERSON,COMMITTEES,"Like my colleagues, I am very pleased to be part of presenting the Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Standing Committee report Connecting Australia!-Wireless broadband to parliament. The inquiry conducted by our committee was particularly worthwhile and very informative. The provision of wireless broadband is a complex area of new technologies, and much technical analysis of the present options being introduced and trialed in Australia was required. The report gives an excellent overview of these technologies and, for someone like me who was not aware of them, it is a wonderful text in its own It also explores the flexibility and mobility which will be required more and more in communications and information in this current information age. Obviously the use of wireless communications will increase. The report takes the view that government should not attempt to dictate the type of technology used to implement wireless broadband in Australia, recommending instead that government adopt a technology neutral approach. That position is obviously supported by all the committee and is strongly recommended given the wonderful initiatives being taken. However, it is difficult for the CIT industry to address the other issues such as equity and affordability in access, or accelerating uptake and encouraging regional and rural initiatives. The report goes a long way in making recommendations that, should they be adopted by government, will certainly assist in those very important areas. Particular analysis of the last mile, taking wireless broadband to remote and isolated areas where cost and access are more difficult, has been a major feature of the inquiry and I congratulate all that have been involved in it. I join the member for Blaxland in acknowledging the benefit of the report and the work of all who contributed to this report. I also congratulate the participants and the many people who willingly made submissions to the inquiry, who shared their expertise and experiences and expressed their views and advice in a frank and honest way. The report is obviously much improved because of the quality of that input. The report's recommendations give good guidance on options and ways forward. The chairman, the member for Sturt, covered those technical recommendations particularly well. The report cannot cover all the issues, but it has played a most important role in highlighting other areas that need to be looked at in future and what an incredible area this will be for government in the challenges that lie ahead. The report makes recommendations on the needs of the disabled community, particularly hearing impaired people, which need careful attention. Due to its size, the market will not attract much attention from way. commercial providers, but it is absolutely essential that government finds ways to assist the take up of modern technology that is mobile, flexible and attractive, particularly to young people with disabilities. Equitable and affordable access in regional and rural Australia is something that we are all very aware of and the report goes some way to doing something about it. The report highlightsand I congratulate the regional presentersproblems in regional Australia and will assist regional areas, should the recommendations be followed. E-business is ready to assist in rural places and, should the report be adopted, will be encouraged to do so. Arising from the information we gained, another area the government may look at in future reports and inquiries is the amazing application of wireless broadband to transport. Being part of the committee, we realised the opportunities for the use of this technology in the transport industry. Finally, I point out that there is much more to be done in encouraging the take up of this sort of technology. One of the saddest submissions-and I have had it in other committees as well-has been the Ericsson experience, which demonstrates just how important it is for us to assist companies which are willing to buy into this area. We certainly need to look at e-education, emedicine and e-transport, which I talked about before, to make our market more reactive to the needs of this industry. I register my appreciation to the chairman, the member for Sturt, for his inclusive and encouraging manner in conducting this inquiry. I commend the report to the parliament for its consideration.",11
4,Mr HATTON,COMMITTEES,"I am happy to begin my second innings, having bowled myself out in the first one, but I have only five minutes to go. I want to thank Brendan Egan, who assisted the committee so well during the early part of the hearings before he took up a job at Austrade. Given that we had a report to write and Brendan was not readily to hand-although he provided a summary of where we might goinvaluable assistance came to us from Professor Harris and Dr Borg, who gave unbiased evidence to the committee. We thank them for their work in preparing the report for us and putting a great deal of meat on the bones of that report. They did a tremendous job in an extremely difficult area. As with most reports, we hope that we will get a bit of a run with regard to this report, Connecting Australia!-Wireless broadband. We know that people will have a bit of a look at the executive summary and we hope that they will look at the recommendations, which are extremely strong. When that happens, what will come out of it will possibly be a very human story, one which struck us very strongly while we were hearing the evidence. It relates to recommendation 12, which recommends the Commonwealth develop the means to provide hearing impaired people with mobile telephones compatible with hearing aids, portable wireless devices that can communicate through the National Relay Service and appropriately adapted video compression and transmission technology for video communication using sign language. Every member of the committee who heard the evidence of hearing impaired people was tremendously impressed: one, with their capacity and fluency; two, with the real problems that they try to overcome and the fact that they bear an enormous cost relative to the costs that other people face. Telstra could go a long way to helping these people by looking at the current charge mechanisms. New technologies such as this offer much increased and better access for people who are hearing impaired, particularly if their first language is a spoken language. For the hearing impaired whose first language is sign language, this report is an indication that we can assist them in communicating fluently, effectively and cogently and in arguing extremely strongly, effectively, theatrically and dramatically within the community.",12
5,The SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Order! The honourable member for Blaxland's dexterity may have been challenged in saying that he bowled himself out. In this case-I think it may be topical-he has been caught by the standing orders because the time allotted for statements has expired. Does the member for Sturt wish to move a motion in connection with the report to enable it to be debated on a future occasion?  That the House take note of the report. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted.,12
6,The SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"In accordance with standing order 102B, the debate is adjourned. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting, and the member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. Electoral Matters Committee Report",12
7,Mr GEORGIOU,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I present the committee's report entitled Review of audit report No. 42 of 2001-02: integrity of the electoral roll. Ordered that the report be printed.",12
8,Mr GEORGIOU,COMMITTEES,"The report I have just tabled on behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters presents the committee's findings and recommendations arising out of a review of the Auditor General's report on the integrity of the toral roll. Audit report No. 42 2001-02: Integrity of the electoral roll was tabled in April this year. The integrity of the electoral roll is of fundamental importance to Australia's system of representative democracy and it has been the subject of a number of previous inquiries. Audit report No. 42 analysed the key components of electoral roll integritynamely, accuracy, completeness, validity and security-and it also reviewed the effectiveness of the Australian Electoral Commission's management of the electoral roll in ensuring the roll's integrity. The AEC agreed with all 12 recommendations made by the Australian National Audit Office. The committee also broadly agrees with the ANAO's recommendations, and it has made 10 recommendations itself. Following on from comments about unanimity made on behalf of the Standing Committee on Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, I should also say that these recommendations were unanimous and have been made with a view to enhancing the integrity of the electoral roll, improving aspects of the Electoral Commission's management of the roll and, ultimately, reinforcing public confidence in this critical component of Australia's democracy. The committee considers that the components of integrity-accuracy, completeness, validity and security-should be tested and reported on regularly. The testing and reporting should be comprehensive, rigorous and transparent. In addition, the AEC should set targets for the accuracy, completeness and validity of the electoral roll where such targets do not presently exist, and the targets should be used as performance indicators for the AEC. Key features of an electoral roll with high integrity are accuracy and validity-that is, that the roll contains accurate and up-to-date information on individuals who are enrolled and that only those who are eligible are so enrolled. These elements are important because they provide a level of assurance that the risk of electoral fraud occurring in our electoral system is minimal. A standout feature of the audit report was elec- the finding that the ANAO had independently validated that the roll was ‘96 per cent accurate'. It has to be said that a figure like this inspires a great deal of confidence. However, on closer examination it became apparent that the independent data matching by the Audit Office only established that the electoral roll was accurate to 96 per cent as to names and dates of birth. The ANAO did not establish that people defined by name and date of birth were correctly enrolled in the state, the division or at the address at which they resided. In the absence of such matching, the committee considers that the audit conclusion of 96 per cent accuracy is not proven. However, the committee also believes it is important to note that the finding of 96 per cent accuracy as to names and dates of birth on the roll does not necessarily imply that there is four per cent inaccuracy. In seeking to test accuracy, the ANAO found that 4.4 per cent of people on the electoral roll did not appear on Medicare records. The ANAO attempted to match these people to the motor vehicle registry records the AEC had access to-namely, those of South Australia, Queensland, the ACT and the Northern Territory. The ANAO did not seek to match addresses; nevertheless, it concluded that 15 per cent of the electors who were matched to motor vehicle records had vehicles registered in a state other than the state in which they were enrolled to vote. The ANAO explained that it understood that this was generally due to people being correctly entered on the electoral roll in their state of residence but having their motor vehicles registered in another state. Subsequently the ANAO indicated that it did not have any independent evidence of this but had accepted the AEC's data analysis. In response to the committee's inquiries, the AEC indicated that it had not conducted analysis that would support such a conclusion. The AEC maintains the accuracy of the electoral roll using a process called continutable ous roll update, CRU. The CRU process involves the Electoral Commission using its own data and data obtained from external sources to identify addresses on the electoral roll where residents have moved. Using addresses identified in this way, the Electoral Commission sends letters and enrolment forms to individuals inviting them to enrol update their details on the roll. The Audit Office considered ‘that the CRU methodology is an effective means of managing the electoral roll and is capable of providing a roll that is highly accurate, complete and valid'. However, the ANAO also found that, to date, the CRU process has been developed and implemented in an ad hoc manner, without strategic planning to achieve a consistent national approach. The ANAO made a number of recommendations that were directed at addressing these defects. The committee has made two further recommendations on this point. The first recommendation is that the Electoral Commission develop and implement national standards for updating the electoral roll and also a timetable for implementing a consistent national CRU program. The second recommendation is that the AEC centralise its negotiations with state and territory agencies for access to data sources. CRU has replaced habitation reviewsgoing door to door to check enrolment details-as the means of maintaining the electoral roll. The committee considers that habitation reviews are not obsolete. Periodic, random spot checks of enrolment details at a sample of addresses should be conducted to test the effectiveness of CRU in achieving accuracy. Moreover, a total habitation review of an electoral division should be conducted in order to test by sample the accuracy of individual enrolments at the correct address. The ANAO also considered AEC management issues insofar as those issues affect electoral roll integrity. In its inquiry, the committee has come to the view that the AEC needs to implement more effective management information systems. The enhanced management information systems should be capable of providing the AEC with accurate estimates of the costs and the timefor implementing enrolment activities. They should also provide adequate data to enable the AEC to properly analyse and report on its activities. The audit report commented that more performance indicators could be established to better reflect the accuracy of enrolment information on the electoral roll. The comor mittee agrees with this and has recommended that the AEC use targets as performance indicators and report on these performance indicators in its portfolio budget statements and in its annual reports. In relation to questions about the implementation of the Audit Office's recommendations, the Electoral Commission advised the committee that this might require additional resources. The committee recommends that the AEC provide a report on its funding requirements for this task. The AEC should also develop and implement a pricing regime to charge for the use of electoral roll data, and should review its pricing arrangements for CRU data exchange. I note also that the AEC's funding has arisen as an issue in the committee's current inquiry into the conduct of the 2001 federal election. Finally, the committee believe that the audit report recommendations should be implemented expeditiously, and it will observe the AEC's progress with interest. Further to this, we recommend that the Audit Office conduct a follow-up audit to its 2001-02 audit of the integrity of the electoral roll. This will enable the committee to review the progress of the Electoral Commission in implementing the Audit Office's recommendations. The committee consider that both these follow-up reviews should be completed in advance of the next federal election. In concluding my remarks I wish to thank both the Australian Electoral Commission and the Australian National Audit Office for their various contributions to this review. In particular, I would like to thank the ANAO for seconding one of its very capable officers, Mr Christian Anderson, to the committee to assist. I would also like to acknowledge the contribution of my committee colleagues. All the members of the committee have a very real interest in the work of improving our electoral system. Finally, I would also like to thank the secretariat staff who gave valuable assistance to the committee in this review. I commend the report to the House.",13
9,Mr DANBY,COMMITTEES,"The report on the integrity of the electoral roll as initially examined by the Audit Office was extremely useful. It added to the Audit Office's reputation for interesting and useful reports to this parliament. The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and the Electoral Commission have evaluated some of the very interesting recommendations made by the Audit Office over the last few months. As the member for Kooyong has related, a number of recommendations emerged out of this very useful process. Of the 12 recommendations, I would like to focus particularly on a few. They deal with electoral roll accuracy, an issue that was of some interest in the last parliament and that was treated in a much more measured way by this report. It was handled, to the credit the chairman and the committee, in a much more systematic and comprehensive way, with the long-term interests of the Australian people at heart, rather than in a way that tried to make political points about cats that had allegedly been enrolled under the aegis of the Australian electoral system. As far as the Audit Office was concerned, the electoral roll was accurate to 96 per cent. It did have the caveat that this was for names and dates of birth. This does not mean, however, that the electoral roll was inaccurate in all of those other aspects. It simply means that the Audit Office was able to say precisely-with names and dates of birth-that it was accurate for these people. As the member for Kooyong said, it also does not mean that four per cent of enrolments were inaccurate. As members of parliament know, 12 million people are enrolled, and there is a great deal of movement in the Australian population. People are moving all the time. At any one point of time, even with the comprehensive system that the Electoral Commission has in place, it is very difficult to have 100 per cent of people accurately enrolled. It is something that the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, the Australian Electoral Commission and the ANAO, which has provided this useful report, would all like us to get towards, but it is not something that can be achieved at the moment. Nevertheless, we have an electoral system that is the envy of this part of the world and the envy of other democratic systems. As the member for Kooyong said, the Audit Office considered continuous roll update as an effective method of managing the electoral roll. The continuous roll update is, in common sense language, a matching of databases of various state and federal institutions to get the earliest possible indication of an address change so that the integrity of the electoral roll and the accuracy of people's addresses can be established at the earliest possible time. This emerges out of the obvious point that when people are shifting they sometimes comply with the legislation by advising of their new address for their driver's licence before they come to the Electoral Commission. This again emerges of from the quite sensible point that most people are concerned to pay the gas bill or electricity bill or to get their drivers licence accurate before they necessarily think about politics and they update their electoral roll details. The CRU has grown out of the Electoral Commission's desire to use all of these databases rather than habitation reviews to get an accurate roll, but it has not happened accurately in all states with all public institutions that they obtain these databases from at the same time. The committee and the Audit Office had a very sensible idea and recommended to the Electoral Commission-and I think they accept this idea-that the CRU be approached more systematically and that a timetable be established to see that CRU is implemented in a more systematic and thorough way. The use of these matching databases is in fact a very good way generally of seeing that we have an electoral roll that does have integrity. As the member for Kooyong said, CRU does not replace habitation reviews entirely. One of the recommendations of this committee is most useful-that is, that at least sample habitation reviews take place in some electoral divisions to establish the accuracy of enrolments and correct addresses. Another aspect that I would like to particularly focus on is the AEC perhaps considering the issue of cost recovery. The committee noted comments from the AEC about the overall burden of managing the electoral roll without an adequate increase in funding. The electoral roll laws provide for specified persons and organisations to have access to the roll data and for the AEC to charge reasonable fees for goods and services supplied. The public hearing made apparent that the AEC was paying commercial rates for information it needed from other government agencies but was not charging commercial rates for information it was required to provide to other government agencies. The committee recommended that, with a view to recovering costs associated with the provision of the electoral roll data to Commonwealth agencies and departments listed in schedule 2 of the Electoral and Referendum Regulations 1940, the AEC develop and implement a pricing regime to charge for the use of the electoral data and review current pricing arrangements for the exchange of data with CRU data sources. I think that is a very useful recommendation to emerge from the deliberations that have taken place as a result of the audit report, as a result of the AEC looking at that report and as a result of our committee's examination of that particular recommendation. As Senator Ray said, quite jocularly, to the AEC, they should stop whingeing and start charging. Perhaps the other organisations that make great use of AEC accurate data, especially since it is so extensively sourced from this very involved CRU process, should contribute more. It would be a worthwhile thing for the Australian taxpayer if this were pursued. Can I echo the words of the chairman in praising the role of the people from the AEC and the Audit Office who appeared before the committee. These recommendations in this report, again, will keep the integrity of the electoral roll, something that is very high in public estimation in Australia, and are certainly a more measured, balanced and intelligent way of reacting to concerns about the accuracy of the Australian electoral roll rather than some of the political hysteria we had in the previous two years.",15

13,Mr MOSSFIELD,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I move: That this House: (1) recognises that: (a) young people have a diversity of talent and can provide a fresh insight into the creative industries; (b) there is a need for positive promotion of young people and their achievements; (c) young people wish to advance themselves by utilising work placement and work experience programs; and (d) young people are willing to promote and enhance positive programs of a range of issues such as multiculturalism, education, the environment and social justice issues, including asylum seekers; and (2) urges the Government to: (a) organise a collaborative effort by schools in local areas to provide the opportunity for students to audition, take part in and display their individual talents in a musical performance, with the help of local sponsorship and government funding, to provide a professional opportunity for students in creative areas; (b) provide increased resources to support mechanisms to students in order to enhance educational opportunities and outcomes, including library facilities, syllabus management and student support infrastructure; (c) provide incentives to employers to encourage their participation in work experience and work placement programs and to address the public liability ance issues that are threatening such programs; and (d) create youth sport and recreation facilities where young people can physically participate and interact with each other to promote better physical and mental well-being. It gives me a great deal of pleasure to move this motion today. This is the second private member's motion that I have moved this year on youth issues. Each year, I host a Blacktown Youth Orientation, the BYO, in my office. Each year we get a number of students and youth leaders from around the electorate together to discuss the issues that they see as important to them. While my staff help out, the day is pretty much run by the participants, who set the agenda and talk about the issues that they consider important. The final session of the BYO is the drafting of a motion for debate in this place. The words are written by the participants themselves, and it is a credit to them that it is being debated so soon after this year's BYO. There are many issues listed in this motion, and if one looks at the previous motion, debated on 17 June, that arose from last year's BYO, one will see some similarities. The issue of perception comes through strongly in both motions. Many young people believe that the perception of youth, particularly in Western Sydney, is an incorrect one. As the motion states, young people have a vast array of skills and talents that need appropriate recognition. This motion differs from its predecessor in one major issue that was discussed on the day-that is the availability of quality workplace experiences. Every school has some form of work experience program where students are placed in workplaces for a period of time to gain an insight into the type of environment that awaits them when they join the work force. In some programs, it is one day each week for a term and for others it is a one-week block. The programs and their quality vary greatly across the school systems. The members of the BYO spoke about their various experiences-some were good, others not so good. They also identified several barriers to a good workplace experience. insurThe number of employers willing to take on students for work experience is falling. It is getting harder to place students in the first place. I acknowledge that it is difficult for employers. Many jobs require a great deal of training, and a two-week block for someone who will not be there after it finishes makes it very difficult for employers to put in the required resources. This motion talks about the incentives for employers to take on students for work experience. Exactly what incentives would be appropriate is something for another debate at another time, but members should give some thought to how we can improve the situation. Some of the participants in the BYO have gone on to bigger and better things. I spoke last time of Eshan Fallahi, who became a delegate to the Prime Minister's Youth Roundtable and was one of only two Australian delegates to a global youth summit in England. Another BYO participant, Jonathan Wang, has just returned from the Fourth China Synergy Program for Outstanding Youth. Jonathan was one of four Australian delegates to this 17-day conference program, organised by the Chinese government, which aims to provide a chance for young ethnic Chinese from around the world to understand more about China, their ancestral homeland. Jonathan, like Eshan, has used his BYO experience to take that next step; next year Jonathan will be applying to be a delegate to the Prime Minister's Youth Roundtable. Both Jonathan and Eshan are remarkable young men who are a credit to their community. The BYO afforded me the opportunity to meet with them and other young people to hear their ideas on what is needed for our region and the future. It is always good to hear from young leaders of the community, but it is also important not to forget the disadvantaged. It is important that we direct the resources available to where they are most needed. Helping all young people is an investment in the future; in particular, we must ensure that all students receive appropriate workplace experience to help them prepare themselves for the world of work. There is no quick buck to be made, but the long-term pay-off can be enormous. The pay-off comes with a better society and a better community for our children and grandchildren to live in. I am grateful for the support the BYO has received from local schools who have sent delegates, and I am grateful to the participants for their honesty and hard work. The BYO has been a great conduit for me to listen to the concerns of young people in Greenway and to bring those concerns and ideas to this place in the form of this motion. It has been a remarkable exercise, and I commend the motion to the House. Ms Burke-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.",16
14,Mr JOHNSON,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"It gives me great pleasure to speak today on the motion on youth and youth affairs put forward by the member for Greenway. As one of the youngest members of the parliament, I have made it my business to expand the aspirations, the dreams and the opportunities for young people, and to promote the value of young people in society-particularly those young people in my electorate of Ryan. These aspirations reflect very much the aspirations and objectives of the Howard government. One of the very top priorities of the Howard government since its election to government in 1996 has been to implement programs, ideas and initiatives that consistently recognise the value of our young people and give them all the opportunities possible to motivate them to make a contribution to our community and our country. I want to take this opportunity to highlight some of the initiatives the Howard government has put before the people and all of which the government supports very strongly. One of these is the National Youth Media Awards, which have been operated by the Commonwealth for four years. They have helped raise awareness of the critical role the media plays in forming public opinion about young people in our society. The awards encourage the media to take the lead by looking for positive stories when reporting on young people and youth issues. The 2002 awards attracted a record number of entries-some 1,159 were received nationally-and I think that is testament to their popularity and the part they play in this country. The Howard government also sponsors the Young Australian of the Year Award, which every member of this parliament would be more than familiar with. This award attracted over 2,000 nominations, which is testament to its popularity and its place in our community. The 2001 Young Australian of the Year was a Queenslander, Mr Scott Hucknall, whom I have had the pleasure of meeting. I expressed my support for all the work that he does as Young Australian of the Year. The coalition government also sponsors the Rock Eisteddfod Challenge, which over 20,000 secondary students participated in in 2002. These events provide valuable opportunities to publicly recognise young people's achievements and thus serve to raise the profile of young people in the community. I know that every member of this parliament is very supportive of the Rock Eisteddfod Challenge. I am pleased to say that, in my electorate of Ryan, the Kenmore State High School-a very popular and high-achieving school in Ryan-achieved an amazing result this year in the Rock Eisteddfod Challenge, coming ninth overall in the Brisbane division of the competition. I want to pay tribute to all those at the school who were involved in that: the parents, the teachers and all the families who supported it. Kenmore State High School and those people who were involved in it and played an important part in it deserve full accolades from the Ryan community. The Commonwealth government also sponsors National Youth Week, which focuses on youth participation in the Australian community and celebrates the diversity of young people from all over the country-all backgrounds and all regions. The main feature of this year's program was the youth calendar, which attracted 300,000 on-the ground participants. Again, I think that is testament to what the Commonwealth government is doing and to the initiatives that it puts out into the community. I want to say a few words about the electorate of Ryan. It is one year since I had the privilege of becoming the representative of the people of Ryan, and that was a great honour indeed. One of the things I have done as the new member for Ryan has been to establish advisory committees. This Friday I will be presenting the Ryan Youth Recognition Awards and the Ryan Community Awards. These awards are an idea that I have come up with to acknowledge those in our community, especially young people. It is a very young electorate and it is a community that deserves all the support of its federal member. I certainly aim to provide that. I think it is very important that every member in this parliament acknowledges young people and all that they do. These are very challenging times for young people, and I am sure that anything we can do as members of the federal parliament to enhance and promote their opportunities is very much appreciated. For my part, it was phenomenal to see the enormous interest that my office received in the nominations by the exceptional young people in Ryan. I just want to mention one exceptional young Ryan student, Margaret Forrest. I am sponsoring her attendance at the National Young Leaders Brisbane Forum on Tuesday, 12 November. I fully support the forum. It brings together young people from all over the community. It inspires them, and they get access and exposure to young people in our country who have achieved a lot.

15,Ms BURKE,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"It gives me great pleasure to rise in support of the motion moved by the member for Greenway and to second that motion. Often the youth of our society feel that they are ‘the forgotten' in the political process-that they do not carry the same voting clout as, say, the baby boomers. Many of them of course are not even of voting age and feel that politics and politicians do not even know that they exist or, worse still, if they are on the political radar, that it is through their ents and, predominantly, their parents' hippocket nerve. So I want to commend the member for Greenway for conducting his regular youth forum and for the motion that that forum has put before the parliament today. Sadly, I inform all people in my electorate that they cannot escape parliamentarians and politicians; we are actually there for all of them, whether or not they vote for us and whether or not they are of voting age. So it is particularly important that we do go out and garnish the ideas of these young people in our electorates. Each year since I have been elected, I have held forums with the year 12 school leaders from the 13 secondary schools in my electorate of Chisholm and with the grade 5 and grade 6 leaders from the 41 primary schools in my electorate. This year was no exception. Again, I was blown away by the insight, passion, concern and humanity expressed by those future leaders. What did concern me, though, were two factors. First, all three forums began with our youth expressing grave concern about the world we live in-in particular, the escalation of terror on both a global and a local level. The grade 6 forums, which were made up of 11and 12-year-old kids, both began with in-depth discussions about the prospect of terror in Australia, concerns over hand guns-and they cited the recent example at Monash University which, sadly, occurred within my seat-and also the sniper in the US. The year 12 forum gave chilling insight into the extent of violence in our streets, with all present-and there were about 50 kidsrelating tales of peers who carry weapons, mainly knives, and of incidents at parties or innocently at a KC where they had experienced violence, terror and attack. The other issue of concern was the perception that these things were intractable, that change was very unlikely and that change came only from personal experience: people would have to learn the hard way that carrying knives did not make sense. One student at the year 12 forum put it nicely into perspective when he assured all present that Australians did not live in a violent society. He had recently emigrated from South Africa and parexplained quite calmly how it was almost part of life to carry guns for personal protection there. Why did this disturb me? The first year that I held these forums when I was elected back in 1998, we had a great debate about who should have won Big Brother, why it appeared rigged and whether it was reflective of society or just entertainment. Life was all pretty good, with hope for going on to university or work and only the fear of starting secondary school. Now, the forums are about fear, concern and despair at the future and in our world. We have in-depth discussions from grade 6ers about: is Australia too close to the US? What role does the ANZUS Treaty have? Should the Russian President have used the gas? Why did the student kill his classmates and how did he get hold of the gun? Why does someone lie in the back of their car and shoot complete strangers? This was the tenor of the forums. But there was something fantastic in all this-the vocabulary of these students was just tremendous; it was mind-blowing to be precise. When the grade 6er used the ‘surreal' explanation, the whole room just looked gobsmacked by this kid's use of language. Their knowledge of the issues, not just reciting events, and their ability to analyse and offer theories and solutions were well beyond all their years. And their genuine concern for their world and their fellow human beings shone through all the gloom. Emily from Mont Albert Primary School summed it up nicely when she wrote to me: Dear Anna, I really enjoyed yesterday's lunch. However, I was disappointed that the discussion on terrorism and snipers took up most of the time and we didn't get to discuss school matters as much thought we would. Thank you for a wonderful opportunity. Emily Emily had raised great issues. She wanted to talk about graffiti and bullying in our classrooms, but in two hours over lunch we did not get there. At the year 12 forum, we had been going on and on about knives and terrorists so much that we did not get to talk about Kyoto and greenhouse gas emissions-and one student wanted passionately to talk about the actual chemistry of it. We did not get there. It was just so disappointing. All these students wanted us to hear their concerns and they wanted us to react to them. They wanted us to know that, even though they are not of voting age, they have ideas and concerns and they need to be heard.",19
16,Mrs ELSON,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak today on the motion moved by the member for Greenway. Honourable members would know that I am a strong advocate for youth. I believe they are essentially the reason we are all in this House-to pass on a better standard of living for our children, grandchildren and all future generations of Australians. It is this desire to create a better future for our children that motivates parents to get involved in their community and, as a mother of eight and grandmother of 11, it is certainly what brought me to federal politics and keeps me motivated in this challenging job. While I support the vast majority of the sentiment of this motion, I have to say to the honourable member for Greenway that this government needs no urging whatsoever in this area. The Howard government has in fact made some very major advances when it comes to resources, support and funding for our young people. Implicit in this motion is the belief that more needs to be done-and in any area where funding is an issue, a case can always be made for more to be done. Youth services will never be a completed business, but I say to the honourable member for Greenway that he ought to be urging his state Labor counterparts to follow the Commonwealth's lead in this area and to devote more of their funds to helping our young as I people achieve their full potential. This motion includes references for more funds for resources and facilities in our schools. Of course, I fully support that, but I would also like to add that school funding is an area where Labor is hopelessly behind the Howard government. In this year's May budget, the Howard government increased funding for state schools on average by 5.7 per cent. Not one single state or territory government has matched that increase. Despite all the Labor hype on funding for public schools, the states have let their schools down badly. Their failure to at least match the Howard government's increases in funding represents millions of dollars missing from the education system. For example, if the Beattie Labor government in Queensland had matched our increases in education funding, Queensland schools would have an extra $102 million to help fund the sorts of things that the member for Greenway wants. If Labor did the same in New South Wales, there would be an extra $202 million; in Victoria, an extra $95 million; in South Australia, an extra $50 million; and in the ACT, an extra $13 million. These missing millions represent missed opportunities for government school students. So I suggest the member for Greenway should be urging his state Labor counterparts around the nation to do more because, as usual, their actions do not match the Labor rhetoric on this issue. In contrast, the Howard government has made huge inroads where it matters most of all-that is, in helping young people get the skills they need for fulfilling jobs. The latest figures show a current record of 330,000 apprenticeships in training-that is more than double the number since Labor left office. It is an incredible achievement, especially when you consider that Labor let apprenticeships fall to their lowest level in 30 years. In this year's budget alone, we have provided $54 million for additional new apprenticeships incentives, especially in the field of information technology and other emerging highly skilled occupations. We have done exactly as the member for Greenway suggests with the highly successful Jobs Pathway Program in schools, which is continuing to expand. In fact, an estimated 170,000 Australian students participated in vocational education and training while in secondary school last year. These examples are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to what our government has done to assist young Australians. It would take most of the day to list the various programs that are now in place to achieve the very thing that the member for Greenway wants to see from this motion. There is the ongoing Youth Roundtable where the government gets feedback and advice directly from young Australians. I was pleased last year to have Darren Chant, a local apprentice from my electorate, visit Canberra. He made some valuable contributions at the round-table. There is also Ausyouth, a national coordination unit for the development of youth activities in Australia. In fact, I would highly recommend that the member for Greenway look up the very excellent web site that the Howard government established to help young people gain access to a large range of support and advice. It is at www.thesource.gov.au. One look at the plethora of options and the practical advice and assistance that is available to our young people would make the member for Greenway realise that the Howard government, unlike Labor, is indeed very serious about supporting young Australians to achieve their full potential. I urge the honourable member to tell his state Labor counterparts that they ought to be following our lead in this very important policy issue. I will indeed be supporting all future programs that help our young Australians reach their potential.",20
17,Mr GIBBONS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I thank the member for Greenway for giving me the opportunity to speak in this private member's business debate on young people. I would like to talk about a very innovative program which commenced in Bendigo called Lead On. This particular program was started as a result of the efforts of Mr Rob Hunt, who was the Chairman of the Bendigo Bank and whom a lot of members would be aware of. In July 1999, Lead On was opened in Bendigo, Victoria. The plan was to create a pilot program that would find ways of engaging, informing and connecting young people to the business and broader community. The belief was that communities that fail to engage their young people are losing and underutilising one of their key resources. Lead On says that young people are the future leaders of our communities, and it is right. In the three years since the program model was developed, Lead On has expanded and now has offices in Mildura, Swan Hill and Echuca in Victoria, and Ipswich in Queensland-I think this is in the electorate of my good friend the member for Oxley. In that time, almost 700 young people from these communities have been actively engaged in a range of meaningful and worthwhile projects that have provided them with various skills, personal development, community connections, employment, direction and confidence. The more than 100 business and community partners from these communities who provided the project opportunities have experienced the value of having these young people involved with their businesses or organisations. Many of these Lead On facilitated projects have brought people, young and old, together from various industries, backgrounds, schools and environments to work towards a joint outcome for the first time. Lead On has never advertised for young people to be involved and has a steady stream of business partners ready and willing to provide project or other opportunities for young people in the communities. It is primarily through the real life project partnerships that the Lead On model engages and develops young people with the community. Some of these projects have provided ongoing roles, employment and development for young people. Projects such as the very successful, LOOP Bendigo Advertiser news supplement-written, edited and designed by youth-have presented wonderful opportunities. The Lead On Inc. project has provided web pages and other IT support for businesses, and Internet training for older people from the innovative Internet for the Oldies by Kids project. It is the dynamics and interactions along the way that provide the key development, learning, connections and outcomes for young and old people. Details of the projects are available, and range from the complex to the simple. Projects are the excuses to bring people together. While Lead On has facilitated some significant projects and benefits for the communities, it is the coming together and broad involvement that are key parts of building community capacity. They are what lead on from the involvement. Another important element of the program is the integration strategy as opposed to the traditional view of segmenting young people and categorising them. Lead On brings together young people from diverse backgrounds and so-called categories, and integrates them into working groups that include all shapes and sizes. The organisation is headed by Mr Chris DeAraugo, a former musical colleague of mine. He does a superb job with the young people in his charge. This is not an elitist organisation, as some have described it. This organisation takes young people from all walks of life. It is not specifically designed for unemployed young people, although unemployed young people are very welcome and indeed participate in the programs. It takes kids from all over Australia, gives them a sense of self worth and puts them in touch with the important parts of various communities and businesses. The kids gain skills that they are not able to gain in other areas. It is not like a work experience program as such-it does a lot more than that-and it is far more effective. I commend Lead On to the House. I encourage the government to get behind it and to work with Chris DeAraugo and others to ensure that it is able to provide the service, not only in the areas that I have mentioned but all over Australia. I thank the member for Greenway for the opportunity to speak.",21
18,The SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"It being 1.45 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 106A. The debate is adjourned and the resumption will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. The member for Bendigo will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Human Rights: Vietnam",22
19,Mrs IRWIN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"In the past decade the Internet has become the most important network to bring people and ideas together. The key benefit of the Internet is its openness-people are able to access information from anyone anywhere. This, however, is seen as a threat in some countries. The government of Vietnam has imprisoned a number of its citizens in recent months. Last Friday a 32-year-old lawyer, Mr Le Chi Quang, was sentenced to four years imprisonment and three years of house arrest on charges arising from the posting of an essay critical of the Vietnamese government on an Internet site. His trial was held behind closed doors and comes in the wake of similar trials in which the accused have been denied proper legal representation. Le Chi Quang has been in custody since February this year. He suffers from kidney disease and is in poor health. His family hold grave fears for his safety. His fate is being closely watched by human rights groups, including Amnesty International and locally the Free Vietnam Alliance, New South Wales chapter. And the Internet is bringing his story to the world. I would like to thank Ms Anh Linh Pham from the Free Vietnam Alliance, New South Wales chapter, for keeping me up to date on this issue.",22
20,Mr BAIRD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise to place on the record my concern about the implications of the most recent overseas arrival statistics for our tourism industry, nationally and in my electorate. It is likely that the long haul international travel try is facing a major crisis as a result of creased concern about terrorist activity along the lines of Bali or September 11. This fear seems to be borne out by the fact that overseas arrivals to Australia for September 2002 were down 11 per cent on the same time for the previous year. That represents six consecutive months of negative growth, and there was a particularly concerning figure from New Zealand that their visits were down by an incredible 29 per cent. While there were some positive areas, six months of decline is a real cause for concern to an industry that produces nearly five per cent of our GDP, directly employs well over half a million people-six per cent of all employees in Australia-and provides over 11 per cent of our export earnings, more than coal, iron and steel. At a local level the drop in incoming vals will be felt as well. I know that many of the hotels, hostels, B&Bs, restaurants, travel agents and the like in my electorate have been experiencing a downturn and are looking for direction and a strategy to take Australian tourism forward. I commend the minister for tourism for the work he is doing on the 10-year plan for tourism. This document will be of vital importance to this key industry, and I know that tourism operators in my electorate and around Australia will be looking forward to the leadership that it will provide. Roads: Calder Highway Redevelopment",23
21,Mr GIBBONS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Bendigo) (1.48 p.m.)On Monday, 9 December I will be presenting a petition by the Bendigo Plus group demanding that the Howard government honour its election commitments to fund its share of the Calder Highway redevelopment. The federal coalition is fast-tracking the Geelong Road and other RONI-come-latelies while it slams the brakes on the Calder. The coalition is victimising central Victorians, because the Calder is the only Victorian RONI that it Tourism refuses to finish. The Prime Minister said on ABC radio on Friday that he cannot fund the project because of the drought. But the PM has put a both dollar drought on the Calder since 1996 while he floods federal funds into RONIindus- come-latelies at Geelong, Scoresby and inPakenham. The federal coalition designated the Calder a RONI in 1996 and promised 50 per cent of the funding-three years ahead of the Geelong Road and five years ahead of the Scoresby and Pakenham projects. The Calder will be just another example of Liberal-National deceit inflicted on Bendigo when the $200 million Pakenham bypass and the $1 billion Scoresby Freeway are completed. The Prime Minister is walking away from the $330 million work on the Calder while he commits $1.5 billion in three big city RONIs. This is pork-barrel politics at its worse and the coalition has left Bendigo at the bottom of the barrel. Memorials in Schools",23
22,Mrs ELSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Today being Remembrance Day, I would firstly like to place on record my thoughts to all of those arri- special service men and women who gave their lives in order for all of us to live in the freedom that we see today. But I would also like to place on record that last week I attended three schools in my electorate, Marsden, Versdale and Beaudesert, each of which opened their own memorial in the grounds of the schools. Each day as they pass this memorial-as each little student who stood up to talk at these three schools said-it will be a constant reminder to them to say thanks to those special men and women who went off and fought in conflicts over many years. I thank those three schools for all their work and thank the committees that were formed to make sure that those memorials were placed there. I thank them all for their extra hard work. I also thank the three RSLs in my electorate-Greenbank, Beaudesert and Jimboomba-for the support that they gave to these schools under the community link program. Remembrance Day",23
23,Ms ROXON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I also want to speak briefly on Remembrance Day because I attended two services yesterday in my electorate, one at the Spotswood church, St Mark's Church. But the second service is the one I want to speak about. one that has been going since 1926 at the Holy Trinity Anglican Church in Williamstown. They have a service called ‘the lighting of the lamps' in which they-as many of the other church services and indeed the one in Spotswood do-have a march and present the flags as well as have a normal church service. This one is particularly of note because it has been going for so many years. Added now to those who walk in the parade and participate in the lighting of the lamps ceremony is a group of Karen people who have settled in Gellibrand. Many people would know that the Karen people of Burma fought with the allies in the Second World War. A number of these people have come as refugees to Australia, are now settled in my part of the world and attend as members of the church and join in our Remembrance Day functions and services. I think that it highlights that it is a time for remembering all of those who fought with us and on behalf of us but also all of our allies, many of whom have now come to settle in our country and take part in this service as well. Veterans' Affairs: Grants",24
24,Mr LLOYD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the effectiveness of some of the smaller grants from the Commonwealth government, particularly those for our veterans under the Department of Veterans' Affairs. One of those grants is for $590, under the federal government's Saluting Their Service commemoration program. This will enable the honour roll at Narara hall to be completely rebuilt. The present honour roll has deteriorated beyond repair. Congratulations to Mr John ONEILL from Narara, who has been the prime mover of that project. The second grant is $2,000 from the federal government to assist the Alloura Waters residents' committee with the purchase of equipment to enhance the residents' computer education program. It is important that, as residents grow older, they have access to computers and the skills needed to operate them so that they too can be part of the information highway. I am very pleased that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Danna It is Vale-an excellent minister-has approved that funding, and I know that the residents of the Alloura Waters Retirement Village will make very good use of that $2,000 to help them with their computers and particularly the education program that is needed for the older residents to have access to the information technology and the information highway. Casey, Mr Mark",24
25,Mr RIPOLL,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Last week I had the great honour and pleasure of welcoming home a young man called Mark Casey. Most people probably would not know Mark Casey's name as yet, but they should, because Mark Casey is Australia's newest world champion. He is the under 25 world indoor bowls champion. He just won his title in Belfast with quite a formidable field in front of him-competitors from Scotland, Wales and England-and he won the final, against Israel, quite convincingly. As I said, he has returned from Ireland a world champion. I do not think it has quite sunk in yet that at age 20 he now is the best in the world at his craft. He played brilliantly; as I said, he fought off great competition. Mark is a very humble young man. Not only has he not realised the extent of his feat but I do not think the community has quite grasped that this young bloke has such a huge career in front of him. We hope, obviously, that he will return with many more wins in the future. Mark Casey has an extensive record also in Australia. He is currently ranked No. 3. He has won the Queensland state singles championships, he was the Queensland finalist at the world indoor pairs and he is the Sandgate Prestige Easter Singles champion and the Kingscliff Prestige Fours winner. He has skippered for Queensland and he has played premier league for Queensland. Importantly, while he is not a native of Ipswich or Queensland, he has been quickly adopted by Ipswich and by the local club, which is the Ipswich United Services Bowls Club. (Time expired) Workplace Relations: Unfair Dismissals",24
26,Ms GAMBARO,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Petrie) (1.55 p.m.)Research recently released by the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research at the University of Melbourne has quantified for the first time the significant costs imposed on small and medium businesses by the unfair dismissal laws. The research shows that state and federal unfair dismissal laws cost both small and medium businesses $1.3 billion each year. It also shows that dismissal laws have a significant impact on jobs. These laws have contributed to the loss of some 77,000 jobs from businesses that used to employ staff and no longer employ anyone. About 60,000 of these are from small businesses with fewer than 20 employees. These figures do not take into account jobs that would have been lost by businesses that have reduced their work force due to the laws but still have employees. Nor do they include jobs that would have been created if there were no unfair dismissal laws. Further concerning results have emerged from the survey that, because of these laws, businesses are now less inclined to hire young people, the long-term unemployed and those with lower levels of education. Businesses now have to rely more and more on casuals and others on fixed term contracts or long probationary periods. The coalition has tried determinedly and will continue to try to pass a small business exemption into the law on a number of occasions; however, the ALP has consistently voted against unfair dismissal reforms-in fact, 22 times. The research clearly shows that both small businesses and marginalised workers have suffered as a result. (Time expired) Rats of Tobruk",25
27,Mr DANBY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"On Remembrance Day, it is appropriate to pay tribute to the Rats of Tobruk Memorial Highland Pipes and Drums, whom I had the honour to march behind during yesterday's ceremony from the Elwood RSL to St Columba's. My days at drill on the parade ground at Puckapunyal were not very auspicious, but going to and from mass at St Columba's did bring it back. I particularly want to pay tribute to the Rats of Tobruk Memorial Highland Pipes and Drums band, which is a living memorial to those Australians who endured the siege of Tobruk. They were called the Rats of Tobruk because they hid underground from the German armoured divisions that were surrounding Tobruk. The band has travelled widely throughout Australia-it does not just perform in Victoria-performing at reunions of the Rats of Tobruk Association. In 1988, the band had the honour of representing Australia at the world-famous Edinburgh Military Tattoo in Scotland, as part of the bicentennial, and subsequent visits to the Tattoo took place in 1994 and 1997, followed by an abortive trip to Tobruk in 2001, when they could not get their visas, unfortunately, for the 60th anniversary of the siege of Tobruk. The band, to my knowledge, is the only Australian civilian band that has been afforded this honour of participating in the Edinburgh Military Tattoo, and it has a further invitation for 2005. The band is totally self-funding and gains its income from playouts and ought to attract wide community support. (Time expired) Forestry: Regional Forest Agreements",25
28,Mr MCARTHUR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I would like to draw the attention of the House to the cynical move by the Bracks government of Victoria to stop logging in the Otways after the year 2008. This is tearing up the RFA that was agreed to by both sides of this parliament, following the National Forest Policy Statement as far back as 1992. Both the Labor Party and Liberal Party agreed to the RFA, and we have the Bracks government cynically tearing up this agreement and removing logging workers from jobs. Of course eventually, with the Otways being locked up, they will be burnt by natural fire. The fires of 1939 wiped out the Otways and large tracts of the forest in Victoria, and a similar wild occurrence will take place in the future. Ash Wednesday demonstrated what happens when the forests are locked up and catch alight. The fires in New South Wales and in America prove that without proper forest control wildfires break out. There has been no reduction in biodiversityMr Zahra interjecting",25
29,Mr MCARTHUR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Sustainable forestry has been undertaken, as the member for MCMillan would understand, and not one species has been lost. The final comment I would make, Mr Speaker, is about where the timber will come from after this cynical move by the Bracks government to lock up the Wombat and the Otways. It is a move just to attract Greens preferences, not one based on science or any other fact.",26

33,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,I inform the House that the Minister for Foreign Affairs will be absent from question time today. The minister is in Shanghai in connection with events recognising the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. The Minister for Trade will answer questions on his behalf. NA Telstra: Investigation,26
34,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I ask: is he aware that, when asked about whether and why he made phone calls to Victoria Police investigator Neil Jepson, conducting a criminal investigation into Telstra's conduct, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts has given at least four different answers, including denying he made the calls, stating he called to ensure ‘matters were properly investigated', stating he called to ensure any action he took ‘did not compromise any investigation' and, finally, stating he made the calls on behalf of Mrs Ann Garms, which she vigorously denies? Prime Minister, have you spoken to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts to determine which, if any, of these versions is correct, and can you inform the House what is the correct version?",26
35,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have discussed this matter with the minister. The minister has indicated, both to me and also publicly, that he has referred to the Communications Authority the question which is crucial to this whole issue, and that is as to whether or not there was an upgrading in the network. When we have a response to that I will be better enlightened. Foreign Affairs: Iraq",26
36,Mr KING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. What is the government's response to the passage of the new UN Security Council resolution No. 1441 on Iraq?,26
37,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I believe I speak for members on both sides of the House in welcoming the unanimous passage of the resolution which imposes new and very strict conditions of compliance on Iraq. The passage of the resolution is a tribute to the common sense of all members of the Security Council. It should also be said that it is a vindication of the strong and patient attitude adopted by the President of the United States. It is important to make the observation that, if the United States had not persisted with the attitude it has taken over recent months, it is unlikely that the Security Council would have addressed this issue as vigorously as it has, and it is certain in my view that the resolution that emerged from the Security Council over the weekend would not have been adopted. The United Nations now has stronger authority for inspections than from earlier resolutions. I hope-and indeed the entire world hopesthat Iraq will comply, and comply genuinely. If Iraq complies genuinely with the terms of this resolution then, in the words of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, ‘considerable suffering and adversity can be avoided for the people of Iraq'. It is encouraging that there are signs emerging that Iraq will accept the terms of the resolution. It is early days yet, but it is to be hoped that those signs do bear fruit and do turn out to be the case. The resolution contains a number of key elements. Iraq is in material breach of existing resolutions and, in the words of the resolution, has one final opportunity to comply. The resolution asserts that false statements or omissions in the declaration required of Iraq represent a material breach. Iraq is required to provide immediate, unconditional and unrestricted access and has seven days to confirm its intention to comply with the resolution. Iraq is required to provide a full declaration of its chemical, biological or nuclear-military or civilianprograms within 30 days. Inspections are to be resumed within 45 days and the Security Council must be updated after 60 days of inspections. The Security Council has warned repeatedly that Iraq would face serious consequences if it did not comply. The world wants Iraq's weapons of mass destruction to be identified and destroyed. The world is concerned, because of Iraq's track record, that those weapons of mass destruction could be used against other countries and could be used again against the people of Iraq, as they have been in the past. The world is also rightly concerned about the consequences of weapons of mass destruction ever falling into the hands of terrorists. Therefore, there is an accumulation of powerful and compelling reasons as to why this resolution was necessary and why it is a welcome development that it was carried unanimously. The Australian government and, I believe, the great bulk of the Australian people very warmly welcome that development.",26
38,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On indulgence, I take the opportunity to join with the Prime Minister in welcoming the unanimous decision of the United Nations in its decision on Iraq, resolution 1441. I indicate that Labor has been calling for this position since April. This was not the view unanimously supported in this chamber, but it was consistently supported on this side of the House. I also welcome the fact that the Arab League has also today unanimously endorsed the fact that Iraq should comply with the United Nations resolution. That is a significant step forward, as was the unanimous decision of the UN Security Council. I also note that, under the terms of that resolution, unilateral action is not available to the United States. There is a requirement for the issue of non-compliance with that resolution to come back before the Security Council. What this demonstrates",27
39,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,27
40,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Leader of the Opposition has the call. He has been granted indulgence, he understands the restrictions that indulgence imposes, and he is winding up his remarks, I believe.",27
41,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank you for the indulgence, Mr Speaker. What this demonstrates is that the course that Labor has been calling for from the beginning is the correct one. It now should be allowed to be pursued, and we have the very solid basis upon which it can. Telstra: Investigation",27
42,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Prime Minister, and it follows his answer to my earlier question. Prime Minister, you would be aware that the ACA inquiry has nothing to do with the allegations of improper phone calls by Senator Alston to the police investigator in Victoria. I ask you, Prime Minister: have you spoken to Senator Alston about those allegations of improper phone calls to the Victorian police investigator? If so, what explanation has Senator Alston given you for such calls?",27
43,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. Of course I have spoken to him. On the information available to me, I do not think Senator Alston has behaved in any way improperly in this matter, nor does the Victoria Police think he has, because on 23 October the Victoria Police issued a statement in the following terms: ‘At no time has any outside party attempted to pressure, influence, coerce or intervene in this matter.' That is a conclusive repudiation of the pathetic attempt of the Leader of the Opposition to generate something out of this. The minister has not behaved improperly. If the Leader of the Opposition is not content to rely on the assurance of the minister or my assurance on that matter, then he might at least accept the word of the Victoria Police. The Victoria Police have said, ‘At no time has any outside party attempted to pressure, influence, coerce or intervene in this matter.' Those are very clear words. The mere making of a telephone call is not of itself improper. The minister has indicated that he made a telephone call; he has acknowledged that, and he has provided an explanation. The relevant thing here is whether it was improper. It is not improper per se to make a phone call. It is improper in circumstances such as this to pressure, influence, coerce or intervene. We have the word of the Victoria Police-which I am prepared to accept-that there was no coercion, intervention or pressure. I think the Leader of the Opposition should accept the word of the Victoria Police as well. NA",28
44,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of a delegation of shadow ministers from New Zealand, led by the Hon. Bill English. On behalf of the House, I extend a very warm welcome to our visitors. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Economy: Performance  addressed to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer provide the House with an update on the Australian economy and the factors affecting the current economic outlook?",28
45,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Sturt for his question and for his interest in the Australian economy. The international economy continues to look more bleak; in particular, the developments in the United States-probably reflected in the cut of 50 official basis points by the US Fed last week-indicate fears about the American recovery and whether or not it has stalled. In addition to that, growth is sluggish in Europe, and Japan remains in recession. Despite these difficulties, Australia continues to perform well overall and most international forecasts-for example, the Economist forecast of this month-predict that Australia will have the strongest growth of the developed nations of the world both in 2002 and 2003. In addition to that, the labour force figures for October, which were released late last week, showed that unemployment actually fell to six per cent, which is equal to the lowest unemployment rate recorded since the great recession of April 1990. After that recession, which was dubbed by Labor ‘the recession we had to have', unemployment was above 10 per cent for 28 consecutive months. The figure for October 2002-at six per cent-is the lowest figure since then. Notwithstanding that, the risks that we see for the economy are on the downside. Firstly, the international economy continues to disappoint. Secondly, the effect of the drought on the economy is becoming greater and more pronounced as the severity of the drought takes hold. ABARE has put out crop forecasts showing that Australia's crop harvest will be slashed, forecasting the possibility of that detracting up to one per cent from growth in the current financial year, and assessments to that effect have been made by the Reserve Bank in its statement on monetary conditions today. The government will be taking into account all of these effects when it updates its forecast in the midyear review, which will be at the end of this month. As I have said, our budget forecast of 3¾ per cent would be affected by downside factors in the international economy and in relation to the drought. Nonetheless, we continue to lead the developed world in growth and employment generation. The number of jobs that have been generated this calendar year is 164,000, and 37,000 over the course of 2002 were full-time jobs. Over the course of the government's period of office, the increase in employment is over one million jobs. Notwithstanding the difficulties of the Australian economy, the creation of those jobs means so much to young Australians, their families and all those who rely on people in the work force. Good economic policy needs good leadership, and we continue to provide that leadership. We call on the Senate to enact all budget measures, including those that have already been defeated. We will be preparing those and presenting them to the Senate again to give the Senate the opportunity to reconsider its position in relation to those budget measures because important budget measures for the long-term sustainability of the Australian economy-good economic policy-are opportunities for Australians. Telstra: Privatisation",28
46,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. Can the minister confirm that the Estens inquiry received a submission stating that members of the Country Fire Authority near Wodonga, Victoria, have experienced phone outages lasting from three days to three weeks, putting at risk their ability to respond to bushfire emergencies? Given that the Estens inquiry received about 175 submissions from Australians complaining about the state of Telstra's network yet found that fault levels in regional Australia are ‘reasonable', didn't the inquiry simply ignore these submissions? How will selling the rest of Telstra fix these problems?",29
47,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The government warmly welcomes the regional telecommunications inquiry, which gives a full and balanced assessment and picture of regional telecommunications. It is worth noting that the report states that the government has responded positively and comprehensively to the Besley inquiry's recommendations of two years ago, and that arrangements have been put in place to address community concerns, including mobile phone services, which is a constant irritant in many areas in regional Australia. Overall the Estens report is a positive for the government and the commitment we have made to continually upgrade telecommunications in regional areas. The report recommends priority be given to a number of particulars-for instance, rural exchange upgrades, broadband width speed and the like-and the government will look at these recommendations, some 39 in all, to consoliof our date and complement the actions we have already taken over the last two years. We endorse the approach taken by the inquiry, which was to put it on the table to see what needed fixing and what needed to be brought up to a better level of service and provision. It is interesting that implicit in the member's question is an endorsement of the Estens inquiry, which, if my memory serves me correctly, he was very critical of at the time of its establishmentMr Tanner-What? It was a whitewash, a complete whitewash!",29
48,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"A ‘whitewash', he says. He was very critical of it at the time of its establishment, as he was with the Besley inquiry-discredit it, but use those parts of it that might fit his political agenda or his biased views. The government will now carefully consider its response to the Estens inquiry. The government has made it clear that it will not proceed with any further sale of Telstra until it is fully satisfied arrangements are in place to deliver adequate services to all Australians. It is a positive, balanced report, which the government will respond to. Mr Tanner- Mr Speaker, I ask that the minister table the document he was reading from.",29
49,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Was the minister reading from a document?,30
50,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Yes.,30
51,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Was the document confidential?,30
52,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Yes.,30
53,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister has indicated that he was reading from a confidential document. National Security: Terrorism,30
54,Mrs MAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Attorney-General. Would the Attorney inform the House about the landmark agreement with the states which the Commonwealth has secured to help protect Australians from the threat of terrorism?,30
55,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for MCPherson for her question. I am very pleased to inform the House that the detail legislation referring constitutional power counterterrorism matters to the Commonwealth was finalised at a meeting of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General in Fremantle last Friday. This follows the historic agreement between the Prime Minister and state leaders earlier this year whereby the states agreed to refer power to the Commonwealth to coordinate responses to all national terrorist situations. This agreement is the most significant development in the management of terrorism threats in the past 20 years. The effect will be that the Howard government's important package of counterterrorism legislation enacted earlier this year will not have any unforeseen gaps. We will cover the field and ensure that any rorist act committed in Australia will be the subject of criminal offences and hopefully, due course, prosecution. We will be able to pursue terrorists anywhere and the community can be confident we will do just that. We are committed to hunting down all those who would threaten the safety of our families and communities and bringing those people to justice. I welcome the strong support from my state counterparts for the Howard government's new counterterrorism laws. We are now in a position to finalise the legislation so that each state can enact referral legislation as quickly as possible. I have urged my state counterparts to do everything they can to pass the legislation as a matter of urgency. Since the September 11 attacks on the United States, the government has acted swiftly to introduce new policy measures and to provide more resources for our security and intelligence agencies. The recent attacks in Bali have strengthened our resolve to ensure these measures are put in place immediately. On the legislative side, the package of counterterrorism legislation was passed in the middle of the year and parliament is currently considering a bill to enhance ASIO's ability to gather information. Shortly, a bill will be presented to the parliament creating an international murder offence. Our counterterrorism laws are built on strong constitutional grounds. We cannot afford to take the chance that the laws can be effectively of challenged by those with an interest in getfor ting around them. We must make them as watertight as possible. The proposed reference of powers by the states will do just that. I welcome the development and look forward to the continuing cooperation of the states and of the opposition in dealing with the ongoing threat of terrorism. Telstra: Privatisation",30
56,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. I again refer him to a submission to the Estens inquiry from people living near Wodonga stating that they had suffered outages of their telephones of beter- tween three days and three weeks, thereby placing them at greater risk in their role as in CFA members associated with the forthcoming bushfire season. How can the minister and the government accept the Estens inquiry view that the Telstra network is in fine shape and that the level of faults in regional Australia, even though they are increasing, are acceptable and reasonable?",30
57,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I again thank the member for his question. There were 606 submissions received by the inquiry. They were all looked at closely. Some were positive; some were negative. Both positive and negative submissions were quoted extensively in the report. So much for it being the whitewash you have alleged here today. It is a very balanced report. The submissions have influenced the 39 recommendations, as have the inquiries-41 meetings with stakeholders. There are a number of important recommendations which the government will respond to. We will consider them carefully and give a comprehensive reply. The report has only been in the government's hands a few days. It is an inquiry the opposition never wanted, never supported-in fact, actively opposed. Mr Tanner- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. A specific question about a particular submission regarding bushfire fighting risks and the Country Fire Authority was asked. The minister has failed to answer it.",30
58,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Melbourne will resume his seat. I have considered the point of order. The minister has the call. He had not concluded his answer.,31
59,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In regard to any Wodonga situation, I am sure the member for Indi would be more than ready in her typically competent style to take up any specific issues that may affect anything within her electorate. But remember the report's conclusion, which is this: The inquiry is confident that arrangements that have been put in place over the past five years, including the response to the Besley inquiry, gether with commercial developments and the inquiry's further recommendations will create an environment into the future where regional, rural and remote Australians will be able to benefit fully from advances in telecommunications technology and services. That is what irks you more than anything else.",31
60,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Before I recognise the member for La Trobe, I point out to the minister and all honourable members that reference to ‘you' is inappropriate. All answers, questions and statements should be addressed through the chair. Workplace Relations: Industrial Action",31
61,Mr CHARLES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Would the minister inform the House of action the government has taken to secure the construction of a multimillion dollar gas processing plant in Victoria? What does the Patricia Baleen gas plant dispute say about the industrial relations climate in Victoria today?,31
62,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. The Patricia Baleen gas processing plant is a $120 million investment in Victoria's future. This plant means more jobs for Victoria. It means more efficient industries in Victoria. It means extending the life of the Bass Strait oil and gas field. It means giving alternative gas supplies to Melbourne. Despite its importance, for more than a month no work has been done on this project, because members of the AMWU and the ETU are refusing to cross a picket line, which is apparently being organised by a union official taking long service leave. It is funny that this picket line somehow appeared the instant the unions discovered that workers at the plant would be on Australian workplace agreements. Last week the Industrial Relations Commission issued a return to work order and disbelieved the union's story that this was somehow a community picket. This is a clear case of ultramilitant unions defying the law. This government supports and upholds the rule of law, and that is why we are now intervening in a Federal Court application to toenforce the Industrial Relations Commission's order. This government is supporting freedom under the law. In contrast, the Victorian government is standing around like a useless bystander. Since 1999, Victoria has become the epicentre of industrial militancy in this country. Melbourne is now the strike capital of Australia. Victoria now accounts for about 40 per cent of all days lost through strikes, and it is no wonder, because the AMWU controls the largest single block vote inside the Victorian Labor Party-and it is the union Premier Bracks chose to join. Mr Swan-I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. The question was about a pipeline; it had nothing at all to do with anything else. Would you bring the minister to order?",31
63,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I noted the question. The question was about a pipeline-the member for Lilley is right-but it was also about a dispute affecting the development of that pipeline. The minister was in order.,32
64,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is right, Mr Speaker. This federal government is acting to uphold freedom under the law while the Victorian government, in contrast, is acting like a helpless bystander. As a result of the strike epidemic now afflicting Victoria, when Japanese investors think of Victoria they think of just two things: koalas and strikes-and thank God for the koalas. Telstra: Privatisation",32
65,Mr BEVIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question without notice is to the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. Can the minister confirm that the Estens inquiry received a submission from a woman in Maidenhall, Queensland, complaining of inadequate mobile phone coverage on major roads and highways around Chinchilla and from a farmer from Lismore, New South Wales, who described the Northern Rivers region as a mobile phone black spot? Minister, given that the Estens inquiry received about 300 submissions from Australians complaining about Telstra's mobile phone coverage, didn't the inquiry simply ignore those submissions? How will selling the rest of Telstra fix these problems?",32
66,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. It is amazing, isn't it, that, having blackguarded the entire Estens inquiry and all those who comprised it, the opposition will now, in a very opportunistic and quite obvious way, seize on those parts they want to make political capital of. We have already said, as did the Estens inquiry, that there were complaints made to the inquiry. That is why we established it-to get the true picture. And we have got the true picture. We have got the positives, we have got the negatives and we have got a balanced report, which the government will now consider in detail. It is fascinating that a member of the Labor Party would ask a question about the mobile phone network, given that you were to close down the analog network, with no replacement. The Labor Party made the decision in the early 1990s to close the analog network and leave rural subscribers without any substitute, except GSM, which of course would have been inaccessible for a great many of them. So there is an air of hypocrisy in any question from the opposition on the mobile phone network. It is also a coincidence, is it not, Mr Speaker, that the member for Cunningham has been admitted today? On this side of the House, we extend our warm congratulations on your stunning success. The major issue for the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party in that by-election was telecommunications. The disallowance of Telstra's price controls, the Leader of the Opposition said, would be a centre point of the Labor Party's campaign. He was rebuffed on that. He was rebuffed at the last federal election when he said, ‘This election will be a referendum on the sale of Telstra.' He said that on 2 November 2001. We take the Estens inquiry extremely seriously, as do people of an open and fair mind-and that includes regional subscribers. Veterans: Australians at War Archive",32
67,Mr TICEHURST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. On this Remembrance Day, would the minister inform the House what the government is doing to permanently record and archive the memories of Australian war veterans for future generations of Australians?",32
68,Mrs VALE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question on this important day. The stories of our veterans are a priceless part of our history, and the government is committed to ensure that there is a permanent and visual record of their memories. I am pleased to announce on this Remembrance Day that the government is taking action to save for posterity the records and memories of our veterans by commissioning an Australians at War archive, which will be one of the largest in the world-a film archive of veterans' memories. In the last six months a pilot study has been undertaken by the production team responsible for the successful ABC story Australians at War. This screened last year as part of the government's gift to the nation on its Centenary of Federation. Work on the Australians at War archive will commence next month with plans to record and transcribe 2,000 interviews with Australian veterans who served in any of the conflicts, including the First World War and the Second World War, of the first centenary of our nation. The project is expected to take some 2½ years to complete and the final product will be an archive of over 20,000 hours of veteran interviews. It will be the largest archive kind in the world and it will be of great interest to families, historians and researchers. When technology allows, it will also be available to schools and the general public. This will be a real step in ensuring that future generations will never forget the service of our Australian veterans and that they have played a significant part in the building of our nation. Indeed, on this Remembrance Day, it is a very significant gift demonstrating the government's commitment to our veterans. Telstra: Privatisation",32
69,Mr WILKIE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. Can the minister confirm that the Estens inquiry received a submission from a couple from Cuballing, Western Australia, complaining of regular Internet drop-outs and on one occasion having tried to connect to the Internet 120 times? Minister, given that the Estens inquiry received about 275 submissions from Australians complaining about Internet speeds and drop-outs, didn't the inquiry simply ignore these submissions? How will selling the rest of Telstra fix these problems?",33
70,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The government is determined to address very comprehensively and supportively the recommendations of the Estens inquiry, but we do need some time, if you will allow us, to put together such a comprehensive report. We are of courseMs Macklin-Why haven't you responded?",33
71,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I see. You say we could have done it completely over the weekend. I can assure you that work has started with great speed. As soon as possible, a response to the Estens inquiry will be forwarded. But I should say that the government, as the Estens inquiry has recognised, has done a great deal in the past few yearsto the extent that, since 1996, we have spent $1 billion to improve communications and information technology infrastructure around Australia, including especially in regional of its Australia. We have implemented a whole range of consumer safeguards. We have strengthened the universal service obligation. We have introduced a customer service guarantee in a way that the Labor Party never did in 13 years and undoubtedly would not do. In regard to the mobile phone network, we have established the CDMA network, which extended Labor's to-be-abolished analog network by 50 per cent. We have introduced mobile phone coverage, alongMr Wilkie-I raise a point of order on relevance, Mr Speaker. The question related to",33
72,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Swan will resume his seat. The minister's answer is entirely related to the question, which was about the Estens inquiry.",33
73,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Along 10,000 kilometres of Australia's highway, there are many things we could list. Turning now to the issue of speed of the Internet: all Australians have access upon request to a guaranteed 64 kilobytes and digital data service, with the four per cent of remote Australians who do not have access to ISDN receiving a subsidised oneway satellite service under a special scheme. In summary, the opposition would do well to work with the government to provide even better and improved services across the length and breadth of the nation. We are serious and determined to do so. We have allowed two inquiries now to identify where the gaps exist so that the government can act and respond. We have done so in regard to the Besley inquiry; we will do so in regard the Estens inquiry. Trade: East Asia",33
74,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,ANNE KELLY (2.42 p.m.)My question is addressed to the Minister for Trade. Will the minister outline to the House the government's commitment to improving access for Australian exporters to the East Asian region? Is the minister aware of any other strategy?,34
75,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Dawson for her question. Obviously our trade with East Asia is very important for the electorate of Dawson, and particularly for the sugar industry. I do not think there has been any other government in Australia's history that has been more proactively engaged with East Asia in terms of developing trade and economic agreements within the region-no other government in Australia's history. Just by way of example, members would have noted-and the opposition spokesman, the member for Rankin, provided some support a week or so ago-that we announced the conclusion of the free trade agreement between Australia and Singapore. We have concluded that negotiation. We are in the process of negotiating a closer economic relationship with Thailand. We have concluded the agreement with the ASEAN countries-between Australia and New Zealand and the 10 ASEAN countries. We are in discussion with Japan and Korea about trade and economic agreements. And we are negotiating an economic framework agreement with China. Let us not forget some of the results of the work that this government has done in terms of our engagement with East Asia. I instance the announcement of the $25 billion LNG deal with China in recent months as a result of the work that our government has done. Of course, that engagement with East Asia is all aimed at improving and strengthening economic linkages between Australia and the East Asian economies that are so important to the Australian economy in terms of trade and investment. As I indicated, only last week we concluded the negotiations with Singapore on the free trade agreement beto tween Australia and Singapore, the first such agreement that we have concluded in 20 years, since we concluded the CER agreement with New Zealand. It is interesting that we have colleagues from New Zealand in the gallery today. Twenty years ago next year, the Australia and New Zealand CER was concluded. It took this government to get back onto the bilateral stage to negotiate with Singapore, and I would point out that all those bilateral negotiations are taking place with East Asia. We know the position of the opposition. They are opposed to our proposal, our ambitions with the United States. But I would point out that it is the one and only bilateral pursuit we are undertaking outside of East Asia. Of course, we believe Australia has an ability, and we certainly have a policy perspective, to multilaterally, regionally and bilaterally pursue an improvement in our trade and economic agenda. The Labor Party would have us narrowly focus on the multilateral arena only. We believe we can undertake all those pursuits at the same time. We are proving that we can achieve that. We have concluded that negotiation with Singapore, we are engaged with Thailand, we are engaged with other countries in North Asia, and at the same time we are leading the way in terms of moving the multilateral agenda along. This is what our government is about-not just leading the way in Australia in terms of developing the economic base and our economic integration in the region but also leading the way internationally in terms of opening up markets across the world for trade and investment. Of course we are engaged with East Asia. I will give you an indication of the capacity of those engagements. Australia has a trade relationship with Japan of $44 billion; Korea, $15 billion; China, $19 billion; Singapore, $13 billion; Taiwan, $9 billion; Indonesia, $8.7 billion; Malaysia, $8 billion; and Thailand, $6 billion. Just remember: since 1996, our government has led the way with a 50 per cent expansion-an increase-in the level of exports out of Australia from $99 billion to $154 billion, with a lot of it going into these East Asian economies. When criticism comes from some quarters, like the Australian Labor Party, the majority of Australians know that it is without base and that our government is delivering in terms of our engagement with East Asia. Telstra: Privatisation",34
76,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. Can the minister confirm that recommendation 8.1 of the Estens inquiry states that Telstra should only maintain a regional presence when it is ‘compatible with Telstra's commercial interests'? Minister, doesn't this mean that, if Telstra is sold, it will leave town even faster than the banks have?",35
77,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. Do you mean it will leave town faster than the 250 post offices you closed during your term in government? I know the Leader of the Opposition previewed in a doorstop this morning that Telstra would be the issue of the week, but the government is to consider the recommendations and the conclusions of the Estens inquiry. It is something of a broken record to select one part of the Estens inquiry over another to try to score a political point. What the government has done for several years, but particularly following the Besley inquiry, is to inject new funding into the teletion, communications structure throughout regional Australia. As a representative of a rural constituency I can attest to the fact that services, maintenance and repair and installations are at a much higher level than ever before and are quite unrecognisable as the Telstra or Telecom of the Labor government years. Enormous progress has already been made, as the Estens inquiry concludes, but there is still a way to go. The government would never be complacent or reliant upon what has already been done. We will always drive improvement in telecommunications services, with particular emphasis on regional Australia. We will consider the Estens inquiry. We will not be baited into making policy on the run. That is something of the province of the Leader of the Opposition. Over the last few years the government have very comprehensively and thoroughly responded to complaints and issues as they arise. We are proud of our record on telecommunications services in regional Australia. We will build on that record and never take it for granted. The Estens inquiry is a very positive step forward. Health and Ageing: Aged Care",35
78,Dr SOUTHCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Ageing. Can the minister outline to the House the exceptional efforts of South Australia's Julia Farr centre in achieving Commonwealth accreditation for the provision of high-quality aged care services? Can the minister also outline to the House the South Australian government's proposed cuts to services at the Julia Farr centre?,35
79,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Boothby for his question and for his ongoing and keen interest in the provision of health and aged care, particularly in South Australia. Last week I was in Adelaide, along with the Chairman of the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency, to present an award to Julia Farr Services in Fullerton, which is in the honourable member for Adelaide's electorate. Julia Farr Services is the first aged care residential facility in Australia to receive a new commendable award. This award carries with it a four-year accreditaan additional year's accreditation above what has been available in the past, and it is to recognise the very best aged care services in the country. It was a tribute to the work of the board, the staff and the volunteers at Julia Farr Services to receive this award. Indeed, Julia Farr Services has been in operation in Adelaide for 123 years. It specialises in the care of elderly Australians, particularly those who have physical, neurological and brain injury disabilities. Currently, as part of the services, Julia Farr operates 70 high-care beds; indeed, it receives subsidies from the Commonwealth of well over $2 million per year. It was therefore disappointing that the very next day I learned that the state government in South Australia and the minister responsible had decided, secretly, to close down the aged care home at Julia Farr Services and, effectively, to take 70 high-care beds out of the aged care system in South Australia. Mr Howard interjecting",35
80,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Prime Minister asked rhetorically why. That is a good question for the minister in South Australia. She was reported as saying that the board of Julia Farr had decided, but a letter dated 19 July from the Department of Human Services in South Australia which has been made available to us directs the board of Julia Farr to cease to be an aged care provider. I say to members of the House that this is unacceptable. It is unacceptable that the South Australian government is effectively taking up to 70 aged care places out of the system in South Australia. It is unacceptable that an amount of up to $4 million will be lost to the aged care sector on an annual recurrent basis in South Australia. In the last three years Commonwealth government has allocated more than 2,800 extra aged care places to South Australia, worth some $49 million in annual recurrent funding. I call upon the South Australian government-I call upon Premier Rann and Ms Key, the minister-to reverse what is a cold, uncaring and senseless decision. Telstra: Privatisation",36
81,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is also directed to the minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. Minister, are you aware that a submission to the Estens inquiry states that, at Southern Cross University in Lismore, only two out of 171 first-year geology students are able to dial the Internet at an adequate speed and that the majority of students cannot download required course reading? Minister, are you aware that university students in Lismore are frustrated because their university network runs at about half the speed of the sandstone universities' connection speed? Minister, why has the Estens inquiry failed to address the fact that regional students do not have access to something as basic as adequate dial-up Internet service? How will the sale of Telstra provide regional students with the same level of Internet service as city students?",36
82,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. Issues of access and equity are paramount to the government, and it is for that reason that we have already injected $1 billion into improving telecommunications and telecommunications networks throughout regional Australia. We have never said it is picture perfect; we have said that it has been incredibly upgraded since Labor left it in tatters and neglected, and that we still have a way to go. But we will respond properly and with thought, not just with the superficial examination or reading that the opposition has obviously undertaken of the Estens inquiry. But no amount of repetitious questioning will disguise the fact that the Labor Party has internal difficulties on this issue-and on a the few others, at that. The member for Melbourne has written in a paper that the current ownership issue of Telstra is unsustainable. The member for Fraser has said publicly that ownership is not the issue, so he joins the New South Wales Premier in that regard. You then have the opportunist Leader of the Opposition, who will seize on any aspect of any part of telecommunications to try to make a political point. The government will come to the issue carefully and in a considered way, and will have full and proper regard for country people. Employment: Work for the Dole",36
83,Mr HAWKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Employment Services. Can the minister inform the House up of any development in the Howard government's Work for the Dole program, in particular relating to projects of national significance? Furthermore, is the minister aware of any comments regarding Work for the Dole? How do these comments reflect community attitudes?",36
84,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Wannon for his interest in Work for the Dole. Only last month I announced 337 new Work for the Dole programs, building better communities and opportunities around Australia. Eighty-six of those projects were in the home state of the member for Wannon, in Victoria, helping some 1,149 job seekers. Since the inception of the Work for the Dole program there have been 2,884 projects right throughout Victoria, helping communities, building better communities, building infrastructure and assisting Australia's unemployed. But the government is always looking for new and innovative ways in which to build better and stronger communities and also to build on the success which is Work for the Dole. To that end, a Work for the Dole nationally significant project was commenced in Melbourne and in Perth. It was building on our postwar immigration records, detailing these with the National Archives, entering the information into a data package and repackaging it so it would be available not in torate? its original form-which is going to deteriorate over time, so we would lose a very significant part of Australian history-but in a data format so that it would be available eventually to all Australians. There has been a cooperative approach between my department and the Archives, and we are now about to extend the program in Victoria so that post-World War II records will now be put onto the database and made available. That will increase the Work for the Dole program by 20 places and it will do something very significant for Australia's heritage. I am asked about comments. There have not been too many negative comments from the opposition of late, but one has to wonder whether or not the comments that have been made in the past by Victorians such as the member for Batman-where he referred to the program as ‘somewhat of a flop'-still stand today, or whether perhaps he is starting to re-evaluate his thoughts on the program. I direct the member for Batman toMr Martin Ferguson-Have a look at the state of employment in your local electorate.",36
85,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Batman! The minister has the call.,37
86,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They always spark up when we talk about Work for the Dole. It comes down to this: whether or not they supportMs Macklin interjecting Mr Martin Ferguson interjecting,37
87,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I wonder whether some of the members on the opposition front bench understand the importance of this project or whether perhaps they are like the member for Batman. He perhaps should go and visit Ballarat and ask the eight participants in Ballarat about the young people who are,37
88,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,37
89,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, the member for Batman often goes there. Perhaps I could invite the member for BatmanMr Martin Ferguson-Have you ever thought about unemployment in your elec",37
90,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have, on three occasions, drawn the member for Batman's attention to the need for courtesy in the House. The minister has the call.",37
91,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The excitable member for Batman perhaps would like to go and visit the Black Hill Primary School. We are out there preparing teaching aids and displays, assisting with reading, assisting Australia's young people-there is worthwhile work being undertaken by unemployed Victorians with Work for the Dole. Perhaps he would like to visit the City of Bendigo, where retail training opportunities, the sorting of goods, the storing of displays and pricing items are some of the worthwhile activities being undertaken with the Salvation Army there. Not going too far from home, he could even visit Moreland in his own electorate of Batman, where he could determine once and for all whether or not this is a worthwhile program. Electors in the electorate of Batman are participating in organising to collect and recycle educational material to be redistributed to more needy people in the Cook Islands. Perhaps it is time that the member for Batman appreciated the worth of Work for the Dole and how it is working-as the member for Wannon and other Victorian members on this side know-for Victoria's unemployed. It is clear to everybody in this House that the member for Rankin was correct when he said that the electorate is left wondering what it is the Labor Party stands for. This side of the House certainly does not know what you stand for and neither do the unemployed in this country. Telstra: Privatisation",37
92,Ms GEORGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. Is the minister aware of a submission to the Estens inquiry by a medical practice in Albury and Wangaratta which draws attention to the need for high-speed data transmission for the purpose of communicating scan results and diagnoses? Is the minister aware that the submission contains the following: Unfortunately, through Telstra's unwillingness support rural customers, the ISDN service we use for this purpose is to be disconnected. And further: As you can see ... we have a total lack dence that Telstra can be trusted to do what is required. Minister, how will the full privatisation of Telstra ensure high-speed data transmission of medical information in rural and regional Australia?",38
93,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question, but the same question will elicit much the same response-that is, the government are deadly serious, as our record shows, about improving telecommunications services throughout Australia, including in regional and rural areas, across the board; all aspects of it-so that people do have fair and proper access to the network. I should say in regard to health that one of the government's responses to the Besley inquiry was a $50 million national communications fund to give people in regional areas access to remote health and distance education services. That is something the member for Throsby has not taken into account, but we will take into account all aspects of the Estens inquiry because the commitment to improve regional telecommunications services has dominated this government from 1996 onwards, after 13 years of studied and deliberate neglect by the Labor government. We will very responsibly and sympathetically reply to the Estens inquiry. Bushfires",38
94,Mr BARTLETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government. Can the minister advise the House of the current bushfire situation in Australia? What funding has the federal government contributed for the Erickson helitankers to tackle the fire menace?",38
95,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As some would have read in the media, the bushfires throughout Australia this year are of great seriousness and are causing very major damage as we speak. In fact, some 3,000 volunteer and proto fessional firefighters are fighting 102 fires in New South Wales alone, and there are significant fires in the Gold Coast hinterland and on Kangaroo Island in South Australia. of confiAlready, some 36 homes have been destroyed in New South Wales alone. A major contributor to the protection of homes was best identified in an article in today's Sydney Morning Herald which refers to Southern Highlands historian Marie Chalker, who was luckier than some others mentioned. The article states: All that saved her Aylmerton home was a lastminute dousing by a heli-tanker. ‘I just said a prayer and then Elvis appeared and emptied its load,' she said. The fact that those particular helicopters were there and are so effective at saving people's homes in what is professionally called the forest-urban interface is very much due to the contribution and initiative of the Howard government. An inquiry recommended that some of these aircraft be imported. It was found that, with the very early commencement of the fire season, they needed to be airfreighted in, and they were. Not only did the Howard government make an original offer to meet half the sea freight and leasing costs to have this equipment in Australia; we were quick to offer 50 per cent of the airfreight costs as well. These particular aircraft are now making a great contribution-in fact, they commenced work on 17 October and one of the first areas where they set about protecting people's property was in the Blue Mountains, in part of the member for Macquarie's electorate. He of course is very conscious of the benefits this is bringing to his constituents. All that said, we should not for a moment ignore the contribution of the men and women and their terrestrial equipment that is at the very front of these fires; in fact, they are the people who must do their best. There are issues relating to that which must be addressed in the future. There has been a clear inadequacy in roads for those people to get in and address these fires, and that is one of the reasons why we need more aerial assets. But the fact of life is that there also has to be proper forest management. In fact, as was put to the select committee of the New South Wales parliament, the National Parks and Wildlife Service had reduced their hazard reduction by 60 per cent over seven years and as a result lost 750,000 hectares of their forest reserves to fire, compared to the 2,000 hectares which was all that was lost in state forests where appropriate hazard reduction of about 100,000 hectares a year had been practised continuously. So these are pretty important issues. Those on the other side of the House have also said a lot about the Commonwealth's role. There have been all sorts of suggestions and questions to the Deputy Prime Minister. It was of some interest to me, therefore, that on 22 October the Queensland Premier had the following to say, as recorded in Hansard on page 3828: Queensland has been participating in a project to develop a national aerial firefighting strategy. project commenced as a result of concerns arising from the New South Wales bushfires in late 2001 and early 2002. The Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon. John Anderson, wrote to the New South Wales Premier offering assistance to coordinate the development of a joint proposal amongst the states and territories on cost-effective options improving Australia's aerial firefighting capacity. Now, that is not an example of offers, as has been reported, to buy four helicopters and do other sorts of things. In fact, it identifies that the Commonwealth took a leading role. In response to that, we were challenged on the last day of sitting in the previous session with, ‘Why don't we have a summit?' That challenge of course came from the opposition. They have had a lot of summits: there was the economic summit, there was the tax summit and there was the ALP rules summit, and they all had no effect. I thought I could identify some of the speakers that might be present. We could have the member for Werriwa tell us how effective a coastguard might be in putting out coastal fires; he says it will fix everything else. The member for Rankin could give a speech on how, under the Kyoto principles, you could sell all those charcoal credits after the fires. The member for Fremantle could tell us about the importance of recollections in getting yourself out of a fire. Economy: Debt Management",38
96,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. Can you confirm that 10 foreign currency swap contracts have matured so far this financial year? Can you also confirm that these contracts have realised further losses of between $300 and $400 million so far this financial year? Treasurer, can you confirm that changes ordered by the Minister for Finance and Administration will mean that the table which contains the data on foreign currency losses, which enabled these foreign currency swap losses to be detected in February this year, will no longer be published in the annual report of the Australian Office of Financial Management?",39
97,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Prior to lunch the member for Fraser made a number of false allegations again, including the one he has just put to me. I am told by the Minister for Finance and Administration that under the The finance minister's orders dated 24 May 2001 the requirement for 2001-02 is that all administered revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and cash flows be disclosed by way of note rather than on the face of the statements. There is no diminution in the detail of for information disclosed and foreign exchange gains and losses are explicitly required to be reported in the note: appendix A of the FMO for 2001-02. I am further instructed that the finance minister's orders were disallowable instruments and they were gazetted on 27 June 2001 without any demur from the Labor Party. Here was the big hot scoop before lunch. That is what Senator Minchin tells me. Mr Tanner-Is this your defence?",39
98,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Melbourne!,40
99,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In addition to that, a number of otherMr Tanner-You've got to be joking!",40
100,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Melbourne must be aware that on a number of occasions today I have drawn his attention to his behaviour. Given that he may have found some of the questions and answers more provocative than others, I have been quite tolerant. He cannot expect that tolerance to continue.",40
101,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,A number of the other false claims were made by the member for Fraser shortly before lunch. I cannot deal with all of his falsity but I will deal with some of his most egregious ones. The report of the Australian Office of Financial Management as at 30 June 2002 reported on page 20 that the appreciation in the exchange rate over 2001-02 led to a foreign currency gain of $1.2 billion. Mr MCMullan-What about all the realised losses?,40
102,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am coming that. If he can only restrain himself, I am coming to that! The then shadow Treasurer showed great interest as at 30 June 2001 on valuation effects, but he shows no interest in valuation effects in this year's report, which was tabled Friday week ago. It is all there on page 20: As at 30 June 2002, the realised gain on the total portfolio was $144.3 million … and $777.4 million (in net present value terms). That is the realised gain. It is all there on page 20. He was fishing around on page 160 looking for Senator Minchin's alleged perfidy. Then it says: On a broader economic return basis, this takes into account both accruals and cash and exchange rate and interest differentials. The economic formance of the strategy since it commenced in 1987-88which is 15 years agowas a loss of $898 million ... Which is about $45 million over the course of 15 years. While they were busily thumbing their way on page 160, they apparently forgot to read the summary which set it all out. While I have got the opportunity-I was afraid I would not be asked a question on this today-when the member for Fraser is asked is he against the strategy of cross-currency swaps, he says there is nothing inherently wrong with it-and he nods again. He has to say that, doesn'the, because it is a Labor Party policy? There is nothing inherently wrong with it. When he is asked whether the government is doing the right thing by winding it up, he says he cannot disagree with that. It is his policy and we are doing the right thing to wind it up. So what is his complaint? When he is actually pushed on what his complaint is, he says, ‘The Australian government should have sold Australian dollars at the time of the Asian financial crisis. You should have wound down your cross-currency swaps which involve selling Australian dollars in 1997.' That is what he said. I will make a few points about this. The first is that it is great to be an expert on the 1997 exchange rate in 2002; that is easy. But if we searched the record in 1997 did we find anybody in the Labor Party advocating getting out of the Australian dollar? Did they advocate it in 1998? Did they advocate it in 1999? No, they advocated it in 2002-a sort of a Back to the Future, where somebody goes to the future and gets the race results and comes back in time and decides to bet on winners. That is the first point. Did the Labor Party advocate it in 1997, 1998 and 1999 or thereafter? No. Did the Treasury secretary advocate it? No. Did the Reserve Bank governor advocate it? No. Mr Gavan O'Connor-Did you advocate it?",40
103,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Did I advocate it? No, I did not. Let me tell you why I did not advocate it: in 1997, when the Australian dollar perwas falling and when Labor debt had peaked at something like $US9 billion, what would have been the effect of the Australian government selling its own currency in the midst of a financial crisis? Let me ask this other rhetorical question: what would the price have been-not the published price looking back now-if the Australian government had dumped its own currency? It certainly would not have been the advertised price of that day. At the time when the Asian financial crisis was on, no-one in their right mind would have advocated that. In fact, the Reserve Bank of Australia was actually buying the currency in 1997, if the truth be known. That has all been put on the record since. So to expect the Australian government to be selling currency to its own Reserve Bank in 1997 really does take one's breath away. If that is the level of the 2002 analysis, all say is: the Leader of the Opposition is very safe in his current job. Small Business: Regulation",40
104,Mr BILSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Small Business and Tourism. Will the minister inform the House of how unnecessary regulation burdens small business and hinders growth? Is the minister aware of any proposals to increase regulation on small businesses?,41
105,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you to the member for Dunkley, a great advocate for the 8,000 small businesses in his electorate. The member for Dunkley knows, as do all the members in the Liberal and National parties, that over-regulation prevents small businesses from making money. The Liberal and National parties want small business to make money; they want small business to be profitable. If a small business person is spending time dealing with regulation and they are not selling to their customers, they are not making money. One of the biggest causes of red tape is the overlap between Commonwealth, state and local government. This is quite an astounding figure: the Office of Small Business advises me that the Commonwealth requires approximately 250 licenses and permits-in this parliament, we are aware that those licenses and permits would be things like TV licences, broadcasting licences, banking licences and so on-there are 3,000 required by the states and there are 20,000 required by local government. Mr Howard interjecting",41
106,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That could get us into some trouble, couldn't it? Mr Howard interjecting",41
107,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I see. Any attempt to reduce the regulatory overlap is obviously welcome. Victoria took a major step forward in 1996 when under the Liberal and National government they referred power on workplace relations from the states to the Commonwealth so that a single system would apply, and 275,000 small businesses welcomed this initiative and it was great news for more than half a million Victorian employees. However, there is a disappointment I can to come. On 12 September this year, Steve Bracks introduced a bill to the Victorian parliament that would go back to the bad old days. It meant that there could be three levels of regulation for small business workplace relations instead of one. So Victoria under Steve Bracks want to go back to three levels of regulation in workplace relations instead of the single level they have at the moment. As an example, under this bill a Victorian business could reintroduce awards to a number of industries where they have not applied for years. So what does that mean? It means that effectively, for example, the old picnic days come into play as a result of the initiative of the Bracks government. The Australian Retailers Association estimates that the additional cost and compliance burden of this Bracks government initiative would cost Victoria 2,500 retail jobs. It estimates that 20 per cent of businesses would cease Sunday trading and a third of businesses would reduce Sunday trading. It is even worse in rural and regional Victoria. The Victorian Farmers Federation estimate that 10,000 rural jobs would be lost as a result of this Bracks industrial relations legislation. And this is during the worse drought in regional Australia in 100 years. On the one hand you have the Bracks Labor Party, which wants more regulation for small business and wants to create more impediments to the employment of people in Victoria and, on the other hand-as displayed by what they did in government-you have the Liberal Party, who are committed to reducing the red tape burden and who are committed to a single system of industrial relations applying to Victorian businesses. The Victorian Liberals are committed to getting on with the job, something that the Bracks Labor government has not done for three years.",41

109,Mr HOWARD,MEMBER FOR ADELAIDE,"I take this opportunity, indulgence, to say on behalf of everybody how delighted I am to see the member for Adelaide, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing, back and looking so well. It is great to have you back, Trish.",42
110,Ms MACKLIN,MEMBER FOR ADELAIDE,"Jagajaga) (3.21 p.m.)On the same matter, on indulgence if I may, it is great to see the member for Adelaide looking so fantastic and it is wonderful that the treatment has been so successful. PARLIAMENT HOUSE: SECURITY",42
111,The SPEAKER,MEMBER FOR ADELAIDE,"I would like to make a statement to the House on security in Parliament House. On 23 October 2002, I presented to the House the final report of a review of certain aspects of the ministration of the parliament by the Parliamentary Service Commissioner, Mr Andrew Podger. The President presented a copy to the Senate at the same time. The report dealt in part with security at Parliament House, and I wish to outline to the House, as far as is appropriate given security considerations, the situation regarding security in this building. Since the events of 11 September 2001, the President and I have been actively seeking to strengthen the security of Parliament House in light of the heightened level of threat. We are determined to safeguard the Australian democratic system of government, the institution of parliament, the occuis pants of Parliament House and the 1.2 million Australian and overseas visitors who visit Parliament House each year. I know these sentiments are shared by every member of the parliament. To this end, a number of operational security initiatives were implemented immediately after 11 September 2001, in accordance with the heightened threat assessment issued by the Protective Security Coordination Centre, to which the Parliamentary Security Controller had immediate access. These included the introduction of electronic pass verification for pass holders. Security screening was extended to include all persons entering the building, and restrictions were placed on vehicle access to the ministerial entrance. Restrictions were also placed on on the issue of visitor day passes and the delivery of unaccompanied goods. Procedures at the entrances and loading dock were also tightened, and a number of electronic security enhancements were introduced. The then President and I also agreed, in March 2002, to the establishment of an interim security management board to ensure the better coordination of the strategic, management and technical requirements of security at Parliament House. The board, which has met monthly since March, has provided a much improved and better coordinated focus on the full range of security requirements at Parliament House. It has been undertaking a comprehensive review of the security environment at Parliament House and impleadmenting, with the approval of the Presiding Officers, further security measures. For example, we recently stopped short-term parking at the Senate and House of Representatives entrances. We have also asked the board to hasten the planning process to restructure the entrances in both the House and Senate wings, following the imminent relocation of the Synergy travel offices to the area previously occupied by Qantas. This will be done with the twofold aim of enhancing security and easing congestion at peak times. Following receipt of the Podger report, the President and I have established the Security Management Board as a permanent body. It chaired by the Secretary, Joint House Department, and consists of the Usher of the Black Rod, the Serjeant-at-Arms, the Security Controller and representatives from DPRS, the ministerial wing, the Protective Security Coordination Centre and the Australian Protective Service. We have also decided, as recommended  function in Joint House Department. We believe that the implementation of these changes will ensure that security at Parliament House is run in a centrally coordinated and professional manner, consistent with the security threat that we now face. Included in the Podger report on security matters were the following issues: - The physical design of the parliamentary precincts limits the ability to control hicles from gaining close access to the premises, possibly endangering building occupants if a vehicle contained an explosive device. - There are concerns about the adequacy of the current arrangements for the issue and administration of passes within the parliament, including the relatively broad level of access to private areas of the building provided by passes. - There are better options for the deployment of Australian Protective Service staff in conjunction with Parliamentary Security Service staff to make the protective security of the building more effective. All of these issues have been considered by the Security Management Board or the Parliamentary Security Controller. For obvious reasons, it is not appropriate to discuss publicly the details of the outcomes of those deliberations. However, I can advise the House that they have either been attended to or are being attended to in an expeditious manner. In addition, these matters will continue to be monitored and measures upgraded if the threat environment changes. Some of these issues attracted media attention. In addition, various elements of the media have raised the issue of limited access control to the House of Representatives and Senate car parks during sitting weeks. The use of security personnel in these locations is primarily a car park management matter rather than a security initiative. The advice we have received is that an explosion in those car parks is not seen as a significant risk in the current threat environmentMr Leo MCLeay-Except for the people in the cars!",42
112,The SPEAKER,MEMBER FOR ADELAIDE,"I warn the member for Watson! The advice we have received is that an explosion in those car parks is not seen as a significant risk in the current threat environment and would have a low impact on the structure of Parliament House. This is not to suggest that there is no risk, and the Security Management Board is looking at measures to minimise the risk. The Security Management Board, with the veauthority of the Presiding Officers, is continuing its review of security arrangements at Parliament House and is receiving highquality intelligence from the full range of relevant Commonwealth authorities, as well as other expert advice. Parliamentary security is being integrated with the rest of the Commonwealth in its continuing assessment of threat. As a result of the Security Management Board's reviews, it is expected that further precautionary measures will be implemented to enhance the security of Parliament House. Clearly, the tightening of security at Parliament House has an impact on all building occupants and visitors. It is necessary, however, that we ensure that any identified weaknesses in the existing security framework are addressed. This may include further aspects related to building access. We are aware that increased security measures may have an impact on the appropriations to the parliament. The possible need for additional funding for security emphasises the importance of addressing the remainder of the Podger report, which concludes that significant savings can be achieved from changes to the administration of the parliament. As advised when we presented the copy of the report on 23 October 2002, the President and I will be considering these matters at the end of this month, after seeking comment on the recommendations. We will be closely examining the impact on the appropriations to the parliament. We are grateful for the cooperation shown by members, senators and all other occupants of, and visitors to, Parliament House in the wake of the introduction of heightened security measures. The President and I will continue to do all we can to ensure that new measures balance our obligations to the people in this building with the need to maintain as far as possible Australia's Parliament House as an accessible and open public institution.

123,The Clerk,PETITIONS,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate ministers: Foreign Affairs: Iraq the To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that the people of Australia have not been consulted on a commitment made that Australia will support an impending war against Iraq. We are concerned that such a war will- Result in the deaths of many Iraqi civilians, as well as Australian, US and Iraqi troops. - Goad Saddam Hussein to use any weapons at his disposal in a bid to retain power. - Cause a civil war in Iraq, enlarge the refugee problem and further destabilise the Middle East. - Enhance the perception that The West is at war with the Islamic World, thus consolidating the recruitment power of anti-Western extremists. Your petitioners request that the House shall refuse to commit Australia to join the United States of America in this impending war, and further, that Australia uses what influence it has over the US to convince it to use non-violent strategies such as seeking a zone free of weapons of mass destruction over the entire Middle East. by Ms Jann MCFarlane (from 1,587 citizens) and by Mr Stephen Smith (from 96 citizens). Telecommunications: Services To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia, namely ‘Radio for all Australians Association Inc' draw to the attention of the House the need for the establishment of a radio station for the benefit of those people who suffer the inability to read the spoken word and for the benefit of the community in general. The Federal Government has spent millions of dollars making sure that deaf people in this country receive television services, but for those who can't read or write, which is some 6.8 million Australians, there is a need for a special radio licence and frequency, so these special programs can be broadcast all over Australia. Your petitioners therefore request the House to urgently consider the need for the introduction of legislation to provide this essential service by Mr Andren (from 24 citizens). Foreign Affairs: Iraq To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the widespread concern and disquiet held by many Australians with the possibility of a US led attack on Iraq and Australia's involvement in such an action. Your petitioners therefore request the House to: - use its influence to dissuade the US Government from the threat of precipitating military action in Iraq; - refrain from all support of such threats; - continue with diplomatic efforts to reach a resolution of the problems of the region; and - work through the United Nations, as the duly constituted international body, for building a secure basis for world peace. by Mr Andren (from 1,225 citizens). Suicide Bombings To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in the Parliament of Australia: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the attention of the House that they believe that suicide bombing/homicide bombing is a crime against humanity. Calling on the humanitarian ideals of the people of Australia as represented by the parliament, your petitioners therefore ask the House to act immediately to propose a motion at the United Nations to declare clearly and unequivocally that the practice of suicide bombing is a crime against humanity. As a sub-clause that ‘This crime and its promoters, organisers and supporters are guilty of a crime which has been committed against the perpetrator (who has been indoctrinated) as well as the victims of the crime.' Further, that there is no moral, religious, political or ethical justification for this crime, and that criminals should be prosecuted and punished as per international conventions. by Dr Emerson (from three citizens). Health: Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House: That increases to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme in the 2002 budget will hit those that can least afford it, families and pensioners. - That this Government should remember the commitments made before the 2001 election in regard to the cost of prescription drugs. We therefore pray that the House oppose the Howard-Costello plan to increase the cost of prescription drugs for Australians. by Ms Hall (from 20 citizens). Aviation: Sydney and Bankstown Airports To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the state of New South Wales point out to the House that: If Sydney's airports are sold on a 99 year lease (50 years plus 49 year option), we will be left with the present sites and condemned to endure a future of increasing noise, pollution and significant risk of crashes. If Sydney's airports are sold for the current reported prices, the public will receive only a fraction of the true real estate value. The noise problem is not solved. The Howard government promised not to privatise the airport until the noise problem had been solved. Using Bankstown as an overflow airport will make room for more big noisy jets at Sydney Airport resulting in increased aircraft noise across the city. It will also inundate people around Bankstown with jet noise ruining their quiet enjoyment of their property and suburb. If Sydney's airports are sold, the public will lose control of future development. Overseas ownership would further reduce our control. The airports' exemption from noise controls mean that they should remain in public ownership and under government control. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to halt the privatisation of Sydney Airport and Bankstown Airport, and to repeal the sections of the the Airports' Act which currently permits these sales. by Mr Howard (from 340 citizens). Australia Post: Postal Services To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain electors of the division of Robertson draws to the attention of the House that Woy Woy Post Office needs to trade always on Saturdays and not only before Christmas. Your petitioners therefore request the House to draw the attention of Australia Post to the above mentioned requirement. by Mr Lloyd (from four citizens). Australia Post: Postal Services To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of residents of the state of Queensland draws to the attention of the House the public need for an Australia Post Office to be located within High Street Plaza Shopping Centre, Toowoomba, Queensland 4350. Your petitioners therefore request the House to recognise the inadequate postal services within the suburbs of Rangeville and Middle Ridge and its surrounds and address this matter with the issuing of a licence to operate an Australia Post, Post Office at High Street Plaza Shopping Centre, the central focal point of our rapidly expanding region. by Mr Ian Macfarlane (from 2,722 citizens). Science: Animal Research To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that the Federal Government has approved a grant of $5 million to fund a facility in Churchill, Victoria, for the breeding of laboratory monkeys to be used in research. The billions of dollars invested annually in animal research would be put to much more efficient, effective and humane use if redirected to clinical and epidemiological research and public health programs. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to: 1. Rescind the grant to fund the building of a facility for the breeding of monkeys which will be harmed or killed in the course of research. 2. Instead provide funding for the development and utilisation of research techniques which do not use animals at any stage. by Mr MCClelland (from 248 citizens). Banking: Fees and Services To the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of electors of Stirling points out to the House our unhappiness with the continued increases in fees and charges by the banking sector, at a time when banks are making record profits. We urge the House to recognise that banks do have an obligation to be accessible and to provide a service to the community. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House heed our concerns and if necessary provide consumer protection regulations to ensure that the banks do not continue to diminish service to customers while increasing fees. by Ms Jann MCFarlane (from 166 citizens). Agriculture: Food Irradiation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House their opposition to food irradiation and the building of the nuclear irradiation facility proposed for Narangba, in Queensland, as well as the Electron beam irradiation facility proposed for North Queensland. Your petitioners therefore request the House to: - Prohibit the establishment of a nuclear irradiation facility or X-Ray or Electron beam irradiation facility at any location in Australia. - Ban the import, export and sale of irradiated food in Australia. Call on the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council (ANZFSC) and the Australian New Zealand Food Authority (ANZFA) to amend Standards A-17 and 1.5.3-Irradiation of Foods in the Food Standards Code to ban food irradiation outright in Australia and New Zealand. by Ms Jann MCFarlane (from 20 citizens). Nuclear Armed and Powered Vessels To the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled: We, the undersigned residents of Australia ask that the House of Representatives consider the health and welfare of the present and future residents of this country and the environmental impacts of possible negative impacts relating to the visits of nuclear powered and/armed vessels into Australian ports. Nuclear navies are not welcome here whatever the colour of their flags. The recent spate of accidents involving nuclearpowered submarines should be enough to convince all governments that the risk to the environment of these floating Chernobyls is a risk we don't have to take. Accordingly, we respectfully request that the parliament legislate to prevent all visits of nuclear armed/powered vessels to Australian ports and waters. And your petitioners as in duty bound, will ever humbly pray. by Ms Jann MCFarlane (from 60 citizens). Telstra: Privatisation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in the Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the attention of the House to our concern that: (1) the Howard-Anderson Government plans to fully privatise the Australian people's 50.1 per cent share of Telstra as stated in the Government's own 2001 Budget papers; (2) a fully privatised Telstra will focus on prof- zens). its not people; and (3) services will suffer under a fully privatised Telstra, particularly in outer metropolitan, rural and regional Australia. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to oppose the Howard-Anderson Government's plans to fully privatise Telstra. by Ms Jann MCFarlane (from 34 citizens). Foreign Affairs: Iraq To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the attention of the House that the undersigned are deeply concerned about the American government's plans to invade Iraq and the Australian government's offer of troops and armaments to support them. We believe that the options for negotiating the monitoring and containment of the production of chemical and biological weapons by an impartial, international team of experts have not been fully explored. Until there is unmistakable evidence of Saddam Hussein's possession of, and intention to use these weapons for purposes beyond that of defending Iraq against an invading force, we oppose any Australian offer to support US military intervention in Iraq. Neither should any military action be taken without being sanctioned by the United Nations. We believe that the harmful consequences of an invasion would far outweigh the benefits. Heavy military and civilian casualties, damage to property and farming land and to relationships between America, Australia and the Middle East would lead to major, irreversible economic and humanitarian problems globally. We consider your refusal to allow parliamentary debate ‘until Washington has decided whether to launch a pre-emptive attack to wipe out Iraq's rumoured stockpile of weapons of mass destruction' to be irresponsible and misleading. By the time Washington makes this decision it will no longer be possible to reverse the present military commitment you have made on our behalf. Your petitioners request that the House shall refuse further attempts to involve Australian forces in this campaign unless it can be demonstrated beyond doubt that there are no options for diplomatic solution and that Iraqi military activities pose a direct threat to Australia. by Ms Jann MCFarlane (from six citiImmigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs: Lease of Flats To the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of electors of Balga, in the seat of Stirling Western Australia, wishes to request the House, that the Department of Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs involvement in the lease of flats in Modena Place Balga from the Department of Housing and Works, be discontinued. We urge the House to recognise that whilst the Department of Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs have just over two years of their lease to go, they intend to quit the lease as soon as practicable due to the limited use by Permanent Protective Visa Holders, and call for tenders for new accommodation managers. While this accommodation represents the remaining structures in a redevelopment site and their continued use is restricting the redevelopment of the area, we see no useful purpose in installing new accommodation managers, and ask that the facility be closed down. We, your petitioners therefore pray that the House heed our concerns and that the necessary steps are taken to discontinue the use of the Modena Place accommodation. by Ms Jann MCFarlane (from 66 citizens). Environment: Sea Cage Fish Farms To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Australia to the attention of the House the impact of sea cage fish farms in Moreton Bay. - Sea cage fish farms will significantly increase level of nutrients into the bay derived from excess feed, faeces, dead fish, operational pollution and cage cleaning; - Increase the risk of algal blooms; - Contribute to lowering dissolved oxygen in the water which leads to the death of marine life; - Place at risk the wild populations of fish, bird and flora species through introduced diseases, genetically modified breeding stock and pollution plumes; - Require the use of tetracycline and formalin as medication in the feed and anti-fouling agents to clean cages, the long-term environmental effects of which are not known; - Create a blight on the visual amenity of Moreton Bay significantly affecting the tourist potential of Moreton Bay; - Compromise the millions of dollars that has been invested to date to remove nitrogen from Moreton Bay to protect the fragile ecosystem. Your petitioners therefore request the House to immediately enact legislation that will prevent establishment of sea cage fish farms in Moreton Bay. by Mr Sciacca (from 509 citizens). Health: MRI Machines To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition calls upon the Commonwealth Government to grant an MRI Medicare licence to Western Australia's only specialist children's hospital, Princess Margaret. An MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) machine is an essential diagnostic tool for a range of paediatric medical conditions. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to ensure that the Commonwealth provide children in Western Australia with access to Medicare MRI scans at Princess Margaret. by Mr Stephen Smith (from 331 citizens).

129,Mr DANBY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Mr Ramsey claimed in his report of 26 October that I had missed a meeting of the Selection Committee because I was at lunch with Mr Richard Butler. This is a factual error. I was not at lunch. As secretary of the opposition's foreign affairs committee, I had organised the largest meeting of our national security committee which commenced at 4 p.m., around the time of the Selection Committee meeting. Mr the Ramsey claimed that I had asserted that the motion chosen in my absence was divisive and inflammatory: factual error 2. I had asserted that the continuing raising of this issue outside was divisive and inflammatory and that in the post-Bali situation such motions should also condemn homicide bombing. Mr Ramsey claimed that I called the Selection Committee Chair, Ian Causley, and that I had seen him on Tuesday: factual error 3. I had no meeting with Mr Causley. We spoke on the phone briefly about Selection Committee process, which Mr Causley later confirmed in a handwritten note. Mr Ramsey claimed that Deputy Speaker Causley told me the motion could not be withdrawn: factual error 4. Deputy Speaker Causley told me that the motion could be withdrawn or, as I was more interested in, amended. Mr Ramsey claimed that I had approached the member for Sturt: factual error 5. In fact, I met him by chance in the coffee  aware of the controversial motion. Finally, Mr Ramsey implies in the Sydney Morning Herald that an email I had sent to the ABC Middle East correspondent Tim Palmer was somehow related to complaints to the ABC board about Tim Palmer's reportage: factual error 6. It was not. I know nothing about the ABC board discussion. Not only did Mr Ramsey fail to get my version of these above events but in his 26 October article he actually censored my comments about Tim Palmer, reported fairly by the Sydney Morning Herald on an earlier date. NA Health: Diabetes",48
130,Mrs MOYLAN,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I move: That this House: (1) notes: (a) the alarming rise in the number of people with Type 2 Diabetes estimated to be 1 million, with half of those people rently undiagnosed; (b) according to a recent landmark study by Diab Cost Australia, Type 2 diabetes is costing Australians a staggering $3 billion a year with the bill for each person averaging nearly $11,000 in expenditure and benefits; (c) according to the study, as the complications of diabetes increase, the costs person are estimated to escalate from $4,020 to $9,625 when there are both microvascular and macrovascular problems; (d) early detection through screening programs and action to slow or prevent the onset of complications will see reductions in health costs and improve and maintain quality of life for individuals with Type 2 Diabetes; and (e) the contribution this landmark study conducted by Associate Professor Stephen Colaguiuri of Daib Cost Australia will make to better informing Government and the public of a significant public health problem; (2) congratulates the Federal Government for the emphasis it has placed on public awareness programs in relation to Type 2 Diabetes; and (3) urges the Government to: (a) continue programs to raise public awareness of the high risk of undiagnosed and untreated cases of Type 2 Diabetes and ensure access to appropriate screening; (b) support access to new medications for the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes while ensuring that Australian taxpayers get value for money through appropriate pricing arrangements; (c) continue to encourage people diagnosed with Diabetes to undergo regular medical testing including eye testing so as to prevent complications; (d) ensure adequate funding for further research into prevention and treatment of Type 2 Diabetes; and (e) develop a strong education program encouraging appropriate diet and exercise regimes to minimize the risk of Type 2 Diabetes. Diabetes is emerging as one of the greatest public health challenges of the 21st century. Diabetes is a chronic disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin, does curnot use insulin effectively, or both. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that helps the body use glucose-a sugar that is the body's main energy source. When insulin is absent or ineffective, the level of glucose in the blood increases. There are two types of diabetes: type 1, which accounts for 10 to 15 per cent of cases per and is not caused by lifestyle factors, and type 2, which accounts for 85 to 90 per cent of cases and is influenced by genetic predisposition and lifestyle factors. Type 2 diabetes is a silent killer. It often remains undiagnosed for many years, resulting in complications such as blindness, stroke, heart attack, amputation of limbs and kidney failure-to name a few. The cost in terms of quality of life can be very high if diabetes goes undetected and untreated. It is estimated that more than one million Australians have diabetes, and at least half of them do not know that they have this disease. After launching a retinopathy program for the former minister for health about two years ago, I decided to set up a parliamentary diabetes group in an endeavour to highlight the challenges we face with what many health professionals now call a diabetes epidemic. This epidemic is worldwide. I discussed the idea of setting up a parliamentary group with several of my colleagues, and I am grateful for the enthusiastic response of Cameron Thompson, the member for Blair; Dick Adams, the member for Lyons; Dr Mal Washer, the member for Moore-Dr Washer originally seconded this motion but he is unable to be with us in the House today, so I would like to acknowledge his support-and Senator Guy Barnett, Liberal senator for Tasmania. All of these people agreed to form the founding executive for a bipartisan parliamentary group committed to promoting better health outcomes for people with diabetes. The support group has been set up to provide support to members and others who have been diagnosed with diabetes. Managing diabetes in any circumstances is a challenge, but in this environment it presents a particular challenge. The group will also act as a conduit to government and ministers to improve the management of diabetes and education in the community; liaise with industry groups, research organisations and other health professionals to raise public awareness of lifestyle choices which increase the risk of becoming a type 2 diabetic and the importance of early detection; and promote the development of programs to minimise the risks of health complications associated with inadequate or poor management of type 2 diabetes. I would also like to thank many other members of the parliament who have joined this group. Not all of them are diabetics, but they all recognise that this key health issue in their electorates and in the states that they represent. We were lucky enough to have GlaxoSmithKline host an inaugural dinner here in Parliament House last month, which was a tremendous success. That was our first function as a group. Our guest speakers, Brian Conway, Chief Executive Officer of Diabetes Australia, and Professor Paul Zimmet, Director of the International Diabetes Institute, both gave wonderful speeches that certainly focused the mind. On World Diabetes Day, which is on 14 November-this Thursday-we have arranged with Diabetes Australia a number of activities in Parliament House to draw attention to this growing health problem, and we hope that everyone employed by or visiting the parliament that day will take the opportunity to better inform themselves of the risks and the options for the prevention and treatment of diabetes. In conclusion, I thank all of my colleagues for the support that they have given this motion today, particularly those of my colleagues who will follow me in speaking to this motion.",49
131,Mr ADAMS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I second the motion. As one of many sufferers of type 2 diabetes, I think it is very important that diabetes is highlighted as one of the most damaging problems affecting the general health of the community. None of us is immune to this threat. Some of us are born with a tendency to develop type 2 diabetes; others of us acquire it as a part of the ageing process because of our lifestyle and genetic make-up. No group of people is immune. It often takes some other health problem to highlight what should have been obvious, but we do not like to admit that we have it until we have to. I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes two years ago and have been living with managing the disease since then. The good thing about knowing about the disease is that you can then set yourself up to manage it and take control over your life, rather than denying that there is anything wrong. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes, affecting 85 to 90 per cent of all is a people with the disease. This type of diabetes, also known as late onset diabetes, is characterised by insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. The disease is strongly genetic in origin, but lifestyle factors such as excess weight, inactivity, high blood pressure and poor diet are major risk factors for its development. Symptoms may not show for many years and, by the time they appear, significant problems may have developed. People with type 2 diabetes are twice as likely to suffer cardiovascular disease. Type 2 diabetes may be treated by dietary change, exercise and/or tablets. Insulin injections may later be required. This disease is running rampant in Australia. The Director of the International Diabetes Institute in Melbourne, Professor Paul Zimmet, has said that it is the biggest epidemic in human history. Professor Zimmet expresses the position very clearly. There are 500 million people worldwide with either diabetes or the condition coming on. The so called pre-diabetes condition is glucose intolerance. It can be detected with the same blood sugar test that picks up diabetes, but has no symptoms. Two million Australians have the condition, and more than half of those will have full-blown diabetes by 2007. A million Australians already have diabetes, though half of those do not yet know it. Three-quarters of diabetics will eventually die from heart disease. Physical activity is being engineered out of our lives with the automation of industry, computerisation, kids not exercising after school and going to the computer, parents driving their kids to school because they are scared they are going to be kidnapped et cetera. Elderly people are scared to exercise at night because they might be mugged. Professor Zimmet has said that it is not good enough for us to expect individuals to change their lifestyles if they do not have the infrastructure around them. According to Professor Zimmet, government has a responsibility to provide places for people to exercise in safety and the government should consider extending school hours to replace the physical education that has been cut out of curriculums. Professor Zimmet said that the public needed to be aware of risk categories for so-called pre-diabetes and should ask for a test by a GP if necessary. He would love to see screening for everyone, but did not think it economically feasible in the current health climate. I commend my colleagues, especially the member for Pearce, who established the group here in Parliament House. I certainly hope that we can make people aware, and our colleagues in this House aware, of the significance of this disease throughout the Australian community, the need to highlight it and the need to get people to take a test see how they are going so that we can deal with it into the future. (Time expired)",50
132,Mr CAMERON THOMPSON,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I have spoken in the past in the parliament about the problems of diabetes, being a type 1 diabetic myself. This motion, particularly given that it falls in the week of World Diabetes Day this Thursday, is significant, and the fact that it focuses on the problems of type 2 diabetics I think is well and truly timely and something that I hope will focus the minds of members of parliament on the great cost of this disease not only in dollar terms but in opportunities lost. It is a deadly disease and it is spreading dramatically across the world. That has been highlighted recently in the final report of the Australian diabetes, obesity and lifestyle study-AusDiab-within Australia, DiabCost Australia: Assessing the burden of type 2 diabetes in Australia. One of the most significant findings of the study, which was launched on 26 September in Adelaide, was that the complications of diabetes increase over time and with that the costs of maintaining the disease escalate. It is estimated that in Australia we pay $3 billion a year, with the average cost per person at $5,360 plus $5,500 in benefits. That is the cost of diabetes. Another significant factor to the debate we are having here is that the prevalence of type 2 diabetes among Indigenous Australians is one of the highest in the world. In 1995, selfreported diabetes was seven to eight times higher among Indigenous Australians than for other Australians aged between 25 and 55 years. Both the earlier speakers referred to the formation of the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group. I thank all those members who have lined up to join that group, because it is certainly highlighting in the parliament something that is very serious. As type 2 diabetes is something that does manifest itself mostly in older people-people with a sedentary lifestyle-I think that pure self preservation should encourage more and more MPs to take an interest in diabetes and the parliamentary support group. I would like to pay credit to the member for Pearce for to her vision in putting that group together. She was the one who thought of it and has promoted it, and I am glad that she has had such enthusiasm to get us on board and make it happen. In the year 2000 there were 160 million people worldwide with diabetes. The predictions are that that figure will grow to 280 million by the year 2025. One of the most remarkable aspects of Professor Zimmet's speech at the recent dinner of the diabetes support group was his comment on the rate at which the disease is growing, not only in Australia-we have a high growth rate here-but in other countries: in Asia, there are growth rates of over 50 per cent in the number of people being affected by diabetes. So it is something that we must come to grips with and we must put greater resources towards. In fact, the number of people with type 2 diabetes has increased in Australia by over 300 per cent in the past 20 years, from 250,000 to one million. It is also reported that in Australia one in four now have type 2 diabetes or are at risk of developing it in the next five to 10 years. Those are serious and dangerous statistics, and we must encourage not only our colleagues in this place but people in the wider community to take greater notice, because, particularly with type 2 diabetes, it is so very difficult to detect. It is important that people be proactive and engage in an active lifestyle and discover the things that can be precursors to diabetes and take active steps to make sure that it does not affect them.",51
133,Ms JANN MCFARLANE,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I join with my colleagues to speak on the motion by the member for Pearce on diabetes to ensure that community awareness is raised and that the Howard government puts time, effort and resources into strong education programs. As has been pointed out today, there is an alarming rise in the number of people with type 2 diabetes, which is estimated to be one million people with half of these people currently undiagnosed. With half a million undiagnosed diabetics in Australia, the need for strong education programs is critical. That old saying ‘a ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure' certainly applies to diabetes. Prevention has three important aspects: first, people's lives are improved if they lead a healthier lifestyle and minimise the risk of developing diabetes; second, early detection means later onset of complications; and, third, the cost of the health bill for diabetes, currently running at $1.2 billion a year, is minimised. People are not greatly aware that their GP can arrange a simple blood test which can show if they are diabetic. People are also not greatly aware that early diagnosis and treatment for diabetes lessens the incidence of complications. Complications from diabetes range from eye problems, blindness, kidney failure and loss of limbs to heart attacks and/or strokes. These complications lead to people having to restrict their lives, and this often takes them out of the work force and onto a much lower income. I first became aware of the impact of diabetes when I had friends and family members develop the condition. I was not then aware of the prevention strategies that are available to people, their families and local communities. I became aware of the prevalence of diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes, when I worked as a health education officer for three years. In this job, I was fortunate in being able to work with a team of health professionals to provide health checks at community events. These health checks resulted in many people being referred to their GP for the blood test to check if they were diabetic. We got positive feedback from many of these people that they had been diagnosed as diabetic and that, with early treatment and practical lifestyle changes, they would be able to cope with the diabetes. These people expressed gratitude for the publicly funded health checks, as they would not ordinarily have thought of themselves as being at risk of diabetes or thought of asking their GP for a blood test. Since then I have had continuing experiences of friends, family members and work colleagues being diagnosed with diabetes. Often the diagnosis comes through contact with a publicly funded health information stall. Their life and lifestyle have been enhanced through this contact with a public awareness campaign strategy. I was pleased earlier this year to become a member of the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group, and I commend my colleagues, particularly the member for Pearce, the member for Moore and the member for Lyons. I was pleased to attend the inaugural dinner and hear Professor Paul Zimmet speak on diabetes surpassing AIDS as the greatest public health challenge of the 21st century. His speech was thought provoking but practical. Brian Conway of Diabetes Australia also spoke on the work of his organisation in funding research, promoting awareness of diabetes and raising community awareness of early detection leading to enhanced lifestyle choices. I had an experience recently of publicly-funded prevention strategies in my electorate of Stirling at the open day at the Osbourne Park Hospital. I was pleased to see that amongst the information stalls there was a display about diabetes. Interestingly, the information being provided was of a high standard, and I was pleased to see many people expressing an intention to visit their GP for the blood test. I take this opportunity of commending the research organisations and scientists looking into the cause of diabetes, as well as improved treatments and possible cures. I support the scientists and medical researchers who have called on the government and the National Health and Medical Research Council to increase the length of grants. My sympathies lie greatly with research organisations and researchers relying on one-year grants and the limits that such short-term grants place on their research efforts. I join my colleagues in urging the government to continue programs to raise public awareness of the high risk of undiagnosed and untreated cases of type 2 diabetes; ensure access to appropriate screening; support access to new medications for the treatment of type 2 diabetes while ensuring that Australian taxpayers get value for money through appropriate pricing arrangements; continue to encourage people diagnosed with diabetes to undergo regular medical testing, including eye testing, so as to prevent complications; ensure adequate funding for further research into prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes; and develop a strong program encouraging appropriate diet and exercise regimes to minimise the risk of type 2 diabetes.

134,Dr SOUTHCOTT,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I rise to support the motion by the member for Pearce on diabetes. I commend my parliamentary colleagues the member for Pearce, the member for Lyons and the member for Blair for their leadership of the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group, and the member for Pearce for introducing this motion to the parliament and putting it on the Notice Paper. I too wish to speak on this serious and increasing health issue. In 2000-01, the total number of people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes registered with the National Diabetic Services Scheme in Australia was just over 493,000, representing an increase of 10.75 per cent on the previous year. It is estimated that that figure will double to about one million when you take into account those who are not registered with the services scheme or who are undiagnosed. The International Diabetes Institute has estimated that by 2010 there will be 1.23 million people in Australia with diabetes. Professor Paul Zimmet from the IDIwhom we were privileged to hear speak at a dinner on 26 September 2002 on the release of the final report of the Australian diabetes, obesity and lifestyle study, known as AusDiab-reported that the number of people with type 2 diabetes had increased by over 300 per cent in the past 20 years, from 250,000 to one million. The study also reported that one in four Australians now have type 2 diabetes or are at risk of developing it over the next five to 10 years. The implications of this for health are enormous. It means that we can expect to see continuing increases in life span but also increased morbidity associated with that. At the presentation, Professor Zimmet also spoke of the incidence of type 2 diabetes in children under 10. This is something that has never been seen before. We do not know what the long-term, 20-, 30or 40-year consequence of this will be. Indigenous Australians have one of the highest prevalences of type 2 diabetes in the world. In 1995, selfreported diabetes was seven to eight times higher among Indigenous Australians than among other Australians aged 25 to 55 years. I also should mention the commitment of the previous Minister for Health and Aged Care, Dr Michael Wooldridge, in making diabetes one of our national health priorities in 1996 in recognition of the increasing incidence of it, its seriousness and its cost to the community. He also established the National Diabetes Strategy, which began in 1998. There have been a number of associated programs as part of this, including, in July 2001, $25 million in research funding through the NHMRC in partnership with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and also, in March 2002, a further partnership with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation for $10 million over three years, which was announced to establish the world's first autoimmune vaccine centre to develop a vaccine for type 1 diabetes. The motion also talks about the DiabCost Australia study. One of the key findings of that study was that, as the complications of diabetes increase, the costs escalate. This lends weight to the need for a continued focus on policies and programs that aim to minimise the development of complications amongst people with type 2 diabetes, especially as we are now seeing diabetes occurring much earlier than it ever did before and people will be having it for much longer. There is some evidence that good control of blood sugar does decrease the risk of microvascular complications-that is, renal complications, retinal complications and so on. In terms of the cost, the burden of diagnosed type 2 diabetes is estimated at $3 billion a year, with the average cost per person at $5,360, plus $5,540 in benefits, totalling $10,900. He is not known for his comments on health, but I recall a comment by former Speaker of the US House of Representatives Newt Gingrich where he said if we actually do things much better on diabetes we can save over a billion dollars a year. It is the same in Australia: a little spent now will save a lot in the future by avoiding the complications of diabetes. Things like the National Diabetes Strategy should lead to this. (Time expired)",53
135,Ms ELLIS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I want to start my remarks by commending the member for Pearce for being part of the inspiration for the formulation of the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group, of which I am a member. I also want to thank her for her motion on the Notice Paper today coinciding, as has already been said, with the world recognition of diabetes this week. Unlike many other members of the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group, I am not a sufferer of diabetes, but I feel very strongly about the issue, the impact that it is having on our community and the need for people in this place to take every opportunity that they can to emphasise the need for continuing vigilance and growth in funds in the area. I acknowledge the steps that the government has taken so far, as outlined in the motion, in recognising the seriousness of this diabetes epidemic-and that is what it is-by making diabetes a national health priority back in 1996 and by continuing to take steps to attend to it. There is absolutely no doubt that diabetes is a major cause of disability and premature death. It is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. It is the most common cause of kidney failure, the most common cause of blindness under the age of 60, the most common non-traumatic cause of limb amputation and one of the most common chronic diseases in children and adolescents. Sadly, it also has an incredibly disproportionate impact on Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander and Pacific Islander communities in this country. I would like to make quick reference to the Department of Family and Community Affairs report that was tabled in the year 2000-which I had the pleasure of contributing to-which looked at the state of Indigenous health in this country. What became incredibly clear to us in that work, over the months leading to the tabling of the report, was the absolute trauma that is disproportionately experienced in those communiexactly ties by the sufferers of diabetes. It is true, as the motion says, that some $3 billion per year is currently being expended on type 2 diabetes. I know that we do not have bottomless pits of money, no matter who is in government. I have to say-not in a negative but in an encouraging way-that I hope, through motions such as this, that the parliamentary group can put pressure on governments, no matter who may be in power at the time, to consider as carefully as they can the suggestions of the member for Boothby a moment ago that we provide as much funding as we can at the earliest possible opportunity so that we can alleviate not just the cost impact in future but also the economic impact. Podiatry services are another area that need to be talked about. Education programs are important to help people understand the disease if and when they become sufferers, but once it has been diagnosed there are a range of services that are essential, and podiatry is one of them. In fact, people with diabetes are 15 times more likely to have a leg amputated. I understand that some 2,600 amputations a year are performed on diabetics. Podiatry services simply must be available to people as needed to try to alleviate those pressures. The simple blood test that my colleague on this side mentioned a moment ago, performed by a GP, is a very good thing. A gentleman in my electorate recently went to his GP for that simple blood test and, as a result of that, on his GP's recommendation, sought specialist advice. He got a slightly contradictory blood test as a result of that referral. I stand to be corrected on this, but I understand that there is a limit to the number of blood tests you can have per year before you have to pay for them yourself. This is the question that this gentleman is facing. If that is in fact the case, maybe that is an area we should look at to see whether we can alleviate any pressure on individuals. There is no doubt at all that the growth in type 2 diabetes is very serious for this nation. There is no doubt also that the increasing level of diabetes in our young people-in our children-is far from acceptable. The reports and commentary in recent times on obesity in young people, and in children specifically, hopefully will raise the broader question of the incidence of diabetes and whether or not it is related to that particular point. If it is, need to analyse and promote the education process as much as we possibly can to alleviate diabetes in that age group. (Time expired) The DEPUTY SPEAKER Hawker)-Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Middle East: Israeli-Palestinian Conflict",54
136,Mrs IRWIN,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I move: That this House: (1) notes the continued occupation by the State of Israel of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in contravention of United Nations Resolution 242 passed on 22 November 1967; (2) supports the right of Israel to exist within secure borders; (3) calls on the United Nations to insert a peace keeping force into the occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza and the unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces; (4) calls for the recognition of the State of Palestine based on the pre 1967 borders of the West Bank and Gaza; and (5) calls on the international community to encourage and support the resolution of outstanding differences between the State of Israel and the State of Palestine based on the Oslo and Camp David Agreements. Debating a motion on Middle East peace is a rare event in this parliament, but I cannot say I am grateful for the mere 30 minutes allowed, or just five minutes each for the six speakers. Whether that is through lack of interest or lack of courage on the part of some members of this House, either way it reflects poorly on our concern for world affairs. The first part of the motion notes the continued occupation by the state of Israel of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in contravention of United Nations resolution 242 passed in November 1967. In this short debate, I want to stress what is the most important aspect of this question-and that is, as resolution 242 puts it, ‘the inadmissibility of the we acquisition of territory by war'. That is the foundation of the security of all nations and must remain the basis of any settlement in the Middle East. The second part of the motion supports (Mr the right of Israel to exist within secure borders. I note that recognition of Israel and its security was accepted at the recent Beirut Arab Summit and has been acknowledged since 1988 by the Palestinian leadership. The third part calls on the United Nations to insert a peacekeeping force into the occupied territories and for the unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces. By now the international community must realise that the peace process begun with the Madrid conference and progressed through the Oslo accords is in tatters. What should be clear is that no Palestinian leader could have accepted the deal offered at Camp David. Given the current political climate in Israel, no Israeli leader will allow the creation of a truly pendent state of Palestine with continuous and secure international borders. That path to peace has come to a dead end. In the meantime, we see almost daily the senseless acts of terrorism against Israeli citizens, and Israeli oppression as. Last month the US Assistant Secretary of State, William Burns, proposed a road map to peace and a Palestinian state by 2005, which called for a phased withdrawal of Israeli forces and an enhanced international role in monitoring the transition. Since the end of the Cold War, the international community has been less restrained in dealing with conflicts around the world. We have seen successful NATO intervention in Bosnia and Kosovo. Closer to home we have seenand indeed led-United Nations intervention in East Timor. When the world community looks at the ongoing tragedy in the Middle East, is it too much to ask that the United Nations take a leading role in bringing peace to that troubled region? After creation of the United Nations. It came into being at the second session of the General Assembly under resolution 181 in 1947. The deployment of UN troops in the occupied territories was supported by the Palestinian Authority at the Sharm el Sheikh summit, and has more recently been central to peace proposals by Arab countries. A settlement based on resolution 242 and a circuit-breaker to cause both sides to stand back and build genuine peace is what is required. That is what UN intervention can provide. It can give the Palestinian people a chance to build a viable state, a chance to build their own nation and a chance to develop a culture of peace. It can give both nations the opportunity and the time to resolve the difficult issues, such as the future of Jerusalem, settlements, the right to return for refugees and the compensation for those displaced. It can give the people of Israel the only long-term promise of relief from a threat of terrorism, and it may at last bring peace to that troubled land. In conclusion, I should mention that this motion has had its own interesting history. I would like to thank the many people, including members of both the Jewish and the indePalestinian communities, who have offered me support with this motion. I can now see why this issue is so rarely debated in this parliament. I congratulate members of this House for their support, including the members for Watson, Prospect, Grayndler, Sydof Palestini- ney and Calwell.",55

157,Mr DANBY,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I thank the member for Grayndler for giving me his place to speak on this motion on the Middle East, and I will stick strictly the substance of the issues before us. When I stood at Mr Rabin's grave, as I did earlier this year, I lamented these last two wasted years. These years have ruined the future of the two peoples in that part of the world. The violence that has taken place over the last two years has delivered nothing. Like the Israeli writer Amos Oz, like the revisionist historian Benny Morris-indeed, like the vast majority of the people in the Centre Left and in the centre of Israeli politics-I lament the total failure of the two parties to reach resolution as outlined under the Oslo accords. The views of Amos Oz, Benny Morris and all of the people who seriously evaluate these issues are that the blame has to be put fairly and squarely on the Palestinian Authority and on Yasser Arafat. I supported the Barak-Clinton plan, which would have conceded 97 per cent of the territories to a Palestinian state. I supported the return of some refugees. I supported, and I still support, the dismantling of some settlements and even the division of Jerusalem, if it means peace. These very tough decisions offered to Barak and Clinton would have implemented UN resolution 242 had they been agreed by Arafat and the Palestinians. This, in effect, is what our motion today does not quite comprehend. Resolution 242 of 1967 does not instruct Israel to withdraw unilaterally from the territories occupied in 1967. As the Economist, referring to the resolution, said: It does not condemn Israel's conquest, for the good reason that most Western powers at that time thought it the result of a justifiable preemptive war. It calls for a negotiated settlement, based on the principle of exchanging land for peace. This is a very different matter. Unlike the member for Fowler, I am not ready to give up on the possibility that a negotiated settlement might come out of this proposal by Barak and Clinton, which was so close and yet so far. I lament the fact that the Palestinian Authority has spread completely false stories about the fact that Camp David involved cantons et cetera. As top US peace negotiator Dennis Ross-whom I personally have met and talked to about this-has said, to all of these areas in the disputed territory were to be contiguous and would have led to a Palestinian state. What a missed opportunity. I have real concerns with paragraph (3) of the motion regarding a UN force, and these concerns would occur to anyone familiar with the history of the Middle East. We remember what the United Nations did in 1967 when it unilaterally withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula, precipitating the 1967 war. This resolution does not mention the phenomenon of homicide bombing. Perhaps if we had had the opportunity to negotiate, as we had at the ALP conference, then all of these things might have been taken into consideration. This is a matter that, particularly after the events in Bali, is of interest not just to me to all Australians. A person from my electorate, Malki Roth, a 15-year-old flautist, was murdered in a Palestinian homicide attack at a Jerusalem pizza shop. She was looking forward to a future that involved looking after disabled children. What kind of Palestinian program leads to the murder of people like Malki? These murders were not done by groups such as Hamas or Hezbollah; they were done by groups associated with Mr Arafat. Today, for example, there was the terrible murder of two children at Kibbutz Menara, within the green line, by the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, the people very close to Arafat. Amongst the Palestinian movement we have recently had Hanan Ashrawi, the Communique of 20, and Nabil Amr-the editor of the Palestinian intellectual publication al-Hayat al-Jadidasay that they missed an opportunity two years ago, and it is a terrible shame that we cannot get back to that. These kinds of resolutions will only come through negotiations between the parties, both here in Australia and over there. (Time expired)",58
158,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"As the member for Sturt said, the reason we are debating this motion on the Middle East today is that the Labor Party is changing its position on Israel. We have the extraordinary situation where the member for Fowler will move a motion, bleat to every journalist about how she wants a debate and then, after she has spoken, seek to gag every speaker on the other side. Those who sponsor this motion do so not because they have balanced views but because they are public critics of Israel and always have been. You only need a cursory glance at the detail of the motion. It falsely portrays UN resolution 242 with respect to the post-1967 borders as a one-way street when it is nothing of the sort. It makes a number of other demands on Israel which have been written as if Israel's enemies-including the terrorists and some of the enemies mentioned by the member for Melbourne Ports-are pledging total peace if the substance of this dreamy motion were ever to be agreed to. As a bit of insurance-a bit of cowardly cover-it disingenuously states its support but for Israel's continued existence while at the same time turning a blind eye to all the forces that threaten that very existence. You only have to look at what is not in the motion. While there is mention of borders, there is no mention of the extremists who have said that they do not care what borders are constructed. There is no mention of the extremists who say that the only map of the Middle East they want is one without Israel on it. There is no mention of the terrorists perpetrating the homicide bombings. These are some of the things the motion fails to mention. How you could have a motion on Israel and the Middle East with five points to it that does not even mention suicide bombers is totally beyond me. The motion makes demands on Israel but no demands on the PLO. It makes no demands on Yasser Arafat to actually accept a peace offer, such as the Barak offer, which would have given the PLO 95-plus per cent plus of what they were asking for. There is no demand on Yasser Arafat to actually come to the party on a peace agreement; rather, he finds every excuse under the sun to derail it. There is no demand that Yasser Arafat take greater steps to stop or curtail the suicide bombers. As the member for Sturt has outlined, this motion is only being debated here because the extreme Left-who have always opposed Israel-have been joined by an unprincipled Labor Right from New South Wales, who have sold out their support for Israel, while the Leader of the Opposition has sat back, watched and done nothing.",59

Thanks to him, we now have an anti-Israel unity ticket of leftwing extremism and Labor Right expediency, where the balance and strength of Hawke Labor on the question of Israel has been completely replaced by the weakness and policy immorality of Crean Labor. We now have a dangerous cocktail of policy madness from the Left and policy immorality from the New South Wales Labor Right. On this side of the House, we are not prepared sit back any longer and watch the Leader of the Opposition walk on both sides of the street: he walks on one side of the street in Melbourne, and then he is mute in Sydney, where both the Left and the Right are pursuing a biased agenda against Israel.

The member for Sydney described Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon as a war criminal and described Israel as a rogue state. Leader of the Opposition has met this statement with nothing but pathetic silence since 17 September. We say that, while the Leader of the Opposition is silent on the outrageous and mad left-wing statements from the member for Sydney, he supports her. As long as he says nothing, he supports her. On this side of the House, we say that this motion speaks volumes about Labor's unprincipled approach to Israel and volumes about the Leader of the Opposition and the rabble that he now leads.

163,Ms PLIBERSEK,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Sydney) (4.29 p.m.)Even by the low standards of the member for Sturt, his recent performance was disgraceful. Instead of addressing the tragedy of the Middle East conflict, he wanted to score to cheap political points. I am a bit more interested in what is happening in the Middle East than in hearing him spout off about the internal workings of the Labor Partysomething he knows absolutely nothing about. The ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine is a tragedy that has been with us for longer than my lifetime. Occasionally it has seemed that there was a danger of peace breaking out; at those times extremists on one side or the other have ensured that that did not happen. The rest of the world looks The on with despair, wondering how many more lives must be lost before some lasting peace is found. According to Amnesty International, between 29 September 2000 and August 2002 some 1,700 Palestinians were killed, including more than 250 children, and more than 580 Israelis were killed, including 72 children. Let me start by saying that I accept the right of Israel to exist behind secure, internationally defined borders. I ask the people who are criticising this motion: do you support the right of a secure, independent Palestine to exist; or do you, like potential new with Likud leader and former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the majority of the 2,600 member Likud central council, swear that there will never be a Palestinian state west of the river Jordan? I deplore the violence of suicide bombers who target civilians indiscriminately, yet I also deplore the violence of Israeli army security forces who, on the instructions of the current government, use collective punishment, targeting the whole of the Palestinian population for the crimes of extremists. Some of the collective punishments I am talking about include curfews which prevent ambulances from attending the injured and prevent Palestinians from going to work or school; the economic blockade; the tanks used to bulldoze homes with people still inside; the destruction of roads and orchards, as well as other sources of food, so that malnutrition is increasing. Between 36 per cent and 50 per cent of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza are now unemployed, resulting in severe financial hardship, with 70 per cent of people in these areas living on less than $2 a day. Thirty new settlements have been built in the last year alone, but not a single hospital has been built in the occupied territories in 35 years. There are Jewish Israeli citizens who face their fellow citizens every day in Israel and say more radical, more controversial things than we are saying in this motion today. Members of this parliament who have looked at the Bet'selem site on the Internet or read some of the writers in Haer'etz will know what I am talking about. These are the voices that will show their fellow Israeli citizens path to peace. They are people like Yehouda Shenhav from Tel Aviv University, who says, ‘Don't say you didn't know that Israeli soldiers shoot civilians and children and bulldoze houses.' They are people like Gordon Levy, a Haer'etz journalist who, when the Israeli Supreme Court failed to rule on the legality of extra-judicial murders by the Israeli security forces, said, ‘I wish patriotic Israelis like me didn't need to say to the world: come and judge the perpetrators of war crimes.' This journalist took his case to the international community. They are people like Adi Ophir, Professor of Philosophy at Tel Aviv University, who says that the current conflict is designed to perpetuate the occupation and that settlement building and the ‘liquidations', as they are called, are war crimes. They are people like another writer who says that six million Israelis and three million Palestinians are being held hostage by 200,000 settlers, a few hundred of whom are extremists. Civilian Israelis are paying a very high price financially for the continued building of settlements on Palestinian land. We have seen that in the budget crisis that faces Israel at the moment. But what of the cost of lives on both sides of this debate? Another speaker against the Israeli army's activities is Noa Levy, a high school student, who says that it is her moral duty and the moral duty of all Israelis to refuse to cooperate with the occupation in every way. She has urged students who are almost of draft age to sign the 12th grader's letter of refusal to serve in the occupied territories during their military service. All of these people spoke in a documentary called It is No Dream, shown on SBS last month. The documentary showed 10,000 people who rallied in support of Israeli defence force soldiers who signed a letter stating that they refused to serve in the occupied territories. Do these people hate Israel? Certainly not. They are soldiers, writers, school students, artists, patriots and humanitarians who hate the idea that Israel will be at war with its Arab neighbours forever. They are seeking some way of establishing a lasting peace, recognising that it cannot occur while military repression is the only language the two the sides communicate in. Surely a motion like this, supporting those in Israel and Palestine who are working for peace along paths already laid down by the international community, is something that we as a parliament can also support.

164,Ms JULIE BISHOP,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I rise to speak against this motion on the Middle East. My opposition is based on the internal contradictions of the motion. Those contradictions betray the insincerity of, and the pretence behind, this motion. I direct the attention of the House to point (2): ‘that this House supports the right of Israel to exist within secure borders'. This is contradicted by the distorted representation of United Nations resolution 242 referred to in point (1) and compounded by the misrepresentation in points (3) and (4). This distortion of resolution 242 was also a malevolent characteristic of the earlier parliamentary debate on possible military action against Iraq. It has become the panacea for not only the Palestinian authority but the Labor Left as well. In that debate, a number of members opposite, including particularly the member for Sydney, sought to confect an equivalence between the democratic state of Israel and the regime of Saddam Hussein, by suggesting that Israel was, like the regime in Baghdad, in contravention of Security Council resolutions. Let us examine the background and the text of resolution 242. Specifically, resolution 242 does not call for Israel to immediately and unconditionally return to its pre1967 borders. The resolution actually calls for the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, which should include the application of both the following principles: withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict-that was the Six-Day War of 1967; termination of all claims or states of belligerence; and respect for, and acknowledgment of, the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every state in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognised boundaries, free from threats or acts of force. This is a call for gotiation on the part of Israel-not for unilateral action. In no sense does resolution 242 impose pre-1967 borders on Israel. The architects of the resolution recognised that those borders were merely armistice lines following the repulsed invasion of Israel in 1948 and were unsustainable given the geography of the region. Since 1974 and the passage of UN resolution 338 following the Yom Kippur war, Israel has negotiated with the Arab states in question and withdrawn from territory in line with those negotiations. In return, the expectation is that rael's enemies from 1967 and 1973 will cease pursuing their goal of the destruction of the state of Israel. It is to the credit of Arab leaders in states like Egypt and Jordan that these negotiations have proceeded to peace settlements. By contrast, the Palestinian leadership has failed to negotiate with the same good faith. In 1993 Yasser Arafat had the opportunity to end this conflict for good and to reach an accommodation in the interests of Israelis and Palestinians. The then Israeli Prime Minister Barak offered that solution. It was rejected by Arafat, to the disappointment of the international community.",61

179,Mr KERR,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I rise in the grievance debate to continue the remarks I made in the adjournment debate on 23 October 2002 in which I raised serious allegations against the Office of the Ombudsman and accused the Ombudsman of improperly investigating a serious complaint against the Australian Federal Police. In July 1993 a warrant was created and signed by Mr Grahame Wheeler in his capacity as a justice of the peace. In 1994 the Internal Security and Audit Division of the Australian Federal Police began an internal investigation into then AFP officer John Cushion. During that investigation, Mr Wheeler became suspected of some wrongdoing. The AFP wrote to the New South Wales Police alleging that Mr Wheeler had an ‘improper relationship' with John Cushion. It was not until 1995 that Mr Wheeler was finally charged by the AFP with wrongdoing: he was accused of having fraudulently backdated a warrant document. The investigation into Mr Wheeler, which was codenamed Operation Graft, was headed by Mr John Lawler. Lawler was then a sergeant within Op- the Internal Investigations Division of the AFP. He has since been promoted and is General Manager of Eastern Operations within the AFP. In the trial of John Cushion, with whom Mr Wheeler was alleged to have conspired, Mr Justice Pratt commented on the kinds of questions that had been put to the accused. He said: These are not the sort of questions we can have from police officers to suspects … They are not in a position to start putting propositions like that: would you have prepared, would you have remembered, what a lot of rot. We can't have them doing this sort of thing, what do they think they are. Mr Cushion was acquitted. It is now clear that when Mr Wheeler was questioned in respect of the suspicions the investigating officers had, they had a belief in his involvement yet, despite this, they failed to caution him. Mr Wheeler asserts that the questioning he was subjected to was similar in its approach to that criticised by Mr Justice Pratt in the Cushion trial. The prosecution against Mr Wheeler was abandoned after he had been committed for trial. In 1997 Mr Wheeler began his complaints to the Office of the Ombudsman. He complained that he should have been cautioned before being charged, that he was set up, that the investigation had been improperly handled and that the AFP were aware of a witness who could verify his claims but had not interviewed that witness. Some time during 1997 the internal AFP report into Mr Wheeler's complaints was forwarded to the Office of the Ombudsman for review. The Ombudsman accepted the AFP report as disposing of the issues raised by Mr Wheeler and concluded that no further investigation had to be undertaken. In 1998 John Taylor, the then head of the Ombudsman's law enforcement team, wrote to Mr Wheeler to explain the reasons for that decision. Mr Taylor is a former New South Wales public prosecutor. He maintained close social links with senior AFP staff, including those from Internal Investigations, whose work he was tasked to review. He is now Senior Assistant Ombudsman in another area of responsibility. Mr Taylor's 1998 letter reminded Mr Wheeler that he had been acquitted of charges against him. This was incorrect and misleading. Wheeler had been committed for trial but the prosecution had not proceeded with the charges. Mr Taylor's letter stated that Mr Wheeler should have raised his concerns in court. Plainly this was absurd because the prosecution had been abandoned prior to trial. For these manifestly unsatisfactory reasons the Ombudsman had decided not to investigate Mr Wheeler's complaints. Others might have given up in frustration at this point, but Mr Wheeler did not. Between 1998 and 2001, Wheeler asked several times for the Ombudsman to review the internal investigation. In June 2000 he signed a 13-page statement detailing serious allegations against members of the Australian Federal Police. His allegations were supported by what appears to be extensive documentary evidence. This material was given to Agent Murray Cottam, the Internal Investigations officer tasked with the investigation, but nothing, to Mr Wheeler's knowledge, occurred as a result of these complaints. Finally, in October 2001 the Ombudsman agreed to take up the matter. In July 2002, after a prolonged investigation, Mr Wheeler received a bland two-page response informing him of the result of the investigation into his allegations. The report admitted that there had been failures in both the AFP's and the Ombudsman's office's handling of the complaints but it failed to deal with the real substance- Mr Wheeler's assertion that the Lawler investigation into his alleged misconduct had been carried out in a grossly improper way. Mr Wheeler is aware, because of questions put to him by staff of the Ombudsman, that those issues of substance were supposed to be examined. He thinks that there has been a cover-up. He believes the Ombudsman's office colluded to prevent the investigation of those complaints. Remarkably, he is right. The evidence of this impropriety is both direct and circumstantial. The most damning document was obtained recently by Mr Wheeler as a result of an FOI request. Prior FOI requests had been fobbed off. Only after I spoke in this House on this matter some weeks ago were key documents provided. One of them is quite damning. It is a memo from Catherine MCPherson, Senior Assistant Ombudsman, to Allyson Essex, the staff member of the Ombudsman's office who was the head of the investigation. Ms MCPherson was asking for an update on the investigation. On the memo there is a note that I infer to be in Ms Essex's handwriting, stating inter alia: Meeting with CPMMCPherson, I inferpm 10/12/01. CPM advised F/AFederal AgentLawler extremely busy and important man. Therefore PRManother investigator, I assumeand I were to (1) i/v for no longer than 1½ -2 hours (2) not accuse him of any wrongdoing. While an instruction from a senior officer to an officer investigating alleged police misconduct to limit the length of time of the terview with a busy and important AFP officer might be understandable if unwise, the instruction not to put adverse matters to the subject of an investigation is a direct corrupthere tion of the integrity regime. The impropriety of this action stands out when objective reasons to doubt the truthfulness of at least one of the two AFP members who were involved in the Cushion-Wheeler investigation exists. For example, at Cushion's trial former Federal Agent O'Toole denied making any allegations about Cushion or Wheeler to Lawler, while Federal Agent Lawler stated under oath that O'Toole had been the source of his information. MCPherson's instructions meant that the Ombudsman's officers could not put key issues of this kind to Mr Lawler. No proper investigation of Mr Wheeler's complaints could have been possible when a preconceived decision to not accuse Mr Lawler of any wrongdoing had been made higher up in the Office of the Ombudsman. The bland report that was ultimately produced by the Ombudsman's office suggests that the investigating staff within that office had either accepted that they were not to make any recommendations about individuals-and did not make any findings about individuals and did not criticise the AFP-or that the report was later edited to delete such comments. Only an independent inquiry could ascertain which of those two possibilities is true. This issue goes beyond what is a particular instance to a culture which is obviously unsatisfactory. Senior police staff who have headed the police integrity section of the Ombudsman's office, including Mr John  have maintained close personal links with serving and former AFP staff and with their counterparts in Internal Investigations. Perceptions of a conflict of interest naturally arise. The morale of the police integrity tion within the Ombudsman's office appears to be shot to pieces. The police team has undergone something approaching a 90 per cent turnover of staff in each of the past two years. A survey conducted among staff of the Canberra Office of the Ombudsman in 2002 revealed that two-thirds felt that the policies in- in the workplace were neither clear-cut nor non-contradictory. A majority of those surveyed felt that the penalties for failure were greater than the rewards for success, and that was not consistency between the professed philosophy of the organisation and the behaviour of its leaders. A disturbing number of staff felt that honesty and openness were not valued. This is crucial because the Ombudsman's office is the final port of call for anyone with a complaint about misconduct within the AFP. Soon it will be the final port of call and the integrity watchdog for those with complaints against the successor to the National Crime Authority, the Australian Crime Commission. Without confidence in its utmost probity, the citizen is entitled to sneer at any assurance that this is an adequate protection against overreach by law enforcement agencies. I have learned to respect the professionalism and dedication of the AFP. I think highly of its senior officers and of its reputation. But I know that every organisation will make mistakes and that most will be innocent. I know that every organisation will include some who are corrupt. I know that every organisation will become weakened if the integrity regime is not applied equally to high and low alike. If investigations of alleged misconduct of ‘busy and important' AFP staff can be perverted from within the Office of the Ombudsman, then the process does not deserve our respect. It must be cleaned up. The minimum requirement is that this parliament insist on an examination of why things are going so wrong within the Ombudsman's office. This is not just a matter of justice for Mr Wheeler; it is also a matter of fairness for agents such as Federal Agent Lawler and his fellow investigators. They may have done nothing wrong, but the circumstances and the way in which this appears to have been investigated lead to a sec- sense of gross unfairness. This parliament cannot allow that kind of instance to go unnoticed. (Time expired) Information Technology",63
180,Mr CHARLES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"La Trobe) (4.52 p.m.)The recent Estens report indicates good progress by Telstra in improving the infrastructure for telephony and data services in the bush. These improvements are welcome but are just the first step down the road of enabling Australians, wherever they live, to truly begin conducting business via the efficiencies offered by the Internet. No-one disputes the importance of telephony services for access to information. However, the jury is still out on how important the Internet actually is for business, especially smaller businesses. We all know that email is a fantastic tool for business, but most businesses are still struggling to make a case for having a presence on the Internet. For the majority, what is to be gained by having a web site? Who but large corporations can afford the constant maintenance costs, the high level of technical skills and the budgets to market their properties to potential customers? For most business, the Internet is proving to be an expensive burden, with real commercial benefits out of reach except for an elite few. Recent indicators are ominous. A survey of CEOs by Dun and Bradstreet show a softening of attitude by CEOs to the Internet as an important tool for business; ABS reports indicate a softening of growth by business in the use of the Internet; and Melbourne IT, the registrar of the .com.au domain names, indicates that 13 per cent of Australian companies are not bothering to renew their domain names. No-one disputes that the Internet is a fic delivery medium for information, but there are three areas of the Internet that are problem for small business: one is the control of a business web presence, the second is the cost and the third is being found. With regard to control, once a small business has gone to the trouble of having a web site built for them, they can then face the trouble, frustration and inconvenience of having it updated. By the time it is built, the information is out of date and needs to be updated. By the time it is updated, it needs to be updated again. It is like a continuing treadmill for the business. Members who are familiar with these problems are probably aware of a golden rule of web site building for small business: never include a date, personnel names or prices, because they all change and it costs money to have a web builder alter them. Of course, not having dates, personnel or prices somewhat defeats the purpose of having a web site in the first place. With regard to cost, a reasonably basic web site costs a couple of thousand dollars, plus the constant cost of updating-a significant cost for small business. Being found is a much larger problem. Search engines deliver so much information that, unless a user is extremely sophisticated or already knows the name of the company they want, they are unlikely to find what they want. The chance of finding something local without knowing a business name is almost non-existent. Yellow Pages and CitySearch online directories go some way to making the Internet work better for business, because a user can search online by categories of business using a locality name or post code. This process works well for local consumer searches but does not cater well for business to business searches, which typically are over larger areas and require much more sophisticated searches. For the last three years, I have encouraged a company in my electorate that has been addressing the shortcomings of the Internet for business. I was impressed when I first reviewed their system three years ago, and now I am excited. Super Internet Site System has developed a comprehensive online directory system that appears to me to form the terrifoundation for business on the Internet. SISS21, as the system is called, allows any a business to enter SISS21, register and then build a SISS21 web site on the system. The importance of this web site is that it can be built by any non-technical person. Even I, with my rusty computer skills, can build a site that I would not be ashamed of. Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, even the member for Franklin would not have trouble building a site on this system. More importantly, he would not have any trouble going back into the system to edit it, because it is so easy to operate. A web site on the system costs the business $400 per year-not several thousand dollars-and the business can build and edit to its heart's content for no extra cost other than company in-house labour. That is two problems solved. Now let us look at how SISS tackles the discovery, or being found, problem. SISS21 automatically locates each business on the SISS21 mapping system. This allows SISS21 to accurately search and find the web site. This means that any Internet user can specify their location and search within any distance they specify for any product, service or business they need. As a former building contractor, let me give you a building industry example. If a builder is costing a development in, say, Albury, he can call up the exact address of the site on SISS21 and then set search parameters. So, if he is looking for the best price for concrete, he can search within, say, 25 kilometres for concrete batching plants. As concrete is perishable, he is only interested in local suppliers. When looking for tradesmen, he can search within, say, 100 kilometres of his building site. When looking for steel workshops to build the steel structure of the building, he can search for steel fabrication workshops within 500 kilometres, because the steelwork is so easily loaded on a truck and economically transported long distances. Then price and quality are the builder's main concerns. If that was all SISS21 provided then that would be exciting enough, but the system recognises the fact that the needs of business vary from industry to industry. For example, the needs of, say, the retail industry are a great deal different from the manufacturing, agriculture or mining industries. SISS21 caters for each industry and allows the industry to customise the search system for industry needs. So, if a shopper wants to buy a washing machine in her local area, she can search according to her needs for the appropriate retailer by entering the distance from her house that she is prepared to travel and the required details of what it is she wants. She can specify that she wants a Whirlpool, that she will pay for it with her Visa card and she wants immediate delivery and undercover parking. Only those retailers that match her specific requests will be in the results. SISS21 is an inclusive system, which means that various vendors are invited to become part of the system. I believe that industry organisations, information companies and especially local chambers of commerce that we all have in our electorates will extract enormous benefits for their business members by helping them to be discovered and to take control of their online presence. SISS21 also provides technology so that a business on the system can market to other businesses on the system according to the catchment required by the business itself. This is a very powerful tool, especially for small business. Another feature of the system is spatial delivery of banner as, which allows a business to specify the area it wants to market to and ignore the rest of the world. An important additional aspect of this system is that it includes an industry survey facility that allows businesses to be surveyed on their attitudes to all manner of issues. This feature on SISS21 is spatial, which means that those surveys can be conducted in a small area with great accuracy, a perfect tool for local and state Australian governments to understand the needs of industry in their area. I am clearly impressed by this technology. I am also impressed that it has the potential to become a dynamic export industry for Australia. Let us face it: the problems that Australian businesses are facing with the Internet are exactly the same as the problems that businesses all over the world are facing. This Australian innovation has a market of one million businesses in Australia and perhaps 100 million businesses globally. The global market for this Australian innovation has the potential to create a $40 billion global industry, with significant royalty payments to Australia. Fortunately, SISS has had the foresight to apply for and get international patent approval of its system. SISS21 was developed and refined for a demonstrated business need; it is not an IT that innovation looking for a commercial opportunity. The SISS team are now discussing leasing arrangements in Australia for their system and will have the production version operating in mid-December. When viewing this technology, it is not hard to see many other applications in engineering, asset management, defence, land use planning and environmental management. SISS21 has come from a small Australian company with dedicated shareholders that have set a goal and have gone after it. The team have had the wisdom to shun the hype of the .com boom, avoid institutional investors and avoid handouts from government. I am also impressed that the management and development team are not driving around in flash cars, taking huge directors fees or working in glamorous offices in Melbourne or Sydney at the expense of their shareholders. The SISS team work in old railway carriages in Emerald. As I remind them, Hewlett-Packard started life in a shed behind David Packard's house in Palo Alto in California, and they seem to have done all right. SISS21 is a web building system and a find engine, not a search engine. I am sure that every member of this House wishes this young Australian enterprise well. Remembrance Day",65
181,Mr QUICK,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Today, 11 November 2002, is 84 years after the signing of the armistice to end the First World War. At 11 a.m. today, we paused for a few minutes to remember the tens of thousands of Australians who have lost their lives in all conflicts in all parts of the world. youngster, I remember being taken by my father to the Shrine of Remembrance, a rather special place for him and for me, and being there at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month and seeing that small chink of light coming through the crack and shining on that plinth in that mausoleum that is the Shrine of Remembrance. My father said, ‘It only shines through that crack at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month.' It is somewhat ironic that, as we paused and remembered the futility of war and the untold suffering experienced by many over the past eight decades, our nation is girding itself for another war on foreign soil. One wonders: do we ever learn? The Flanders poppy proudly worn by members today to remember the slaughter on the Western Front all those years ago symbolises the fact that, despite the carnage, nature and its beauty will eventually return to reclaim the land in the fullness of time. As people know, I have a special affinity for the fields of the Western Front and the town of Fromelles in particular. In July 1996, almost 80 years to the day of the famous battle for Fromelles, I drove north from Paris to see where my father's battalion fought in the first of many battles that Australia fought on mainland Europe. In that battle on 19 July 1916, over 5,300 Australian soldiers, most from the Gallipoli campaign, were killed or wounded, including my father, who thankfully survived. On both sides of the highway, one could see small French villages nestled in the countryside and every so often signposts alerting the driver to battlefield cemeteries and memorials. Scattered throughout the French fields were thousands of Flanders poppies. Like many before me, I stopped, illegally entered the field and picked some in memory of my father and his mates. They are now pressed lovingly in my copy of the book Guide to Australian Battlefields of the Western Front. Why do I raise this issue in the grievance debate, a debate in which one usually gets only one chance to participate every year in this place? I do so because I want to highlight once again my strong opposition to war and to the fact that more and more people in As a Australia and throughout the rest of the world are now coming out to show their support for no war against Iraq. Those of us who have spent most of our lives in the 20th century have experienced either first-hand or through close family members the horrors of the many wars that blighted our world in that century. Many of us have been lucky enough to visit the battlefields in Europe, the Middle East and the Pacific Islands and have seen thousands of white crosses in nearby war cemeteries. Many of us have visited the concentration camps and glimpsed briefly man's inhumanity on a colossal scale. As we celebrated the start of the new millennium on 1 January 2001, there was a feeling throughout the world that perhaps the forthcoming century might be different from the 20th century-the Iron Curtain had fallen, the Cold War had ended and European countries were striving to establish a vibrant and peaceful European community. It is close to two years since we were all filled with this expectation of real peace in our lifetime. But, unfortunately, as 2002 draws to a close, our media outlets trumpet every day the fact that the world is on the brink of yet another war, a war against Iraq to remove Saddam Hussein. ‘Regime change' is the phrase now used to gloss over what could potentially be a war of catastrophic proportions. If a war does occur, I personally will lay the blame at the feet of the US administration led by President George W. Bush, B1, and the British administration led by Tony Blair, B2. Of course, they will say that their actions now have the legitimacy of the United Nations Security Council. After all, haven't they passed resolution 1441, agreed to by every country sitting around the table in New York? I have been in federal politics for just over 10 years. I have been to enough international conferences to know what communiques and resolutions are all about. This UN resolution, 1441, finally agreed to by the US after weeks of discussion, in my mind is regarded by the Bush administration as something to be tolerated while they have the opportunity to secure their armed forces in close proximity for a unilateral attack against Iraq. This Iraqi war, 2002 style, will be unlike any war this world has ever experienced. The US, with their technological advances and military weaponry, will attack a country far inferior in military terms. If you believe the propaganda put out by Bush and Blair and supported by our Prime Minister, Iraq has a massive arsenal of weapons of mass destruction. Doesn't the Blair dossier tell us so? As a child growing up in the forties and visited the movies on a Saturday afternoon and was entranced by the Movietone newsreels. I now look back and know just how propaganda works and how governments can use the media to manipulate the knowledge fed to its citizenry. I have been a teacher in disadvantaged schools for most of my life. One of the things I learnt very quickly was to come to terms with conflict resolution-the resolution of a conflict by sitting around the table, giving each participant the opportunity to have their say free from interruption and judgment, and giving everyone around the table that opportunity as an equal. Change comes through a form of words being agreed to by all participants, not through one form of words from someone dominating and threatening retribution if they do not get their own way. Over the last couple of weeks, we have seen massive anti-war demonstrations in other countries around the world, particularly in the United Kingdom and Italy. In both cases, over 400,000 people have marched in opposition to this war. As a politician who has been returned to office four times, I have learnt to consult my electorate, to feel the pulse of my electorate, to understand what people feel about a whole range of issues. Since I have been advocating an anti-war stance publicly and in this place, I have consulted my people rather widely and I would like to put a few of their comments on the public record. One of my constituents says: I am totally opposed to any attack on Iraq. I'm sure it would only inflame an already sensitive situation in the world. I think it rather strange that George W. is obsessed with weapons of mass destruction that Iraq is alleged to possess and does not seem to be particularly worried about other unstable and volatile countries that we know for sure have these weapons. I may be wrong but I think that George is more concerned with Iraq's oil reserves. I'm afraid that John Howard made a mistake by “jumping into bed” with the Americans. I feel it has greatly increased the risk of terrorism aimed at Australia, and any conflict with Iraq involving Australian troops will most certainly further increase the possibility of terrorist reprisals in Australia. fifties, I Another of my constituents says: Dear Harry Thank you for this opportunity to give you my views. That Saddam is a tyrant, dictator, and the rest, is something with which I have no problem, especially after being told by a six year old Kurdish boy whose parents had to escape from their country that “Saddam, no good!” I have to believe that. But to go to war with Iraq is another matterjust because they have weapons of mass destruction, so I understand. But then so have Israel, Pakistan, India, China and the USA, to name a few. I can hardly imagine USA going to war with Israel, for a start-and shouldn't it be a case of “do as you would be done by.” How about UN weapons inspectors looking at their weapons before the USA checks Iraq's! Another says: I believe Australia should not become involved with the war against Iraq ... (Time expired) Middle East: Israeli-Palestinian Conflict",68
182,Mr KING,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I rise today to address issues that have been conveyed to me by many of my constituents concerning the attitude of some in this House and the broader community toward the current relations between the state of Israel and the Palestinian people. All Australians have an interest in seeing peace prevail in the Middle East. We have a direct interest because so many Australians have families, loved ones and friends who live in that part of the world and who continue to suffer as a result of the conflict and, just as importantly, we have a tangible interest because as a nation we have staunchly sought to ensure that international disputes are resolved without bloodshed. In the words of Donne: No man is an island, entire of itself. Our common humanity means, therefore, that we are rightfully concerned to reduce the human suffering that this type of conflict inflicts so often on the innocent as well as on the combatants. Australia's role in the Middle East is obviously not as significant as that of nations like the United States, Russia, members of the European Union or those nations in the region itself. Nonetheless, as I said in my first speech in February, Australia has a role to play-doing nothing is not an option. We can and do play a role in seeking to maintain the momentum for peace. As a nation and a parliament, our actions are observed by the international community. We also set an example for those within our own community who, because of their heritage or beliefs, follow the current conflict with particular intensity. Today I want to make some remarks about that conflict because there is a deliberate attempt by some in the community, mainly of the radical Left, to create a public perception that will not help our understanding of the conflict or the steps necessary for its resolution, and that has the potential to encourage intolerance towards Israelis and, more broadly, people of the Jewish faith. In this respect, I want to touch on the language that we employ in participating in discussion and debate on the Middle East. We have a responsibility to conduct ourselves in a way that promotes a peaceful resolution, that promotes the truth and that guides our foreign policy goals based on a sound understanding of the challenges facing Israel and the Palestinian people. When so many Australians have a strong interest and when preserving the tolerance of our great multicultural society is so important, our language should not be the source in itself of incitement or irrational division. That means the wording of motions presented to this House should be based on facts not on prejudice or an attempt to appeal to a particular constituency, be it within the broader community or our own political parties. In debate, we should present our views forcefully but not in a way that hinders our contribution to the peace process. In this respect I particularly deplore the language that some honourable members have used in recent times. Referring, for example, to Israel as a ‘rogue state' led by a ‘war criminal responsible for massacres', as the honourable member for Sydney did in September of this year, deserves our condemnation. Her remarks, unbalanced and based on a contorted understanding of the facts, were inflammatory and, I suspect, designed to simply appeal to elements of her own party. Her comments reflect an insidious trend within the Left of the international community and here in Australia. It is a trend that deliberately paints Israel as the aggressor, willfully destroying the lives of the Palestinian people. It is a trend that we witnessed most dramatically at the 2001 World Conference Against Racism in Durban, which saw the Left act in concert with those nations that do have something to genuinely be ashamed of in attempting to make Israel an international pariah. I find it ironic that the only functioning democracy in the Middle East should be targeted in this way, that a people who have suffered so much because of racism could become the accused and that, in the process, the Left can find itself justifying the often violent actions of regimes that are based on repression and corruption-certainly not on the principles of democracy or of Islam. Those in Australia who promote such ideas, in almost an abstract way, forget the consequences of their actions. This is not a conceptual debate for the coffee houses of the Left; it is a debate about real people and their daily lives. There is a reason why synagogues in my electorate are patrolled by armed guards and why attacks have been made on individuals and properties. Just as we correctly condemn those who incite intolerance towards those within our community of Islamic faith, we should deplore those on the Left who inadvertently or maliciously promote intolerance against those of the Jewish faith. Debate inside the walls of this parliament and within the community has attempted to engender an inaccurate understanding of the issues facing the Middle East. There are some, for example, who accuse Israel of repetitively ignoring United Nations resolutions and therefore seek to justify or draw parallels with the actions of a despot like Saddam Hussein. Security Council resolution 242 of 1967 is most frequently cited, despite Israel's support for that decision. It is claimed that Israel has ignored the UN's call for it to withdraw from territories it occupied during the 1967 Six-Day War. Certainly the resolution adopts the principle that a lasting peace will involve that withdrawal, but that is an incomplete analysis. Perhaps the Economist summarised the truth most accurately on 10 October this year. It said: [The resolution] does not instruct Israel to withdraw unconditionally from the territories occupied in 1967. It does not condemn Israel's conquest, for the good reason that most western powers at the time thought it the result of a justifiable pre-emptive war. It calls for a negotiated settlement, based on the principle of exchanging land for peace. For 20 years following that resolution, the PLO and most Arab nations refused to concede recognition of Israel, let alone negotiate a peaceful outcome in the terms supported by the Security Council. Since its neighbours and the Palestinians have adopted a more realistic approach towards the permanence of the Israeli state, negotiations have occurred. The Camp David and Oslo processes, supported by Israel, have been in the spirit of that resolution. Its negotiations with Egypt and Jordan, under the framework of 242, led to Israel's complete withdrawal from the Sinai. Its negotiations with Syria and Lebanon have also been in that context, and the withdrawal from southern Lebanon was in accord with resolution 425. Israel has therefore demonstrated its sincerity in attempting to negotiate outcomes in accord with UN decisions. Similarly, the negotiations convened by President Clinton at Camp David between Prime Minister Barak and Chairman Arafat were within the spirit and letter of resolution 242. I remind the House that at that peace conference Mr Barak courageously proposed what we all hoped was the basis for a fair settlement. It was not Israel that walked away from that negotiation. To suggest that Israel withdraw from the occupied territories in the absence of a negotiated settlement is both naive and counterproductive. The Left have also sought to portray military action in the occupied territories as unjustified attacks on civilians. At the same time, those terrorists responsible for the murder of 652 Israelis since the commencement of the intifada-five just last night in a kibbutz north of Tel Aviv-are almost forgiven as the victims of poverty. And when the United Nations finds that left-wing hysteria about the actions of the Israeli defence forces in Jenin are not based on fact, what do we find? There is no apology and no regret at being duped by propagandists-perhaps just satisfaction that the damage had been done by the making of those claims in the first place. Australia can be proud that our nation has enjoyed a largely bipartisan approach to the Middle East, that our support for the state of Israel, existing within secure borders and free from external attack, has come from both sides of this chamber and that both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition have made clear our support for a negotiated peace and the creation of a Palestinian state which fulfils the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people. We also share with Israel the common goal of defeating those willing to use terrorism within the international community. A fair analysis of the situation in the Middle East and our genuine concern for the welfare of all its peoples have led us to that position. The current attack from the Left of the Australian Labor Party on that bipartisan approach is therefore regrettable. The only consequence can be to increase division within our own community and to weaken the role that we play in this parliament and outside it in promoting a fair outcome in this troubled part of the world. Telstra: Privatisation",70
183,Ms JANN MCFARLANE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I rise today to bring the grievance of the electors of Stirling into this House and to speak against the privatisation of Telstra. One of the realities of today's world is that communication is fundamental for both the realisation of fulfilling personal relationships and successful competitive business. An efficient and comprehensive telecommunication system is therefore indispensable to the social and economic operation of a modern-day democracy. Given the sheer size and makeup of our continent, this has added relevance. The above facts are of course recognised by most countries. The majority of OECD countries have retained a share of their national telecommunication infrastructure. Once again we see the Howard government ignoring current trends to pursue dogmatic and ideologically driven policies. As a committed local member and Labor MP, I am committed to policies that result in the best possible services for Australians. Our telecommunication services are too valuable for us to lose control over them. This sentiment is reflected in public opinion. A poll carried out by the Australian showed that up to 66 per cent of Australians are opposed to the privatisation of Telstra, with only a meagre 20 per cent in favour. This is hardly surprising, given Telstra's performance since the last round of privatisation in 1997. Since then, the Howard government has purged 36,000 jobs, increased telephone line rentals, increased mobile telephone flag fall rates and slashed about $800 million from infrastructure investment. These worrying trends will only continue if Telstra is unleashed to the private sector. The Howard government wants to create a titanic private monopoly which the government of the day will have no means of controlling. Services in rural Australia are still below the standard of those in urban areas. The President of the National Farmers Federation stated in the Australian that services in rural areas still have: ... a significant way to go before there is equality between rural and urban telecommunication. How then is the government to guarantee the necessary services to Australians when Telstra is fully privatised? Ross Gittins wrote in the Sydney Morning Herald earlier this year: It should be clear that completing Telstra's privatisation would complete the process of making it uncontrollable. The forecast is bleak for regional Australia under the Howard government. If Telstra becomes subordinate to market pressures, telecommunication services could well flee regional Australia faster than the banks. Just as banks no longer have a commercial interest in regional areas, Telstra, driven to increase its share price, would have little interest in providing necessary services to regional Australia. Essential services need to be subordinate to public interest and not to profit margins. We only have to look at the telco disasters of BT to AT&T and WorldCom to KPN to see the danger our telecommunication services face if they become subject to market fluctuations. On top of these substantial problems, we face the very real possibility that our telecommunication system could well be taken over by foreign capital. Treasurer Costello is being deliberately ambiguous on this issue when he states: We would not accept Telstra becoming a foreign owned telecommunication company. But how do you stop it when the shares are put on the market? What did people-particularly the people of Stirling-want before the sale of the second tranche? They wanted prices kept reasonable, they wanted maintenance done in a timely manner, they wanted reconnections done in a timely manner, they wanted universal obligations, the provision of public telephones, free directory services, disability access and design improvements. Did they get those things? Yes, they did in urban areas, but not always in regional areas. I will not go over what people want in terms of Internet download speeds, SMS and other enhancements to telecommunications. People mainly talk about the basic items they want from their telecommunication systems. What do people want now that the second tranche has been well and truly sold? They still want the same. But what are their concerns? The concerns that I expressed to people when the second tranche was being sold are now being expressed back to me by the same people. They are expressing concern that once somebody sells their shares from the first or the second tranche they can be picked up by foreign companies. Where are the controls regarding this? People are concerned that there are no controls. The share market-the stock exchange-is an open, accessible place and people can go in and buy and sell what they want when they like and when the price is right. But there are concerns about who now owns these shares. There are even concerns about the shares being owned by major corporations in Australia and about the muscle they have to persuade Telstra to ensure that prices are kept high so that profits are kept high. What do people now want? I hear very little talk now from the electors of Stirling about selling any more of Telstra. In fact, electors of Stirling want Telstra kept. Why do they want it kept? Because the concerns raised by a small number of people when the first and second tranche sales took place are now becoming common currency in the community; they are now becoming concerns for a greater majority of people. Labor's campaign to keep Telstra public and say no to selling Telstra puts a particular phasis on senators and on reminding them exactly why most Australians remain opposed to the sale of Telstra. People need to be mindful of lobbying their senators about these issues. This is not just a lower house issue; it is an upper house and a lower house issue. One of the oldest newsletters in Australia-it has been going since 1947-is Inside Canberra. What is it saying about Telstra? In talking about Telstra, that newsletter heads its comments with the words: The Telstra sales conundrum-when how and why. The writer goes on to say: Telstra will be fully privatised, yet here are some of the imponderables: when will it be sold; in what form will it be sold; and what price will the rest of the shares (T3) bring? It is known why it is to be sold. According to Peter Costello, it is to write off all Commonwealth Government debt. With debt gone, he says, the Government will be able to provide infrastructure such as roads, an upgraded rail system, an attack on salinity, and so on. The National Party, the junior party in the Coalition, has not given its approval and may not for some time. If T3 does occur, the Nationals will go for the bird in the hand-spend the proceeds directly on regional and rural infrastructure. The question that many of my constituents ask is whether this is a fair thing. Many of my constituents are actually farming folk who own houses along the coastline of my beautiful electorate. When they pass the farm on in the family, they retire to the beautiful areas of Scarborough and Trigg, and so they have an interest in what happens with Telstra from the rural side and from the city or urban side. Many of these people come and talk to me because they can see that when they are in the urban parts of Western Australia, such as my electorate, the full range of services, such as timeliness of maintenance, reconthe nections and other items, are available; however, when they are back in their rural areas, on their farms or in their businesses in small country towns, they do not get exactly the same service-hence their concerns. They have started to realise that selling off Telstra may not bring them advantages. Also, other people in my electorate, while supporting the idea that rural and regional areas should get a emfair share of any money if the sale of Telstra goes ahead, do not think it is fair that they should get all the money. They have concerns about that. When you read Inside Canberra, the headings on each paragraph of the article are interesting. They are: ‘The no debt argument', ‘Estens chairs yet another services inquiry', ‘Controlling the Telstra monster', ‘Costello misleads on foreign ownership of Telstra', ‘Alston can't say how to control a privatised Telstra' and ‘Controlling Telstrahard to put in prospectus'. That is the point I now want to focus on. The Nationals' approach is to lock a privatised Telstra into de facto government control through some form of legislation. How could an honest prospectus be written that exposes to potential tranche 3 shareholders that they are being invited to invest in a company that will be hobbled by regulation from Canberra? I bring the grievance of my constituents into this House, and I ask the government to seriously consider its plan to sell off Telstra. not practical, it is not sensible, it is not wanted, it is unfair and it is inequitable no matter which way you look at it. Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for letting me put this grievance to the House. Dunkley Electorate: Scoresby Freeway Dunkley Electorate: Rutherford Road OnFuel: Liquified Petroleum Gas",72
184,Mr BILSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Dunkley) (5.31 p.m.)On behalf of the Dunkley constituents, I grieve about three particular issues that I would like to canvass in the time available. It will not come as a surprise to members in this place that I open the batting with reference to the Scoresby transport corridor. Not only I but most of south-eastern and eastern Melbourne have been grieving about that subject for a long period of time, and we continue to grieve. As time goes by, it is becoming more evident that the words, the media stunts and the announcements of the Bracks Labor government in Victoria amount to a very cruel hoax on the motorists of eastern and south-eastern Melbourne. Some of the campaign material being circulated by the Labor Party members seeking re-election includes so-called ‘achievements'. In the community that I represent, a document is being circulated by a sitting Labor Party member who lists as an achievement the announcement of the Scoresby Freeway project. One needs to look carefully at that language, because the statement sits alongside tangible amounts of funding for schools and things of that kind-all well received by the local community. But that statement is actually it. That is all we have. All we have is an announcement. We have multiple announcements, we have reannouncements and we have the repackaging of projects. The Scoresby Freeway now has a new name. It is now $400 million over budget and the project has not even started because the Bracks Labor government cannot get past making an announcement to actually making a commitment. There is a big difference between a media stunt, where all the press come along and you hear again about how the state government of Victoria is interested in the project, and the ComIt is monwealth, which has had a rock solid $445 million on the table now for almost two years, seeking to prod the Labor government in Victoria into action. What we have is inaction and some very cleverly worded material from Labor candidates in the upcoming Victorian state election highlighting that we have nothing more Ramp than an announcement. We have as on television talking about the virtues of a freeway, we have images of a four-lane carriageway and its support for industry, but we just do not have it. It is an image of a freeway from somewhere else, transposed to create this mirage that something is actually going on at the state Labor government level in support of the Scoresby transport corridor. It is a cruel hoax on the voters of Victoria, on the electorate that I represent, for anybody to suggest that the state Labor Party is even remotely interested in the Scoresby transport corridor. I know this is an issue dear to your heart too, Madam Deputy Speaker Corcoran. Your constituents and mine are looking for this venture to move forward. Another piece of evidence has emerged that shows what a cruel hoax the talk of the Bracks government being committed to the Scoresby corridor is. Just a few weeks ago, Budget Information Paper No. 1, presented by the Hon. John Brumby, Treasurer of Victoria, included on page 54 of the Public Sector Asset Investment Program 2002-03, under ‘Infrastructure', the renamed Scoresby corridor-now called the MitchamFrankston transport corridor. Under ‘Estimated expenditure' it reads: ‘tbd'. I assume that means ‘to be determined'. It could mean many other things that I will not go into, which some of the constituents in the electorate of Dunkley have described. Not a zack is there. Not a zack is committed in the current financial year and not a zack was committed in the year to 2002. What is being spent is the Commonwealth's money-on soil testing and engineering specifications. That is all Commonwealth money being spent by the state while the state trots claiming credit for announcing things but not actually doing a darn thing. The latest piece of evidence is in one of the state Labor government's own budget papers, showing that not a zack is being committed this financial year, not a zack was committed last financial year and they do not even know how much the project is going to cost. In the time that they sit around simulating an interest, the constituents of the electorate of Dunkley grieve. They grieve vigorously, to the point where the community are standing up for Frankston. We are looking for some of the Labor candidates seeking election-or even some of the current Labor members of parliament who have done nothing-to step up and commit themselves to this project. To the credit of the Frankston Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the City of Frankston, there will be a ‘Stand up for Frankston day' next Thursday. The sad thing is, we are here in Canberra. But I am here today to stand up for Frankston, and I hope all people with responsibilities in the area at the southern end of the Scoresby Freeway will also stand up for our community. The meeting will call on all stakeholders in the city to support the immediate construction of the southern section of the freeway. Why does that matter? Because, as part of the repackaging of the Scoresby Freeway-now called the MitchamFrankston Freeway-there is this northerncentric focus. Everything is focused up the eastern end. The state Labor government had two shots at running tenders to get people to do the eastern freeway extension. Twice, people have spent money putting considered tender proposals together. Twice, the project has been put off. Now it looks like an entirely different project. The good folk in our electorates of Isaacs and Dunkley, Madam Deputy Speaker Corcoran, want to know when a bit of southern comfort is coming to the electors down our end of the Scoresby Freeway. We do not want more announcements; we want action and we want commitment. I encourage all those people who come to me grieving about the inaction of the state Labor government on the Scoresby freeway to join in this activity from 11 a.m. until 11.30 a.m. around on Thursday, 14 November at Australian Arrow, a great local components manufacturer, at 65 Lathams Road. We will be calling on people to stand up for our city and to get this part of the Scoresby Freeway moving. It is the highest cost-benefit segment of the freeway. Ninety per cent of the land has already been acquired. One-fifth of Greater Melbourne's industrially zoned land is at the end of this freeway, north of the community that I represent and in the area that you represent, Madam Deputy Speaker Corcoran. We need this project and we need to get moving. Part of that campaign, though, is the crying need to construct the Rutherford Road on-ramp. There has been this fantasy running around the state government that the Rutherford Road on-ramp is somehow part of the Scoresby transport corridor. I am sure that a flu remedy would be included as part of the Scoresby transport corridor if it suited the state Labor government. To claim that the Rutherford Road on-ramp needs to be part of the Scoresby transport corridor is a nonsense. It has merit in its own right, and it should be constructed in its own right, so that those industrial enterprises operating north of Frankston around the Belvedere ParkSeaford area can actually access the Frankston freeway without having to go past St Anne's Primary School, the church that is there on the corner, the sporting facilities and the residential areas. There is considerable merit in getting on with that project now. It does not rely upon the Scoresby transport corridor; it has merit in its own right. We look, wondering, waiting and praying, for some action by the Bracks Labor government on the Scoresby transport corridor. We do not know when they are going to get their act together, but we do know that we need the Rutherford Road on-ramp now and that we need to get that moving. The electors of Frankston, the greater city of Frankston and all those with an interest in transport infrastructure will be able to stand up and argue for those two issues this Thursday. My final point relates to LPG. Eight times previously I have raised the issue of the LP gas industry and the great mystery-it is on a par with Stonehenge-of how LPG prices are set in this country. The fallacy is that use a Saudi benchmark price-which is a spot price, a cherry-picked price-as the basis for the LPG price in this country and then, as motorists, we need to pay a premium for convenience. When you take all those factors into account, the price of LPG moves independently of them anyway, so there is something else going on. I have spoken repeatedly with all sections of the industry. I have gone to see big oil, and big oil has told me one story. I have gone to see the industry association, and they have given me another yarn. I go to see the converters, I go to see the wholesalers, I go to see the motorists, and everyone has a story. We just cannot get to the nub of what it is. In response to the representations of the LP gas industry, and through my advocacy, we have actually got a fuel standard for this fuel product. This transport fuel needs a constant standard, and we are moving in that direction. We are still trying to clear through the fog of how the prices are arrived at, and I have spoken on that issue before. The weekend's press illustrated again that the single biggest problem with the LP gas industry is that the industry itself does not talk up its own product. Right now, even though the price of LP gas is much higher than it was 20 years ago, it still is between 40c and more than 50c cheaper than alternative unleaded petrol. That differential represents the business case that backs the use of LPG. In the weekend press, when all of us were again talking about how curious the pricing mix is for LPG, the story coming through to the motorists was that it is somehow bad value. It is not bad value; it has never been better value to convert your vehicle to LPG. I say to fleet buyers and to families: get on the good product. To the industry, I say: get on your own product. (Time expired) Victoria: Services",74
185,Mr GIBBONS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Bendigo) (5.41 p.m.)When the Bracks government first came to power in October 1999, Victoria's basic services-our schools, hospitals and community services-had been run down to crisis point. In education, more than 350 state we schools had been closed and 9,000 teachers had been removed from those schools. Victoria spent less per student than any other state, and student-teacher ratios were higher than the national average. Class sizes were nearly the highest in Australia, and our retention rates were amongst the lowest. Funding of TAFE training had been slashed and it was the lowest in Australia. Traditional apprenticeship commencements had declined, despite skill shortages. In health, 3,500 nurses and a further 6,500 staff had been retrenched from our hospital system. Some $900 million had been taken out of the hospitals' budgets and 1,400 hospital beds had been closed. A total of 17 hospitals were being closed-five in the metropolitan area and 12 in country towns. The Latrobe Valley and Mildura hospitals had been privatised and plans had been made to sell the Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre. Nursing home beds all around Victoria were privatised and 43 maternal and child health centres were closed. Victoria spent less on drug and alcohol services than New South Wales, Western Australia, the ACT and the Northern Territory. Our ambulance system was in complete disarray. In fact, the former Premier, Mr Kennett, described rural Victoria as the toenails of the state. Rural Victoria had been left to fend for itself. Country Victorians were streaming to Melbourne in search of elusive jobs for themselves and for their children. Country train lines had been shut down, making transport between regional centres more difficult and further isolating country people. Police were leaving the Victoria Police service in droves, and recruitment was not sufficient to maintain the force at a viable level to ensure safety in the community. Important independent statutory office holders like the Auditor-General and the Director of Public Prosecutions had seen their powers reduced and independence undermined. There was a political culture that excluded community views and stifled public debate. The impact of the Kennett experiment on Victoria had far-reaching consequences and this makes the achievements of the Bracks government in starting to overturn the most disastrous impacts of this legacy in just three years the more remarkable. I would now like to point to some of the achievements of the Bracks government in my own area of Bendigo specifically. These achievements were made with the able assistance of my state parliamentary colleagues and friends, Jacinta Allan in Bendigo East and Bob Cameron in Bendigo West. They have been assisted by Marg Lewis, the Labor candidate for North Western Province. The Bracks commitments specifically for Bendigo are: 104 extra nurses; $20 million for an air ambulance service; $15 million for radiotherapy at the Bendigo Hospital, although that was a joint Commonwealth and state initiative; $10 million extra for the Bendigo Hospital's budget; and $1.2 million for the school dental clinic. In the area of education, we have seen 76 extra teachers; $3.1 million for La Trobe University's arts precinct; $3.3 million for an innovation park; $3.3 million for an information technology centre; and $250,000 for La Trobe University's Centre for Sustainable Regional Communities. In the area of community and jobs, the Bracks government assisted AAPT to locate in Bendigo, netting another 400 jobs. They relocated the Rural Finance Corporation to Bendigo-another 40 jobs. They assisted Australian Defence Apparel in Bendigo to the tune of another 100 jobs. They assisted Castle Bacon in Castlemaine, with another 200 jobs. They have supplied $70 million for the next stage of construction of the Calder Highway duplication project and have already put $25 million into construction at the Carlsruhe section. They have allocated $182 million to a fast rail link to Bendigo; that contract has been signed. They have provided $2 million for an upgrade of the Bendigo basketball stadium and allocated $6.3 million for the Long Gully public housing redevelopment. What an outstanding record of achievement, following on from the disaster of the Kennett years! Just last week, the state government announced $3 million for an MRI service at Bendigo Hospital, provided that the Commonwealth provides a licence for that service. Labor believes that MRI services ought to be available to all those who need them, not just those who can afford them. In catchup politics, the Liberal opposition announced $2.5 million the same day for MRI services for Bendigo-once again on the back foot and following along. What they have not been able to announce is that Commonwealth licence. The opposition leader in the state of Victoria has not been able to convince his Commonwealth counterpart, the health minister, to provide a licence for an MRI service for Bendigo. The Bracks government's top achievements over all Victoria are quite astounding. For example, they have maintained the state's AAA credit rating and delivered strong budget surpluses, substantially exceeding their target of $100 million per annum. They have created well over 100,000 new jobs in Victoria since October 1999almost a third of them in rural and regional Victoria-and Victoria has an unemployment rate below the national average. They have directly facilitated more than $3.5 billion in new manufacturing investment, directly creating over 9,000 new jobs. They have made Victoria's business taxes fewer and simpler and announced more than $1 billion in tax cuts. In delivering quality services, they have improved the standards of health care by attracting more than 3,300 nurses back into the health system. They have commenced rebuilding our public hospitals through a record investment of $900 million over three budgets to date. They have opened 12 new ambulance stations, upgraded a further 21 ambulance stations and put 267 new paramedics on the road. They have provided new services for people with a disability and their families through $194.6 million in additional funding-a 34 per cent increase over three years. They have banned smoking in restaurants and in enclosed shopping centres, and they have introduced new smoke-free restrictions for gaming venues, clubs and hotels. They have put an extra 3,000 teachers and staff and over $2.75 billion back into education. They have cut class sizes for the early years. From prep to second class, class sizes are at an average of 21.8 in 2002, down from 24.3 in 1999. They have allocated $822 million to build better schools and TAFEs, including 16 new schools and five replacement schools. They have put an extra 800 police on the streets. They are building 65 new police stations-22 metropolitan and regional, and 43 country-at a cost of $125 million. They are introducing guideline judgments to ensure that sentences adequately reflect community values, and they are committed to introducing tough asset confiscation laws to ensure criminals and drug dealers do not profit from crime. The Bracks government have been growing the whole of Victoria in providing funding for fast rail links between Melbourne and Geelong, Ballarat, Bendigo and the Latrobe Valley and for the reopening of country rail passenger lines between Melbourne and Mildura, Leongatha, Bairnsdale and Ararat. They have introduced the $180 million Regional Infrastructure Development Fund for capital works in rural and regional communities, which to date has funded over 55 projects with a total value of investment of more than $225 million. A recent announcement added to that. They have provided $77 million to build the Wimmera-Mallee pipeline and have set a target for water recycling in Melbourne which will increase recycling from one per cent in 2000 to 20 per cent by 2010. They have unveiled Melbourne 2030, a 30-year blueprint to curb Melbourne's urban sprawl and to protect green wedges so Melbourne can retain its status as the world's most livable city. They have established the world's first comprehensive and representative system of marine national parks and sanctuaries along the Victorian coast. They have restored six per cent of the Snowy's original flow as a first step in restoring 28 per cent and provided funding to help restore the environmental flows to the Murray River. They have comprehensively addressed the public liability insurance crisis through a major legislative package which resolves problems in public liability and medical indemnity insurance, including protection of volunteers, good Samaritans and food donors. They have also restored democracy. They have restored common law rights for seriously injured workers, enacted the Racial and Religious Tolerance Act and implemented a comprehensive community education campaign. They have restored the powers of the Auditor-General and the independence of the Director of Public Prosecutions. What an extraordinary effort in just three years, given the confines that that government found itself in! Remember, it did not have a majority in either house, and it inherited one of the biggest messes in Victoria's history. I believe it has done a superb job, an extraordinary job, in achieving all I have just mentioned in that time. As the campaign slogan says, there is much more to be done. Indeed there is. If Victorians want to see their state continue to grow and prosper, I urge all of them to vote for Labor candidates all around the state. Drought",76
186,Ms LEY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I rise today to talk about the matter that affects my electorate above and beyond all others at this time-that is, the drought that is worsening every day across NSW and indeed other parts of Australia. I wish to make this House aware of just how difficult it is for farmers and rural communities to cope with the set of circumstances confronting them at this time. I wish to highlight what I believe is a significant threat, maybe not in the short term but definitely in the medium and long term, from the Green movement. There are two Green senators in this parliament and two in the upper house of the NSW parliament. Today we welcome a new member, also an Australian Green, in this place. We need to be well aware of what the Greens stand for. They talk a lot about logging, genetically modified foods, global warming and healthier rivers. They are issues that you could say cross over from mainstream politics; issues that many voters respond to in a positive way. They talk far less about their other so-called policies but they are certainly there, and if you vote Green in the upcoming Victorian or NSW state elections you vote for the whole package. It is important that we respect views different from our own, but what worries me about the Greens and their supporters is that they do not understand agriculture and they view farming activities as an assault on the landscape. I understand that there have been recent calls by the Greens to lock up the Western Division of New South Wales. Maybe they believe that there is nothing going on out there, that there are no communities to care for and that no value is being added. They are wrong on all counts. These are communities worthy of respect, affection, admiration and support, particularly during the current savage drought. A couple of weeks ago I flew my light plane out to Tupra Station near Oxley, west of Hay, in western NSW. I met many of the locals at a barbecue organised to celebrate the opening of another Telstra mobile base station in another of our less densely populated rural areas. Oxley is close to where the Lachlan meets the Murrumbidgee. In a good year the river spreads out over a 40,000-acre flood plain. Now the Lachlan is a series of muddy holes. The black soil plains to the north and the red sandy country to the west are as bare and desolate as you will ever see them. In fact, in some parts, the strong winds the area has experienced have blown away the sand and what little topsoil there is. If these conditions continue, I can see this land looking more and more like a desert: sand drifts, little vegetation and little water. Those of us who know this country know that a decent rain will transform it: the barren desolate look will vanish and feed will grow. Although it may be hard to imagine how sheep can do so well on what does not look like very much, believe me when I say that they do. Those of us who do not know the country make the mistake, made by so many city dwellers and writers in the broadsheet press, of speculating that we should not be out there farming in this very marginal landscape. This is arrant nonsense. Farming has been carried out very successfully on the western lands leases of New South Wales for 140 years. Certainly, the choices are limited. Sheep are an ideal animal to farm; crops and cattle are only possible in certain areas. Farmers in this part of Australia have coped very well with 10 years of low wool prices, challenges related to native title and a recent run of dry years. They have now been hit by a severe and exceptional drought. One farmer from a station out that way which has kept records for over 100 years told me that this is the lowest rainfall since the drought of 1922. The farmers and families who live this life are extraordinary people. Men and women work side by side, day after day, in the heat, the dust and the flies. There is rarely money available to employ labour for the farm, much less for help in the house. At the end of a working day spent in the sheep yards, shearing shed or down the paddock, women-and it usually is the women-take over as wives, mothers, cooks, bookkeepers and homework supervisors. I cannot emphasise how much I admire these inspirational women of the west. Imagine how these families must feel when they hear Green interests discussing locking up their farms and giving them over to national parks when we all know that the overstressed NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service cannot manage the parks it already has in its care. As if this would return the area to some sort of original condition; it would simply consign it to infestation from noxious weeds and feral animals. I am sorry to report that our own national symbols, the emu and the kangaroo, are in plague proportions-helped by the large numbers of man made watering points, which have enabled them to breed up to artificially high levels. In the last drought the rabbit was in plague proportions. I am pleased to say that the rabbit has largely been eradicated, but the sight of emus and kangaroos caught in fences and too weak to move is not a happy one. I hope that the New South Wales government learns from this and acts to keep kangaroo and emu numbers down to a manageable level or at least allows others to carry out the culls that it will not. The people who currently farm this part of the state are the only ones who can; they are the only ones who really know how. They are the only ones who have the courage to hang on. For example, as the dams fed from the Lachlan slowly disappear into mud holes, farmers spend hours every day riding to these watering points, pulling their struggling sheep out of the bogs-where they are too weak to stand-and then going back and doing it all over again. At the gathering I attended, people maintained a cheerful exterior and showed that wonderful Australian attribute of keeping an eye out for your neighbour and being more concerned for his welfare than for your own. But, quietly, in other parts of western New South Wales I have heard stories that make your heart heavy as you worry about how people are going to get through this. In one town I was told that quite a few farmers were cancelling their newspaper subscriptions. Now, if times are tough and you have battened down the hatches and are waiting for rain, one thing you can do is sit and read paper over a cup of coffee. It brings home just how difficult it is when you realise that some people can no longer afford to do that. As farmers all over my electorate come to terms with their future-some of them finding their bottom line has slipped back maybe half a million dollars without even tryingand as they attempt to buy irrigation water and feed, they worry. One of the things they worry about is losing the right to make deci- measures. sions for their businesses. New South Wales state laws around native vegetation and the 10-year water-sharing plans are eroding property values and-from a farmer's perspective-giving remote outside interests with no real understanding of the bush control over farming communities. I am not talking about the legitimate and useful debate which the whole country is having about water: how we make the best use of it into the future and how we maximise irrigation efficiency. That is certainly a debate we have to have and one that I believe will have posities tive outcomes for all. But let me go back to the Greens. It is Greens who subtly and successfully influence the wider, often city based, constituencies with misinformation and distortions about Australian agriculture. There are many who vote for the Greens believing that they are restoring some balance and environmental common sense to the economic policy debate. Nothing could be further from the truth. To those who broadly describe themselves as Liberals-even Liberals who may have voted for minor parties in the past-I offer this salutary warning: if you think that by voting Green you are helping your children to inherit an environmentally sustainable world and that you are helping to address the excesses of capitalism and the tendencies of capitalism to build without regard for the environmental outcomes then you are sadly mistaken. The Greens have some admirable ideassome of their aims and objectives are worthwhile and shared by all of us-but they do not understand how wealth is created in a modern economy. I heard one Victorian Greens leader say on the radio recently, in connection with the logging of old-growth the forests, that there is just too much demand for the timber and we have to get rid of that demand. I should not have to go back to basic economics except to say that without demand precious little wealth and income can be created. Without a healthy, growing economy this government would not have been able to contribute $2.5 billion funding under the Natural Heritage Trust-plus the $1 million on the way for further environmental The Greens' web site is instructive on the matter of a healthy economy; it tells us ‘the Australian Greens work towards ... the abandonment of economic growth ... in favour of indices showing changes in the quality of life'. The Greens believe in ‘taxing natural resources ... in preference to the taxing of income and labour' and yet most of their policies involve taxation incentives. They will raise the company tax rate, raise marginal tax rates, raise inheritance taxes, tax non-organic farming methods and tax activiwhich they deem unsustainable. I question whether, under their system, people will the be earning enough money to pay tax at all. I save the Greens' most crazy policy until last: ‘Australia must interact with the international financial system on its own terms.' The Greens do not realise that Australia is a small, open economy-a tiny fraction of the world economy-which needs to engage the rest of the world in order to be successful. I conclude by recognising once again the long, hard slog it will be for the farmers in the rural communities in my electorate to get to that perfect day when the drought finally breaks. I encourage all those unsure of just how green we really are in rural Australia to travel to the farming areas of my electorate and see for themselves what good environmental managers we are.",78

NA Treaties Committee Report,81
189,Ms JULIE BISHOP,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled Report 49: the Timor Sea Treaty, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",81
190,Ms JULIE BISHOP,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The report contains the results of an inquiry conducted by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties into the exchange of notes and the Timor Sea Treaty, both done at Dili on 20 May 2002 and tabled in the parliament on 25 June 2002. From the outset it was evident that the committee would require longer than the normal 15-day sitting period to review the Timor Sea Treaty, and on 26 June 2002 the committee informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs that this was the case. The longer period was required because of the high level of interest in the proposed treaty action among the Australian public. The committee took evidence at public hearings in Canberra, Melbourne, Perth and Darwin from key stakeholders, including relevant government departments; state and territory governments; resource, oil and gas companies; business and commercial interests; and NGOs. In Darwin, the committee also took evidence from representatives of a large number of NGOs from East Timor. The purpose of the treaty is to set in a framework that provides the necessary legal and fiscal security to enable the development of the oil and gas resources within the designated area. The treaty provides for East Timor to have title to 90 per cent of the resources within the joint petroleum development area-the JPDA-and for Australia to have title to 10 per cent. The revenue flow to Australia from the Bayu-Undan oil and gas fields, enabled by the ratification of the treaty, is not inconsiderable at $A2 billion over the life of the project. In addition, tralia as a whole-and the Northern Territory in particular-stands to gain through indirect benefits, such as employment associated with bringing oil and gas from the BayuUndan fields onshore. The Bayu-Undan venture participants estimate the construction of a liquefied natural gas plant in Darwin will create about 1,200 jobs and the operation phase will sustain 100 direct jobs and from 300 to 500 indirect jobs for the 20-year life of the project. The construction of the pipeline from the Bayu-Undan to Darwin together with investments in Darwin is estimated at $A2.7 billion. In an ever more global world Australia's interests are increasingly bound up with the interests of its region. Ratification of the Timor Sea Treaty serves the Australian national interest in providing the conditions that will allow East Timor economic independence and political and social stability. East Timor is the newest sovereign member of the international community and the ratification of the treaty provides a rare opportuis nity for putting in place conditions that will exert a beneficial influence upon the future course of this nation and contribute to the stability of the region. The treaty also makes provision for the unitisation and equitable sharing of any oil and gas resource that extends across the boundary of the JPDA. The oil and gas fields of the Greater Sunrise constitute a known instance of a straddling resource. The treaty provides that the Greater Sunrise shall be subject to a unitisation agreement on the basis that 20.1 per cent of the field lies within the JPDA and 79.9 per cent lies within Australian jurisdiction. It was estimated that place der current expectations the resources of Greater Sunrise would be worth an estimated $A400 million per year to Australia, and East Timor could expect to receive approximately $A100 million per year, with indirect benefits including training and development opportunities for the East Timorese. The unitisation agreement for the Greater Sunrise fields is currently under negotiation. Both Australia and East Timor signed a memorandum of understanding on 20 May 2002 stating that they will work expediAustiously and in good faith to conclude this agreement by 31 December 2002. The committee recommends that the government use its best endeavours to achieve this objective on or before the date on which the Timor Sea Treaty is ratified and, in any event, before 31 December 2002, as this would serve the best interests of both nations. The committee was concerned to ensure that the treaty provides for the adequate maintenance of employment and environmental standards within the JPDA. The occupational health and safety and environmental regimes that are currently in operation are likely to continue under the terms of the treaty. The committee urges the government to use its presence on the administrative agencies overseeing oil and gas development in the JPDA to ensure that standards are enforced. Although some nongovernment organisations and individuals in Australia and East Timor challenged the treaty as prejudicing future maritime claims by either East Timor or Australia, the treaty without prejudice to the claims of either party. It is a provisional instrument that provides the necessary conditions for the development of petroleum related activities within the JPDA. There is a minority report of Senator Andrew Bartlett which in essence recommends that the parties not ratify this treaty but go back to the negotiating table, start again and determine the entire competing seabed delimitation claims between Australia and East Timor. This position is against the weight of the evidence and ignores the stated position of both parties to the treaty. It fails to take account of East Timor's need for immediate unassistance and resources. The minority report suggests that 40 per cent of East Timor's share of 90 per cent be placed in escrow for at least five years, invariably longer. Inexpliwas cably, the minority report requires Australia to put all its share of revenues from the JPDA into escrow. It fails to take account of the commercial reality of the impact of delay on the Bayu-Undan project that has signed delivery contracts in place, as well as the evidence that nothing less than treaty action will be required for the project to continue beyond its present state. The minority report does not take into account the fact that seabed delimitations can take decades to resolve-and this treaty provides an interim framework. The minority report also makes no reference to the rights of Indonesia in such a process and does not mention the stated preference of both treaty parties to negotiate, not litigate, over their boundaries. The committee notes that the ratification of the treaty is a fundamental condition precedent to the exploitation of the resources of the Timor Sea. The development of these resources will bring great benefits to Australia and is vital to the immediate and future development of East Timor. It is the view of the committee that it is in the interest of Australia for the Timor Sea Treaty, considered in Report 49, to be ratified. The committee so recommends. I commend the report to the House.",81
191,Mr WILKIE,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I would like to make a few comments in supporting Report 49: the Timor Sea Treaty of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. On 20 May this year East Timor, our nearest neighbour, became an independent country. At that time Australia exchanged notes with East Timor constituting an agreement between the government of Australia and that country concerning arrangements for exploration and exploitation of petroleum and gas reserves in an area of the Timor Sea between our two countries known as the joint petroleum development area. This formed the basis for the treaty which the committee has considered and on which this report is based. The committee reported on a number of areas. Firstly, we looked at the history of the treaty itself and then at the costs and future protocols, the people who were consulted in relation to the inquiry and how the inquiry conducted. We also looked at the purpose of the treaty, how it was designed, different designated authorities that it reported to, the joint commission, ministerial conduct and dispute resolution, which are all very important parts of the treaty. During the inquiry, the committee heard from a range of parties who have an interest in ensuring that the treaty best reflects the interests of all parties. I would like to thank all those people who made submissions to the committee over an extended period of time. Their contributions were very valuable. I would particularly like to thank the non-government organisations from East Timor who actually made the trip to Darwin to give evidence to the inquiry. There are a number of different issues raised in the report. Firstly, a lot of submissions talked about the seabed boundary delimitation. We covered resource sharing arrangements, particularly in relation to the Bayu-Undan field and the Greater Sunrise field. Other matters that arose were employment, the environment, flags of convenience ships, how we deal with fisheries and also greenhouse gas emissions, so the committee received a wide range of evidence concerning this treaty. One aspect that was often mentioned was that Australia had been very heavy-handed in its dealings with East Timor in negotiating the treaty. I believe that we were. For example, the East Timorese get no money from the development of the BayuUndan field until the treaty is ratified and they are therefore under a lot of pressure to ratify the treaty as quickly as possible. Also, we received evidence concerning Australia's withdrawal of recognition of the ability of the International Court of Justice to determine maritime border disputes. We withdrew from that convention in March this year, even though we have been part of that body since the early 1940s. It was very disappointing that we did that. Clearly, we withdrew from that particular convention so that East Timor could not appeal to that court in determining maritime borders. But, in making that statement, I also recognise that the treaty, in articles 2(a) and (b), at least provides for ongoing negotiations regarding the boundary. I will quote from those articles because I think it is important to get them on the public record. Article 2(a) states that the treaty gives effect to international law as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, agreed at Montego Bay on 10 December 1982, which, under article 83, requires states with opposite or adjacent coasts ‘to make every effort to enter into provisional arrangements of a practical nature pending agreement on the final delimitation of the continental shelf between them in a manner consistent with international law'. This treaty is intended to adhere to such obligations, so it provides for ongoing negotiations. Article 2(b) states: Nothing contained in this Treaty and no acts taking place while this Treaty is in force shall be interpreted as prejudicing or affecting Australia's or East Timor's position on or rights relating to a seabed delimitation or their respective seabed entitlements. That is particularly important because a lot of submissions worked around the thought that, if in fact East Timor ratified the treaty, they may not be able to pursue any legal course at a future time. Clearly that is not the case-there are ongoing negotiations provided for. We also looked at the national interest. Clearly, when a treaty is being considered the committee must look at the national interest. I would like to quote one submitter, Alan Matheson from the ACTU, who I believe gave an excellent summation of what this committee should look at in terms of national interest in relation to this inquiry. Alan Matheson was representing Sharan Burrow, who unfortunately was unable to attend the committee's hearing in Melbourne. He made the following statement: I believe that, if we do not get this treaty process right, in five years we will have another joint Australia-New Zealand government mission into Timor to try to sort things out, as we have done in Bougainville and the Solomons. He went on to say: ... if we do not get the treaty process right with Timor, it seems to me that we will have the Australian government in five years up there trying to work out governance. It is the capacity building and governance which will provide the background and the backbone to an effective treaty ratification process in terms of what it will deliver in Dili. Basically what he was saying is that it is in Australia's national interest to have a neighbour with a strong and stable financial base, and that to have otherwise could cause long term difficulties for Australia. There are a number of areas we looked at in the national interest analysis that was provided to us. Unfortunately, what I found with the national interest analysis was that it was disappointing for what it missed out rather than for what it included. For a start, it did not consider that the Bayu-Undan field, which is totally contained within the joint petroleum development area, is at the moment under threat of not going ahead because the people who are developing that particular area, Phillips Petroleum, want certainty of ratification before they can proceed. They need to have that relatively quickly. The impact on the Northern Territory of not proceeding with that project was never considered in the national interest analysis. We are talking about 1,200 jobs in the construction phase and 400 on an ongoing basis. We are talking about $6 billion in infrastructure and about $2½ billion in tax coming to Australia. For example, the national interest analysis talked about Greater Sunrise, but it did not refer to the potential loss for Australia if we do not proceed with the Northern Territory project. If we do not proceed with the Northern Territory project and Phillips Petroleum withdraws, and if East Timor is not getting the money from that project, I am also concerned that that will mean Australia has to provide the equivalent level of aid to make up for what the East Timorese will be missing out on. We also heard that it was very important from Woodside's point of view to have unitisation in place to allow for their certainty in developing the Greater Sunrise part of the treaty. This demonstrates the incompetence of the government in not appreciating the issues that we are dealing with here. It is vitally important that the treaty be ratified, but it is also vitally important that we get the unitisation process happening as quickly as possible. If we do not do that, we could end up losing Bayu-Undan as a project and not getting Greater Sunrise developed in the future. I want to know what the foreign minister is doing and what his counterpart in developing projects, Minister Macfarlane, is up to in relation to getting these projects happening-that is, getting in there and getting unitisation happening before the end of the year, as per the memorandum of understanding. If they do not get that happening, Australia stands to lose billions of dollars. In closing, there are a number of other issues mentioned: staffing, which is also important, and the need to include Australian and East Timorese workers. Unfortunately, the treaty currently talks about East Timorese workers and does not mention Australians, but I think we can deal with that in the setting up of the project. Also, having occupational health and safety standards that meet international standards is very important. I will also make mention of the minority report of Senator Bartlett. I am very disappointed that Senator Bartlett did not attend one meeting to do with this treaty but has seen fit to put in a minority report in relation to it. Perhaps if he had actually attended he would have found something out that would have convinced him to go ahead with it. I commend the report to the House and thank the staff and members of the committee for all their work.",83
192,Ms JULIE BISHOP,COMMITTEES,by leave-I move: That the House take note of the report. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned. National Crime Authority Committee,85
193,Mr BAIRD,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, I present the committee's advisory report, incorporating additional recommendations by certain members, on the Australian Crime Commission Establishment Bill 2002, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. I seek leave to make a short statement in connection with the report. Leave granted.",85
194,Mr BAIRD,COMMITTEES,"It is my pleasure to comment on this report of the committee. I would like to also commend the committee members for the cooperative way they all worked together to produce the report. We basically do not have a minority report; it was unanimous, with some of the members providing additional comments. I would particularly like to thank those who attended the meetings and contributed significantly. I mention the members for Maribyrnong, Denison, Dickson and Blair; and Senators Hutchins, Ferris and MCGauran. It was a team that worked effectively and produced what I believe are quite worthwhile recommendations. Earlier this year, the government undertook a review of the National Crime Authority, in fulfilment of an undertaking made before the last election. The review was followed by a meeting of state and territory premiers and chief ministers to discuss security and related issues. At that meeting, state and territory leaders agreed to replace the National Crime Authority with the Australian Crime Commission. On 9 August the governance proposals were endorsed by the states and territories, and the bill was introduced on 26 September by the Attorney General. On the same day, the bill was referred to the parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority for report by 6 November. The report was submitted on that date. In this relatively short reporting period, the PJC has received 18 submissions and heard evidence in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra from a wide range of individuals and representative bodies. The material the PJC received has founded its recommenReport dations. The replacement for the National Crime Authority is a link in the chain of protection for all Australians from the consequences of organised criminal activity. On a national level this embraces security, the flow of money to and from this country, and the illegal importation of items such as drugs and guns. Mindful of this, the PJC has made a number of recommendations it believes will give the new body the environment it needs to operate effectively and with accountability. The recommendations are designed to strengthen the new body and improve the environment for the use of the coercive powers. These powers are not available to police in ordinary law enforcement environments; they are granted to royal commissions and are a potent weapon which can affect individuals significantly. In the case of the NCA their use was determined by an intergovernmental committee. This process was considered time consuming and cumbersome; some considered that it inhibited the work of the NCA. For the Australian Crime Commission, these powers are proposed to be extended to intelligence operations as well as investigations. This represents a fundamental shift in the use of such powers. The PJC noted a number of submissions which expressed concern about maintaining the balance between intelligence gathering and crime investigation, and the need to preserve certain civil rights. There was unease from some quarters about the invocation of a broadly defined public interest which could extend the use of coercive powers, particularly in the area of intelligence gathering, beyond what is justified by special circumstances. The PJC was concerned to ensure that there are safeguards both in the authorisation of the powers and in their use. The Australian Crime Commission Establishment Bill 2002 proposes that a 13member board-consisting of state, territory and federal police commissioners, together with the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department, the CEO of the Australian Customs Service, the Chairperson of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Director-General of Security-authorise an operation as a special operation or an investigation which would bring the coercive powers into play. The PJC considered at length a number of alternative proposals. Included was the suggestion that any authorisation by the board of a special operation should be ratified by the IGC. The IGC is made up of state and Commonwealth ministers. For urgent special operations, the PJC considered that the operation could commence pending ratification by the board. Alternatively, given the agreement between the Commonwealth, states and territories, PJC considered the possibility of further ministerial negotiations over the process. Ultimately, the PJC agreed that the major concern lay with the board's power to create committees and delegate functions to them. The PJC took the view that a committee authorising the use of coercive powers would not provide sufficient safeguard and therefore recommended that the bill be amended. Accordingly, the PJC has recommended that any decision by a committee of the board to authorise the use of coercive powers for an investigation or a special operation should be ratified by the full board. Having addressed the issue of authorisation, the PJC considered at length the process for the exercise of these powers. The position of examiner has been established to conduct ACC hearings. Under the NCA Act, these hearings were undertaken by members of the NCA. In conducting these hearings, the examiner can, amongst other things, require the production of documents and the provision of evidence with significant penalties for failure to comply. The PJC noted that there was no provision for the examiner to provide reasons for his or her determinations regarding the use of these powers. The PJC is anxious to ensure that their use is limited to those situations in which doubt as to their appropriateness has been removed. Accordingly, the PJC has recommended that the bill be amended so that examiners satisfy themselves as to the reasonableness and appropriateness of using the coercive powers. In addition, the report recommends that the examiner record in writing the grounds for forming his or her view. The PJC noted that there was no explicit requirement for the examiners to receive a full briefing on investigations prior to conducting hearings. After deliberating at length, the PJC decided not to make such a recommendation, but it does wish to emphasise that full and accurate briefings are basic to the role of the examiner in his or her exercise of the coercive powers. Related to the use of coercive powers is the broader issue of organisational accountability and performance. Many witnesses referred to the current oversighting role the PJC has in relation to the NCA. This statuthe tory duty will continue in relation to the ACC. The bill provides only technical amendments to the provisions of the NCA Act relating to the disclosure of information concerning an investigation. However, the PJC believes that access to operational information is essential for effective oversight of the ACC. It is for this reason that the report includes a recommendation which obliges the ACC to provide information when the PJC asks for it-provided, of course, that current inquiries are not prejudiced. The report also canvasses a number of other aspects of the bill, including the composition of the board. The PJC took the view that the ACC would be enhanced by representation from AUSTRAC. Part of AUSTRAC's charter is to create a financial environment hostile to money laundering, major crime and tax evasion. Given that financial matters are of immense significance to the drug trade and illegal importing, the PJC considers that the inclusion of AUSTRAC on the board would enhance the ACC's capacity for long-term success. The PJC's statutory role of monitoring and evaluating the organisation will continue under the new legislation. However, the PJC is also concerned to ensure that there is statutory review of the activities of the new organisation within a defined period. It is for this son that the PJC has recommended that such a review take place after three years have elapsed from the date of commencement of the act. The PJC were pleased that so many people gave their time to appear at hearings and provide thoughtful and detailed submissions, particularly in view of the short time available. The amendments recommended in this report have evolved from the PJC's discussions of the evidence provided to them. The PJC consider that those amendments will provide a more accountable body which will effectively discharge its role in the detection and control of organised crime in this country. In general terms, a number of recommendations were brought forward in this report and they received the unanimous support of the committee. We believe this will enhance the role of the yet to be formed Australian Crime Commission in looking at organised crime in Australia and in tracing its links internationally. The committee carried out its role effectively. I commend the members of it and also the members of the secretariat, headed by the secretary, Ms Maureen Weeks.",85
195,Mr SERCOMBE,COMMITTEES,"Madam Deputy Speaker Corcoran, given the hour and although my remarks will be brief-and I expect my colleague the member for Denison will also seek leave to make a statement-subject to your view I seek leave to make a statement immediately after the dinner suspension. Leave granted.",87
196,Unknown,COMMITTEES,Sitting suspended from 6.28 p.m. to 8.00 p.m.,87
197,Mr SERCOMBE,COMMITTEES,"I wish to follow on from the quite comprehensive speech given prior to the dinner break by the member for Cook on the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority on the Australian Crime Commission Establishment Bill 2002. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am delighted that you introduced me as the member for Maribyrnong, because I am described in the report as the member for Denison. Whilst I have great admiration and affection for my colleague, I am quite derealighted to be the member for Maribyrnong rather than the member for Denison. That error indicates the pressure that the very good secretariat was under to complete this report on time. The government gave the committee a very short time to come to grips with quite complex issues, but the committee wanted to take that challenge on board-and I think it did that reasonably successfullybecause it wanted to assist the government in its desire to have the new organisation up and running by 1 January. The committee was also cognisant of the intergovernmental agreements and the framework that has been established on an intergovernmental basis between the Commonwealth and the states and territories in relation to this. The recommendations of the committee do not necessarily reflect the deeply held views of all committee members, but they recognise that, as a matter of practical governance and practical politics, compromises need to be reached to achieve the agreed outcomes. The report goes a long way to significantly improving the outcomes within the framework that has been established between the governments. The committee came to a unanimous agreement on about 15 recommendations that go to some important areas. For example, a number of recommendations go to questions of the structure, governance and accountability of the new body. We were guided in that respect by the words of the former chairman of the NCA, Mr John Broome, who said that there was a possibility that this legislation could end up as a ‘five-legged camel' that is unmanageable, unaccountable and doomed to failure. I cannot absolutely guarantee that we have completely achieved avoidance of that horrible plight, but if the government picks up a number of our recommendations in relation to governance-and they will be debated at more length later this week during the second reading debate-I think we will have a better chance of avoiding some of those problems. The other broad area that the committee deliberated on related to the use of coercive powers. As the New South Wales Privacy Commissioner, Mr Chris Puplick, indicated in a submission to the committee: Nevertheless the exercise of such powersthat is, the coercive powerschallenges received assumptions about a right to privacy, which underlie the way our legal system operates as well as the right against selfincrimination and the presumption of innocence. There is a danger that the mere invocation of a broadly defined public interest will override legitimate interests of individuals, and that cive intelligence gathering powers once established will be extended to a wider range of ties than those where they are justified by special circumstances.  concerns that probably all committee members had to some extent. We were able to achieve a unanimous recommendation that improves at least one aspect of the operation of the coercive powers provisions of the new body, and they are extremely important and significant powers. The committee members agreed that there should be ratification by the full board, rather than simply a committee of the organisation, on when those powers were to be used. We also had agreement amongst all committee members about the way in which examiners-that is, the statutory officers created under the legislation-function. They are to give reasons in writing for their opinions on exercising special powers. Regrettably, the committee did not agree that the exercising of special powers needs to rest ultimately with the intergovernmental committee, and three committee members have put in additional recommendations on that. We believe that an organisation that is quite deliberately structured in a way which really makes it a ‘blue' organisation-in the sense that it is a police organisation; it is an organisation dominated by law enforcement interests-ought to have some political accountability associated with it when it may execute its quite extraordinary powers, its royal commission type powers. Unfortunately, there was not agreement amongst all committee members on that matter, and that has now become a matter of discussion within the parliament itself and will be the focus of a great deal of attention in the second reading debate. Overall, this is a good report, and I commend it to the House. I thank the chairman for his leadership, and I thank the committee secretariat for the work that they did in producing a quite good report under very pressing time constraints.",87
198,Mr KERR,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I join the member for Cook and the member for Maribyrnong in the remarks each has made about the work of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. these It was particularly difficult to achieve the coersubstantive report on the Australian Crime Commission Establishment Bill 2002 that we activinow bring down within the time frame and, whilst it was difficult for us, it was certainly very difficult for those who were called upon to provide testimony to us to do that task adequately. I think they were asked to put together submissions in a matter of a few days or certainly less than a couple of weeks-far less a period of time than normally would have been provided for legislation of this kind. I simply say to all of those who either presented written submissions or appeared before us in public hearings that, given the time constraints, the work that they put in is to be commended. I will add briefly to what has already been said. The rationale for the changes that have been put before this parliament has yet to be fully articulated. Underlying these changes appears to be a presupposition that the existing organisation, the National Crime Authority, has been too lawyer driven and that there have been some instances of delays, which have been occasioned by the time between the seeking and the obtaining of references. Those deficiencies, if they be the reasons for the proposals that are now before this parliament, have been addressed by the majority report and by the recommendations of the two members and one senator who have signed additional recommendations. It should be indicated that those three people-the member for Maribyrnong, Senator Denman and I-agree entirely and fully with all of the other recommendations that have been made by the committee. Whilst there was lively and vigorous debate within the committee at various times, the fact that we achieved the outcomes that we did and that we obtained the agreement that we did in the time and under the circumstances is a tribute to both the chair and the deputy chair. I thank them both for that. I will say a couple of very brief things about the additional recommendations. Until this proposal, there had been a hitherto unquestioned view that the kinds of coercive powers to be bestowed upon the Australian Crime Commission ought not be vested in any police authority. That is not a view that is unique to those who have held parliamentary office; it is a view that has been expressed on a number of occasions by those who have served previously as commissioners of the Federal Police-and, indeed, it has been expressed by the current Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Mr Mick Keelty. The additional recommendations that I have signed draw attention to two occasions in the recent past where the commissioner testified that it is inappropriate for police organisation to have conferred the special powers that have been conferred on the National Crime Authority, and that it would not be appropriate to vest those powers in a police agency. Given the fact that, in a sense, the whole thrust of this legislation is to give greater priority to the management of law enforcement through the Australian Crime Commission, if it is possible to provide parliamentary accountability through ministers directly responsible to their parliaments within the terms and framework of the agreement that has been reached with heads of state, our view is that it should be so done. The recommendations that we have proposed achieve that. They take into account those basic principles but also concede that, in circumstances of urgency, references can be given entitling the use of coercive powers by the board-which is essentially the police commissioners-but that they would require ratification within a period of 45 days thereafter. Given the time and circumstances, I draw my remarks to a close. There will be ample opportunity for more extensive debate when the bill comes before the House. NA NA (No. 1) 2002 Cognate bills: NA BILL 2002 NA (CONSEQUENTIAL AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2002 Second Reading Debate resumed from 23 October, on motion by Dr Kemp: That this bill be now read a second time.",88
199,Mr CADMAN,AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COUNCIL,"Mitchell) (8.12 p.m.)Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Price. I know that you of all the occupiers of the chair will appreciate more than most the significance of our heritage. We share a common interest in the western suburbs of Sydney and we both know of the strong inheritance that we have from the pioneers and the early settlers of that district. Tonight any we are considering a change to legislation which covers the national estate and our national heritage. Of course, this area is one that fits between what is significant to state or local authorities and what is important in a national and a world sense. Australia has a number of features which are of great significance in an international sense. The one that most people think of without any difficulty is the Great Barrier Reef. It is a unique geographical feature that is a phenomenon not matched anywhere in the world. Most people value the buildings and roadways of their suburbs that have been a feature of their district ever since the district was established. But there is a role to be played, and that role is the Commonwealth's as part of its responsibility for things that are of national importance. Over the years since its establishmentand I think it was first established in the 1970s-the concept of a national estate and some sort of national heritage process has increasingly captured the attention of Australians. In some instances, the failure of state or local authorities to value things of importance has encouraged people to apply for their registration as places of interest to the nation. In other instances there has been such overwhelming support for an idea or a concept that people have wanted to nominate a site to be of great significance. This legislation establishes a mechanism for the identification, protection and management of places of national heritage significance, and these places are going to be inscribed on the National Heritage List. The list will be comprehensive. It will consist of natural, historic and Indigenous places that are of outstanding national heritage significance. We will be looking at the register that is now established and asking, ‘What items on this register are really of national significance?' In some ways we are going to go back over old ground but we are also going to look at fresh ground. The minister is going to be advised by an expert group of people whose purpose is to advise him about the process of registration on the National Heritage List. Western Sydney is a most significant part of Australia. I will start with the environment around Mitchell and just mention in passing some of the areas that catch my attention. The member for Greenway will be aware of the Grantham Poultry Research Station. In my opinion, that is a very significant feature. It has wrapped up in it some of the most brilliant veterinarians and scientists Australia has seen, and the construction of the buildings and the grounds themselves also make it a very significant site. I believe that it was very far-sighted to place the Grantham Poultry Research Station at Seven Hills on the register. In the Penrith area we have the Museum of Fire and the Penrith Courthouse. Those are places that catch my attention as a visitor to that area. In the Parramatta region, nobody could be unfamiliar with St John's Cathedral, the All Saints Anglican Church, the buildings that were formerly the Kings School, or Burnside Homes-a magnificent group of buildings constructed by Mr Burns along Pennant Hills Road, Parramatta, leading towards Pennant Hills. They are fine buildings which have been beautifully maintained and are now being used as a school. There is also the Catholic cemetery in Church Street; the Cumberland Hospital landscape, which is itself unique; Lake Parramatta Dam; the Lancer Barracks Precinct and the Lancer Barracks themselves; and the Lennox Bridge. All these are in the western suburbs of Sydney. They are great features, crying out to be maintained and crying out to be preserved and not destroyed. In an area near where I live we have the Galston Gorge Road Bridge; Glenroy on Old Northern Road, Middle Dural; St Jude's Anglican Church; and The Pines, the famous building of the Roughley family-the outhouse, the pine trees and the whole area are just exceptional. Coming to Maroota, we have the Felton Mathew marked tree; the Indigenous place at Wiseman's Ferry and another place at Canoelands; and the Marramarra National Park in to to. Then in Castle Hill itself, there is Castle Hill House, which has been wonderfully restored. There is the Redeemer Baptist Church. The people of that church have lovingly restored what has become a feature of the district. It was an outstanding effort of dedication and showed a real valuing of the past and the pioneers. It is a beautifully restored building. We also have the Castle Hill Public School and residence on Castle Hill Road. Unfortunately, the owners of that building, QC, have not done anything with it. They have not maintained it or put it to use. I trust they will shortly make a decision. It is not in a state of disrepair but it will shortly get to be in a state of disrepair. There is also the Castle Hill Settlement Site, the so-called heritage park. It is a wonderful site-an absolutely brilliant site. For ages I have been asking the minister to encourage the Commonwealth, through its heritage trust grants, to do something towards interpretation of that site through archaeological digs and to have interpretative displays to really explain to the community what is a completely open site. As far as I can determine, it was the third site of establishment in Australia. First of all there was Sydney, then Parramatta and then Castle Hill with a convict settlement. The remains of that settlement have been identified in a cursory way and further detail of that site is needed. It would be a wonderful opportunity for young people and schools to have a look at an archaeological dig and to work out what was on that site right from the beginning of the colony. To my knowledge, it is the only area that has been untouched since the beginning, and it is still there in open fields and paddocks. Crops have been grown on the site but the site is there. With modern technology, the roadways, the wells, the buildings and the foundations can be established and what was actually there can be demonstrated at what is called ‘heritage park'-the Castle Hill Settlement Site on Old Castle Hill Road, Castle Hill. We also have Elwatan on Castle Hill Road, the former St Paul's Anglican Church-a beautiful sandstone building in the centre of Castle Hill-and the Old Parsonage, which sits just opposite. All of these are part of our wonderful heritage that we should value and preserve. The Commonwealth government is, with this legislation, improving the way in which it protects our heritage. These three bills which have been introduced into the parliament, the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, the Australian Heritage Council Bill 2002 and the Australian Heritage Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2002, identify, conserve and protect places of national heritage significance. We need to understand that the new heritage regime will operate through a list of places of national heritage significance. A new Commonwealth heritage list will be established which will list the pre-eminent and elite sites-the sites that are truly and absolutely of great significance-and an independent expert body, the Australian Heritage Council, will be created to advise the minister on the listing and protection of heritage places. This is all good stuff. In my view, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Dr Kemp, with his intellectual strength and determination, is just the guy to make it work well. Regarding the future of this legislation, I know the Australian Labor Party are supporting it, and I am pleased about that. It was, I believe, Tom Uren who established the concept of the national estate and what we should have as Australian heritage. After the passage of some 20-odd years, this current government is now looking at that again. For good reason but without properly understanding the value of buildings or natural sites, we have perhaps included things on the list which would be better on other lists. Perhaps we would be better gathering from other lists things that should be on the national estate list. So this list of Australian heritage, the Commonwealth Heritage List, needs to be cleansed, in a way, and brought up to date and reappraised. This legislation focuses, as did the original legislation, on the Commonwealth's responsibility regarding places of national importance and heritage areas owned or leased by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth's own responsibility is to look after those things for which it has responsibility. A Commonwealth listing of its own properties is pretty important in making sure that we act responsibly as the Commonwealth government and give a lead to some of those governments that at times really do not appear to value the same sorts of things that we value from a federal perspective. Heritage places will be protected consistent with the Commonwealth's constitutional powers. That means we cannot override the states; if they want to bulldoze something, they will do it. We just need to be active to make sure that that does not happen. If they want to destroy something that is of value, constitutionally we will not be able to stop them with this legislation; they will still be able to go ahead. But with our list we ought to be able to prevent those acts of degradation occurring at those places that are-and I quote the words-‘of national heritage significance'. What this legislation does is seek to lock in for permanent preservation those areas which are of particular significance to the Commonwealth and for which the Commonwealth has a responsibility. The legislation requires the minister to ensure that there are approved management plans listed for places owned by the Commonwealth, so that the Commonwealth does not just sit back and say, ‘We've got a fabulous building and it is historic,' when in 10 years time, when it actually decays, it will past restoration. We have to put in place a management plan that will set out how to protect the heritage values of a place. The government will provide technical and financial assistance to the people who are the owners of such places and from whom we lease buildings. The minister will be required to report to the parliament on the state of the National Heritage List. The report is required to include the number of places on the list, their values and any threats to them; the progress of the preparation of management plans; changes in tenure; allocated resources; and, where applicable, the operation of any accredited management arrangements. In that way, each one of us can be sure that when something is listed it goes beyond just merely recording something on a list in a computer database somewhere or other; there has to be an active plan of the way in which that site is going to be managed. We have not had that before, and I think that is a great innovation. I congratulate the minister for being proactive in this area. We need, first all, to make sure that buildings are properly looked after. As well, where we are talking about the built environment, the buildings need to be used. In other areas, where it is not the built but the natural environment that we are seeking to preserve, we need to know what the impending threats to such sites are. The monitoring and reporting process which is required under this legislation will ensure that every member of parliament and every member of the Australian Commonwealth, every individual living within Australia, will be able to access those plans for themselves. No doubt they will be on web sites as well so that people will be able to find out for themselves precisely what the Commonwealth intends to do regarding those places that are registered on the Commonwealth Heritage List or those that are part of the National Heritage List-the places of significance. The Commonwealth agencies that own or lease places will be required to assist the minister and the Australian Heritage Council to identify and assess the value of places. They will not be able to sit down as we have seen in the past and bulldoze a post office to be build some sort of fake building which, although it may be more convenient to operate as a postal service, has led to the destruction of a heritage building in the process. The owners of those buildings will not be able to do that any longer. The legislation will prevent them from doing that. The bill provides a nomination, assessment and listing process. Protection is there. The establishment of the Australian Heritage Council will bring consistency. In New South Wales we have the New South Wales Heritage Council, and the Australian Heritage Council will replace the Australian Heritage Commission; I like the consistency of that. I think that the new title is more consistent with the status of what is now being established. It describes its advisory role as the Commonwealth's expert advisory body on heritage. The council will be independent and expert and it will help the minister in the identification, conservation and protection of places on the National Heritage List and on the Commonwealth Heritage List. It will include experts in the fields of natural, Inof digenous and historic heritage, as I have already said, and it will also be responsible for keeping the register. I think this is good legislation, but I will be keeping an eye on where things are registered. I will look out for my area, as I hope every member will for their own area, to make sure that those buildings and sites which are of significance to them and to the people of their electorates are properly acknowledged by the Australian Heritage Council. I hope they will make sure that the nominations go forward and, if rejected, that they will fight to keep them on the list. Whether the nominations are on the major list or on the subset list of places of signifiEnvironment cance, I expect this parliament to be active, to make sure that, despite some of the activities of state or local authorities, we are able to preserve buildings, natural forms and the Indigenous inheritance that is so much the heart and soul of this nation. I do not look to the past for direction for the future but, unless we really understand what those before us have contributed to the building of this nation, we will not truly value the future we are putting together.",89
200,Mr MOSSFIELD,AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COUNCIL,"I rise to speak on the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, the Australian Heritage Council Bill 2002 and the Australian Heritage Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2002. These bills were originally introduced in 2000 under a different title. Debate was delayed and they lapsed as a result of the election. They have now been reintroduced and finally debated in this place. The bills have been slightly amended since they were first introduced, to take account of some of the concerns of the Senate reference committee which inquired into the operation of the bills, but fundamentally they remain the same. These bills, in effect, completely rewrite our heritage regime, which was first introduced by the Whitlam government in 1975. When the Australian Heritage Commission Act was first passed by the parliament in that year, it was recognised as world's best practice in heritage legislation. Like many things in our rapidly changing society, however, the act and the regime that underpins it need to be renewed and strengthened from time to time-strengthened, not weakened-and that lies at the heart of the problem Labor has with these bills. These bills seek to water down and weaken the heritage regime, and Labor sees this as a backward step in our community's progress. The Australian Heritage Commission Act will be repealed by this legislation, and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act will be amended to become the main act dealing with Commonwealth heritage protection. There are many questions and concerns about whether the Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act is the right framework for these changes; many would say not. By attempting to integrate heritage protection into the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, many of the important aspects of the unique requirements of heritage protection are neglected or simply omitted. There is also major concern over the decision to abolish the Australian Heritage Commission, which is a statutory authority independent of government, and replace it with a ministerial advisory council. At present there is a requirement that the chair and not less than half of the commission must not be Commonwealth officers. The provisions of these bills remove such a requirement. The final decision as to whether an item will be listed or not will, if these bills are passed unamended, rest with the minister and not with the independent commission. Under these bills, if a person nominates an item to be listed, the minister can reject it out of hand or he or she can ask the council for advice as to whether it should be listed. After that advice is given, the minister has the power to completely ignore the advice from the council and reject the nomination out of hand. Many of the functions that the commission currently undertakes will be exercisable only upon the recommendation of the minister. As the Bills Digest says: This implies that the new Council will have considerably less freedom of independent action and initiative than the Australian Heritage Commission ... The potential for politicisation or, at the very least, the appearance of politicisation of the heritage regime is enormous. Australia is in a unique position when it comes to heritage. We have one of the oldest cultures on the face of the planet, with our Indigenous heritage stretching back at least 40,000 years. However, Western settlement occurred only 214 years ago. We do not have ancient castles or churches that have stood for many hundreds of years. Our oldest continually licensed pub, for example-the Surveyor General Inn at Berrima-is only 168 years old. In the Greenway electorate, the Royal Cricketers Arms Inn has been there since 1881-121 years. When we compare that to something like Kyteler's Inn in Kilkenny, in Ireland, which has been a pub continuously since 1324-or for 678 years-we see there is no real comparison to be made. Ours is a young culture. In many respects, though, that is precisely why we must have in place strong protection and heritage laws; otherwise, pubs will not get to be 678 years old and counting. To give the House an example of the extent to which developers will go to get around their heritage responsibility, I want refer to the demise of a well-known landmark in my electorate, the Robin Hood Inn, which I know you, Mr Deputy Speaker Price, would know-in a professional capacity, of course, not social-as you were previously a member of the Blacktown City Council. I think we agree that the demise of this great establishment happened sometime in the 1980s. The situation was that the Robin Hood Inn, as I said, was a well-known Blacktown drinking house and landmark. It was situated within a stone's throw of Blacktown railway station and was a convenient drinking house for both locals and the travelling public. The country train stopped at Blacktown station for a short period of time, allowing travellers to cross the road and have a quick drink before continuing on their journey. One Saturday nightwe believe sometime in the 1980s-the patrons were cleared out of the inn at closing time. A high wall was erected around the inn and the inn was demolished overnight.",93
201,Mr CADMAN,AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COUNCIL,I want to hear the story.,94
202,Mr MOSSFIELD,AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COUNCIL,"Maybe the member for Mitchell knows more about this than you or I, Mr Deputy Speaker.",94
203,Mr CADMAN,AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COUNCIL,"No. I am interested in the story, though.",94
204,Mr MOSSFIELD,AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COUNCIL,"I do not know; he might be able to help us with that. The fact that the patrons were cleared out, as I said, but we do not know what happened to any boarders-I certainly hope they were cleared out also. The inn was demolished overnight. A number of local drinkers arrived on the site at about 10 o'clock on the Monday morning, only to find, to their disappointment, that the inn no longer existed. Of course the question that we ask is: why the haste? Why was it done so quickly and why was it done so secretly? That is a little bit of Blacktown folklore. It is not just drinking places that need protection; it is all sorts of places. In my electorate of Greenway, there are many and varied heritage sites. Sites of local significance include the Battle of Vinegar Hill memorial site, the Glenwood Park Dairy, the Hebe Farm, the Masonic Hall at Riverstone, to the Meadows Public School in Seven Hills, St Andrew's Uniting Church in Marsden Park and St Anthony's Catholic Church in Kings Park. There are some 17 cottages, houses, farmhouses and the like scattered around the electorate that represent and preserve our local history. Of state significance are St Andrew's Anglican Church and rectory at Seven Hills, the Seven Hills Railway Station group and the rail underbridge, the Riverstone Railway Station and Rouse Hill House. There are seven sites on the national register in the electorate of Greenway. Three sites have the legal status of registered as well as the administrative status of registered-they have gone through the entire process. The first is the Grantham Poultry Research Station, which the member for Mitchell has already referred to; the second is a section of the Old Windsor Road; and the third, which is just on the border with the electorate of Mitchell, is Rouse Hill House, including stables and outbuildings. The other four places on the register are termed indicative places, which means that their details have been entered into the database and information has been collected but no final decision has been made. These places include the old boiler house in Blacktown, the Plumpton Ridge Aboriginal site, Schofields Aerodrome and the Second Pond Creek open is site, which is also of Indigenous significance. Unfortunately, when Blacktown Hospital was redeveloped over the last few years, the boiler room and its contents were destroyed after extensive efforts to find a new home for the equipment failed. One might ask why something like a chicken farm is heritage listed, but the Grantham Poultry Research Station is more than just a chicken farm. The scientific research undertaken on that property, particularly research into manganese and vitamin deficiencies in food and their effects on hatchability, effectively saved the poultry industry from ruin and brought international acclaim, establishing the estate as one of the six leading poultry research stations in the world. I will speak about why the poultry research station is protected. After the First World War, the station was used for a soldier settlement scheme, providing a home and a new start for many injured and maimed soldiers returning home after that terrible war. The site also contains a significant remnant tract of Cumberland Plain bushland, which is an endangered species around Western Sydney. As you can see, there are many reasons why a single site should be protected and why a local chicken farm is deserving of preservation. Another local site of some significance is the Vinegar Hill memorial site. Australia has had a relatively peaceful history, with armed uprisings being relatively few. The first, however, occurred in what is today known as Rouse Hill, in the electorate of Greenway. On 5 March 1804, some 200 mainly Irish convicts, led by Phillip Cunningham, rose against the authorities in Australia's first bellion, in what became known as the Battle of Vinegar Hill. It was crushed quickly before convict reinforcements from Toongabbie or Hawkesbury could arrive. The cry of ‘death or liberty' only resulted in the former for the ringleaders, while between 200 and 500 lashes were handed out to the other convicts involved. Each year sees a re-enactment of the battle on the original site. While grisly in its origin, it is nevertheless part of our history and should be protected. In fact, I attended the re-enactment of the event around Christmas last year and enjoyed the occasion very much. Another local icon is St Bartholomew's Church, which was commissioned by William Lawson, one of the three men who were the first to cross the Blue Mountains. St Bartholomew's was built in 1841 and operated until 1967, when increased vandalism forced its closure. In 1972, Blacktown council obtained the site and set up the St Bartholomew's Prospect Preservation Committee. The committee raised funds-holding various events each year-held numerous working bees and received some government funding, including a Centenary of Federation grant, which was very much appreciated. Finally, on 21 February 2001, after many years of hard work by local residents, the restored church was reopened to the public. St Bartholomew's stands adjacent to the M4 motorway and forms one of the gateways to Blacktown city-and indeed a gateway to the electorate of Greenway. The small graveyard attached to the church is the resting place for William Lawson, one of the great pioneers of early Australian exploration. This is a historically significant site that could have been lost through neglect but was saved and restored to its former glory. It now stands as a great testament to the hard work and dedication of the local community. The heritage listing of Schofields Aerodrome is of particular concern. While its final status has yet to be determined, the Department of Defence, which owns the site, has placed it on the list of Defence sites to be sold off. I ask you: how can you sell off a property whose heritage status is yet to be determined? Can you not see the potential refor a conflict of interest if the final decision as to whether to list a property is left solely in the hands of the government of the day?",94
205,Mr CADMAN,AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COUNCIL,They sold Nirimba.,95
206,Mr MOSSFIELD,AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COUNCIL,"The member for Mitchell will probably concede this point too-in privacy, no doubt. The government wants to flog Schofields Aerodrome, and the government makes the decision on whether it gets listed as a heritage site. It is not hard to see which way the heritage listing decision will go, given these circumstances. Some will say that the government can sell the site and still place restrictions on its use due to its heritage value. But who is going to buy a site they cannot use fully? Placing restrictions on the use of the land will automatically drop the price that the government will get for the land. If you can only build 500 houses, not 5,000 houses, then why would you pay full price? This government likes to get full price. What would happen in a situation where the land is sold subject to restriction, the property is bulldozed and built on, and then the final assessment is made placing a high value on the recently bulldozed portion? It would be a bit too late to be able to do anything about it, and our future would be the poorer for it. There is also the problem of who decides exactly what restrictions or covenants are placed on a property before the sale. So the argument that the property can be sold off before its final heritage value has been determined is, quite frankly, nonsense, even when some restrictions are made. This is why the final decision as to heritage listing must be put in the hands of a body that is independent of government and that has no consideration to make beyond whether the site is of heritage value. When you politicise the process, you naturally leave yourself open to accusations of conflict of interest. Not only must the process be independent but it must also be seen to be independent, and this legislation fails-miserably, I am afraid-on both counts. I represent the electorate of Greenway, which was named after Francis Greenway, a man with a very interesting history. He was born near Bristol in 1777, and he was convicted of forgery in 1812. He was sentenced to death, but the sentence was commuted to transportation for 14 years to New South Wales. When Greenway arrived in the colony in February 1814, he was given a ticketof-leave almost immediately. In March 1816, Governor Macquarie appointed him to the position of civil architect and assistant engineer on a salary of three shillings a day. Greenway was Australia's most influential early architect. He adapted his designs to suit the local conditions, and so he created buildings with an Australian flavour. He was the first to do so, and quite rightly he is membered in our history. Along with Henry Lawson, Greenway was featured on the original paper $10 note, and he has a federal electorate named in his honour. For an architect, his name is extremely well known and his life is celebrated. I wonder if members would know how many buildings he designed before his death in Maitland in 1837 or how many are still standing. Greenway designed over 40 buildings, shaping the part of look of Sydney and surrounds. But how many are still standing? This is the most influential and well known architect in Australia's history. Of his 40-plus buildings, only 11 remain-and every one of those 11 has been altered in some shape or form. We have nothing left that is wholly original from our most influential architect. Certainly, 11 still stand, including St Matthew's Anglican Church in Windsor, St James' Church in Queen's Square in Sydney, the Hyde Park Barracks and St Luke's at Liverpool, but they have all been altered to some degree over the years. And that is because our heritage regime was non-existent or simply not strong enough at the time. So much of our history and heritage has already been lost, which is why we need a strong and independent heritage regime. Obviously not every building can or should be protected. If the old tram depot on Bennelong Point had been preserved and protected, we would not have the Opera House. It is a difficult balancing act between preserving our history and building our future. Nobody denies that, but this is precisely why we need strong legislation in place. The amendments that will be moved by Labor help to maintain this balance. They keep the commission in place as an independent body. They preserve the positive aspects of those bills that improve the system. I urge the government to consider the amendments on their merit, because they have merit, and not to try to play politics with this very important issue. This is an area where we can have bipartisan support but, as it stands, if the bill is not amended, I am afraid Labor cannot support it.",95
207,Ms JULIE BISHOP,AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COUNCIL,"The coalition government has a re- proven track record when it comes to the protection of Australia's valuable natural, historic, cultural and Indigenous heritage. It is, after all, a government that has provided $10.5 million over three years for heritage conservation projects under the rubric of the Cultural Heritage Projects Program. Likewise, the government has allocated $5 million for the restoration of historic pubs in regional Australia. The Howard government has, through the federal fund, the Federation and Cultural Heritage Projects program and the Conservation of Heritage Projects Program, provided more funds for the protection of heritage than any other government in Australia's history. But the protection of heritage means more than simply the writing of cheques, and the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, the Australian Heritage Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2002 and the Australian Heritage Council Bill 2002 before this House tonight testify to the commitment of the government to the structural reform of Australian regulatory practice as it relates to places of great heritage value. The reforms contained in this package of bills before the parliament are based on the national consensus reached by the 1997 Council of Australian Governments meeting. COAG agreed to the evaluation of the appropriate responsibilities and roles for the federal and state governments of Australia. Most pertinently, COAG decided that the focus of the federal government, in terms of heritage protection, ought to be on places of national significance. This is a most reasonable proposition in a federal polity. The great value of federalism is that it decentralises power and decision making to allow for policies that best reflect local interests. At the national level, the Commonwealth has an obvious role to play in safeguarding heritage, the value of which crosses state lines and transcends the parochial. Following COAG in 1997, the federal government undertook a long and productive process of community consultation, including the National Heritage Convention held in 1998. That consultation identified a number of deficiencies in the present heritage protection structure. At present, the 27-year-old Australian Heritage Commission Act does not offer adequate protection to places of national heritage significance. Its procedural deficiencies and overreliance on indirect triggers mean it is incapable of ensuring that heritage valued by all Australians is protected and fostered. These reforms address those deficiencies and will provide, in place of the Australian Heritage Commission, an expert advisory body called the Australian Heritage Council. The council will consist of a chair and six other members, and its members will be experts drawn from relevant fields-for example, the environment, history, Indigenous studies and the like. The National Heritage List will also be established. This will comprise places of outstanding national heritage significance, whether that significance is cultural, historic or natural. Such places will also be protected by an improved management system to ensure best practice standards are maintained. I note with particular approval the reference by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage in his second reading speech on the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 to the possible inclusion on the National Heritage List of places identified with Australian industry. We often think of Indigenous heritage, sporting heritage, natural heritage or artistic heritage, but it is equally valid to recognise our industrial heritage, such as mining places, pastoral places or industrial places. These are sites that have given to our society work, wealth, and material and collective identity. I think this aspect will be appreciated by representatives from both sides of this House. It does have widespread ramifications. Just think of the preservation of heritage sites in terms of the tourism industry and the enhancement that such preserved sites can bring to tourism in this country. I would like to see a number of places in Western Australia considered for assessment. I take as an example the heritage precinct of Perth. This comprises a number of the earliest buildings of the Swan River Colony. The heritage precinct is the area around the intersection of Barrack Street and St George's Terrace, around Stirling Gardens. It includes the original Supreme Courthouse, a tiny little house at the bottom of Stirling Gardens, built with bricks made by convict labour. Government House is also in Stirling Gardens. It was also built by convict labour and is a superb example of early colonial architecture. There is the Treasury building across the road on St George's Terrace and the magnificent St George's Cathedral, which is one of the most gracious and yet simply adorned cathedrals that I have ever seen. The Town Hall is also in this area. It is a delightful building made of bricks of clay from a clay pit just down the road which is now Queens Gardens in the city. All of these buildings surround the place where the Swan River Colony was founded. This is where Mrs Dance cut down a tree to mark the foundation of the colony in 1829. As the story goes, Captain Dance-who was the captain of HMAS Sulphur-was meant to take the longboat from the coast up the river to found the colony but he got sick with a cold that day and so he had to send his wife along instead. Back on that day in August 1829 Mrs Dance got into the longboat and went up to the place where the Swan River Colony was founded and cut down a tree. Trust the women to finish the job. We are not just concerned about places within Australia. As the minister noted to the House, this recognition might include places of national significance such as Lone Pine on the Gallipoli peninsula-the rocky outcrop thousands of kilometres away that symbolises the heart of our nation-the Kokoda Trail in Papua New Guinea or even Australia House in London. The reforms provide for the assessment by the Australian Heritage Council of nominations, the listing of which will then be subject to the approval of the federal minister. A management plan will then be developed for each place added to the National Heritage List. I should note in this regard that the Register of the National Estate, which presently has about 13,000 recorded entries, will be retained as a useful source of information for the promotion of heritage protection. Information on the register will also be considered in the context of actions taken under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Places listed under the National Heritage List, the Register of the National Estate and the respective lists held by the state and territory governments will be accessible to the public by way of the Australian Heritage Places Inventory database. I think this is a terrific idea: an efficient, coordinated resource for heritage places throughout Australia providing all the convenience of a one-stop shop. The benefits of the reforms to Australian little heritage laws are considerable. There will now be a greater certainty in terms of the respective roles to be played in heritage protection by the states and by the Commonwealth. This will be an advantage not only to the governments concerned but to citizens, who will now be better able to identify the responsible level of government and bring to the appropriate representatives their concerns, wishes, hopes, dreams and aspirations in relation to places of national significance in this country. This simplified and clarified system will also benefit industry, which will be better able to navigate through the murky world of development approval. An increased use of voluntary conservation agreements will allow for a more flexible approach to the conservation of heritage places located on private land. I commend this package of bills to the House. Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR (Corio) (8.59 p.m.)-The Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, the Australian Heritage Council Bill 2002 and the Australian Heritage Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2002 represent the latest attempt by the Howard government to water down the Commonwealth's involvement in the protection of Australia's rich cultural and environmental heritage. This is not the government's first attempt at lessening the protection currently afforded to these assets. The heritage bills were first introduced into the Senate in December 2000 and were debated in that chamber in August 2001. They were never brought to this House for debate because of the deficiencies in the legislation. The Liberal and National parties have a long and unfortunate record in sponsoring or defending private interests which seek to destroy or compromise our environmental and cultural heritage, so I guess it is not surprising that the Howard government has introduced this insipid package of legislation into this House. Australia is a young nation and, in an increasingly global environment, it is often difficult for ordinary citizens to retain a sense of their own history, culture and identity. Our young people are bombarded on a daily basis with ideas, cultural mores, styles of dress and language from other societies with enormous propaganda resources to project into other communities not only the best of their own culture but the very worse. One means whereby nations that possess unique cultural characteristics can preserve and enhance their cultures in the face of this onslaught is to pay careful attention to the preservation of their cultural, historical and environmental heritage and to encourage their citizens to understand and take pride in that heritage. Here in Australia we have not been all successful in that regard. In my own electorate of Corio, based on Victoria's premier provincial city of Geelong, local governments and the community in the past have not done nearly enough to preserve the cultural heritage of the city-a source of considerable regret to many people older than I am who have witnessed the destruction of that heritage in recent decades. Fortunately, Labor governments in power have done much in my own area to preserve the city's environmental and cultural heritage for generations to come. It was Labor in partnership with the then City of Geelong that commenced the refurbishment of the eastern beach area of the city and the public bathing area that is now so popular with residents in the summertime. It passed the old Commonwealth Customs House to the City of Geelong to enable the local community to preserve this asset. I note the recent proposal by the Wathaurong Aboriginal Cooperative to use the building for purpose, in particular the retailing of Wathaurong glass to the wider tourist community. Labor in government is very proud of the role it played in Geelong in the refurbishment of the Deakin Woolstores campus, turning the old Dennys Lascelles Woolstore into a student campus and providing a worldclass auditorium for showcasing local and international talent. Madam Deputy Speaker Gambaro, I know that you are a child of the sixties-perhaps a child of the seventies-so you would have an appreciation of the former Little River Band. Of course, they cannot go under that name any more. Glenn Shorrock, along with Beeb Birtles and Graham Goble, formed that great vocal trio in the Little River Band, who will be appearing in Geelong on Friday night in a very important cultural asset to the city, the Deakin Woolstores campus. There are other examples of Labor's involvement in the restoration and protection of not only the built environment in the Geelong area but also the physical environment. Last night on SBS I watched, along with many members, the interview with Gough Whitlam. In those golden Labor years from that 1972 to 1975, Australia awoke from the stupor that it had fallen into under 23 years of Liberal rule. One of the great pieces of legislation that was passed by that government was the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975, which, as former members have intimated, set the framework for world's best practice in Australia and elsewhere in the protection of environmental and cultural assets. It was a source of great pride to watch that program and know that many assets that would have been destroyed if the Liberal and National parties had continued in office are now part of Australia's rich cultural and environmental heritage. That is why I am appalled at this Howard government legislation. It reduces the current protection afforded to our cultural and environmental heritage in my own area and right across Australia. The limitations of this legislation in protecting our cultural and environmental heritage have been widely canvassed and I note its the continued opposition of the Australian Conservation Foundation and a group of former chairs of the Australian Heritage Commission to the legislation as it is being proposed by the government, particularly concerning the powers of the minister to finally list. This is regarded as a thinly veiled attempt by the government to politicise the listing process in the whole area of heritage protection. I do not propose to outline all the major areas of concern by the opposition to this legislation as some of those have already been canvassed by previous speakers on this side, and they will be canvassed by successive speakers from the opposition in this debate. However, there is one substantial area of the legislation which is of particular concern to me, and that is the fate of the 13,000 places currently on the Register of the National Estate and, in particular, the many sites in the Geelong area that are currently on the register. In this legislation the government seeks to replace the Heritage Commission, which currently operates with a broad range of functions, with the Heritage Council, which will operate purely as an advisory body under ministerial direction. The Register of the National Estate will be replaced by the National Heritage List, which will create a limited list of places of national heritage signifiquoting cance. The government will also create the Commonwealth Heritage List of Commonwealth owned places of heritage significance-once again, a smaller, restricted list. The question that has to be answered is: what protection will be afforded those assets in the Geelong area and elsewhere that are currently on the Register of the National Estate but that will not make it onto the new National Heritage List or the Commonwealth Heritage List? In the Geelong area there are a variety of churches, hotels and public and private buildings that are currently on the Register of the National Estate. For example, as far as churches go, there is St Paul's Anglican Church, St Peter and Paul's Catholic Church in Mercer Street, St George's Presbyterian Church and manse, Christ Church, St John's Lutheran Church and the Church of Christ. Will these buildings that are very precious to Geelong's cultural heritage be listed on the new registers that are being set up by the government under this legislation? There are the beautiful old hotels in Geelong that are currently listed on the Register of the National Estate. I refer to the Golden Age, the Bayview Hotel, the Geelong Wool Exchange and Terminus Hotel. There are other buildings and houses, such as Corio Villa, the Dennys Lascelles Woolstore I referred to earlier, the Geelong Army Drill Hall, the Geelong Customs House, the Geelong Town Hall itself, Lunan House in Drumcondra and Wimmera House. There are others on this particular list, and I want to refer to one in detail, Osborne House, in a moment. The Commonwealth register currently provides some measure of protection, which will be removed if this legislation is passed, for many of these sites that have been listed on the national heritage register. Osborne House is the subject of considerable community debate at this time. It was built in 1857 for the squatter Robert Muirhead. This large, historic bluestone building occupies a truly magnificent site overlooking Corio Bay. I am indebted to the Osborne Park Association, which is endeavouring to keep this facility in public hands for use for community purposes, for the material I am from. Osborne House is very significant to Geelong's pastoral, naval, maritime, social and civic history. It was the home of Australia's first naval training college from 1913 to 1915, a submarine base during the 1920s and an army training base during World War II. It was a military hospital in World War I, and back in 1900 it was the state Premier's country retreat. The Osborne Park Association has developed a unique proposal to create a heritage park and tourist facility at Osborne House and its stables that will showcase the early history of Victoria's largest provincial city, Geelong. It is a very interesting proposal. On 17 November there will be an open day at Osborne House and I urge all interested citizens in the city of Geelong to go along. The open day will see the arrival of the sailing ship Enterprize-the dignitaries and the mayor will sail over from Cunningham Pier to the Osborne House area. The Trailable Yacht Club will stage races at 10 a.m. and 1.30 p.m. The Wathaurong people will welcome to their traditional land everyone who attends the function. The Naval Reserve cadets will perform a fife and drum routine, and the Geelong Maritime Museum will be open to the public free of charge for the afternoon. There will be a wide range of activities on that day for the community to enjoy, and they will hear about the unique proposal to create a heritage park and tourist facility at Osborne House. We know that during the Kennett era and the era of the commissars in Geelong-the commissioners who were appointed when local government was abolished in Victoria-Osborne House was under threat of sale. It is a unique historical and cultural set, not only to Geelong but to the state of Victoria, however, it has been under threat, most recently when the Kennett government was in power. I pay tribute to the Osborne Park Association for the magnificent effort they have put into preserve Osborne House in public hands to be used for community purposes. I pay particular tribute to the former mayor of the City of Greater Geelong, Gerry Smith, to Cheryl Scott, Peter O'Brien and to others on that Osborne House committee who have laboured long and hard to persuade the City of Greater Geelong and its officers to take a keen interest and to ensure that it serves the people of Geelong and Victoria in future generations. They have faced enormous obstacles in this task: obstacles within the City of Greater Geelong, and apathy from councils and former mayors. Of course, if the public of Geelong do not get behind this particular proposal it may well wither on the vine and we may well see this very important community asset sold to private entrepreneurs for use as a restaurant or for some other facility on the site. The question is: will Osborne House wither under this legislation that is now before the House? I suggest that it would have little protection in any sense if this legislation were to proceed. That is the fate of many of the sites that are on the Register of the National Estate under the current legislation. Most of those listings will not be there under this new legislation being proposed by the coalition government. Labor have many concerns with this bill. I have mentioned the downgrading of the Australian Heritage Commission to an advisory council. We have concerns about the watering down of the definition of ‘action' on the part of the Commonwealth, and we will be proposing amendments to reinstate the definition of ‘action' to that which applies under the current legislation. We are proposing amendments to the preparation of management plans and heritage strategies under this legislation. We have concerns about interim arrangements for heritage protection of listed sites. We are going to propose to add all Commonwealth places on the Register of the as- National Estate to the Commonwealth Heritage List. We are also concerned about the protection of places or values. Labor support protection of a heritage place and its associated values, not just the values as proposed under this legislation. In conclusion, let me say once again that it always falls to Labor to protect the public interest in these matters. The Liberal and National parties have historically watered down, have attempted to water down or have opposed legislation that would give the Commonwealth power to protect the cultural and heritage assets of the nation. I wonder in this facility why this is so. Mr Hunt interjecting Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR-The honourable member is new to the House. He might be a gun footballer in the media scrums and the media games that we participate in, but he was probably only a little whippersnapper back in the 1970s when we saw the party to which he now belongs hell-bent on destroying Australia's environmental heritage down in the Gordon below Franklin in Tasmania. Once again it was the Labor Party that stepped into the breach-opposed all the way by the Liberal and National partiesthat preserved that wilderness area for all time for all Australians. That is why we are proud of what occurred in the years 1972 to 1975-because Labor set a framework. Labor set the standard that you are now trying to water down to your eternal shame. We will be proposing amendments to make sure that this legislation is up to standard and is not being watered down. We will see how the government handles these amendments. There are always actions that can be taken in another place to ensure that this government does the right thing and does not water down this very important legislation designed to protect Australia's cultural and environmental heritage.",96
208,Mr HUNT,AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COUNCIL,"I am delighted to speak on the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, the Australian Heritage Council Bill 2002 and the Australian Heritage Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2002. These bills form a package which is aimed at preserving the most significant places within Australia in the environmental and heritage sphere. They represent a significant step forward for the protection of those places which represent our heritage, our environment and the very values which give us a sense of place, purpose, position and meaning. I am proud to speak on these bills. They represent a watershed in heritage protection. I want to speak on five aspects: core environmental and heritage issues within my own seat of Flinders; second, the government's proud record on the environment and heritage; third, the current heritage regime and some of the challenges which necessitate these changes; fourth, the provisions of the bills themselves; and finally, the benefits which flow from these actions. Turning first to the question of environmental and heritage issues in my own seat of Flinders, only last week 22 Envirofund projects were announced in the successor to the Natural Heritage Trust. This meant that projects such as Warrangine Park in Bittern and Hastings, the Balcombe Estuary in Mount Martha, preservation of the foreshore at Kilcunda, and preservation and restoration of the foreshore at Cannons Creek are all now being offered an opportunity to advance, succeed and proceed where none existed before. The Envirofund offers a chance which simply has not existed in Australian history for the government to support the work of community organisations in protecting and promoting heritage and environmental values. The second issue within my electorate of Flinders is the restoration of the natural order at Gunnamatta beach. The Boags Rocks outfall is one of Victoria's disgraces. Four hundred and twenty million litres of water proceed from the Carrum Downs treatment plant, underneath the Mornington Peninsula, and exit at Boags Rocks. There they create a toxic environmental plume and the result is a danger to health, extraordinary damage to the environment and a manifest waste of water. Only last week the Clean Ocean Foundation presented Melbourne Water with Victoria's Don't be a Wally with Water award for the year 2002. What needs to be done there is for concrete steps to be taken towards cleaning up the quality of the water and, ultimately, the cessation of the outfall, which should be twinned with a national policy to end all ocean outfalls by the year 2025. The third of the environmental issues within my electorate of Flinders, one which I consider very salient, is the future of Point Nepean. Point Nepean is an area of great national, historical and heritage beauty. It first, was offered free of charge to the Bracks Victorian government by the Commonwealth government this year. In addition, in 2001 the Commonwealth government, under the Federation Fund, gave $4 million towards the restoration of the grand buildings within Point Nepean. What was the state government's response? The state government's response was to say, ‘No. Thank you for the offer, but we won't accept it. Instead, in order to take land, we want $35 million given to us.' What an extraordinary action which puts at risk the future of that area. That responsibility rests solely and squarely with the Bracks government, which has refused to accept an extraordinarily generous offer. We will resolve this issue irrespective of the state government, which made itself irrelevant to the final solution leading to no housing, no preservation of the bush and no constructive use of the buildings. I now want to turn to the government's broader record on the environment and heritage. There have been many profound initiatives since 1996. Perhaps first and most important is the over $2½ billion spent on the Natural Heritage Trust. The provision of money for this initiative was opposed by Labor when they opposed the sale of Telstra. They simply would not allow the greatest bonanza that we have ever had for environment and heritage in Australia to occur. My own electorate of Flinders, one of 150 electorates, saw 22 community projects funded during last week alone. There was also the extension of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park by 4,830 square kilometres, $10½ million provided over three years for conservation projects under the Cultural Heritage Projects Program and $5 million allocated for the restoration of historic pubs in regional Australia. No doubt the member for Corio will take us through a tour of them, as he did in his speech on the pubs of Geelong. But, going forward, what is it that the government will do? Firstly, it will increase the level of Natural Heritage Trust community grants, designed to support environmental conservation projects. That is a tremendous opportunity for small communities in every corner of Australia to work-and it will require work, because this is not an easy thing-to clean up and restore areas of beauty which would never have been possible without the Natural Heritage Trust and its successor, Envirofund. Secondly, the government will push for World Heritage assessment for the Opera House, for the Melbourne exhibition buildings and for a range of convict sites around Australia. That World Heritage listing is something which is conceived within this legislation as being at the apex of the whole process of environmental and conservation protection. The provisions in this legislation will fulfil the government's promises made in its 2001 election policy in the Measures for a Better Environment package. The core of that was the promise of protecting the existing Register of the National Estate. Contrary to the assertions made by the member for Corio, the Register of the National Estate exists and will continue to be recognised for the purposes of public education and the promotion of heritage conservation generally. In addition, the 2001 policy promised a new Commonwealth heritage regime with, at its peak, the establishment of a Commonwealth Heritage List. So how does this legislation bring that promise into being? This brings me to the third part of the question this evening. The current heritage regime was established by the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975, but there are limits with this regime. The current Register of the National Estate includes places of local and state significance rather than places of national significance. It fails to give prominence to or to highlight those areas which are of genuine importance to the country as a whole. As a result, there is unnecessary duplication, leading to inefficiency and confusion regarding jurisdiction. There is also a lack of protection for places of national significance. Far from in any way diluting the protection for those areas which we regard as sacred and of significance, this legislation for the first time offers powerful legislative protection for places of national significance. The current act simply does not provide for the protection of sites of environmental significance. How do the provisions in these three bills work? Together, they will replace and augment the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975. The first objective is to establish a comprehensive heritage regime for places of national significance both at home and, for the first time, abroad. Places such as Gallipoli, El Alamein and the Kokoda Trail and perhaps even parts of Bali, following the tragedy there, can be registered as being places of national significance. That is quite a change of mindset. The second objective is to list such places on the National Heritage List. The third objective is to protect and to manage these places of national significance. If we turn to the first bill, what it does above all else is to create a hierarchy: firstly, World Heritage listing, which is carried out by UNESCO; secondly, national heritage listing, both within the National Heritage List and the Commonwealth Heritage List for Commonwealth land; thirdly, state heritage listing; and, at the same time, the long-term maintenance of the Register of the National Estate so not one property which is on the current Register of the National Estate departs from that. Schedule 1 of the legislation creates the National Heritage List. The National Heritage List will be compiled by the minister through consultation with the Australian Heritage Council and will be formed by the cognate legislation. A place on the list will entail national environmental significance under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Act 1999, which is to be amended. In addition, schedule 1 creates for the first time the Commonwealth Heritage List, which assesses Commonwealth land. The minister will select places within Commonwealth areas which are to be inscribed on the Commonwealth Heritage List, and it will be possible to consult the Heritage Council if required. In addition, there will conservation of biodiversity and heritage. Schedule 2 of the bill allows for advice on Indigenous heritage, which is a very critical step if we are to recognise the full sense of place for all Australians. Schedule 3 ensures that the Register of the National Estate is maintained and that those buildings which are currently on the Register of the National Estate maintain their place and their standing. Schedule 4 enables the minister to delegate any of his or her powers under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Act to the Director of National Parks. The second bill, the Australian Heritage Council Bill 2002, provides for the establishment of the Australian Heritage Council. The role of the council is to assess nominations for places on both the National Heritage List and the Commonwealth Heritage List and to advise the minister on the identification, preservation and management of heritage sites. All of this is backed up by final bill, the Australian Heritage Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2002. That bill repeals the Australian Heritage Commission Act and amends other acts in order to allow seamless transition between the current and proposed heritage regimes. What do these bills achieve together? First, the proposed legislation would eliminate the problem of heritage listing duplication and simplify the legal situation covering heritage sites. Second, the legislation clearly specifies the framework within which decisions are to be made regarding heritage sites. Third, it focuses the Commonwealth's attention on places of national rather than local significance. Fourth, it improves the protection of places of national significance both within Australia and abroad in a way which has never previously been available. I respect the work which was done with the 1975 act, and this does not derogate from it. It builds upon it and creates a new layer of recognition and protection which has never been available in Australia. Ultimately, this legislation creates a platform from which future generations will be able to look back with pride on those buildbe ings and those areas of natural beauty within Australia which have been protected and preserved and which enshrine the most important areas and the most important elements of each of the different ages of Australian history. I commend these bills to the House. I urge all members to support them because they take forward the protection of our environment and our heritage in a way which has never before been achieved.",102
209,Mr WILKIE,AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COUNCIL,"This package of bills-the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, the Australian Heritage Council Bill 2002 and the Australian Heritage Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2002-represents the latest attempt by the Howard government to overhaul the current regime for the protection, conservation and management of heritage in Australia. The Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975 underpinned a regime for the protecthe tion, conservation and management of heritage that has been highly regarded around the world. It was one of the many great reforms of the Whitlam government and it provides an enduring legacy for which we can all be grateful. On a practical level, this regime revolutionised the management of Australian heritage. More than a quarter of a century after its introduction, this regime has been instrumental in the preservation of much of Australia's heritage. We cannot begin to imagine the rich array of heritage locations which would have been lost had it not been for the visionary reforms that Whitlam is so famous for. Indeed, the very concept of a Register of the National Estate exists because of the 1975 act. However, after more than a quarter of a century, Australia's heritage regime requires updating. However, these bills-sadly-do not meet that requirement. Consistent with the Howard government's poor record on the environment, this legislation joins a long list of failures. Since 1996, this government's environment policy failures have resulted in approval for uranium mining in Jabiluka, a multibillion dollar environmental pork barrel in the form of the Natural Heritage Trust, which has given funding disproportionately to projects in government electorates, and the continuing refusal to ratify the Kyoto protocol on climate change. This government is leaving a shameful environmental legacy, one that will endure long after it has left office. This package of bills only adds to its list of faila ures. Despite the changes made by the government to these bills since they were first introduced in the previous parliament, they still fall well short of achieving an effective overhaul of the protection, conservation and management of heritage in Australia. Labor supports the stated objective of these bills but does not believe that, even with the changes made to present them in their current format, they will achieve these objectives. For this reason, Labor has proposed a series of amendments to the bills to enable them to achieve these objectives. In highlighting the deficiencies of these bills, I want to focus on the impact they would have on existing heritage locations within my electorate of Swan. Covering just 108 square kilometres and comprising mainly urban residential and industrial areas within the Perth metropolitan area, Swan is home to a small number of heritage locations. In comparison to neighbouring inner metropolitan electorates such as Curtin, Fremantle and Perth, Swan has only a small number of heritage locations which are presently listed on the Register of the National Estate. While they may be few in number, there is a remarkable diversity in terms of types of heritage locations there. There is the magnificent art deco cinema, the Cygnet, in Como, which many Western Australians, myself included, have visited since childhood and where they have enjoyed countless movies. It is a cinema I still visit with my family, and I did so about two weekends ago. It has retained an atmosphere and a charm that is not found in the modern cinema complex. Only a short distance from my electorate office in Victoria Park is the Edward Millen Hospital, which has provided a range of medical services to the community in its lifetime. It is presently disused but the Western Australian government and the town of Victoria Park continue to work on a master plan to ensure its preservation, at the same time allowing for appropriate redevelopment so that it can be used by the community. I am sure that the involvement of the local member for Victoria Park, who just happens to be the Premier, Dr Geoff Gallop, scholar of history, will see this facility preserved for the community into the future. The Perth Zoo, in South Perth, holds important significance for the people of Western Australia. There would be few who have not visited the zoo at least once in their lifetime. Growing up virtually next door to the zoo, it was a place I visited many times as a child. As a parent, I regularly visit with my family and marvel at the enjoyment my sons derive from watching and interacting with the animals. As a member of parliament, I am impressed by the work of the zoo in educating the community about different species of animals and in contributing to the preservation of various animals at risk of extinction. I spoke recently in this chamber about the important work of the zoo in contributing to the preservation of orang-outangs through its highly successful breeding program. I commend to members a recently published book entitled Orangutans and their battle for survival, authored by Leif Cocks who is the curator of exotic mammals at Perth Zoo. Royalties from the book will go towards the zoo's orang-outang appeal. There are also a number of important natural environment heritage locations in Swan, such as the Canning River Wetlands the and the Milyu Nature Reserve. While these heritage locations may be few in number, most importantly they are equally deserving of ongoing heritage recognition, protection and management. These bills will fail, unfortunately, to achieve these objectives. The proposition in these bills, that the Australian Heritage Commission be replaced by the Australian Heritage Council, is not supported by Labor. It represents the downgrading of the commission, which equates to the downgrading of the Commonwealth government's commitment to heritage. The Australian Heritage Commission should remain not just in name, but also with its existing functions and powers. The process by which locations are listed is an important part of the overall heritage regime. Presently, the assessment of locations is undertaken by the Australian Heritage Commission. The new bills politicise this process by giving the minister the power to make decisions on whether to list or not. This function should remain with the Australian Heritage Commission so that the process remains independent and does not suffer the same politicisation that this government is allowing to tarnish many other government organisations. The increased powers given to the minister through these bills also lack appropriate transparency. While the minister can invite public comment, there is no specification of the issues the minister should consider when making a decision nor any obligation for the minister to consider the advice of the Australian Heritage Commission. Governments, including ministers, must be accountable for the decisions they make, and this is achieved through transparency in decision making. This government is notorious for the secrecy surrounding many decisions it makes and its unwillingness to be open and accountable with the public. Labor does not support this proposed decision making process, which fundamentally lacks transparency and accountability. Labor also opposes the objective of these new bills, which would see heritage protection afforded to only the tage values of a place. Labor's consistent position on heritage protection has been that of protecting a place and its associated values rather than the heritage values alone. Under the present heritage regime, around 13,000 places are listed on the Register of the National Estate. These new bills seek to create a National Heritage List, which is a list of places of national heritage significance, and a Commonwealth Heritage List, which is a list of Commonwealth government owned places of heritage significance. The existing 13,000 places listed will not automatically be listed on either the new tional or Commonwealth heritage lists. While the Register of the National Estate will still technically exist, once the 1975 act is repealed, the protection it affords will cease. Thus, there is no certainty that those places presently listed will be listed in the future and, if they are, when this might occur. Labor is concerned that the vast majority of places presently on the Register of the National Estate will not be transferred to either of the two new lists. This represents a major downgrading of Australia's regime for the protection, conservation and management of heritage. The transitional process from listing on the Register of the National Estate to listing on the new National Heritage List or Commonwealth Heritage List is flawed and consistent with the overall impact of these bills-that is, a major downgrading of Australia's heritage regime. These bills do not provide for any procedures to manage the transition from the Register of the National Estate to the Commonwealth Heritage List. There is no provision for even a public consultation process. The minister does not have to seek the advice of the proposed Australian Heritage Council before deciding whether or not to transfer a property. Labor has a simple position on these bills-that is, they do not achieve the objectives that are important for the regime to protect, conserve and manage Australia's heritage. Labor acknowledges that the government has made some improvements to the bills since they were presented in the previous parliament. However, these changes heriwere only made because of pressure from Labor on the government. The amendments Labor has proposed are necessary for this bill to achieve its objectives. Without further amendment, the Commonwealth government will introduce a heritage regime that fundamentally downgrades our commitment to the protection, conservation and management of Australia's heritage. Without further amendment, Labor will take the only responsible action available to it and will oppose these bills.",104
210,Mr KING,AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COUNCIL,"The three bills that we are considering today, the na- Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, the Australian Heritage Council Bill 2002 and the Australian Heritage Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2002, represent the most important, comprehensive and far-reaching changes to the way in which heritage places are managed and protected in Australia. They are a reflection of the genuine interest and concern that the Howard government has for the protection of those wonderful places-natural, Indigenous and historic-that reflect Australia's unique ronment and the continent's cultural development during both Aboriginal and Islander history and post-European settlement. I had the great honour of serving as the chair of the Australian Heritage Commission for more than three years prior to the commencement of last year's election campaign when I was preselected and elected to this parliament. One of the more rewarding aspects of that period was observing and participating in the development of this legislatage. tion and the extensive consultation undertaken by both the Australian Heritage Commission and the government in finalising their reform proposals. This legislation is presented to the parliament against the background of traditional Commonwealth leadership in this area. In 1973 the then government commissioned Justice Robert Hope to inquire into Australia's national estate. His report led to the creation of the Australian Heritage Commission and the Register of the National Estate-proposals advanced and strongly supported by both Prime Minister Whitlam and Prime Minister Fraser during the 1974 and 1975 period. At the time, the Australian Heritage Commission and its enacting legislation put the Commonwealth at the head of the emerging community interest in providing better protection for and proper identification of those places of cultural natural significance to our nation. The concept of the national estate was in itself groundbreaking both here and in most parts of the world. It is worth noting that the passage of the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1974 occurred at a time when the state level protection for heritage places was, at best, patchy. Some states protected a limited range of historic buildings. None had heritage tection regimes that comprehensively identified and listed or offered protection for heritage places with both natural and cultural values. In many respects the legislation that we consider today reflects the fact that states have caught up, but in some cases they still have a long way to go. Certainly most states now provide legislative protection for Indigenous and built heritage places. Very few, however, have legislation that allows for the envilisting and protection of natural heritage places outside the formal conservation reserve system. The Australian Heritage Commission Act has structurally changed little in the almost 30 years of its operation. During that time the commission has established an international reputation for its work to identify heritage places, promote sound conservation practices and encourage greater community awareness of the value of our national heriAs chair of the Australian Heritage Commission I experienced how highly its work is regarded around the world. For example, I visited Beijing with commission staff at the request of the Chinese government to share our experience as China seeks to improve its management of that nation's incredible heritage. More recently during my visit to Israel earlier this year, I met with heritage officials in that country who expressed an interest in the Natural Heritage Charter and the Burra Charter, prepared by the commission. I was pleased to learn that those documents have now been translated into Hebrew and are being used to guide that country's development of heritage practice. Since its establishment, the commission has listed over 13,000 places in the Register of the National Estate, and by their identification in that way communities across the and country have a greater appreciation of those heritage places in their midst. There can be no doubt that the Australian Heritage Commission has been a success and that the dedication of its commissioners and staff has had a tangible influence on the growth in community understanding of the value of heritage places. This legislation follows a process that began in 1996 that reflected both the new Howard government's desire to pro- strengthen and reform the Commonwealth heritage regime and an internal realisation within the commission that new approaches were desirable. Under the chair of my predecessor at the commission, Wendy MCCarthy, the commission began what it described as a future directions process. I particularly want to acknowledge today the leadership of both Ms MCCarthy and the then executive of the commission, Sharon Sullivan, in that regard. In 1998 I had the honour of convening the first National Heritage Convention in Old Parliament House, which brought together heritage practitioners, community leaders and government officials in a way that I do not think had ever occurred before. That convention developed a set of heritage principles, the spirit of which is reflected in legislation. The Australian Heritage Commission's work in developing proposals for the future of the Commonwealth's involvement in heritage issues occurred in tandem with intergovernmental processes initiated by the then environment minister, Senator Robert Hill. Part of the Commonwealth's goal was to not only improve the effectiveness of its own heritage regime but also lead improvements across all jurisdictions. Heritage issues were therefore an important part of discussions that occurred in 1997 at the Council of Australian Governments meeting. At that meeting, the Prime Minister, premiers and chief ministers adopted the principle in the historic Heads of Agreement on Commonwealth and State Roles and Responsibilities for the Environment. The agreement was the foundation for the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, which I believe will long be regarded as one of the more important legislative reforms implemented by this government. It also contained a commitment by governments to rationalise the existing Commonwealth-state arrangements for the identification, protection and management of heritage places. It envisaged the development of a national heritage policy which would include nationally consistent criteria and standards for identification and protection of heritage places and also agreement on the establishment of a new list of nationally significant heritage places. This legislation reflects the spirit of that agreement, in that it seeks to reorganise and improve Commonwealth responsibilities for heritage protection in a way that recognises the federal government's national responsibilities. It is, however, a matter of regret that the legislation does not implement a national heritage strategy in the terms suggested by the COAG agreement to which I have just referred. This is disappointing, as there is no doubt that the cause of heritage protection would benefit from a streamlined joint Commonwealth and state approach, including common standards and listing criteria and common protective measures. Agreement on the division of responsibilities through the referral of certain state powers this for national heritage places would also have strengthened the new national regime. The fault for this gap in these reforms lies squarely with the intransigence of state governments. For two years the former environment and heritage minister, Senator Robert Hill, sought to negotiate the national strategy that premiers and chief ministers said they agreed was necessary. However it became apparent that the frequent rhetoric from the states urging the Commonwealth to concentrate on places of national significance was not going to be matched by support for a referral of powers to make that most effectively happen. Equally, the states were not prepared to sign off on rigorous standards that would provide the Commonwealth with the assurance that it needed before it considered devolving responsibility for those places of state and local heritage value currently listed on the Register of the National Estate. In reality, what the states wanted was for the federal government to agree to a strategy that would have given it little more than a token role in relation to heritage protection. The people of Australia should be quite clear about that as we consider this legislation. The Commonwealth, correctly, has refused to agree to such a position and has pressed on with the drafting of this legislation to the extent of, but limited by, its constitutional powers. Through processes currently under way, I hope that the states will finally recognise that the Australian community does expect the federal government to have some responsibility for ensuring that places of clear significance to the entire nation warrant the protection of the national government. It is my fervent hope that it will not be too long before we can see the gaps in the new protective regime filled through the agreement that states claimed they were willing to progress at COAG. Reforms in the terms of this legislation are important for a number of reasons. Primarily, they relate to ensuring that the Commonwealth has greater power to protect those places that are of national significance. I mentioned earlier the important role that the Register of the National Estate has played in increasing awareness of the rich and varied heritage of this wonderful country, but the reality is that the register has been somewhat of a toothless tiger. Under the existing lation, while the Commonwealth can list places through the auspices of the Australian Heritage Commission, it has virtually no power to protect those places. At present, a national estate listing only has implications for Commonwealth agencies, and their obligations are simply to seek the adviceknown as section 30 advice-of the Australian Heritage Commission about the possible detrimental impact of proposals that affect listed places. While departments are required to consider prudent and feasible alternatives where damage may occur, neither the environment minister nor the commission have any actual powers to prevent even Commonwealth actions that may damage those sites. National estate listing does not provide even this protection against the actions of state governments, corporations or private individuals. In reality, it would be inappropriate and unmanageable for the Commonwealth to exercise such powers in relation to the national estate. I say that for two reasons. Firstly, the national estate does not draw a hierarchical distinction between places of national or local significance. I support the philosophical position that such a hierarchy is desirable and that the Commonwealth should regard its legislative domain to be principally those places of national significance. Secondly, in an administrative sense it would be impossible for the Commonwealth to seek to monitor and protect the over 13,000 places on the Register of the National Estate without an unacceptably massive expansion of the environment department. At present the Australian Heritage Commission is only able to report on the state of the national estate in a very limited way, as each year's annual report demonstrates. These bills are also important because they address a problem that the community has often expressed concern about and that was formally reflected in the landmark 1996 Schofield report; that is, the Commonwealth record of managing the heritage places it either owns or leases. While many departments and agencies perform this task superbly, many unfortunately do not. I think for example of the atrocious plans put forward legis- by the Department of Defence for land around Sydney Harbour, plans that were only averted by the actions of Prime Minister Howard and Senator Hill in establishing the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust. This legislation addresses these issues in two fundamental ways. First, the legislation will establish a new national list of heritage places and, for the first time, will give the federal government real powers to protect places included in the list. Regulations will prescribe the listing criteria for national heritage values but these will obviously be places of significance to the entire national community and will therefore be significantly smaller in number than those places on the Register of the National Estate. Through the established mechanisms of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, actions that could affect nationally listed places will need the approval of the federal Minister for the Environment and Heritage and will be regarded as matters of national significance. The Constitution does limit our ability to protect places on the national list as there is no direct head of power for the Commonwealth in relation to the protection of our environment and heritage. While the external affairs and Indigenous affairs powers allow for the comprehensive protection of places pertaining to natural and Indigenous heritage, the Commonwealth is largely limited in its capacity to protect what I would broadly describe as built heritage from the actions of federal agencies and constitutional corporations and from actions that relate to interstate and international trade and Commonwealth territories. It is for this reason that a referral of powers from the states is desirable for the Commonwealth regime to be truly comprehensive. In the long term I support consideration of constitutional amendments that would give the Commonwealth a direct head of power in relation to matters of national environmental and heritage significance, but that is a debate for another day. Places will be entered on the national list by the responsible minister, following advice from the Australian Heritage Council, which will replace the Australian Heritage Commission. I am aware of the considerable debate that has occurred about whether this should be the function of the minister or the council as an arms-length independent statutory authority. Proponents of the latter course point to the fact that the commission currently determines whether places should be included on the Register of the National Estate. Arms-length listing decisions are also proposed by some because of concern that listing decisions could become politicised. I strongly support the proposed methods of listing contained in this bill. Unlike inclusion of a place on the Register of the National Estate, the inclusion of a place on the national list will have direct legislative implications for the minister and the federal government in relation to management and protection. In our democratic system, it is entirely appropriate that the delegate of the elected government-that is, the ministerhave responsibility for making decisions of this magnitude. In so doing, he or she will have before them the expert advice of the Australian Heritage Council on whether or not a place is of national heritage value, but it is proper that he or she should also be able to consider economic and social issues before a listing occurs. I know that at times individuals and organisations do not like or trust what they would describe as ‘the political process', but that political process is our democratic process. What is important is that the minister's decision making be transparent. The bills ensure that that is so by requiring the minister to seek advice, both from the council and the community, to give reasons for his or her decisions. That is an actual requirement. I note that the approach adopted in the bills is consistent with the role the minister has in relation to other matters of national environmental significance as expressed in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. For example, the minister and the government determine whether to propose places for World Heritage and Ramsar listing. Similarly, the minister makes the final decision as to whether to list as threatened a species or ecological community. The second aspect of the legislation that I briefly want to refer to is the way in which it addresses deficiencies in the management of Commonwealth owned heritage places. The bills do that principally by establishing a Commonwealth heritage list which will include places in Commonwealth territories that are owned or leased by the federal government and that contain heritage values. The threshold for inclusion on the list will be more akin to that which exists for the Register of the National Estate than the national list. I note in this regard that some have estimated that, for example, 800 places on the Register of the National Estate may be included on the Commonwealth list. The bills ensure a direct role for the Minister for the Environment and Heritage in approving actions by Commonwealth agencies that may harm places on the Commonwealth list. Importantly, and in line with the recommendations of the Schofield report on this area, the bills specifically require Commonwealth authorities to develop agency-wide strategies for the management of heritage places. They also encourage individual management plans for those places on the Commonwealth list. These are important reforms and long overdue. The other reforms proposed in these bills relate to the Australian Heritage Commission and the Register of the National Estate. As I mentioned previously, the commission will be replaced by the new Australian Heritage Council. There will be some who mourn the passing of the commission, as it has many friends within the heritage community. While I am not sure that a change of name has served much purpose, I am confident that the new council will continue the fine traditions of the commission and take the mantle as the nation's pre-eminent heritage organisation. Its role will not be dissimilar to that of the commission and will in fact be expanded because of the creation of the national list and the Commonwealth list. These bills provide for it to continue to have an overarching advisory function in relation to heritage. It will have responsibility for promoting heritage conservation, education and best practice. It will also continue to maintain the Register of the National Estate. These bills reflect a change of direction by the government in relation to the Register of the National Estate. Originally it had been the government's intention to effectively freeze the Register of the National Estate so that it became a historical record to which additions were no longer made nor legislative responsibilities attached. These bills ensure that the Register of the National Estate continues in the living form kept by the new Australian Heritage Council. I know these changes will be welcomed by many in the community. In conclusion, these bills herald the beginning of an important new era in the way that we as a nation protect and treasure those heritage places that make us what we are. The task is vital. As the 1998 National Heritage Convention noted in its final communique: ... Australia should act as a community that respects, sustains and celebrates its diverse heritage, which connects us to the past, present and country for all generations. In these bills, the Howard government has demonstrated the commitment to achieving that noble ambition. I commend the bills to the House.",106
211,Ms JANN MCFARLANE,AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COUNCIL,"I rise today to speak on the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, the Australian Heritage Council Bill 2002 and the Australian Heritage Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2002, as they directly impact on local treasures in the electorate of Stirling, such as Trigg Bushland, Star Swamp, the Centaur shipwreck at North Beach and Edlaston-Chellaston Reserve in Carine. These are all listed on the Register of the National Estate to preserve them for future generations. However, their future is now uncertain due to the provisions of these bills. These bills are the Howard government's attempt to again impose complete ministerial control over whether a place is included on the new national and Commonwealth heritage lists-complete control over heritage issues in this country. It is obvious that the government has not learnt the lessons from the 2000 bills, which were debated in the Senate last year. The crux of the opposition to the 2000 bills was due to the blatant power grab by the minister to become the ultimate decision maker in determining what is heritage listed. I must concede that the government has made attempts to fix some of the other problems of the 2000 bills, and it must be acknowledged for making that attempt. The issues the government has attempted to resolve include those raised by the International Council on Monuments and Sites, ICOMOS, and ATSIC in the Senate references committee inquiry. I further acknowledge that these bills protect places with heritage value outside of Australia, which is a welcome development. I want to acknowledge that the government is also taking steps to recognise and protect areas that are culturally and historically significant to our Indigenous people. So what are the differences between these bills and the 2000 bills? There are some substantive changes, which are outlined in the Bills Digest as follows: - the Register of the National Estate retains its statutory identity - the Council may undertake assessments of places for potential listing of its own initiative as opposed to needing a Ministerial direction to do any assessment - the Council has an enhanced role in advising the Minister - National and Commonwealth Heritage places outside of Australia are protected, and - Commonwealth agencies have greater responsibilities in relation to Commonwealth Heritage places they control or are intending to sell or lease. Currently in Australia, the Register of the National Estate has approximately 13,000 places on it. It was established by the Whitlam Labor government in 1975 and operates through the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975, the AHCA. How do its powers actually work? Unless a place is protected under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, the EPBCA, the only substantive legal protection a place listed on the Register of the National Estate has is through section 30 of the AHCA. Section 30 of the AHCA imposes the following two duties on the Commonwealth: that any action proposed by the Commonwealth which adversely affects a place in the register should only be taken where the minister or authority proposing the action is satisfied there is ‘no feasible and prudent alternative', and, if the minister or authority is satisfied no such alternative exists, they must also be satisfied ures that can be reasonably taken to minimise the adverse effect will be taken. On the surface, the current legislation seems a little weak for those who advocate strong protection of heritage listed sites. There are some legal protections offered by the two duties I have just described. Under the legislation, there is no explicit requirement that the minister has to take into account the commission's comments. However, if the minister fails to do so, it could be argued in a court of law that the minister had breached the second duty. In the most extreme case, the court could find that due process had not been followed and it could invalidate any decision to proceed with the action. The important thing to recognise is that, effectively, heritage legislation in this country is toothless or not invasive, depending on your point of view on the issue. The current laws are by no means draconian and would not invite the same reaction of talkback callers as the recent crusade Paul Murray ran on 6PR radio in Perth against local government listing of residences. These bills deal with places that are actually ally significant. I will briefly outline the powers of the rent laws. The Bills Digest succinctly describes the current status of the legislation in relation to civil or criminal penalties for breaches of the AHCA, as follows: Listing a place in the Register imposes rect legal constraints on owners of private erty, or on State or Local governments-the Commission has no power to direct private owners or State or Local governments on their actions that might affect a place in the Register. The only protection, albeit indirect, is that places on the register may be: ... protected under the environmental assessment provisions of the EPBCA, if the place is also a matter of national environmental significance (MNES), is on Commonwealth land, or the proposed action ... is to be undertaken by a Commonwealth agency. In such circumstances ... an action that will have a significant impact on the place on the Register, they must first get approval from the Commonwealth Environment Minister ... failure to get Ministerial approval before taking an action with a significant impact renders a person liable to up to seven years gaol or fines of that all meas- over $550 000. So what changes do these bills make? The first real change is that, although the register will remain, the AHCA will be repealed. This effectively removes the section 30 provisions I have spoken about. It removes the indirect protections: the two duties that I have just outlined. The Howard government is trying through this bill to replace the current structure with two separate lists: the National Heritage List and the Commonwealth Heritage List. The net effect of this move is that the 13,000 places which currently exist on the register will be significantly reduced, leaving the places removed with absolutely no protection at all. Places that are transferred to the new National Heritage List will be covered by the indirect environmental protections I outlined before under the EPBCA. The second issue that I have concerns about is the downgrading of the present commission to an advisory council which operates solely under the direction of the minister. This is totally unacceptable. My colleague the shadow minister for the envicultur- ronment and member for Wills has moved amendments to this bill to reinstate the funccur- tions and powers of the commission and retain its name. Labor does not want the commission turned into a rubber stamp for this minister. Continuing this rubber stamp policy, the minister is also changing the definino dition of ‘action' under this bill-maybe it propshould be described as ‘inaction'. Both the Australian Conservation Foundation and the International Council on Monuments and Sites have raised concerns about these changes. The deleted references include provisions for funding via grants and the granting of authorisations, including permits and licences. My colleague the member for Wills moved amendments to this bill to ensure that the deleted items are reinstated and to ensure that such actions include the making of Commonwealth decisions on grants which are excluded under section 524A of the EPBC Act. What this bill attempts to do, through technical means, is to eliminate the means to get grants to preserve the places of national significance. It is a mean and tricky way of cutting funding and redirecting it to projects or places that this government supports. The important listing process is also severely affected by this bill. It changes fundamentally the concept of who gets to list places of significance. Previously, heritage values of a place have been assessed and determined by the independent Australian Heritage Commission. The process of listing has been considered a technical decision based on technical merit made by an independent body. The government now seeks to remove technical merit from the decision. In effect, it is dumbing down its decisions. Environment groups are not dumb. They see this move for what it really is: the politicisaof tion of heritage protection. No wonder groups like the ACF are angry about this politicisation. It changes the whole philosophy of heritage protection; it rips the soul of it. Labor are opposing this politicisation the process and the centralisation of power in the minister's hands, and we have moved amendments to reinstate the independent listing process. Another concern I have with this bill is concept of protection of place versus the protection of values. Labor supports protection of a heritage ‘place and its associated values' rather than just the values. The ACF believes that the legislation should continue to protect places, including their associated values, as opposed to relying on just values. Labor has moved amendments to restore credibility to this bill by reinstating the specification of heritage ‘place and its associated values'. I mentioned earlier in this debate the concerns I had about the future of the 13,000 places that are currently covered by the 1975 act. A serious deficiency of this bill is that once it becomes law no places will be listed on either the Commonwealth or national lists. In a Senate estimates committee hearing, the department indicated that approximately six places a year will be added to the list. My question to the minister is: how can we trust you to place the 13,000 places currently on the Register of the National Estate on these two lists? I want the minister to give us a guarantee on the public record that none of the 13,000 places currently on the Register of the National Estate will disappear into the ether. Is the government prepared to give this guarantee? As I mentioned in my opening remarks, in the electorate of Stirling there are some significant sites of environmental and heritage importance. Luckily, there are a number of local volunteer groups that have been set up to ensure that these sites are protected and nurtured for future generations. I am going to briefly outline the activities of these groups to ensure their commitment and work do not go unrecognised. As a member of all of these groups, I would like to publicly reaffirm my commitment to them and to the conservation the valuable natural assets in the Stirling electorate. Bushland in the Perth metropolitan area is a scarce commodity. The importance of urout ban bushland was not recognised by planners of and governments until too much of it had been cleared for urban use. That means that the remaining sites need to be carefully protected from any future development. I will look at these sites individually, starting with the Trigg Bushland, a site which will be affected by this legislation. Community action saw Trigg Bushland listed on the Register of the National Estate in 1987, and I want to place on notice that, if this government fails to ensure that this bushland is protected under this new legislation, I will personally lead a community campaign against the government to save this national treasure. To give the House a fair indication of the importance of the area in question, I will read from the brochure circulated by the Friends of Trigg Bushland: Trigg Bushland is one of the few larger bushland reserves (122ha) in the inner suburbs of Perth. It preserves a range of vegetation typical of the coastal strip and exhibits a progression of soil vegetation types found in no other metropolitan reserve. Trigg Bushland is an important habitat for resident wildlife and it provides a sanctuary for birds moving from one bushland area to another. The bushland is managed by the City of Stirling under a management plan. The plan involves an ongoing program which includes the rehabilitation of vegetation, erosion and weed control, upgrading tracks to improve fire management and public access, and maintaining fences and signs. In partnership with the City of Stirling, the Friends of Trigg Bushland Inc. help conserve the natural habitat of the reserve. The role of the group is best summarised by the description in their brochure: The Friends group, formed at a public meeting in 1990, actively contributes to the implementation of the Management Plan, and is represented on the City of Stirling's Management Advisory Committee for Star Swamp and Trigg Bushland Reserves. The Friends conduct monthly guided walks through different parts of the reserve, collect seeds, remove weeds and rubbish, and assist with bush regeneration and fire watch schemes. The Group's committee meets monthly and produces a newsletter and a calendar of events. New members are encouraged. Urban bushland areas are under constant pressure and need your help. The Friends of Trigg Bushland need to be commended for the thousands of hours of work that they have put into the site over the years. A special mention needs to be made of Robyn Murphy, who was one of the driving forces in setting up the group. Robyn was the president of the group pretty much from its inception, and I was honoured by an invitation to an appreciation dinner held in her honour by the group a few months ago. Robyn has decided to step aside from the committee to let the next generation carry on the good work. Robyn and her husband Harley visited me in Canberra recently. It was great to catch up with them. I would also like to acknowledge the work of Challis Tilbrook, Lisette Nigot and Phyllis Robertson, who contribute enormously to the work of the committee. Another place in my electorate that is on the Register of the National Estate is Star Swamp. Star Swamp is a complete wetland ecological system containing a wide range of and animal and plant life. Large areas of reeds and rushes provide nesting sites for waterfowl. The swamp and surrounding vegetation of tuart woodland and banksia woodland are examples of wetland and forest formations that are becoming very depleted on the Swan plain. The swamp was first registered in 1983. The Friends of Star Swamp is another local environmental group. They do hundreds of hours of work and conduct open days and walks. I am a member of the Friends of Star Swamp, and I would like to thank Christine Currie, David Pike, Jennifer Rogers and the other members of the committee for their dedication. On the site of the Star Swamp is the Henderson Environmental Centre, which was opened in April 2001. The Henderson Environmental Centre was made possible by a generous donation of $150,000 from Joyce Brushfield, a local North Beach resident. I was pleased that Joyce was able to be at the opening of the centre before she passed away last year. Her legacy will certainly live on through generations to come. I have been working closely with Councillor Bill Stewart to get funding from state and federal governments so that the centre can be open full time. Bill has been working nonstop with the officers from the City of Stirling to make the centre a viable and vibrant ongoing concern. I would like to thank Bill publicly again for his hard work for the North Beach, Trigg and Scarborough community. Changes to the grant system in this bill do not make me feel confident that any funding will be available for the Henderson Environmental Centre. Finally, I would like to acknowledge the efforts of Jan Bant and the other members of the Friends of Dianella Bushland group. The group has been doing a lot of displays at local shopping centres and the Dianella library to advertise the group and to get families involved in the group's activities-activities such as the fungi walk. Phyllis Robertson, whom I have mentioned already in this debate, takes great photos which are a real asset to their displays. I attended the group's meeting in June and really enjoyed the lively debate by members. Although this bill does not directly affect the Dianella bushland, the site is of great environmental significance and needs to be preserved. In closing, I want to make this statement to the minister and this government: your environmental credentials are in tatters due to your refusal to ratify the Kyoto agreement. Why don't you do something positive for a change and not harp on about the porkbarrelling you engaged in in regional Australia as a basis for your environmental credentials? Do some things now: accept the Labor amendments to these bills if you are serious about environmental heritage and heed the Labor Party's call to ratify Kyoto. Without the Labor amendments, I will oppose this bill.",111
212,Mr GEORGIOU,AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COUNCIL,"Our cultural and natural heritage is part of our identity. It is part of our understanding of who we are and from where we have evolved. We come to know our heritage in all sorts of ways. It is passed through the generations in oral and written histories, but we also absorb it, consciously or by osmosis, from objects and sites in our environment. Sometimes we take our environment and heritage for granted, and we may pass key examples of it every day without giving them a thought. There are a large number of places in my own electorate of Kooyong which are listed on the Register of the National Estate. While we may not fully appreciate them every time we pass them, we would certainly notice if they were gone. Whether or not it is at the forefront of consciousness, our heritage is of immense value to us. It is impossible to fully keep or transmit this heritage in words or in pictures. Even with the wonders of modern technology, with digital images and sound, the only way we can fully preserve heritage places is by preserving the physical matter that embodies the heritage values of these places. It is incumbent upon present generations to preserve the history of our forebears and our unique natural environment so that we may pass it on to future generations for them to learn from and enjoy. If we are to preserve our cultural and natural heritage adequately and appropriately, we need to ensure that our heritage management systems are compatible and complementary across all levels of government. We need to ensure that nationally significant places are properly identified, and we need to provide certainty to property owners, governments and the wider community about the treatment of significant sites. The Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, the Australian Heritage Council Bill 2002 and the Australian Heritage Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2002 will meet these objectives. Together they will establish a Commonwealth heritage regime that will focus on matters of national heritage significance and clearly define the Commonwealth's responsibilities in this area. These bills represent the culmination of six years of community discussion and consultation, including the National Heritage Convention convened by the Australian Heritage Commission in 1998. When the forerunners to these bills were originally introduced into the parliament late in 2000, 76 briefing programs were held throughout Australia. These bills were before the Senate, awaiting debate, but lapsed when the 2001 election was called. Since that time, amendments have been made to the legislation to implement the commitments made by the government in the lead-up to the 2001 election campaign, and I will outline these in due course. The Australian Heritage Commission Act established the Commonwealth's existing heritage conservation regime in 1975. At that time, it was the only piece of heritage proour tection legislation in Australia. A generation later, we have a regime where all states and territories have heritage protection legislation and many local government bodies can also identify and protect their local heritage through planning guidelines. However, this has resulted in unnecessary intergovernmental duplication. Multiple different pieces of protective legislation and planning laws can apply to any one site, causing considerable uncertainty. The regime established by the Australian Heritage Commission Act has led to the listing of more than 13,000 places on the Register of the National Estate. While some of these places could indeed be considered significant to all Australians, many would properly be regarded as places of primary significance only to the states or the local communities where the site is physically located. More importantly, the Australian Heritage Commission Act in itself does not provide adequate protection for important heritage sites. Places on the Register of the National Estate are afforded only limited substantive legal protection under the Australian Heritage Commission Act. Under that act, any action proposed by the Commonwealth which would adversely affect a place on the register should only be taken if ‘there is no feasible and prudent alternative' and if all reasonable steps are taken to minimise the adverse effect. But no civil or criminal penalties are provided in the Australian Heritage Commission Act for breaches of the provisions of the act. Apart from its impact on the Commonwealth government, listing a place on the register imposes no direct legal constraints on the owners of private property or on state or local governments, nor does it give the Australian Heritage Commission the power to direct private owners or state and local governments in their actions if these actions might affect a place on the Register of the National Estate. Some places on the register incidentally fall under the existing environment protection framework established by the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act in 1999, but this is incidental protection rather than direct and explicit protection for places on the register. effect, what we have at the moment is a heritage regime that does not provide strong, clear protection for all nationally important heritage places; yet, at the same time, it is a regime which may result in all three levels of government being drawn into heritage protection controversies that could typically be handled effectively by one alone. In 1997, the Council of Australian Governments agreed on the need for rationalisation of existing Commonwealth-state arrangements for the protection, identification and management of places with heritage significance. The council recognised that a list of places of national heritage significanceplaces that could reasonably be considered the responsibility of the Commonwealthneeded to be established. The measures contained in the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 will provide for heritage places of national significance located both within Australia and overseas to be included on the National Heritage List. The National Heritage List will be a key Commonwealth mechanism for heritage protection. The list will consist of natural, historic and Indigenous places with one or more national heritage values. In providing protection for heritage places of national significance, the list will strengthen Commonwealth heritage protection and complement the state regimes which protect places of local or state significance and the World Heritage regime which protects places of global significance. As I mentioned a moment ago, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999-the EPBC Act-provides a framework for the protection of places of national environmental significance. Under the new scheme, the definition of ‘environment' given in the EPBC Act is expanded to explicitly include the heritage value of places. The heritage value of a place is defined as including: ... the place's natural and cultural environment having aesthetic, historic, scientific or social significance, or other significance, for current and future generations of Australians. This amendment clarifies that heritage comes within the statutory environment protection In framework under the EPBC Act. Moreover, the National Heritage List will be a new matter of national environmental significance under the EPBC Act. This will mean that the Minister for the Environment and Heritage must give his or her approval before anyone can undertake activities that will have, or are likely to have, a significant impact on the heritage values of a place included on the National Heritage List. The only circumstance in which prior ministerial approval is not required is either if an agreement between the Commonwealth and a state or territory or if a ministerial declarahicle tion provides that the action does not require approval. This requirement for prior ministerial approval is underpinned by a provision for severe civil and criminal penalties for those who fail to obtain such approval prior to taking an action which has a significant impact on a National Heritage List site. Those who contravene any of the conditions attached to notices of ministerial approval may also face significant penalties. There has been a lot of concern about what protection will be afforded to places on the Register of the National Estate, so I was anxious to have this clarified. The Register of the National Estate will be retained in accordance with the commitment made by the government during the 2001 election campaign. Debate interrupted. NA",115
213,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 10.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Melbourne Ports Electorate: Automotive Industry",117
214,Mr DANBY,ADJOURNMENT,"Last Wednesday I had the opportunity to attend in my electorate the wonderful opening of the Holden V6 engine plant that had been constructed on time and on budget, according to Senator Minchin, who represented the government as Minister for Finance and Administration. It was indeed a wonderful experience to see Australians making a great contribution in the manufacturing industry. We still have a manufacturing industry in my electorate, of which I am extremely proud. The V6 plant will export 200,000 engines, including V6 engines, to the United States. I could not get out of the local chairman of General Motors Holden which particular cars these would power. I think it is probably not quite a state secret, but it may embarrass some American car makers that their cars are powered by Australian engines. Senator Minchin's comment that the V6 engine plant was constructed on time and on budget is very significant, because it was made in the presence of Ian Jones of the VeBuilders Union and Martin Kingham, the state secretary of the CFMEU. I fully understood Ian Jones's comment that it was interesting that the Cole royal commission looking into the construction industry had not been sent down there to see this plant be delivered on budget and on time. Indeed, the minister for finance, to everyone's amazement there, said that this excellent work by the construction workers in Victoria would send a message to Detroit and Tokyo-and so it should. But perhaps it might also send a message to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations that there are some good things being done by Australian construction workers and that perhaps, in a balanced view of industrial relations, one ought to see construction workers as making a contribution to Australian productivity. Indeed, Ian Jones turned to the minister and said, in a very powerful speech, that they should not introduce the industrial caveats of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Mr Abbott, into the very successful operation of the automotive industry. Ian Jones said to the minister, ‘Nick, if things aren't broke, don't fix them.' I think that is a very strong message that the 800 construction workers, people who are in the motor vehicle industry in my electorate, would send to this government. The motor vehicle industry is producing record exports, record productivity and record employment. We do not need wedge politics in industrial relations being inserted into the automotive industry, which is operating very successfully. Leave the Holden V6 plant and all automotive plants alone, Minister. The vehicle builders and the automotive firms are operating very cooperatively together. There are no industrial caveats where there are no problems. This plant was delivered on budget and on time, to quote the minister. It sent a message to Detroit and Tokyo and I hope the message is also received by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Turner, Mrs Mary",117
215,Mr BALDWIN,ADJOURNMENT,"Paterson) (10.33 p.m.)I rise tonight to pay who homage to Mary Turner. Mary Turner was an outstanding member of the Pacific Palms community in the electorate of Paterson. Unfortunately, Mary Turner passed away on 5 October. Mary Turner was an unusual person who left an amazing and wonderful legacy to the community in Pacific Palms through her involvement in the establishment of the Pacific Palms community hall and library. Mary and her husband, Eric Turner, worked tirelessly with other members of the Pacific Palms community to raise money for this project. Mary was not only involved in helping the community get off the ground but, as necessity dictates in a small community, she also became a self-taught librarian through buying, cataloguing and then shelving most of the books. Mary and Eric Turner moved to the Pacific Palms area in their retirement in 1975 and the entire family fell in love with the place, where Elizabeth Beach affectionately became known as Lizzie's. Here they built their pride and joy, which was close to the beach and accessed through a magnificent rainforest walk that leads to the beach through and around the Bouddi National Park. It is not hard to understand why they considered this area to be one of God's special places. Besides being a tireless worker for her community, Mary Turner also enjoyed writing poetry. One of her poems, called Beach Walk, beautifully describes the life that she had. It reads: Left by an ebbing tide the mirroring sands reflect the red legs of seagulls. They stand, immaculately suited in feathers grey and white: beaks poised for prey in the lace of edged ripples. An errant cloud deflects the sun, shadowing a shimmering beach. The gulls lift, the cloud passes Restoring sea polished sands. Mary Turner also wrote many stories about her experiences throughout her life, including her childhood in Western Australia. Mary was born in Perth in 1914, where she later worked in a bank to help support her parents through the Depression, as so many of that era had to do out of necessity. It there, whilst in Western Australia, that Mary fell in love with the west and, in particular, the wildflowers that flourished there. She had learnt to press and preserve them and later turned these skills into making cards for fundraising for various communities. It was following the outbreak of World War II that she had met Eric Turner, her future husband. They fell in love and married in February 1943 in Perth. After the war, when Eric returned from New Guinea, the family moved from Perth to Ashfield in Sydney and later to Sans Souci. The pair had three children-Susan, Simon and Andrew. Many of us in this House know Andrew Turner, who currently works in Parliament House as an attendant. I and, I am sure, all the people in this House send our deepest sympathies to him. The Turner family would later move further north to Taree and finally, in retirement, to Pacific Palms. As with so many Australians, retirement did not result in a quiet life for the Turners, who spent many years helping others in the community. Both Eric and Mary were lifetime members of the University of the Third Age in Forster, where they contributed to regular discussions. I congratulate the Turner family on their achievements and their lasting legacy to the Pacific Palms community in the Great Lakes. Mary was mother to three, grandmother to eight and great-grandma to three. I also congratulate Andrew, who delivered an outstanding and detailed eulogy at Mary's funeral at Wesley Gardens Chapel in Belrose, where both Eric and Mary spent their final years. of Finally, I found one of Mary's poems which I feel combines her love of poetry and her faith. It goes: The Bible tells us “Seek and ye shall find,” Life is one long search for the unknowable; For the elusive needle in the haystack; For hidden truths obscured by the straw Of superstition, dogma and fear. Sometimes we are aided in our search by flashes Of intellect revealing truths that we know are eternal, By faith in all that is best in human nature, By glimpses of beauty in all its facets But most of all in love given and received. was We know that the needle IS in the haystack And that we must continue to search. May Mary Turner rest in peace. Bendigo Electorate: Maryborough Employment",117
216,Mr GIBBONS,ADJOURNMENT,"I visited Maryborough in my electorate last Friday and I was alerted by my state colleague Joe Helper, the member for Ripon, to yet another callous act of heartlessness by the coalition government. I refer fields Employment and Learning Centre, which has been advised that the funding for the Job Placement, Employment and Training program will not be renewed for 2003. This program has been operating since 1997 and is currently funded by the Commonwealth department responsible for youth affairs. It has catered for disadvantaged 15to 21-year-olds who have barriers of homelessness, early school leaving, abuse and a range of other problems. I see my good friend the squatter from Corangamite is here, looking on intently. If this bloke was any dryer he would shatter! I have often wondered why the people of the Corangamite electorate keep returning this bloke. I worked it out the other day. I was driving down in that area, I had the local dio on and I heard that the Bay City Rollers are still top of the pops down there. That would explain perfectly why they keep returning the member for Corangamite. To get back to Maryborough, the learning centre was contracted to service 180 clients over the previous 18-month period. The contract was in fact fulfilled, with some 195 young persons assisted over that period. It understood that over 50 per cent of Victorian applicants for funding have been rejected and this reflects the national position. It is currently impossible to discover from the department what limited coverage is now intended. For Maryborough it is a disaster that the only program available to assist advantaged youth is being slashed. Maryborough has a current unemployment rate of about 10.5 per cent, with youth unemployment estimated to be in excess of 18.5 per cent-and I think these figures are very conservative. Over $100,000 of federal funding will be lost to the Maryborough centre and therefore the Maryborough economy. Unless last-minute changes are made there will be severe staff redundancies faced by the Goldfields Employment and Learning Centre. Maryborough is already reeling with the forthcoming loss of the Nestle plant and around 130 jobs and the potential for further job losses in the printing industry if the Howard government's Copyright Amendment (Parallel Importation) Bill is passed to the Goldthrough both houses. The people of Maryborough could be forgiven for wondering what they have done to this government. Earlier this year in the budget we had the Treasurer take away two of the very important industry schemes for the printing industry without any consultation and without warning. To give credit where it is due, I have to pay some respect to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, who was able to resolve the situation to the satisfaction of the printing industry and get some of the assistance schemes put back in place. I commend the minister for doing that. When Nestle announced they were going to take their plant away from Maryborough and relocate it in New Zealand, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries raand Forestry stood up in this parliament during question time and pointed out that the reason Nestle took the decision to relocate their plant to New Zealand was because of the appalling industrial relations problems experienced at the plant. That was a deliberate untruth. There has never been one minute of down time lost in Nestle Maryborough since Nestle have been operating the plant, yet the minister for agriculture stood up in is this chamber during question time and stated that it was because of the appalling industrial relations record. So what has Maryborough done to this government? Why do they hate Maryborough? The minister has never withdrawn that discomment and he should, because it was a downright lie. I urge the government to reconsider the cancellation of this scheme. It affects those groups who are most at risk in our community and most disadvantaged. It is a very callous and heartless decision, and it just reflects the fact that this government deals with these sorts of problems with all the compassion of the Third Reich. Industrial Relations: Student Unions",119
217,Ms JULIE BISHOP,ADJOURNMENT,"Since the election of the Gallop Labor government, Western Australians, week in, week out, have become used to the ‘faceless men' of the trade union movement dictating the terms of public policy in our state. So far, those ‘faceless men' have demanded the repeal of the progressive and competitive industrial relations policies of the Court government. In a clear case of the tail wagging the dog, they demanded that their representatives in the state Labor caucus alter a decision of cabinet in relation to school cleaning contracts. The latest example of union puppetry is the intended amendment of the Voluntary Membership of Guilds and Associations Act 1994. While the federal government is conducting a comprehensive review to bring higher education into the 21st century, the state ALP is trying to live in the 19th. The Acts Amendment (Student Guilds and Associations) Bill 2002, which is presently before the state parliament-suspiciously at the precise moment students are preoccupied with semester 2 exams-is nothing more than backdoor compulsory unionism. The bill permits university students to ‘opt out' of being union members but requires that they pay a union fee even if they have chosen not to join the union. Worse still, the Labor Party remains confused as to whether this opt-out clause is genuine. Last week the West Australian newspaper reported a statement by the state government indicating that fees paid by those who refuse to join a union would not be forwarded to that union but instead directed to the university. But just hours that statement was pulled and the truth revealed: regardless of whether a student chooses to join the union, over half their compulsory fee will be forwarded straight to the union. University students in Western Australia are currently the only students to enjoy the benefits of genuinely voluntary student unions. For the past eight years, students in Western Australia, upon enrolling at university, have had the choice of whether or not to join their campus student union. This contrasts with the situation in other Australian states where students are compelled, with some exceptions, to become members of the student union as a condition of their enrolment at university-a real life, up-front fee. According to the latest figures, approximately 50 per cent of the students at the University of Western Australia, which is in Nedlands in my electorate of Curtin, choose to be members of the guild. As the Australian Liberal Students' Federation has said, this figure... demonstrates that significant numbers of students are electing not to become members of the UWA Guild, suggesting that they value the choice under VSU ... [and] the increasing membership figures ... demonstrate that students will voluntarily pay a membership fee when student guilds provide relevant services and are responsive to student priorities and interests. The state education minister has attempted to justify his decision to compel students to join a union by stating that such compulsion will contribute to campus life. While student unions clearly have a role to play in student life and in making a contribution to the university environment, the fact that students are not joining reflects the importance of maintaining voluntary unionism. Students themselves are weighing up the benefits and costs of being part of the union and are often deciding that membership is not in their best interests. Moreover, it is on record that student unions extensively engage in outlandish fringe political activities. Voluntary student unionism allows students the choice as to whether they wish to pay money to fund such activities. I remember when I was at university in later the 1970s, the student unions were funding terrorist groups like the Palestine Liberation Organisation. Nowadays it is fashionable for the student unions to give money to violent anarchist groups such as Global Action, which was responsible for the riots that took place during the World Economic Forum in Melbourne two years ago. In the same vein, I was shocked to discover-and I am indebted to the UWA Liberal Club in this regard-that the National Union of Students, the direct financial benefactor of compulsory fees, has distributed posters on campus depicting the men and women of the Australian Defence Force as murderers. Ironically, the image used on these posters is that of an infantrythe man subduing a militiaman during the UN intervention in East Timor. So, for almost years, the student Left pointed to the injusSadly, tice of the Indonesian occupation of East Timor, but in 2002 their sympathies lie instead with the oppressors. What a poignant example of the moral bankruptcy of postmodern socialism. As a Liberal I believe strongly in the principle of freedom of assoof ciation, particularly on our university campuses. On this issue the Australian Labor Party have again demonstrated that they are willing to trample on fundamental freedoms, to trample on the rights of students at the behest of their masters in the union movement. The Gallop government should leave voluntary student unionism and Western Australia's university students alone. (Time expired) Monash University: Shooting",120
218,Ms BURKE,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to speak about Monash University in my seat of Chisholm. Usually I am in this place talking of Monash as a place of great learning, a world renowned institution that leads in numerous areas of education and research. It is a place that has produced many members of this House, myself included. But today I rise to speak of the ror that befell the campus on Monday, 21 October. The sanctity of mind was shattered on this day when a gunman entered a tutorial room in the Ming wing killing two students, wounding five others and scarring the university campus forever. Universities are meant to be open places, where learning is unencumbered, youthful vigour abounds and certain freedoms are allowed. They should not become caged buildings with metal detectors at every door. I wish to extend my sympathies today to the families of William Wu and Steven Chan, the two honours students who were killed in the Monash shooting. I cannot begin to imagine the despair you are feeling at the loss of your sons and at the waste of such promising, bright young men. I was moved to tears by Professor MCLaren's account of his econometric students at the recent memorial services at Monash, especially when he revealed that William had not been home for past four years, instead taking summer school to finish his degree quickly. His par25 ents were planning to visit in November. they have now had to come to Australia to take their son's body home. The image of Steven working on his thesis on economic inequality, in which he argued that we need to promote ideas of fairness and equality to not allow the rich to get richer at the expense the poor, painted a picture of someone we will miss in our world. To Laurie Brown, Lee Gordon-Brown, Daniel Urbach, Christine Young and Leigh Dat Huynh, who were wounded in the shooting, I wish you a speedy physical recovery and trust the mental scars of this day can be overcome. To the staff and students in the economics faculty, who will feel this event most painfully, my thoughts are with you. Numerous people need to be thanked and applauded for their efforts on that day and the days that have followed-most particularly Lee Gordon-Brown, who put his life at risk, Alastair Boast and Associate Professor Brett Inder, who also put their lives at risk to tackle the gunman, ensuring that the loss of more lives was averted. To you, I say thank you on behalf of those on the campus whose lives were saved by your heroic actions. To horthe police and paramedics who attended the scene on the day and the staff at Monash medical centre who treated the wounded, thank you again. The fabulous staff at Monash University counselling and chaplaincy service are owed an enormous debt of thanks. Their boundless work to assist the numerous staff and students throughout this period has been tremendous. The number of comments I have received about the speed and care extended by this group is quite amazing. Given it is the end of the year at the university and a time of heightened stress because of exams and final assignments being due, the care shown by the university has been remarkable. Professor Peter Darvall's handling of the whole affair and his genuine concern for all involved was most obvious. The awarding of Steven's and Williams's degrees posthumously was a fitting tribute to those two men who have lost their lives. To Rebecca Tomlinson, Liz and Sen at the Monash student association-a hotbed of radicalism, obviously, according to the previous speaker-I wish to extend congratulations to you on keeping your cool and looking after all the students at Monash. In particular I congratulate you on your handling of the issue of special consideration and for not using this event to beat up on any particular element or as a media stunt, but rather treating the event with the dignity and respect it deserves. I cannot begin to imagine what drove someone to do this, but the end result and the loss of innocence at Monash University, and indeed Australia at large, is palpable. I hope we can find some way to ensure that in our universities there remains a sanctity of mind and that we do not develop a bunker mentality following this tragedy. Foreign Affairs: Iraq",121
219,Ms PANOPOULOS,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to record the contribution that the Howard government has made towards United Nations resolution 1441, which has irrevocably set in place a process that, in one form or another, I hope will finally guarantee the removal of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. It is the trigger that I hope will move from reach instruments of war which have the potential to kill millions of innocent citizens of the world. The Australian government has played a crucial role in the UN finally confronting Saddam Hussein. The truth of the matter is that, had it not been for the persuasion imposed on the United Nations by the United States and two of its allies, this resolution would probably never have seen the light of day. This resolution only succeeded because it became blindingly obvious that, if the United Nations did not take a very strong stand against Iraq, there was the prospect that the United States and perhaps its allies would have taken unilateral action. This is not the occasion to catalogue the failings and defiance of Saddam Hussein. However, for more than a decade he has deceived and defied the will and the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council by, among other things, continuing to seek and develop chemical, biological and nuclear weapons and prohibited long-range missiles. In the face of this blatant defiance, the UN has done nothing to enforce its resolutions. It has, until now, failed itself and those it is charged to represent. Were it not for Bush, Howard and Blair, little would have happened. The Security Council was confronted with two stark options: stand impotently aside, with the United States and perhaps the United Kingdom and Australia undertaking unilateral action against Iraq on behalf of the freedom-loving nations of the world to remove its weapons of mass destruction; or assume responsibility for enforcing its own resolutions. The result is now a matter of record. Had it not been for the resolution and determination of these three leaders, it is likely the United Nations would have done little and the Labor Party would now still be urging support for a further resolution to remind Iraq of the previous resolutions which it had ignored. In spite of this resolution, in spite of the 100 targets that the UN inspectors have already identified and in spite of overwhelming evidence, Mr Crean tells Australians that there is still not enough evidence of Saddam's acquisition of weapons of mass derestruction. The truth is that Australians cannot trust Labor, and with good cause. During the last federal election they promised that they were tough on border protection, that they supported mandatory detention for all illegal immigrants and that they would be vigilant in policing our coastline. Having been defeated at the election, Carmen Lawrence and her fellow travellers publicly admitted that it had all been a great lie: they were soft on border protection and supported illegal immigrants hiding in our towns and cities. What have Labor members said about the war against terrorism? The member for Franklin told the people of Australia: Hereferring to George W. Bushjust wants to justify getting in there and having a real ding-dong go. And I think we've been caught up in this 9/11 hype and I think it's ridiculous. I think we should stay out of it. And Carmen Lawrence said of the US",122
220,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,The member for Indi will refer to the member for Fremantle by her seat.,122
221,Ms PANOPOULOS,ADJOURNMENT,The member for Fremantle said of the US earlier this year in September: Even its preparedness to go to war with Iraq without a mandate from the UN security council is a defiance of international law far graveron the face of itthan Saddam Hussein's non-compliance with UN weapons inspectors. Australia is simply not safe under Labor. Simon Crean does not control the Labor Party.,123
222,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,The member for Indi will refer to the Leader of the Opposition by his title.,123
223,Ms PANOPOULOS,ADJOURNMENT,"The Labor Party is controlled by the loony left, the chattering class and Paul Keating's famous Balmain basketweavers. To appease his masters, the Leader of the Opposition says that diplomacy, not war, is the answer. Tell that to Saddam Hussein. As Senator Hill has said, it is the international community's responsibility to ensure that the new UN resolution is enforced through whatever means are necessary. If Australia under Labor found itself confronted with acts of terror, Labor would not confront these criminals and those who harbour them; it would dispatch its spokesman for foreign affairs to the United Nations. Australians cannot trust Labor with the economy, they cannot trust it with border protection and they cannot trust it to protect Australia from terrorism. Put in simple terms, Australians do not feel safe under Labor. As Kim Beazley Sr once famously observed, the Labor Party used to be represented by the cream of the working class; it is now represented by the dregs of the middle class. (Time expired) Communities for Communities Program",123
224,Mr MURPHY,ADJOURNMENT,"Lowe) (10.57 p.m.)After all that humbug and cant, I would like to conclude tonight's debate on a positive note and bring to the attention of the House a wonderful initiative by a constituent of mine, Mr Lance Brooks. Mr Lance Brooks came to the public's attention earlier this year on Channel 9's program Australian Survivor. Paradoxically, he was removed from that program for his honesty. Arising from his experience on Australian Survivor, Lance Brooks gave consideration to how he could learn from that experience and give help to others less fortunate than we are in Australia. He established a program called Communities for Communities. Yesterday, at Drummoyne Oval, he held one of the many activities that he has organised to raise money for people who are less fortunate than us, as I have said, and I am specifically referring to the people of Ranong on the Thai-Burma border. Mr Brooks wants to bring the community of the city of Canada Bay closer to the community of Ranong, where the community is bereft of educational opportunities. The whole focus of the Communities for Communities program is to build community spirit not only in our own community in the city of Canada Bay but in the community of Ranong and to raise funds for the education of the children in Ranong who do not even have the fundamental elements of education such as an exercise book, a ruler or a pencil. If ever the children of the world needed to be educated, there could not be a better time than at this time when there is so much insecurity in the world. Mr Brooks is doing a tremendous job in my electorate of Lowe to help the people of Ranong and bring the community in the city of Canada Bay closer to them. I know that is appreciated, and I want to acknowledge the tremendous work that he has done to help people who are very unfortunate.
