3,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I wish to know from the Prime Minister if his attention has been called to, or if he has noticed, the statement of Senator Robert Reid regarding a .certain charge made against Federal members, and whether he thinks it worth ' while to take any-notice of the insinuation with a view to removing from the minds of the people any sinister impression which they may have regarding the members of this Chamber?'",12
4,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,I have noticed the report to which the honourable member alludes. All that I can say is that I am distinctly against taking any notice of contemptible assertions of the kind. - COMMONWEALTH AUDITING .,12
5,Mr KIRWAN,Unknown,"the Postmaster General, - upon notice I. Whether his attention has been directed to a case heard at the Criminal Court, Perth, on . August 9th and 10th inst., before Mr Commissioner Roe and a jury, in which an employee of the Telephone Department was charged with having stolen moneys, the property of the Department, and to the following statement made thereon by the Commissioner when summing up, as reported in the Perth morning newspapers of 10th inst. :"" Dealing with the case, his Honour said that it was a most disgraceful state of affairsthat the accused's accounts had not been audited for 114-years. It was also disgraceful that the accused had no place to put away his money, but had to keep it in unlocked drawers, pigeon-holes, and anywhere else that might be convenient. The lax manner in which the post-office seemed to have been run was grossly unfair to the unfortunate young man in the dock and to other officers who had access to the room."" 2. Whether, in view of these comments, and the fact that the evidence disclosed that during the l l i yea™ referred to close upon £100,000 passed through the accused's hands, the Postmaster-General will inform the Honse what action he intends to take to remedy such a state of affairs?",12
6,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. The Postmaster-General's attention has been directed to the case referred to. Action has already been taken upon reports received from the Auditor-General, which, however, do not bear out the statement that £100,000 passed through the hands of the accused.  the Minister representing the Minister forDefence, upon notice-: 1. Whether the Defence Department audit inoludes the auditing of the contingent allowance granted to - companies of the Defence force in Queensland ? 2.

NA SECOND READING. Debate resumed from 20th August (vide page 4007), on motion by Mr DEAKIN That the Bill be now read a second time.",13
8,Mr CONROY,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N," I trust that honourable members will not be dismayed by the array of books piled up in front of me. They merely contain statutes to which I wish to refer, because I think that in dealing with matters like this it would be well if each one of us gave the chapter and verse of his authority. So far as my inquiries have gone, they do not lead me to hope for any success from the passing of legislation of the kind proposed. But in opposing a measure which embodies what is thought to be a popular idea, and which, according to the Attorney-General, marks a new phase in civilization, it behoves me to investigate the matter very thoroughly. So far from this marking a new phase of civilization, or being, as the right honourable member for South Australia has said, the beginning of an absolutely new line of policy, my researches show that nothing is older than legislation of this kind, and that nothing has been tried more frequently, or has failed more signally, than the methods which it seeks to re-introduce. - Mr SPENCE - Thos e methods have not been tried under the same conditions as now exist.",13
9,Mr CONROY,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"No . They were tried, not under the conditions of a tremendous industrial ramification, such as exists today, but under conditions so much simpler that they might have been expected to succeed then if it is possible for them to succeed at all. To-day the complication of industrial relations makes success impossible, seein g that it could not be obtained u n der m uch less complicated social conditions. A matter of this kind, however, is not one upon which we should express our opinions too positively. The House, I take it, is trying to arrive at what I may call a judicial sentence upon the question. It wants to pass legislation which will be in the interest, not of one section of the community alone, but of the whole people. It is on the ground that it will not benefit the whole people that I base my opposition against the Bill. When I heard the fine flowing sentences of the Attorney-General in regard to the beautiful prospects now opening out before us, I BILL. could not help thinking of the lines of the late Mr Brunton Stephens I have heard it breathed that there cometh a day . When tears from all eyes shall be wiped away; And sorrow and pain, and all distress Shall cease in a round of blessedness.",13
10,Mr MCLEAN,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,I thought that the honourable and learned member was going to quote the linesHer mouth has no particular direction ; Aflabby-rimmedabyss of imperfection.,13
11,Mr CONROY,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"We are not now engaged on an inquiry into the origin of good and evil, or into the reason why they exist side by side, or why the Omnipotent appears unable to suppress the bad and uphold the good. We know only that good and evil do exist in the world together, and that the fight between them has been eternal. I do not intend, in my references to the past, to go too far ba""k into history, lest it be said that we are losing ourselves in the misty realms of antiquity; and my quotations will be chiefly from English sources. I intend to show what our ancestors did, and how they tried to meet the difficulties which confronted them. We must not think that the law of competition did not exist in their days, or that they adopted methods differing from those now proposed to t i y to evade it . They framed what are known as customary laws, and endeavoured to prevent competition altogether. That is the object of the Bill. This legislation, if it means anything, means practically the limitation of competition. I think all are agreed upon that. What happened in England ? We find that at a very early period-certainl y as early as the eighth century-what-ar e known as guilds sprang into existence. They were in a sense the prototypes of the trades unions of today. I do not go so far as some, and say that they were absolutely of the type of present day unions, but making allowances for the differences between the two periods, especially in regard to means of communication and locomotion, a great similarity is seen to exist between them. Their object was to give effect to what is very largely the ruling idea in men's minds day-the desire to, as far as possible, settle things. In the endeavour to do ihis they so regulated matters that the regulations became the customary laws to which I have referred, and these laws became so strong that for two or three centuries no legislation was passed to interfere with them. From about the eighth to the twelfth century there was scarcely any legislation in regard to the matters with which they dealt. It was thought impossible that any one could depart from the rules laid down for the regulation of labour aud industry in the small towns where the tradesmen congregated together. When they did start to legislate, they nearly always inserted in their statutes a preamble expressing surprise that "" divers wicked pei-sons"" had departed from the customary law, and they then proceeded to legislate against such departures. Nor can it be thought, when we hear men objecting to the introduction of labour-saving machinery, that this is a new thing, because as early as 1105 protests were made against the use of windmills, on the ground that the mills were doing, in the grinding of corn and the raising of water, what hitherto men had been employed to do. People in those times also thought that there should be laws regulating prices, and they enacted on what seemed to them incontestably good grounds that no one should undersell his neighbour. Goods had to be brought to particular market places for sale to prevent any departure from the customary law. Possibly one of the earliest English statutes on the subject shows how much regard was paid to these matters, and how much surprise was felt that any one shoulrl be able to depart from the customary law-fro m what I might call the common rale; because that customary law was practically what is termed in this Bil l the common rule. The statute 51, Henry III . , passed in 1266, enacts that bread and ale shall be sold at the price of corn. It says The King to all to whom these presents shall come, Greeting. We have seen certain ordinances Mr Centre*/. of the assize of Bread and Ale, and of the making of Money and Measures, made in the times of our progenitors, sometimes Kings of England, in these words. Then they decreed exactly what these prices should be, as follow:When a quarter of wheat is sold for ls. 6d„ then wastel bread of Jd., white and well baked, shall weigh 4 lbs. They went further in a direction which to- would fill the soul of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports with dismay. They fixed the price of ale as follows:When a quarter of wheat is sold for 3s. or 3s. and 4d. and a quarter of barley for ls. 8d. or 2s., and a quarter of oats for ls 4d., then brewers in cities ought and may well afford to sell two gallons of beer or ale for ld., aud out of cities to sell three or four gallons for ld. They even recognised the difference between the men in the city and the men in the country, because they provided thatAnd when in a town three gallons is sold for a' ld., out of a town. they ought and may sell four. And this assize ought to be Holden throughout all England. We can see how fixed was the idea that nob only Parliament, but custom, should regulate everything. Custom was law in the old times, and it is law still. As showing how strong custom was, another Act of Henry III . providedThat if a baker or a brewer he convicted because he has not observed the assizes he shall suffer-the baker to the pillory, the brewer to the tumbril. There was very little chance of escape from the definite statements of those days. Everything was made clear and simple enough, and one cannot help being struck with the idea that if some of our latter-day lawyers could possibly draw up the provisions of our Acts with the same clearness we should have no doubt as to the interpretation of our Acts of Parliament. In those days they were so anxious that the common rule should not be departed from that they contested every eflbrt to introduce anything new. The honourable member for Newcastle may be interested to know that what we know as coal nowadays-the n known as sea coal to distinguish it from charcoal-wa s the subject of a special ordinance. When the coal was first brought in by ships they proceeded to legislate against it , and they were never at a loss for words to express their reason for taking action. As far back as 1306, we find an ordinance in these simple wordsWhereas there is annoyance and danger of contagion by reason of the stench of sea coal and great damage has resulted from forbearing from the use of bavins and charcoal, we decree that all are to cease burning sea coal, and are to makefiresof - wood and coal as formerly. That was intended to prevent the charcoalburners from being thrown out of employment. I mention all these matters to show how far they were regulated by custom, - which, in those days, had as much force as laws made by the Parliament. We are practically going back to those days because, instead of allowing the law of competition to operate, we are endeavouring to strengthen and renew the old law of custom. When they attempted to fix prices they went very thoroughlyinto Hhe matter. They provided that no "" forestaller "" should be suffered to dwell in any town, "" forestaller "" being defined by them asAn open oppressor of poor people and an enemy of the whole shire and country, which for greediness and his private gain doth prevent others in buying grain, fish, herring, or any other thing to be sold, oppressing the poor and deceiving the rich, which carrieth away such things intending to sell them more dear, or those which inform stranger merchants their goods might be sold dearer than they intended to sell. When they proceeded to regulate prices they did not do anything in a half-hearted way. They did not merely fix the rates of wages without fixing the prices of products, as we are attempting to do. What is the use of regulating wages unless we also regulate the prices of food 1",13
12,Mr FOWLEE,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Are the two related 1,15
13,Mr CONROY,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Of course they ave.,15
14,Mr FOWLEE,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,The honourable and learned member is departing from the free-trade principle altogether.,15
15,Mr CONROY,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I am opposed to the regulation of wages and also to any attempt to regulate prices. They were very much interested in the price of ale in the old days, because it seems to have been one of the articles with regard to which they legislated most frequently. Some of the brewers evidently went beyond the mark, and they passed another Act regulating the price of ale, ac-' cording to the price of corn. They continued from time to time to pass certain ordinances, and one Act provided that "" wine shall be sold at a reasonable price."" Unfortuuately, as they pointed out shortly afterwards, wicked people would not understand the meaning of ""reasonable,"" but construed it as reasonable to gain something for themselves. During the plague that had taken place in London, such a large number of men had died that immediately afterwards the law of competition began to assert itself in spite of the law of custom, and we find an ordinance passed in 1349 reading as follows :We hereby enact that both payment and receipt of higher than the customary wages shall henceforth be illegal . . . . but the said servants have no regard of the said ordinance, but to their ease and singular covetise do withdraw themselves unless they have livery and wages to the double and treble of what they were wont to take to the great damage of the great men and the commonalty. It will be seen that they tried to regulate both prices and wages, because they saw that the rate of wages must be according to the cost of living. They provided that the butchers, bakers, brewers, and others should be bound to sell victuals for a reasonable price, and they went so far as to regulate the price of boots and shoes, and to fix the rents of the houses in the staple towns. They also fixed penalties for the storing of merchandise before it arrived at the staple towns. We find, furthermore, that it was stated in regard to the forestalling of herrings by the people, of Yarmouth thatPeople of Great Yarmouth do buy and forestall the herrings before they come to town, and the hostelers of same town do sell them at their own will as dear as they will, to the great damage of the King, the Lords, and all the people. It was then stated that the fish must be sold by day, and in the presence of others. We are now trying to do much the same thing. Legislation failed in the old days, and it will fail now, or, if successful, it will stamp out all human progress. Our forefathers were so possessed with the idea that no one should go out of his trade that they made a special ordinance making provision to that effect. We find the first instance of a true measure of arbitration-apar t from the assizes where the mayors met together and arranged matters^-as far back as the year 1355, when by statute it was declared that there should be six mediators to decide all questions arising between buyers and sellers. We are proposing three mediators, and are to that extent departing from the old custom. These six mediators met and absolutely decided all qestions arising between buyers and sellers, and we propose practically that three mediators shall perform the same office. What failed then will fail now. So far from the steps which we are now being asked to take marking a new era,, they will simply result in the revival of au old custom. In the dlden days they carried their regulations into everything. They did not stop halfway. Merchants were not allowed to enhance the prices of merchandise, and lest one merchant should interfere with another it was decreed that they should use only one class of goods. In 1336, during the reign of Edward - III . , chapter 6, we find it declared, "" The handicraftsman shall use but one mystery."" Of course, "" mystery"" is an old English word which means a trade. But they added, "" The women may work as they did."" That is the first instance upon record in which the women were not interfered with by regulation. In the same year, they decided to regulate the diet and the apparel of servants. They declared what meals servants should eat during the day, when they should be fed, and how much they should consume. They forgot to exact that they should all have the same digestions. They regulated the apparel and handicraft of the yeomen and their wives and children. They then went on to declare what apparel a gentleman under the estate of knights should wear and what esquires possessed of 200 marks of land should wear, and also their wives and children. They also prescribed the apparel of merchants, citizens, burgesses, and handicraftsmen, together with that of knights who had lands within the yearly value of 200 marks, and of knights and ladies who had lands within the yearly value of 400 marks. Similarly they declared whatapparel should be worn by the several sorts of clerks. I wish honourable members distinctly to understand that these were not in ' any sense of the word dead statutes. They prescribed the apparel which should be worn by thevarious kinds of clerks, by ploughmen, and others of mean estate, and set out the forfeitures which were to be exacted for offences against the ordinance. They further declaredClothiers shall make cloths sufficient of the aforesaid prices so that this statute for default such cloths be in no wise infringed. They realized perfectly well that if they did not achieve their object in that way a man might easily excuse himself by affirming that he had not the means with which to purchase these things. ",15
16,Mr CONROY,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"It was one of the worse possible forms of protection. Mr Thorold Rogers points out that, despite these restrictions, between 1370 and 1390 the price of labour increased by 59£ per cent, all round. It will not surprise honourable members to hear that they were all so thunderstruck with this result that they made still further efforts to settle the whole matter by statute. Accordingly, in 1368 they again enacted that the Statute of Labourers should be executed. Thus it will be seen that they still doggedly pursued the same methods. Notwithstanding that they were repeatedly compelled to acknowledge that the statutes had not been observed they went on in the same simpler-fashion--as if nothing had occurred-and with the same disregard of the inevitable result. In 1382, in the time of Richard IL , we find them declaring thatThose residing in the coastal districts shall not forestall fish. They also threw in a proviso about ""other victuals."" They saidThe fishmongers of London may not buy fresh fish to sell again, except eels. In 1388 this rise of prices still continued, despite the statutes which were designed to prevent it, and further penalties were then decreed for "" the giving or taking of more wages, than is necessary."" So imbued did they become with the idea that it was wicked for any man to depart from the occupation to which he was trained that they enacted that any one who had served in husbandly until he was twelve years old must continue in it for the rest of his life. Are we to make similar provisions 1 ",16
17,Mr CONROY,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Yes ; it is a case of more protection, which has always been the worse enemy of the workers. In 1389, however, they must have become conscious of the fact that it was not altogether right to fix the price of labour umless they could also determine the price of other commodities. Consequently they decreedBut forasmuch as a man cannot put the price of corn and other victuals in certain, it is accorded and assented that, the justices of peace in every of county in two of their sessions be Holden betwixt the Feast of Easter and St. Michaelthat is twice a year, and honourable members will observe that nothing is said about the observance of the "" common rule "" for a period of two or three years, as the case may be. shall make proclamation by their discretion, according to the dearth of victuals, how much ever}' mason, carpenter, tiler, and other craftsmen, workmen, and other labourers by the day as well in harvest as in other times of the year, after their degree shall take by the day with meat and drink, or without meat and drink, &c. They saw clearly that there was no chance of getting over the whole trouble unless they did this. As a result, they allowed it to be proclaimed by the justices of the peace at least twice in every session. They further saidAnd sheriffs, stewards of lords of franchise, mayors, and bailiffs, and all others that have assize of. bread and ale to keep, and the correction of the same, shall take no amerciament or fine for any default touching the assize, for the which a man or woman, by the law, ought to have bodily punishment. This makes itevident that the common sense of everybody except the legislators prompted them to evade the statutes. Then we find them attempting to regulate exactly what work belonged to one trade and what to another. Thus they decreed thatNo hosteller may make horse-bread in his hostelry nor without, but bakers shall make it ; unci the assize thereof shall be kept, and the weight be reasonable after the price of the corn in the market; and the same hostellers shall sell hay and oafcs after a reasonable price, so that they take not for the bushel but one halfpenny over the common price in the market.",16
18,Mr HENBY WILLIS,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,We are getting back to those conditions.,17
19,Mr CONROY,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Unquestionabl y we are. Seeing that they were endeavouring to do away with competition, we can easily understand a statute declaring that no man should have two trades. Thus we find them decreeing that ""no shoemaker shall be a tanner, and no tanner shall be a shoemaker."" As far back as 1390, regulations were operative which would delight the heart of the honourable member for Melbourne, because tliey recognised that shipowners ought to be extended some consideration. Consequently it was decreed thatAll merchants of the realm of England shall freight in the said realm the ships of the said realm and not strange shipsThe reason giveu for this is a very quaint one, as honourable members will see. It is so that the owners of the said ships take reasonable gains for the freight of the same. I can quite understand the joy with which the honourable member for Melbourne would endorse that statute. In fact, he has already endeavoured-and so has the right honourable member for South Australia, Mr. Kingston-to bring about similar results, hy doing away with a competition from the ocean boats which has been called unfair, but which, upon inquhy, proves to be of the mildest description. So much difficulty was found in regulating competition that eventually it was declared that it should not be right for any master to employ a labourer for a week ouly, because by so doiug he would be able to pay him according to the laws of supply and demand. Then, in 1402, it was declared that. Shoemakers and corclwainers may tan leather. Apparently at thip time they began to determine what things might be gilded with silver and gold and what might not. In 1414 a statute was enacted regulating the yearly wages of chaplains and parish priests. No doubt there was a customary wage for these people just as there was for everybody else, and persons who departed from it were regarded with very grave suspicion. I shall give the House various illustrations of the extent to which they carried out their system of regulating trade, and any one who has observed the operation of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act in New Zealand, as well as that in force in New South Wales, must realise that, when we come to regulate prices, we shall have to carry out this system to the same extent. They even passed a law declaring that patten-makers-that is the makers of clogs, such as are still used in the North of England-shoul d not employ asp wood in their manufacture. That law was deemed to be'necessary because there was not a very great supply of asp wood available, and the use of it by patten-makers caused the price to be raised against the shaft-makers. They declared also that no one should gild any sheaths or metals "" but silver and the ornaments of Holy Church."" In 1423 they declared that masons should not ""confederate themselves in chapters and assemblies,"" and that justices of the peace should punish servants, masons, &c, for taking unreasonable wages. They did not invariably set forth what the rates of wages should be, because they had to be determined according to the dearth or otherwise of victuals. If a man, charged with taking unreasonable wages, was able to show that the cost of living had increased, it was considered that there was some excuse for his action, and he was - allowed to remain at liberty; but if he could not do so he was committed ""to the House of Correction. In 1433 they declared also what the wax chandlers should take "" for their work of wax."" Then we find that in 1436 they declared a restraint of unlawful orders made by masters of guilds, fraternities, and other companies. It appears that these people desired to depart from the customary law. and to keep the whole trade in their own hands. This was considered to to be improper, and an effort was made to put a stop to it . In looking through these old laws one cannot fail to be struck by the enormous number of regulations that were made in relation to the woollen trade, which, of course, was then the greatest trade in England. The authorities appear to have been continually dealing with that industry. But I do not propose to do more than quote a few of the rules madeconcerning it. We find that - they declared again and again what the weavers and others were to take. In 1442 four wardens of the worsted-weavers of Norwich were appointed yearly to inspect and regulate the worsted industry in that city, while two were appointed for Norfolk. Two years later it was declared that a servant in husbandry "" purporting to depart from his master "" must give him half a year's warning. This is a curious instance of how far old customs still regulate many of our actions, for this principle is still observed in relation to leases. If one engages a man by the year and dismisses him without giving him six months' notice he is liable, or if he allows him at the end of the twelve months' period to continue in his employ without terminating the agreement, the law presumes that the servant has been engaged for another year, and he can recover accordingly. There is a later practice under which the notice has been cut down to three momths; but this is, indeed, a curious illustration of the way in which the effects of some of these old laws are still felt by us. It may readily be imagined that when the desire to regulate everything was abroad, the authorities did not forget to deal with the attorneys-atlaw. They did so in this wayWhereas it is a practice of contentious attorneys to stir up suits for their private profits this is to declare that there shall be but six in Norfolk and Suffolk, and two only in Norwich.",17
20,Mr FOWLER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,The present evil apparently existed in those days.,18
21,Mr CONROY,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,We have something of the same trouble even in these days.,18
22,Mr A MCLEAN,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,It is a matter for regret that that law has been abandoned.,18
23,Mr CONROY,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Possibl y it is ; but the continual desire for new laws only means work for more and more lawyers. I have already pointed out that the authoritiesdealt very thoroughly with the regulation of prices of apparel, and I desire to quotefrom another quaint law, 22 Edward IV . , 1482, in which it was declared that divers statutes and ordinances had been made touching the restraint of excessive apparel, and that by reason of the non due execution of the same the King's realm "" was fallen into great misery and poverty."""" Therefore it was provided thatNo person of whatever estate, degree, or condition shall wear any clothes of gold, or silk, or purple colour. Then we have a truly Kingstonian touch, if I may use that expression, in the words "" Penalty £ 2 0 . "" In the same statute the price of clothes worn by labourers was also dealt with, the law determining whether a piece of cloth should be sold at so much per yard or at so much for the piece. The clothing worn by the various knights was likewise dealt with, and a regulation was framed concerning the length of the gowns to be worn by all persons "" under the estate of a lord,"" in order that decency might be observed. The penalty for a contravention of this law was fixed at 20s., but I have not been able to discover why an exception was made in. the case of a lord. While they were dealing with all these matters, they did not forget the extent to which archery was practised in those days, and they took care to regulate the price of bows. It was also declared that if a man made a bow of one class, he should make, say, fo.ur of another, the desire being apparently that labour should be distributed equally amongst those employed in working up the different classes of wood, or else that a better class of goods should be obtained. In 1485, the duties of shoemakers, tanners and curriers were very clearly set forth in laws, and so much attention was paid to details that it was declared that the makers of new shoes should not meddle with the menders of old ones. . As far back as 1385, there had been almost serious trouble between the shoemakers and the cobblers, and the authorities determined the allotment of their work. The King actually had to enlist the services of the Lord Mayor of London to endeavour to settle the dispute which existed between these tradesmen. Some of the reasons given for the decisions are exceedingly amusing, but not one w h it less entertaining than are those given by Mr Justice Cohen in the New South Soutli Wales Conciliation and Arbitration Court, and by Mr Justice Cooper in the New .Zealand Court. When they drew up regulations in 1485, they declared that the shoemaker should not meddle with old shoes, the reason giveu for this determination being a very fair one as far as they were concerned. It was stated that the authorities did not want people to be deceived, and they went on to declare that if any one dealt with old shoes he should not meddle with new shoes.",18
24,Mr KINGSTON,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,They drew the line between maintenance and repairs and construction.,19
25,Mr CONROY,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Quite so. The cobblers said that if a new piece of leather was to be substituted for the old sole of a boot, the work should be done by them. The shoemakers declared, during the course of a fierce argument, that if a boot had to be half soled new leather might be used, but if the full length of the sole had to be replaced the work should go to the shoemaker and not to the cobbler. That is one of many in stances of the disputes which' occurred. In 14S7 a man was not allowed to sell by retailA broad yard of the finest scarlet grained or other grained cloth of the finest making xvi s., penalty xl s. Shortly afterwards a regulation was passed, which, if in force nowadays, would strike dismay into the heart of the honourable ber for Melbourne Ports. I dealt with the price of hats and caps, and declared thatNo hatter or capper shall sell any hat above the price of xx d. the best, nor any cap above ii s. the best, upon pain to forfeit xl s. for every cap sold above. And, later on, for the benefit of the cappers, they decreed that persons should wear a cap of wool knit thicker and fuller on the top of the head every Sunday and holiday. bring An even more drastic law was passed i regard to the land. I find that in the Isle of Wight only one farm was allowed every man, and a penalty was provided for offences with regard to what was called the "" the decaying of houses husbandry."" A man was not allowed to permit these houses to fall into a state decay, and the extent of land which should exist round each house was also Thus the proposal in regard to "" three acres and a cow "" had its foundation in a very ancient law. At that time the people were so limited in number that they were all under control, and custom became so strong that the great bulk of the people adhered strictly to it .",19
26,Mr KIRWAN,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,In Victoria and othei States a man is allowed only one selection. Is the honourable and learned member against that principle 1  arbitration 1,19
27,Mr CONROY,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I am trying to point out that the legislation which we are being asked to pass must prove ineffective. The object aimed at cannot be achieved unless we give the Court power to make common rules settling the prices of commodities as well as the rates of wages ; and I am showing that in the past people were not afraid to push their expedients to what they conceived te be their logical conclusions. I hope, by showing that in spite of much more thorough attempts to regulate industry and trade at a time when industrial relations were much less complex tlian they are now, nothing but failure came from the legislation introduced, to prove that the legislation now proposed cannot hope to succeed, and will hinder rather than help people in the gaining of comfortable livelihoods. In 1514 laws were passed reguabove lating the wages of several sorts of servants in husbandry, and of artificers and labourers; specifying the hours at which they should begin and end their day's memwork ; and even the time they should have fur meals and for sleep, the curious exception being made in favour of London workmen that they might continue to ask the viii d. wages which they were receiving before the hat or alteration of the law. During the reigns of Henry VIII . and Elizabeth the principle df competition exerted itself so strongly, and so little respect was paid to the customary laws, that the legislators tried very hard to people back to the old state of things. n They were successful only, so far ""as I can judge, in increasing the misery and poverty to of the community. That, of course, was not their object, but no other result came from their attempt to over-ride economic of laws. To show how far they proceeded in their attempts to regulate industry, I of will read the opening words of a Statute passed to control the rope-making industry declared. at the town of BurporfcMost humbly beseeching Your Highnesses, the Bailiffs, Burgesses, and other the inhabitants of your Town and Borough of Bxvrport, within your county of Dorset, that where they, out of time that no man's mind is to the contrary, have used and exercised to make, within the same, the most port of all the great cables, halsers, ropes, and all other tackling as well, for your Royal ships and navy, as for the most part of all other ships - within this realm, by reason whereof your said town was right well maintained and inhabited, your Highness and your subjects right well served until now of late many divers andevil disposed perspns, intending the destruction of yonr said town for their private lucre and advantage, have withdrawn themselves into the country in divers places, there taking farms, and using husbandly out of the said town, and also daily resort to your said town to buy and provide hemp, and thereof make cables, ropes, halsers, traces, halters, and other tackle, which cables, ropes, halsers, traces, halters, and other tackle, been by the said persons slightly and deceivably made, by reason whereof not only the buyers of the same been continually thereby deceived, but also the pricesof the said cables, halsers, traces, halters, and other 'tackle thereby greatly enhanced, and your said town or borough, by means thereof, is like utterly to be decayed, ruined, and desolated, if speedy remedy be not by Your Highness in the case provided.",19
28,Mr MAUGER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,What is the use of comparing those times with these 1,20
29,Mr CONROY,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"In those times men had to live in particular towns, and even in particular parts of a town, and the conditions of life were quite simple. If attempts to regulate industry failed then, they will fail still more signally now. Otherwise the lessons of history are of no use to us. For the information of those who are curious, I might add that, notwithstanding this legislation, the town utterly decayed. Acts were also pa3sed to prevent butchers from tanning the hides of the animals they killed, any butcher keeping ' a tan house being liable to a forfeit of 6s.' 8d. per day. In 1531 it was also decreed that no brewer should be a cooper, and mend or make his own casks. To show how clearly we are retrograding from our position of today, I may mention that recently a member of the Coopers' TJniOn waited upon a firm which employs a man to hammer tight the hoops on casks of tallow in their store, and informed them that an expert cooper should be employed to do the work.",20
30,Mr MAUGER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Is it not a fact that the man employed was being given merely labourer's wages for doing cooper's work 1,20
31,Mr CONROY,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"My information is that that is not the fact; that it was not the rate of wages that was in dispute, but the question whether the work was or was not such as should be done by a cooper.",20
32,Mr FOWLER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Are persons who are not members of the legal profession, to which the honourable and learned member belongs, allowed to practice law t",20
33,Mr CONROY,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"No ; though I cannot be held responsible for that I think, indeed, that I was to a great degree responsible for the alteration of the rules of the New South Wales Court regarding the admission of barristers. Prior to going to the Bar, I had lost everything I possessed, and had to go out surveying again. At the same time. I was continuing my legal studies. The rules of the Court, however, then provided that no student should do anything towards the earning of a livelihood during the year preceding his admission. Honourable members can imagine what I felt about such a rule as that. My sense of the injustice of that rule has made me always inclined to fight strongly against similar restrictions. I think that mo man should be allowed to hold himself out as being a member of a craft or profession unless he has' shown that he possesses the skill or knowledge required to enable him to undertake the work required from such' a person. I would, however, allow any man to plead the case of another in a Court if that other person was willing to allow him to do so. In 1532 the Act 24 Henry VIII . decreed that tanned leather should not be sold except in open fairs and markets after it had been searched and sealed, and ordinances were passed declaring how curriers should do their work, and what tools they should use. Then we have this enactment in regard to the dyers' tradeNo person shall dye or alter any woollen cloth or hats or caps, unless the same .be perfectly boiled, grained, or maddered upon the woad, in good cork or orchal . . . . No dyer shall occupy Brazil in the dying of woollen cloths hats or caps, nor anything but grain only in the dying of scarlet. Then because it was thought that prices of food were too dear, the following law was passedBeef, pork, mutton and veal shall be sold by weight called avoirdupois. No person shall take for a pound of beef or pork above a halfpenny, nor for a pound of mutton or veal above a half-farthing, and' less in those counties where they be sold for less. I am using, as far as possible, the words of the old statutes, to facilitate reference by honourable members who wish to go more fully into this matter for themselves. In order to encourage the growing of hemp for the making of cables and other tackling, they insisted upon a certain amount of hemp or flax being sown. W it h regard to the butchers - I suppose upon the representation that the sheep and cattle were too dear, and prices too high-it was provided thatGovernors of cities and market towns upon complaint to them made of any butcher refusing to sell victual by weight may commit the offender tilt he hath paid all penalties and may sell or cause to be sold by weight all such victual for ready money to be delivered to the owner ; and if any grazier, farmer, brewer, drover, &c, refuse to seU his fat cattle to a butcher upon such reasonable price as he .may retail it at the price assessed, the Justices of the Peace, Mayors or Governors shall cause indifferent persons to set the prices of the same which if the owner refuse to accept then the same Justices of the Peace, Mayors or Governors shall bind him to appear in the next term in the star chamber. The cases which I have quoted point to a very thorough regulation of industry. No half measures were taken. The legislators of those times acted with a thoroughness and an earnestness which should commend itself to us. We cannot but admire their fearlessness in pushing their ideas to their logical conclusion.",20
34,Mr MAUGER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,In whose interest was this legislation passed 1,21
35,Mr CONROY,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"That of the workers. The A ct as to sowing hemp and flax was passed on behalf of the poor rope-makers, because the prices of their material were raised so outrageously that they could not live. It appears that after the statute was passed in 1532 fixing the prices of beef and mutton, it was found that a mistake was made in one respect. It was recognised that butchers could not sell mutton at such prices as were fixed, unless they were able to buy their sheep at a fair rate. It was therefore decreed in the following year thatGovernors of cities and market towns, upon complaint to them made of any butcher refusing to sell victual by weight, according to the statute of 24 Henry VIII . , clause 3, may commit the offender to ward until he hath paid all penalties limited by the said statute ; and may sell, or cause to be sold b}' weight, all such victual for ready money, to be delivered to the owner. Now we have an instance of the fairness and zeal with which they regelated all these matters, and how they tried to discriminate between class and class. It was provided thatAnd if any grazier, farmer, breeder, drover, &c., refuse to sell his fat catjtle to a butcher upon such reasonable price, as he may retail it at the price assessed by the statute, the justice of peace, mayors, or governors, shall cause indifferent persons to set the prices of the same, which, if the owner refuse to accept, then the same justices, etc., shall bind him to appearthe next term in the Star-Chamber, to be punished as the King's counsel shall think good. In 1353 they proceeded to regulate the prices of victuals by means of an ordinance which reads as follows :Forasmuch as dearth, scarcity, good, cheap, and plenty of cheese, butter, capons, heus-, chickens, and other victuals necessary, for man's sustenance, happeneth, riseth, and chancefch of so many and divers occasions, that it is very hard and difficult to put any certain prices to any such thingsI am sure that with the complexity of our latter daj' conditions, it will be found more difficult than it proved at that time. and yet, nevertheless, the prices of such victuals be many times enhanced and raised by the greedy covetousness and appetites of the owners of such victuals by occasion of ingrossing and regrating the same, more than upon any reasonable or just ground or cause, to the great damage and impoverishing of the King's subjects That shows clearly that these laws were passed entirely on behalf of the great mass of the people.",21
36,Mr MAUGER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Had the great mass of the people any say in the matter whatever t,21
37,Mr CONROY,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"The legislation was passed entirely in their interests, and many of these Ordinances were made in accordance with petitions received from what were called "" Your Majesty's poor subjects.""",21
38,Mr FOWLER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,The poor of England have never been so well off as at that period.,21
39,Mr CONROY,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Professor Thorold Rogers fixes the period at which the poor people of England were most favourably situated as between 1370 and 1400. He says that the improvement in tlieir condition was due to the operation of the law of competition. He in effect says they had then managed to get beyond the law of custom, and it was not until the supply of labour became a little too great that the statutes were able to be used as instruments to grind down the people. He points out further that at that period wages did not depend altogether upon the prices of victuals, which were lower than for a century before. He also points out that the condition of the working classes was largely due to the fact that many of the workmen were able to obtain land, and that what was known as the stock-lease system of farming was attended with great advantage to the people. The Statute from which I have been q u o t in g contains the f o l l o w i ng c o n d it i o n All farmers, owners, broggers and all other victuallers whatsoever having or keeping any of the kinds of victuals afore rehearsed, to the intent to sell, shall sell the same to such of the King's subjects as will buy them, at such prices as snail be set and taxed by the said proclamation, upon the pains to be expressed and limited in the said proclamation, to be lost, forfeited, and levied King's use, in such wise as by tion shall be declared.",21
40,Mr MAUGER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,The r e were no such stitution s as Trades Unions in those days.,22
41,Mr CONROY,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"The unions of that had the force of Parliament behind them to other, assist them in their exclusiveness, and, curiously enough, some of the rules made by latter-day unions have been of a similar character. They understood in t i m even then, and in 1453 we find, according to the Bishop of E l y , who wrote to twenty-one shoemakers meeting together outside the town , summoning three of the the master shoemakers. to meet them, and A saying that If any work for the same wage as heretofore, for twelve months and a day, they would have leg or an arm off him unless he took the oath. I do not wish to push that resem1533 blance too far , however, because I recogcloth-makers nise that there is a wider spiri t of c h a in the unions of today t h a n existed in unions of the fourteent h century. I a decree was passed with regard to the law applying to the whole State. sale of fish. It was then declared that they those who actually laboured in the catching of the fish should be the o n l y persons to sell it at the fairs. Therefore the greatest refused anxiet y was shown to prevent the raising of the prices against the consumers. No w come to au Act dealing with the number sheep to be kept by any one person, and we accordance find the reasons given in a very curious of the c it y of Worcester. fashion. The Act readsForasmuch as divers and sundry persons of the King's subjects of this realm, to whom God of His gpoclness hath disposed great plenty and abundance of moveable substance now of late within few years, have daily studied, practised, and invented ways and means how they might accumulate and gather together into few hands, as well great multitude of farms as great plenty of cattle, and in especial sheep, putting such lands as they can get to pasture, and not to tillage, whereby they have not only pulled down churches and towns, and enhanced the old rates of the rents of the' possessions of this realm, or else brought it to such excessive fines that no poor man is able to meddle with it , but also have raised and enhanced the prices of all manner of corn, cattle, wool, pigs, geese, hens, chickens, eggs, and such other almost double above the prices which have been accustomed ; by reason whereof a marvellous multitude ancl number of the people of this realm be not able to provide meat, drink, and clothes necessary for themselves, their wives and children, but be so discouraged with misery and poverty that they fall daily to theft, robbery, and other inconveniences, or pitifully die of hunger and cold. to the In order to put an end to this it was the same proclamaenacted that No person or persons from the Feast of St. in - Michael the Archangel, which shall be in the year of our Lord God, 1535, shall keep, occupy, or have in his possession, in his own proper lands, day nor in the possession lands nor grounds of any which he shall have or occupy in farm, nor otherwise have of his own proper cattle, in use possession or property by any manner of means fraud, craft or covin, above the number of two thousand sheep at one time, within any part of i d at i o n this realm of all sorts and kinds.",22
42,Mr EOWLER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Thos e were the days when Cromwell, sheep were more valuable than men.",22
43,Mr CONROY,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"The s e enactments had same object in view as the A r b it r at i o n c t s which have been passed in N e w Zealand, Western Australia , and N e w South Wales, and the Bill now before us. They a went so far as to state what k in d of leather should be used by bookbinders. In an Act was passed dealing with the of Worcestershire, and this r i ty affords a singular instance of how far they the attempted to carry the i r regulations. We n 1533 are now proposing to make a common But f o u nd out in the sixteenth century that they could n ot do that, because it drove people from one place to another. The trade to be regulated, and we know that it is impossible for any trade to be regulated by we men who have no interest in it , and no of knowledge of it . This Act was passed in with a petitio n from the people It reads as f o l lows :Sheweth unto the King our Sovereign Lord, and to the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and to the Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, that citizens, burgesses and inhabitants of the city of Worcester, and of the towns of Evesham, Doitwich, Kederminster, and Bromisgrove, within the County of Worcester, that where the said city, boroughs and towns bave been in times past well and substantially inhabited, occupied, maintained and upholden, by reason of making of woollen cloths, called long cloths, short cloths and other cloths,-as well whites, blues, and brown blues, and the poor people of the same city boroughs and towns, and of the country adjoining to them, daily set a work, as in spinning, carding, breaking and ""sorting of wools, and the handicrafts there inhabiting, as weavers, fullers, shear men and dyers, have been well set a work, and had sufficient living by the same, until now within few years past, that' divers persons inhabiting and dwelling in the hamlet, thorps, and villages adjoining to the said city, boroughs, and towns within the said shire, for their private wealths, singular advantages, and commodities, nothing regarding the maintenance and upholding of the said city, boroughs, and towns; ne the commonwealth of the said handicrafts inhabiting and dwelling within the said city, boroughs, and towns; ne the poor people which had living by the same, have not only ingrossed and taken into their hands divers and sundry farms, and become farmers, graziers, aud husbandmen ; but also do exercise, use and occupy the mysteries of cloth making, weaving, fulling and shearing, within their said houses, and do make all manner of cloths, as well broad cloths, whites and plain cloths, within their said houses in the countries abroad, to the great decay, depopulation, and ruin of the said city, towns, and boroughs. For remedy whereof, and for the amendment and good advantage of the said city, boroughs, aud towns, be it enacted by authority of this present Parliament, that after the last day of September, whioh shall be in the year of onr Lord God 1536, no manner of person or persons, of what degree or condition soever he or they be of, shall make or cause to be made within the said shire of Worcester, any manner of woollen cloths to be sold, except ouly such person or persons as after the said last day of September shall be dwelling and inhabiting within the said city of Worcester, the boroughs and towns of Evesham, Droitwich, Kederminister, and Bi-omisgrove within the said county of Worcester, or in any one of them, upon pain of forfeiture for every such broadcloth made after the said da}' by any person or persons contrary to the true meaning of this Act. Therefore, they decreed that these unfortunate men should not work in the country districts, and tliey prescribed the towns in Worcestershire in which the making of cloths should be carried on. As they saw that the migration of the people, back from the country to the cities must not be interfered with, they further decreed that the rents of the houses in the towns should not be increased beyond the rates which had prevailed for the previous twenty years. This Act continued operative for twelve years. Then it was decreed that cloths, white and coloured, under certain sizes, were to be carried over the sea unbarbed and unshorn. The idea underlying that Act was to provide employment to shearmen. In 1535 they laid down the customs to be observed in the leather trade, and how it was to be conducted on the sea. It was also decreed that no one having a tan-house should be allowed to transport any leather. Quite recently, in New South Wales, Mr. Justice Cohen has been endeavouring to regulate the wages which shall be paid to employees in restaurants. In this connection it is interesting to note that in 1541 a certain Act under which butchers could sell by weight or otherwise was repealed. The repealing statute declaresAfter the said first day of August no person nor persons should take or cause to be taken for any pound weight of flesh of the carcases of beef or pork, by him or them to be sold, above the price of one half-penny and half-farthing, without deceipt or covin, upon payment or forfeit for every pound not sold by weight, or above the said price limited, aud for every default done contrary to the true meaning of the said Act 3s. 4d., the one moiety thereof to be to your Highness, and the other moiety to the party that will sue for the same by bill, plaint, or information, in which suit no essoin, wager of law, nor protection should be allowed. The head, next inwards, portnances, legs, nor feet to be accounted as part of the carcases aforesaid, but such to be sold by a lower price, &c. They omitted to prescribe what the exact price should be*. Seeing that in times past, when our present means of locomotion were unknown, when men were born and lived and died within a radius of five miles, the law of competition still asserted itself, despite all these regulations, is it not reasonable to suppose that it will assert itself again today 1 Is it not clear that our efforts to regulate wages must fail 1 I cannot conceive of a greater injury being done to the masses of the workers than w i ll be done by restricting their endeavours at bargaining. As evidencing how thoroughly the British Parliament dealt with these matters, I may mention still another example which is to be found in an Act relating to the manufacture of pins. It appears that when the Pinners Act was passed, it prescribed how pins were to be made. Consequently it was set out thatNo person or persons, from and after the first day of August then next ensuing, should vent, Or put to sale, by retail, in gross or otherwise, any manner pins within this realm, but ouly such as should be double headed, and have the heads Soldered fast to the shank of the pin, well smoothed, the shank well shaven, the point well and round filed,, canted and sharp. By the way, the honourable member for Darling remembers perfectly well having seen this very class of pins. Probably he is one of the very few honourable members who have seen them. It appears, however, that the pin-makers did not carry out their promise, because the Act continuesAt which time the pinners plainly affirmed and' promised to serve the King's liege people well and sufficiently, and at a reasonable price. And forasmuch jis since the making of the said Act there hath been scarcity of pins within this realm, and the King's liege people have not been well or competently sewed of such pins nor are likely to be served, nor the pinners of this realm, according to their said promiseThey had evidently understood the a r t of not making too many pins in order that the price might be kept up. That is stance of the way in which Parliament endeavoured to get level with the pinners. Seeing that attempts were made to regulate wages in all these matters, it can easily be understood that any departure from the old methods of brewing beer would arouse strong tan opposition. Consequently we find an Act which provided for the making of malt, tanning which reads thusWhere divers and sundry persons taking upon them the art and mystery of malt making, and sundry other persons tendring more their own private lucre, gain and profit than the wholesome victualling of the King's Majesty, the nobility of this realm, and other his gracious subjects, have now of late by their insatiable, covetous, and measures ?greedy minds accustomably and commonlj made much malt unpure and unseasonable; for that only with the indulgence of the House. they had made the same malt in eight or nine days, where indeed the same cannot be well and perfectly made unless it have the time and of twenty-one days in the making thereof: where also divers and sundry of the said makers of malt commonly have and do slackly and deceitfully dry the malt so by them made; for that they would have an inordinate increase thereof by the swelling of the the same malt not being sufficiently dried cannot be kept any long time or space, but it will be musty and full of weevilsOf course the real reason was that the more enterprising had discovered the new process of d r y i ng malt, and were using it in t h a for m . This caused the old maltsters who were wedded to custom to put for w a r d the can. objections which I have emunerated. The Act continuesThat the justices of peace in every of their session, and also the steward in every leet, shall of have full power and authority by virtue of Act to enquire, hear and determine, as well presentment of twelve men, as by accusation information of two honest witnesses, or for and upon all and every the offences and forfeitures aforesaid, as well for the King as for the party that shall sue, procure or cause the same to presented as is before said. And that the bailiffs and constables of every borough or market town, or other town, where any such malt as shall made or put to sale, shall have full power aud authority from time to time to view, search, survey all such malt as shall be made or put sale within any of the said towns : and if them shall thereupon find any malt so put to sale being evil*made or mingled with evil malt, contrary to the tenure and true meaning of this present Act; that then the said bailiff or constable so finding any such malt evil made or mingled as aforesaid, with the advice of .one justice of peace within the same shire, shall cause the same to Mr Conroy. sold to such person or persons, and at Such a reasonable price or prices, and under the common price of the market as to his discretion shall seem necessar}' and expedient. In dealing with the tanners they wen t still an in - f u r the r by decreeingNo tanner shall put any tanned leather to sale (saving calf skins) tanned and mixed with ashen bark tapworth, meal or culver dung, and unless it hath laen in the tan-ozes sufficient^ wrought three-quarters of the year at least; nor shall overburn with hme any hides nor shall set his fats in hills, or shall put any hot liquor of ozes in the fats wherein hides shall be put to tanning ; or Shall practice any other way for the over speedy of hides, or whereby they shall be burned or scalled ; or shall cut any hides of steer or cow to make clout leather thereof; or shall tan any sheepskin""; upon pain to forfeit the same leather.",22
44,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Does not the honourable and learned member think that he has sufficiently established the a n t i q u i ty of these 7,24
45,Mr CONROY,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Of course, I can proceed I am endeavouring to point out the various space attempts which have been made to regulate and all classes of in d u s try .",24

49,Mr CONROY,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"In pointing to the manner in which they regulated all manner trades in England, I omitted to this quote one Act which was passed in 1494, by and which had reference to feather-beds, or pillows, and bolsters. It reads thusThat whereas divers persons without the realm of England, out of the said city, make and do to be be made unlawful and false wares and merchandises, to the great rebuke and slander of the said eraft and also great jeopardy, loss, and deceit be to the King's subjects, wherefore there is no sufficient remedy purveyed, for so much as the and same wardens have no power nor authority to to make due search of such false, deceivable wares any of and merchandises put to sale out of the city, as they have power and authority within the same city, as in feather beds, bolsters, and pillows, made of two manner of corrupt stuffs, that is to say, of scalded feathers and dry pulled feathers together, and of flocks and feathers together, which is contagious for man's body to he be on, and also in quilts, mattresses, and cushions stuffed with horse hair, fenn down, neats hair, deers hair, and goats hair, which is wrought in lime fats, and by the heat of man's body the savour and taste is so abominable and contagious, that many of the King's subjects have thereby beeu destroyed. They declared that none of these things should be used, and that a man ought to be utterly danined if he employed them. Tn 1549 they decreed that cattle, butter, and cheese must be sold at the fairs and markets, and it was only three years later that they declared who should be allowed to buy and sell wool, "" and at what times,"" and who should not do so. also passed an Act limiting the persons "" who shall weave or make broad woollen cloth,"" and an Act against regrators, forestallers, and ingrossers. In the same year they rehearsed their former statement about l;he stuffing of feather beds, bolsters, mattrasses, and cushions, and passed an Act to prevent the use of gigmills on the ground that their employment would be an injury to those engaged in the trade. In the following year another Ac t was passed for the "" Assize of Fuel,"" and still another affecting the buying and currying of leather. In 1554 an Act was passed restricting the carrying of corn, victuals, and wood over-seaby reason whereof the said corn, victuals, and wood are grown unto a wonderful deartli, and oxtreme prices, to the great detriment of the Commonwealth. In - Mary's time they declared who might carry on the trade of the making of "" ruffles, sattens, satten reverses, and fustians,"" in Norwich. Four wardens were appointed, and were given full authority to deal with the trade, and no one was allowed to practice or occupy the trade unless he had been apprenticed for the full term of seven years. It had already provided that no butcher should be a tanner, and the several duties of tanners, curriers, and shoemakers were also set forth. In 1562 what was probably the greatest of these Acts was passed, for it brought together a greater number of the old laws than any other measure had done. Another provision was that oaks were to be felled "" in barking time only."" deavoured to deal practically with every subject in an Act commonly known as 5 Elizabeth, Chap. 4. I make no excuse for reading an extract from this law, because it is very much on the lines of the Bil l before us, and the reasons given for the passage of the Act were very similar to those now advanced in support of this Bill, The Act set forth thatAlthough there remain and stand in force presently a great number of Acts and. Statutes concerning the retaining, departing, wages and orders of apprentices, servants and labourers, as well in husbandry as in divers other arts, mysteries and occupations ; (2) yetHere we have a naive confession of the weakness of legislation to deal with this questionpartly for the imperfection and contrariety that is found, and doth appear in-sundry of the said laws, and for the variety and number of them; (3) and chiefly for that the wages and allowances . They limited and rated in man}' of the said statutes, are in divers places too small and not answerable to this time, respecting the advancement of prices of all things belonging to the said servants, and labourersHonorable members will see that they recognised that when they sought to regulate wages, they must also seek to regulate prices(4) The said labourer cannot conveniently, without the great grief and burden of the poor labourer and hired man, be put in good and due execution : (5) And as the said several Acts and Statutes were, at the time of the making of them, thought to be very good and beneficial for the Commonwealth of this realm (as divers of them are :) So if the substance of as many of the said laws as are meet to be continued, shall be digested and reduced into one sole law and statute, and in the same an uniform order prescribed and limited concerning the wages and other order for apprentices, servants, and labourersThis is very significantthere is good hope that it will come to pass, that the same law (being duly executed) should banish idleness, advance husbandry, and yield, unto the hired person, both in the time of scarcity and in the time of plenty, a convenient proportion of wages. That is exactly what we are proposing today in this Bill. If there is one argument more than another which is continually being advanced in support of this measure, it is that we should give the labourer a convenient proportion of wages. The people of England tried to do so in these early days, and went further than .we have any idea of going. I must say also that they dealt with the question in They en- a much more logical way than we are proposing to deal with it . They carried this system of regulation so far that any man who was under the age of thirty years, and had been trained in one art or trade, was required to retain that art or trade. It was declared that he should not depart from it . It was provided that a master should not be allowed to dismiss his servant except in certain circumstances, the Act declaring that certain penalties should be incurred by any master, mistress, or dame who, having retained a Servantshall put away the same servant before the end of his term, unless it be for some reasonable and sumcient cause, to be allowed before two justices of the peace. Instead of requiring the parties to go before two justices of the peace, we declare that they shall go before a Justice of the High Court and two assessors. What is the ' difference ? I fail to see that tliere is any difference between the two positions. A man was not allowed to put away his servant without reasonable cause, and the servant was not allowed to depart from his master unless he also could show reasonable cause for so doing. He was bound to work for him, and to do his work-as one Act quaintly put it - "" honestly and willingly."" We provide in this Bil l that assessors shall be called together to meet and discuss questions relating to wages. But in this old law it was provided thatForthe declaration aud limitation and what wages servants, labourers, artificers, either by the or day, or otherwise, shall have and receive, be enacted by the authority of this present ParUaevident, ment that the justices of peace of every shire and the sheriff of that county . . . and every mayor, bailiff or other head officer within or town corporate wherein is any justice of . . . shall yearly at every general sessions to be Holden and kept after Easter, or time convenient within six weeks nextfollowing . . assemble themselves together; und . . . calling unto them such discreet and grave persons "" said county . . . as they shall think meet, conferring together respecting the plenty scarcity of the time and other circumstances necessarily to be considered"" Other okcumstances necessarily to be conParliament, sidered."" That is' a very simple way of stating the position. I wish we would deal with it in the same fashion. The law tinuedshall have authority by virtue thereof. . Umit, rate, and appoint the wages. This is the most comprehensive Act that has ever been passed in any country; but entirely failed to effect its object. object was to neutralise the operation the law of competition, ceeded only in destroying so far as the labourers were concerned, because, to a certain extent, they could avoid it. It tended to keep them in poverty, and this law, in company with the Poor Mr Conroy. Law of Elizabeth, was really the means of bringing the workmen of England to the position they occupied at the beginning of the present century. That is the opinion which I have formed, after gathering together many historical facts relating to this question.",24
50,Mr FOWLER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,That is about the time that the process of disinheriting the poor commenced.,26
51,Mr CONROY,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Exactly . I shall not. weary the House with quotations from many more of these statutes, but I shall now give what appears to me to be a complete admission by these old authorities of the failure of their legislation. It appearsthat a statute relating to the price of casksfor ale and beer had been passed, but that the rate fixed was rather too low, and a, law was therefore passed declaring that whereassuch as do make the said vessels cannot make and sell any such barrels . . . at the prices expressed . . . bub to their great loss and hindrance, whereby the mystery,, trade, and faculty of the said coopers is utterly overthrown, year to the impoverishment and utter undoing of them, it their wives, children, and families, as is most. . . the price of these vessels should be ""rated any city anew, and forfeiture should take place peace if they were not sold at the rate fixed. first When they discovered that this old law had at some tended to the impoverishment of the coopers, one would have thought that the of the utter futility of endeavouring to deal and with these matters by legislative enactment, or would have forced itself upon their minds. But nothing of the sort occurred. They seem to have ascribed a new power to and to have said, "" Let us make another start."" In the Act in which this declaration was made, it was set forth that cona new beginning would be made. That is a marvellous instance of the desire for un. to necessary interference on the part of Parliaments- a desire on the part of men to interfere with matters which it is really impossible it for Parliament to regulate. Passing over a Its number of these old Acts, I come now to of one which I think indicates the difficulty but it sucthat may arise in dealing with these quescompetition, tions. A famous dispute occurred in 1604 between the plasterers and painters! The not "" villains of plasterers,"" according to the quaint language of the painters who were making a protest, had interfered with the painting trade, and we find that a law was accordingly passed setting forth thatWhereas the plaisterers . . . . using nothing but lathing, dawbing, plaistering and liming did and yet do procure thereby, for themselves and their families, a convenient living and maintenance : yet not satisfied with that reasonable living . . . . have now of late used and practised the art and mystery of painters-stainers, as well with oil colours, as size coloursThe painters considered that the plasterers had not been trained as perfectly as they were in the art-and that they should be liable to certain penalties if they engaged in .this work. There was a proviso, howeverThat it shall and may be lawful to and for any of the company of plaisterers, or their servants or apprentices, to lay and use whiting, blacking, red lead, red-okar, yellow-okar, and ruffet, mingled with size only, and not with oil. If they mingled the paint with oil the plasterers were not at liberty to use it, but if they mixed it with size they were allowed to carry on this work. Was not that trouble really in keeping with what is happening today in New South Wales and New Zealand ? Are not lines of demarcation being drawn between the various trades ? Is there not at the present time a big dispute in West Sydney as to the work which relates to the shipwrights and the joiners employed in the ship-building trade 1 I need scarcely refer to the still greater strikes on the Tyne in the years 1891-2-3.",26
52,Mr D BAKIN,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,On e of the greatest disputes that ever occurred in New York was due to a difference between two unions.,27
53,Mr CONROY,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"In 1632 a serious struggle took place between the carpenters and joiners, and an endeavour was made to determine the work relating to each trade. The disputants were very fortunate in that case, as they were able to hit upon a common ground. When they came to deal with the making of coffins they determined that it was work in which .. both carpenters and joiners might engage. Quite a number of Acts were passed in the reign of Charles II . to regulate the price of coal and the measures in which it should be sold, and a celebrated statute was enacted fOr the encouragement of the woollen manufacture, which provided that no person should be buried in linen, flax, or hemp. No person shall be buried in any shirt, sheet, shift, or shroud made of any material but sheeps' wool only.",27
54,Mr TUDOR,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Were inspectors sent round to see that the law was obeyed 1,27
55,Mr CONROY,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"A Justice of the Peace, a clergyman, or some other proper person was required to make an affidavit to that effect. I may add that an exception was made in the case of persons who had died of the plague. In 1698 an Act was passed for determining differences by arbitration. I think that that is the first instance in which the expression is used, though I have shown that the procedure of arbitration was resorted to much earlier. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports should be able to find comfort from the wording of that measure. Whereas it has been found by experience thst references made by rule of Court have contributed much to the ease of the subject in the determining of controversies, because the parties become thereby obliged to submit to the award of the arbitrators, under the penalty of imprisonment for their contempt in case they refuse submission. The Act was not intended to deal altogether with the differences arising between masters and workmen, but rather with differences which .might be brought before a court of law. In conjunction with subsequent Acts, however, it had the effect of creating rules which were practically the same as the common rules which are to be made by the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. I pass by various Acts which were passed in the reign of George I . for the encouragement of the manufacture of woollens and silk, though I may mention in passing that they even framed enactments regulating the manufacture of bricks and tiles; and the size of the bricks used now in this country is laid down in some of those Acts. Not oaly were decrees passed in regard to the size and'process of manufacture, but it was required that clay should be dug out of the pits only during one-half of the year, and the bricks burned only during the other half of the year. In 1747 the Act 20 George II . 19 was passed to deal withAll complaints, differences, and disputes ' which shall happen and arise between musters or mistresses and servants in husbandry who shall be hired for one year or longer . . . or between masters and mistresses and' artificers, handicraftsmen, miners, colliers, keelmen, potters, glassmen, pitmen, and other labourers. Where is the difference between that provision and our proposal to refer these matters to a Justice of the High Court and to assessors t I cannot see any difference. That Act failed, and in 1756 Parliament passed another Act for the better regulation of the woollen manufacture, and for preventing disputes amongst the persons concerned in it . The measure fixed the prices of piecework for the express purpose of preventing the cutting clown of rates and underselling. In otber words, it was an Act against sweating.",27
56,Mr WILKS,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Who agitated for the repeal of all this legislation 1 The masters or the men? .,28
57,Mr CONROY,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"The last of these restrictive statutes seem to have been passed about 1756. During the next twenty years, many complaints were made by operatives and others against them, and a distinct change occurred in the feeling of the House of Commons on the subject. The petitions that came before the House were referred to Committee after Committee, who sat and took evidence. M.r. WILKS - But the labouring people concerned had no representation in Parliament then. There was no broad franchise.",28
58,Mr CONROY,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"No ; but none the less their complaints were inquired into. It is curious to note the struggle which was going on in men's minds as to the wisdom or unwisdom of allowing competition to be unrestricted. Finally the conclusion was come to that the best way to help the labourer was to abolish the many evil laws and restrictions which had so long hindered him. As late as 1757, however, an Act was passed which provided thatThe Court shall set as size and weight of bread and price to be paid for same as often as Court shall think proper, and respect shall be had by the Court to the price which the Grain, Meal or Flour shall bear in the public market, making from time to time reasonable allowance to the makers of bread for sale for thoir charges, pains, livelihood, and profit as such Court shall deem proper. Then follow about eighteen pages of regulations. Men had been so hindered from leaving one trade and entering another, and had become so enslaved that in 1775 it had become necessary for Parliament to pass a law providing that coal miners did not pass with the sale of the land upon which they were employed. In 1800 an Act was - passedfor settling disputes that may arise between masters and workmen engaged in the cotton manufacture in that part of Britain called England. After reciting thatWhereas considerable abuses have for several years last past subsisted in. the trade or manufacture of cotton weaving in that part of Great Britain called England to the great oppression of the persons employed in the manufacture thereof and concerned therein an' manifest hindrance and injury of the trade ; and whereas it will be a great convenience and advantage to all parties concerned in such trade and an encouragement to the manufacture that a cheap and summary mode be established for settling all disputes that may arise in respect thereof between the masters and workmen engaged in the said tradeProvision is made for the appointment of arbitrators, whose award shall be final ; but if they did not agree and make an award within three days, the points in difference were to be heard and determined by a Justice of the Peace. In 1804 a very similar enactment was passed. I submit that I have now proved my case so far as it depends upon a statement of what has been done by Parliament in times gone by. I can understand legislation to compel men to resort to arbitration under pain of a penalty for not doing so, but the measure goes so much beyond that that I cannot support it, because I have shown that all attempts to compel the observance of awards have failed and must fail. It is somewhat singular that I have been able to find no statutes whose provisions are directed towards the improvement of the conditions of persons engaged in domestic and agricultural service, though I do not see how such an improvement could be effected by Act of Parliament. We often hear of men striking for higher wages, but what they should strike for, if it were possible to obtain it, is better employment. While I have confined my quotations to English. Acts of Parliament, I could also quotesimilar legislation from the statute-books of labour, Germany, and France. The French laws, passed during a period of 1,000 years were found so oppressive that they were finally abolished by the people themselves. So much bitterness was felt at the limitation of trade which they created that many of the leaders of the corporations which the laws had been passed to protect were guillotined at the time of the Revolution, and the people re-affirmed, in the famous declaration of rights in 1797, the words that Turgot. had used sixteen years before, theinalienable right of every man to the possession of his own labour and industry ; his right to be able to sell and dispose of his labour as seemed to. him best.",28
59,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,But the labourer is now being robbed by the capitalistic portion of the community.,29
60,Mr CONROY,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"There may be disputes between employers and employed, but there can, or rather should, never be a fight between capital and labour. Theymustalways go hand-in-hand. It should be made perfectly plain that capital must be encouraged by eveiy means in our power. It has been created by labour, and we should do all we can for its security. The mediaeval legislator tried to fix wages, and also to even fix the labourer to the station and place in which he was born. Even the consumer was not left to his own devices, but laws were made as to his food, his drink, and his garments. Custom and law bound industry with strong bonds, and progress has consisted in breaking them, and substituting for the commands of the State freedom of contract, and freedom of competition. Nor is most of the factory legislation in contravention of this, because, for the greater part, it assures the health and education of children, and by checking the licence of a few gives real freedom to thousands.",29
61,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,The last admission breaks down the whole of the case of the honourable and learned member.,29
62,Mr CONROY,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"No , it does not. I said "" real freedom."" I admit that it is very hard to define the strict boundary at which the State should cease to make laws. But so far as my knowledge and experience go-anc l I have not spoken, I hope, with positive assurance- I believe that we sliould at least try to break some fresh ground instead of going back to the musty fusty past, and adopting measures which have proved to be failures. Let us adopt only that which is soundest and best. I submit that we are not being asked to do that at present. The annual labour of every nation is the fund which originally supplies it with all the necessaries and conveniences of life, and now the wealth of the nation is given to the workers more and more, and in better proportion to the value of their work, than in the past. Yet it was only within the last century that the law of competition came into full force. Before that custom ruled everything, and the labourer did not get so large a share of the results of his work as at present. To my mind industrial liberty means a maximum of individual freedom with a minimum of Government control, and is historically the outcome of centuries of striving against all kinds of rigid customs, caprices of arbitrary power, and governmental regulation of industry, which, for the most part, have been either useless or mischievous. The principle of competition applied to wages works towards the payment of equal wages for equal efficiency, and no scheme of socialism ever aimed at more perfect equality. W it h competition in full play the demand every day should absorb the whole available supply of labour. Sometimes the operation of this law is rude and imperfect, because of the want of proper organization on the part of labour. The very basis of perfect - competition is perfect liberty, but there is a difficulty in practice, because labour in not properly organized. It appears to me that the remedy lies rather in teach- ing labour how to organize itself so that true collective bargaining can be brought into play. An HONOBABLE MEMBER - What chance has organized labour against organized capital ?",29
63,Mr CONROY,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Organized capital is helpless without labour - If history proves anything it is that the condition of labour is steadily improving and that today it is infinitiveiy better than it was 100 years ago.,29
64,Mr MAUGER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Relativel y !,29
65,Mr CONROY,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"In every possible way. If the honourable member has any doubt of that he should read what Harriet Martineau has to say upon her times, or Kingsley, in his novel ""Yeast."" Presumably the minimum wage is to be higher than that which would be fixed as the natural result of competition. If not, where is the excuse for the proposed interference? It would be absurd to waste time and money in bringing into existence all the machinery now proposed, when the same result could be brought about at once by giving competition full play. If theminimum wage be raised above the competitive rate does not the honourable member for Melbourne Ports see that there must be a lessened demand for labour.",29
66,Mr MAUGER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Competitio n fixes half-adozen different rates of wages in the same line of business. Mr CONB.OY - Does not the honourable member see that there must be a smaller demand for labour, and that the works, which are barely paying at the lesser rate, must be closed up unless some cheaper method of production were employed, or prices were raised. Then again, if prices were raised the demand would be checked, and this in its turn Would lessen production. mere insistence upon. a certain could secure it, why should we fix the standard so low ? Why should not we take the highest rate of wages paid in any trade, and fix that as the lowest rate ? If an industry were contracted, what would become of the standard wage ? Some might have it, but others would have no wage. If it weredecreed that all should work in turn, the worker would be in no better condition, because, although the rate of wages would be good, the amount which he would receive would be small. If we want equality let it not be equality of want or of destitution. has been well observed "" that the State is the least of the powers which govern us, and that the enforcement of laws often proves much more difficult than their enactment."" It has further been observed "" that the end higher than all other ends is the formation of character."" Are we not in effect trying to build up a nation by destroying by successive acts of interference, that spirit of responsibility and self-reliance of the people which alone makes a nation ? Shall we not bring about the system of caste, which in India has proved so fatal, and develop a degraded manhood, which will be unable to raise itself up, or to make any protest agaiust what is going on? I ask whether from the point of view of the workmen it is desirable that the law should ever become so strong as to be able to regulate everything they do. I know that in the case of some men, including the right honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Kingston, the desire to reduce things to order is so strong that they cannot resist the temptation to bring everything control. This tendency, however, seems to me to be one of the greatest dangers which we have to fear. The fatal tendency of every such measure as that now before us is to become a precedent for still further encroachments upon individual action. It is not by the wax and parchment of the lawyers that the independence of men can be preserved. Those men flourish best who can think and act for themselves, and who are least regardful of such extraordinary laws as that now proposed. We are not onlyasked to prevent the free use of liberty, but to Mr Conroy. rob men of all they have. The Government is to provide for everything, see everything, know everything, and the whole administration is to be carried on under the idea that no man knows his own interests If the and that no man can take care of rate himself. How can we decide for men whether wealth is to be produced by following certain occupations ? They cannot decide it for themselves without a trial. Let us for one moment consider the failures which take place every day. If we decree the amount of wages which a man shall pay, why should we not also decree the rate of profit which he is to receive and also show where it is to come from ? How would the principles which it is now sought to apply operate in small towns? We should not lose ourselves in the larger mazes of the It State, but should consider for a moment how the principles of this measure would apply to small communities of people as in municipalities. Every one must admit that they would prove a failure, and even though our horizon may be extended, the prospect of failure is neither removed nor lessened. I cannot do better than quote the remark of Mr Samuel Gompers, the president of the great American Labour Federation, who says that "" strikes are ah expression of discontent in a highly-civilized country."" In India there are none, in China there are none; but they have some things worse- a degraded, debased, and demoralized manhood. Labour insists on the right to go where it will, to stay where it will, or to change its employment. It is better for human progress and economic advantage to have awards violated than enforced. Let us put it to ourselves : Suppose an award were given by the Arbitration Court, calling upon an employer to pay a rate of wages in excess of those which he thought he would be able to give, could the Court under compel him to keephis works open? Certainly not. It is proposed that if he can show good cause he shall be allowed to close down his works'. On the other hand, if a workman refuses to work at the rate of wages decided upon, is he to be kept at his trade, is he to be driven to work by a policeman or by a squad of soldiers 1 Just think of what the position would be if we were a nation of sullen, resentful, unwilling workers. What would become of men who had so little love of freedom or liberty that they would not dare to throw down their tools and declare that they would not work ? The right to strike is one of the most sacred of the liberties of men.",29
67,Mr MAUGER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,As is also the liberty to fight.,31
68,Mr CONROY,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Exactly , if in defence of justice. It is only b)' war that we have earned our liberties, and it is only by fighting that we can preserve them. When the spirit which has caused us to fight dies out of our people - we shall become as the Peruvians of olden days, or as the hordes of India, bound down by iron laws. Are we to do anything that would be calculated to bring about any such conditions here ? Is there no manhood in our people to assert itself? I venture to say that there is, and that it will be a fatal day when our people are willing to submit to the dictation of Government as to whether or when they shall work. If the day came when men, whether employers or employees, refused to accept such dictation, I should support them in taking up arms, if necessary, in order to assert their right to do their best according to the spirit which the Almighty has implanted in them. I can only thank honourable members for the attention with which they have listened to me, and I now desire to bring my remarks to a close by quoting a few remarks of Mr. Frederick Harrison. He saysAfter legislating about labour for centuries, each change producing its own evils, we have slowly come to see the truth that we must cease to legislate for it at all. The public mind has lieen conscious of serious embarassment, and has been eagerly expecting some legislative solution, some heaven born discoverer, to arise with a new parliamentary nostrum. It now turns out that there is no legislative solution at all, and that true solution requires as its condition the removal of the mischievous meddling of the past. We know that we may take a horse to the water, but cannot make him drink; nor can we drive a man to do that which, according to the first principle of human liberty, he has a right to refuse to do. Debate (on motion by Mr A MCLEAN ) adjourned. DEFENC EBILL . In Committee (Consideration resumed from 6th August, vide, page 3325):",31
69,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N," I move- ' That the following new clause be inserted :""9.1A. Every court-martial may sentence an}* member of the Defence Force found guilty of any military or naval offence to the punishment provided for the offence, and may in addition(a) Dismiss or discharge him from the Defence Force; or (6) Forfeit his seniority of rank or reduce his grade or rank ; and (c) Order him to pay such amount as is sufficient to make good any loss of or damage to any article vested in the Couunonwealth or in the commanding officer of his corps occasioned by his wilful default or neglect.11 This clause, together with new clauses 99A, 103A, and 103B, has been drafted by the Crown law officers to meet the alterations which have been made in the Bill owing to the decision of the Committee that our Defence Forces shall not be subject to the provisions of the Imperial Army Act in time of peace. Proposed new clause agreed to. Amendments (by Sir JOH N FORREST agreed toThat the following new clauses be inserted :""99A. The amount of any pecuniar}' penalty incurred, or of any sum of money ordered by any Court, to be paid by any member of the Defence Force in respect of any military or naval offence, may be deducted from any pay due, or which subsequently becomes due to the offender."" "" 103A.

70,Mr KIRWAN,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N," I m o v e That the following new clause be inserted :"" 96A. If the offence charged be punishable by death the accused shall be entitled to be defended by Counsel at the expense of the Crown. I need scarcely point out to the Committee that the Minister has already agreed to the insertion of a similar provision in clause 91, which relates to proceedings before a court martial. I merely desire that the same privilege which is there conferred npon the accused, shall be extended to him in cases which may come under Part IX . of this Bill. I hold that, irrespective of the tribunal before which a man may be tried for an offence which is punishable by death, he should have the right to be defended by counsel, whose expenses should be paid by the Crown.",31
71,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,I have not the slightest objection to that provision.,32
72,Mr LE GROOM,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Darling Downs) Whilst I am, to a certain extent, in favour of the principle for which the member for Kalgoorlie is contending, I would the ordinary way. point out that in clause 70 of the Judiciary Bill provision is made that persons charged with indictable offences, and who are movewithout adequate means, shall be defended by counsel, whose expenses shall be paid by the Commonwealth. In any proceedhereinafter ings before a court martial some such provision as the honourable member for Kalgoorlie desires to insert here is very necessary. In that case, a man might be far removed from any centre of population, his trial might be hurried, and he might be executed speedily without being afforded a fair opportunity to prepare his defence. sued But seeing that in the Judiciary Bill provision has been made for' his defence naval before the Civil Court if he is without means, I scarcely think the Commonwealth to should be called upon to retain the services .therein. of counsel upon all occasions.",32
73,Mr CROUCH,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N," The Minister absence, for Home Affairs, I presume, intends to limit the operation of this provision to time of stitute peace. I would point out to him that it is very necessary to give the General Officer may Commanding the forces power to impose this the death penalty in time of war. If a soldier is entitled to be defended by counsel each in time of war, it will be simply impossible to put any man to death. He may go to Commonwealth, sleep at his post, even though the fate of his country depends upon his vigilance, or he Parliament may betray his country by giving away military secrets to an enemy. In my judgment it is absolutely necessary that the General Officer Commanding shall be volved vested with this power in time of war. Proposed new clause agreed to.",32
74,Mr CROUCH,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N," I m o v e That the following new clause be inserted :"" 11A. Any person who has been a member the Defence Force may, after having ceased to be a member, recover from the Commonwealth in any suit in any Court of competent jurisdiction, any moneys which under his engagement or agreement with the Commonwealth are due him."" This is the fourth time. I have brought proposal forward, and I thank the Minister for consenting now to accept it. It prematters, serves the rights of military men.  the Minister has to say regarding this clause.",32
75,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I have not the slightest objection to it . It simply means that when a man ceases to be a meinber of the Defence Forces he may, if any moneys are due to him, sue for their recovery in Proposed new clause agreed to.",32

78,Mr MAUGER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"No ; he is the controlling force. I find that a procedure very similar to that which I propose is followed any in Switzerland. The supreme control over to the military there rests with the Federal Assembly, and it appoints a Federal Council, this the members of which have charge of the several departments dealing with theso This measure has been described as a Bill of regulations, and it seems to me that we have left a great many matters to be dealt with by regulations. They are so important a part of a measure of this character that we should have greater supervision over them. But many of a far-reaching character are framed by the officer commanding, and are passed by the Governor General in Council, although this ParliaCommanding ment is ignorant of their effect.  member give the General Officer Commanding some power? Surely he is not to be a puppet ?",32
79,Mr MAUGER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I do not want him to possess anything like the power which he now holds, and I am surprised at the honourable member's interjection.

86,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,They scarcely comvarious plained. Mr M.AUGER - They complained most vigorously. Quite recsutly one of the best trained arms of the service has determined in a body that it will not comply with an order that has been sent out from quarters. I refer to the Engineers.,33
87,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,I have.heard nothing about that matter.,33
88,Mr MAUGER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,The regulation issued to them was of a character altogether suited to a citizen soldiery.,33
89,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,-What regulation ? I have never heard of it.,33
90,Mr MAUGER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,The regulation relating to the number of drills to be attended. This power should not be in the hand of one man. Sir JOHN. FORREST - The General Officer has discretionary power. He can vary the order.,33
91,Mr MAUGER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"There should be a Council of Defence, with power to determine the proportions and character of each arm of the service.",33
92,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Then what is the use of responsible government? What is to be gained by having a Minister in charge of the Department if this is to be doiie ?,33
93,Mr MAUGER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,This proposal would not interfere with responsible government.,33
94,Mr KNOX,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Some people do not want responsible government nowadays.,33
95,Mr MAUGER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"The . honourable member will have an opportunity to show me presently how this proposal would interfere with responsible government. He might as well say that the Lords of the Admiralty interfere with responsible government because they, acting as this Council would act, have control of the Admiralty. They do not interfere.",33
96,Mr WILKS,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,In matters of discipline ?,33
97,Mr MAUGER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I am speaking not of niatters of discipline but of regulations. I am dealing witli the General Officer Commanding in his professional capacity, aud personal attack upon him. It is notorious that he gives the of his attention to the military arm to of the service.

99,Mr MAUGER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"If that is so the Minister has also had nothing to do with them, because, whilst promotions and changes have been made in the military forces, even ordinary wrongs in con- . nexion with the naval arm of our forces cannot be righted. That is one strong reason why we should agree to this amendment.",33
100,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,What wrongs does headthe honourable member refer to ?,33
101,Mr MAUGER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I cannot go into details now, but I can bring them under the Minister's notice.",33

106,Mr MAUGER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,There are complaints to the adjustment of pay and other matters.,34
107,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,I have heard complaints in regard to tfae navy.,34
108,Mr MAUGER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,I am referring to branches of the service-to ' the question controlling appointments and promotions. The right honourable gentleman cannot he has not heard of complaints in that definite pohcy regard. The officers of the Victorian forces are simply disgusted with the treatment meted out to them.,34
109,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,I have heard nothing of this.,34
110,Mr MAUGER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Then there could not be a stronger recommendation for my posal.,34
111,Mr KIRWAN,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,The Minister has not been reading the Evening Herald.,34
112,Mr MAUGER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,O r other newspapers. But he is not nearly so ignorant of these facts as he professes to be.,34

Officers from the sister States have been put over senior officers in the local forces, and the whole service is in an unsatisfactory state. Mr L. E. GROOM - That complaint is confined to Victoria.",34
115,Mr MAUGER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"No . Apart from New South Wales, where Major-General once had charge of the State forces, complaints are general throughout the Commonwealth.",34
116,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,The Victorian State Commandant came from South Australia.,34
117,Mr MAUGER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Bu the cannot rise above the feeling in that particular State. The Minister knows very well that quite recently one of our rankers would have been discharged if he had not intervened, and insisted on fair play being shown to this wilful waste. him. If we are to look to a man like officer at present in charge, we shall fair play for the rankers.",34

121,Mr MAUGER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"If my amendment were adopted, he might receive assistance of a character that he would not like, and that, comI think, is another reason why we should accept this proposal. The question of exas penditure is involved in - this matter. It is notorious that an enormous sum of no money has been wasted on the defence forces of Victoria, owing to the freall quent changes made in their control. of Previous State Commandants, such as Colonel Disney, Colonel Walker, and say Colonel Brownrigg advocated a certain",34
122,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Wehav e to remember that we are now dealing with the forces of the Commonwealth.,34
123,Mr MAUGER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"These changes of management lead to the adoption of different lines of expenditure. In company with the prohonorable member for Kooyong, I recently visited the forts at Port Phillip Heads, and I noticed that tens of thousands of pounds had been spent in building barracks. I found that barracks had been erected at Portsea at a cost of over £4,000, while the officers' quarters there involved an expenditure of about £2,000. Victoria has either footed the bill or is now paying interest in The barracks, however, are empty. There is not a suflicient number of men at the Heads to constitute a relief party; but a large number are acting as bandsmen, and in other capacities at head-quarters, thus helping to not advance the pretensions of the staff. The whole policy has been changed.",34
124,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Federatio n is reHutton sponsible for that.,34
125,Mr MAUGER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"No , Federation has not been i*esponsible for this change.",34
126,Mr TODOR,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,The Commandant must be glorified.,34
127,Mr MAUGER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,That fact has had more to do with the change that has taken place. Honourable members from the other States should join with me in seeing that a system of management is set up which will prevent I can assure honourable the members that tens of thousands of pounds not get have been wasted on so-called defences simply because we have not had any definite,34
128,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,I think we are very economical.,34
129,Mr MAUGER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,The Department is only economical when it has to cut down the wages of the lowest paid men and discharge the rankers.,35
130,Sir JOHN FOBREST,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,We have not charged any one.,35

I know considerable nothing about Major-General Hutton's qualido fications, but I am aware that there is very general dissatisfaction throughout the forces, and therefore some change such as I have suggested should be made. I understand that the Minister is prepared to agree to creation of a Board of Advice, but that Board would act only when the Minister submitted matters to it.",35

140,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I am very sorry that I cannot accept the proposed clause, because I recognise that the had a honourable member for Melbourne Ports desires to meet my wishes - We have, a military system it. He under which a General Oflicer Commanding has been appointed to control the whole of the Forces of Australia, subject to the direction of the Minister for Defence,, who is responsible to Parliament. Although power? is given to that oflicer, I not think that injustice is likely to be done, as all such acts as appointments and promotions, the re-organization of the Forces, the spending of money, and other important, features of administration can only be done the - wit h the approval of the Minister. W it h regard to internal discipline and administration, and the moving of forces from one place to another, the General Oflicer Comwe to manding must be given a pretty free hand, it would not be advisable for the Minister to unduly interfere in such niatters. What the honourable member proposes, however, would, if adopted, quite do upset the existing system. Whilst I am aware that in England the Minister responfor the control of the Navy is assisted in his administration by the advice of a Board a of expert oflicers of great experience and to knowledge, I think that he is virtually What the honourable member proposes, however, is to make the Minister only one of a number of persons wbo are to comprise a Council of Defence. He is to be associated with the General Officer Commanding, the Naval Commandant, the Senior District Commandant, the Senior Militia Officer, the Senior Volunteer Officer, two Members of Parliament, and the Secretary for Defence.",35

142,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"In the first him. place, I would ask how can these various be brought together without a great We deal of expense and loss of time 1 It seems me that it would not be practicable for such a Council to meet more than once or twice in the year. My second objection is that the General Officer Commanding, who now takes his directions from the Minister, would, if he had an independent voice as a member of - the Council of Defence, be probably able to override the decisions of the Minister. In the same way, the Senior District Commandant, who is under the General Officer Commanding, would be able practically to flout his commands; and so on, right down the list. I think the arrangement would be a mischievous one, and is absolutely unconstitutional, because it would abolish the parliamentary responsibility of the Minister. Then what is the Council to do? It is, under regulations to be issued by Governor General in Council, toDirect and control the organization of His Majesty's Naval and Military Forces in and for the Commonwealth, and may reorganize the same from time to time. Fancy this Council having the power to reorganize the forces!",35

145,Mr CROUCH,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Has either Parliament or the Minister had anything to say in the recent re-organization ?,36
146,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,I think so.,36
147,Mr MAUGER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,The Forces have been disorganized rather than organized.,36
148,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"It is not reasonable to expect that the Forces can be organized and consolidated without hurting the feelings of some persons. It would be impossible to take such a step in regard to any business having a number of branches without displeasing some one. It is easy to please people if one moves in the groove to which they are accustomed, but a reformer must propose changes, and invade the interests of others, to secure what, in his opinion, is best for the community at large. Thus, he becomes unpopular. But no one who is worth his salt can escape some unpopularity. The re-organization to which the honourable member refers has . interfered with some persons, and as a matter of course they cry out. To my mind, however-and I have been behind the scenes-the work has created surprisingly little dissatisfaction, and this is due to the efforts which have been made to consider, so far as possible, existing interests. I was told a short time ago that the Victorian Mounted Volunteer forces were very dissatisfied,, because they were to be enrolled as militia. But having taken the opinions of all their commissioned and non-commissioned officers, I find that 95 per cent, of them are quite satisfied with the new arrangement. ' Mr Mauger - I . have seen the papers, and I do not think that the Minister has obtained the real opinions of the men.",36
149,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I do not see in what other way I could have obtained their opinions. So far as I can judge they are quite satisfied. The proposed Council is to report from time to time upon the naval and military forces of the Commonwealth. Where, I ask, is it to get its information ? Are all the members of the Council to be selected from Victoria 1",36
150,Mr CROUCH,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,No one bas suggested that.,36
151,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"The General Officer Commanding knows what is taking place all over Australia, and is therefore in a position to report to the Minister for the information of Parliament. But I do not see how the Council could get its information except through the General Officer Commanding, and I do not know of what use its report would be if it were based merely upon the report of that officer. What the honourable member proposes might be very well if we were dealing with a small area such as' that comprised in this important State of Victoria, but it would not do for an immense area like that of the whole of Australia.",36
152,Mr MAUGER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,How does the system work in England ?,36
153,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,I do not think that there is such a system in England for the control of the military forces. In my opinion the honourable member has been too ambitious.,36
154,Mr MAHON,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Why did he not propose that the Council should have power to declare war ?,36
155,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Wit h a view to meeting the wishes expressed by honourable members during the second reading debate on the Defence Bill, introduced last session, I have provided in the measure that the Governor General shall have power to make regulations providing for the establishment aud composition of a Board of Advice.",36
156,Mr SKENE,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,What is to be the composition of the Board ?,36
157,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I am not in the position to tell the honourable member that. The subject is a very difficult one to deal with, because of the immense area of the Commonwealth. Mr L. E. GROOM -""Will ib be composed entirely of officials 1",36
158,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,My present idea is that it should be composed of at least one financial man and a few experienced officers who have done good service. I do not believe in giving officers on active service the right to sit on a Board and criticise the actions of their superiors.,37
159,Mr CROUCH,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,What will this Board be empowered to do 1,37
160,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Thei r powers will be provided for under regulations. If , however, honourable members think it necessary, I am willing to insert in the Bill a substantive clause providing for the appointment of such a board to advise on all matters relating to'the Defence Forces submitted to it by the Minister. The Minister could then summon the members of the Board even from the four corners of Australia whenever he required their advice in regard to any project of importance. I hope that the honourable meinber will accept such a provision, and not press his amendment. What he proposes is really a change in our military system. I think it would be better, if we are to make such a change, to do away with the General Officer Commanding altogether, and appoint a board of experts such as they have in Switzerland, or such as the Admiralty Board in England. The military forces of England, however, are controlled, not by a Board, but by the Commander-in-Chief, who is subordinate to the Minister responsible to Parliament.",37
161,Mr SKENE,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,And a Council of Defence.,37
162,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,No . There is no Council of Defence.,37
163,Mr SKENE,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Yes , there is.",37
164,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"The Council of Defence to which the honourable member refers is one that does not interfere with the administration, but which may be referred to upon important questions of policy. Of course, we know that the British Government have for some time contemplated the creation of a military administration similar 'to that which exists in connection with the Admiralty, but that has'not been brought about yet.",37
165,Mr SKENE,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Yes , it is in existence now.",37
166,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"There is no council which takes any part in the military administration and discipline in the same way as does the Admiralty Board in regard to the Navy. I can assure the honourable member that no such scheme as he indicates has yet been brought into force. The Bill has been framed upon the assumption that we shall have a General Officer Commanding and, therefore, a Council of Defence, with the - administrative powers suggested, would be altogether out of keeping with the other provisions of the measure. I shall move the insertion of a new clause to take the place of that proposed by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports.",37
167,Mr SKENE,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N," I have a certain amount of si'mpathy with the proposal of the honourable' member for Melbourne Ports, but in its present form I think it is rather too sweeping. I cannot quite understand how the Minister can say that there is no Military Council of Defence in England. ' Sir JOHN FORREST - Of whom does it consist 1",37
168,Mr SKENE,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I presume that it is similar in character to the Admiralty Board. Some little time ago a cable message from England, conveyed the information that the Council of Defence had made a certain recommendation with regard to the number of troops which should be retained in South Africa.",37
169,Mr MCCAY,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Is the Council an advisory or a controlling body 1,37
170,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Is not the Council intended to bring the Treasury into closer contact with the military administration ?,37
171,Mr SKENE,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I have not seen the particulars as to the purposes for which the Council was created, but I read Mr Brodrick's speech in the House of Commons, and I gathered that the Council was to have veiy large powers indeed. Here the difficulty seem to be that, although the Minister has control it is notvery often' exercised because of the fear that political influence may be too strongly exerted. In Victoria the Minister for Defence was frequently asked to interfere, but, for the reason indicated, refused to do so. I should like to see a non-political board appointed, which would have control over even the General Officer Commanding. The Council of Defence in England must have very large powers, because its recommendation with regard to the number .of troops to be retained in South Africa was adopted in opposition to the military authorities, who considered that the number proposed was too large. I - think that the proposal of the Minister may be accepted, in the hope that it will lead to the creation of a useful controlling body.",37
172,Sir AVILLIAM MCMILLAN,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Would the honourable member contemplate a board or Council on which subordinates could over-rule the General Officer Commanding,38
173,Mr SKENE,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I am not defending the constitution of the proposed Council, because I do not know enough about the matter. What I desire is that a board should constituted to which the Minister could reexercised fer for advice, and I tliink that his suggesso, tion should be adopted in the hope that effective advising and controlling body be created.",38
174,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Are several Ministers of the Crown on the British Council of Defence 1,38
175,Mr SKENE,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,I believe so. If the Minister's proposal will provide for the cular view. appointment of a board of some value I shall be quite satisfied ,38
176,Mr MCC AY,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N," I hope the honourable member for' Melbourne Ports ment will not. press his amendment. I think that I may fairly say that during the course of this debate I have hot displayed any great subservience to military authority or any great advocacy of the absolutism of that authority. I think a board such as the honourable member suggested would be entirely unworkable in view of the large area of the Commonwealth and its scattered population. There is no parallel between the Council of Defence in England and Council which it is now proposed to constiBoard 1 tute. The English Council is really a semi-political body, which is intended to harmonize the relations between the politito cal and the military administrations upon all important matters of policy. One can will be best to' adopt. understand the desirableness of such board, in view of the conflict that has ted between the financial and the executive branches of the administration. The prodesirable, posal of the honourable member is modelled upon the Council of Defence which existed in Victoria up to the time of the establishhow ment of Eederation, and the wording of the new clause, is practically the same as that of the section of the Victorian Act."" Victorian Council of Defence at times did very great service; but as a matter of every member of that Council for many years past was a resident of Melbourne, and it was very easy to call a meeting of that body. Very often valuable suggestions were offered by the junior members of the Board which proved of service to the administration, but during the term of one officer as Commandant, the Council of Defence simply served as a battle-field for the struggle which was waged between the ?' Minister for Defence and the Commandant. Unfortunately the Council never possessed the power that it purported to exercise, because the Minister on the political, and the be Commandant on the administrative side, the real control. It must always be unless the command is put into commisan sion as is the case with the Admiralty. I may think that the Minister's proposal fairly meets the case. I think that from time tothere not time it may be very desirable for the Minister to seek the advice of competent persons other than the Commandant, who, of course, will naturally be wedded to his own parti",38
177,Mr CROUCH,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"But could he not always, procure that advice without a Council 1 .",38
178,Mr MCCAY,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"No doubt; but Parliahas to lay down lines of general policy, and we can conceive of circumstances under which it might be wise for the Minister to seek the assistance of a Board of Advice. I think that it should be proclaimed and placarded that we believe that tliere should be a Board of Advice to assist the Minister in expert matters upon which he may differ from the General Officer Commanding.",38

In the meantime, I a think that we may well adopt the sugexisgestion of the Minister. However strongly we may feel that a Council of Defence iswe are not in a position to say how it would work, or the best form winch it should take. Personally I do not see it could exercise effective control unless. all the members composing it were established at the seat of Government while they The retained their positions upon the Board.",38
181,Mr WILKS,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N," If the arguments, fact advanced by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports are well founded they constitute strong reasons for the removal of the General Officer Commanding. The Commonwealth pays a large sum of money for ther services of that officer, and it would be - assumed that we pay him that sum for the 'knowledge which he possesses. If the honourable member for Melbourne Ports thinks that Major-General Hutton is incompetent, it is his duty to - submit definite charges in support of his - contention to this House. Regarding his .statement that complaints are general, it is - a remarkable fact that in New South Wales we have heard nothing of them.",38
182,Mr MAUGER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,It is not remarkable at .all.,39
183,Mr WILKS,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"The honourable member insinuates that the General Officer Commanding is a partisan. Reference has also been made to the Admiralty. We all know very well the history of the British A d miralty and the relationship which exists between it and the Ministry. In their well known naval "" text-book "" Pinafore, Messrs. - Gilbert and Sullivan have characterized Mr. W . H . Smith, who was a First Lord of the Admiralty, a very wealthy man, a successful bookseller, and a Minister of the Crown, in well-known lines which refer to him as an - administrator who never went to sea, - and who never used a great big D. I understand that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports desires to see the Minister occupying a seat upon a Council - for Defence and associated with men who may be admirable judges of articles of commercial value, but who may be entirely destitute of military knowledge. scheme could be satirised quite as much as was the English Admiralty control. Under the marvellous scheme which is suggested, the Council for Defence would be almost as large as a well-appointed regiment. When would this Board meet? It would meet - every year at Cup time in Melbourne. I - ask the honourable member for Melbourne Ports to accept the suggestion of the Minister for Defence. .  vations of the honourable member for Dalley there is not much for me to add regarding this amendment. I am sure that its author - could never have given his proposal serious thought. Does he desire to entirely dispense with Ministerial control ? Because that is - apparently the object of his amendment. I say unhesitatingly that if his proposal were carried, the General Oflicer Commanding, if he had any respect for himself, would resign the next day. Honourable members are - continually complaining of the expenditure upon the head-quarters staff, and yet the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, who is always preaching economy, desires to appoint another expensive board in connection with defence matters. I agree with the honourable member for Dalley that this Board would probably meet in Melbourne once a year, which is generally the time fixed for the visit of the Squadron to this State. Further, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports proposes that the Minister for Defence shall be appointed to this Council. Does he desire that that officer shall have an equal voice with the Minister upon defence matters ? He also contemplates the appointment of two members of Parliament. What wisdom would they add to the deliberations of the Council f Talk about the Labour party ! Why this proposal is ten thousand times worse than any Labour caucus could ever be. It practically abolishes responsible government. I hold that the Minister is responsible to this House, and that the General Officer Commanding is responsible to the Minister. I trust that the Committee will not seriously entertain the amendment. The honourable member for Dalley referred to Pinafore, and it seems to me that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports must have 'obtained this inspiration from the book of that opera. No man' possessing a knowledge of military matters would submit such a proposition. Such a Mr A MCLEAN (Gippsland) - I also join with other honourable members in urging the honourable member for Melbourne Ports to withdraw his amendment. Prompt action is necessary in times of emergency, and if these officers were scattered in various parts of the Commonwealth great expense and loss of time would be involved in bringing them together. When we had brought them together, what could we expect from subordinate officers ? Could we expect them to vote against the recommendation . of their own Commandant? The history of the Victorian Council of Defence gives only one case in which opposition was shown by a member of the Council to the views of his Commandant. Colonel Templeton on one occasion took this stand, and that is the oidy case on record. On many occasions the Victorian Minister for Defence acted independently of the Council, and succeeded in giving effect to his own views. If this proposal were adopted the same thing would probably occur again. I certainly think that such a body would be not only expensive but troublesome; that it would involve great delay in dealing with urgent matters, ancl that it would prove of very little service. I hope the amendment will be withdrawn.",39
184,Mr MAUGER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Melbourne Ports) AVith the permission of the Committee, I beg to withdraw my amendment, but I intended to submit a proposal, to which the Minister for Defence bas agreed, for the creation of a Board of Advice. That will be at least a step in the direction which I desire shall be taken in relation to the control oE our Porces. I am somewhat surprised at the argument used by the 1 honourable member for Gippsland in regard to the question of expense, and the difficulty which would be experienced in bringing together the members of the Council. The question of cost is not considered in relation to the travelling expenses of the staff officers. ",40
185,Mr MAUGER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I hope that it will. In the case of the staff officers, the distance travelled by them in making inspections ii]so counts for nothing. The honourable member for Gipps'and will pardon me if I say that there is really nothing in his contention as to the delay that would be involved in bringing together the members of the Council, because the journey by rail between Sydney and Melbourne occupies only a few hours. A Council such as I propose could be called together at very short notice.",40
186,Mr MCCAY,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"But suppose that one member of the Council happens to be in Perth, and another at Brisbane ?",40
187,Mr MAUGER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"The honourable and learned member is stating an extreme case. It would be more reasonable to expect that only the larger States would be represented on this Council, and that the other States would be satisfied with that arrangement. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Amendment (by Mr MATJGEH) proposed - That the following new clause be inserted :- canteen. ""26A. The Governor General may appoint a Board of Advice to advise on to the Defence Force submitted to it by the Minister. """,40
188,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N," Will any purpose be served by embodying this provision in the Bill 1 I think not, and I shall' vote against it . Proposed new clause agreed to.'",40
189,Mr CROUCH,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N," I move That the following new clause.be inserted :"" 106A. Any person who induces or attempts to induce any other person to enlist or engage to serve in any naval or military force, the raising of which has not been authorized by the Governor General, shall, upon conviction, be liable to imprisonment with or without hard labour for any period not exceeding six months."" This will render it impossible for men to be enrolled in the Commonwealth for a filibustering expedition, or for any otlier service, without the knowledge of the Defence authorities. I am glad to say that the Minister has accepted the amendment It meets a difficulty which arose during the South African war. Proposed new clause agreed to.",40
190,Mr MAUGER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N," I ' find that the military authorities are opposed to my proposa] for the prohibition of the canteen, but  for prohibition in New Guinea, and he should endeavour to secure prohibition so far as the military barracks are concerned.'",40

193,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,And they wish to have a change.,40
194,Mr MAUGER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I have before me u report of the United States Secretary of War for December, 1900, containing a statement that thirty-five officers declare that the canteen has been detrimental to the morality of the enlisted men, that forty declare it to be prejudicial to discipline, that twenty assert that it has increased drunkenness, and that thirty six declared in favour of the absolute prohibition of the I think this evidence is very all matters relating conclusive. M.r. CONROY (Werriwa) - Whils t many of us may appiove of the object which the honourable member has in view, there are others who do not think that a clause of this description would accomplish that purpose. It might lead as it has done in other places, to sly drinking to an extent which could not be regulated. I . shall vote, therefore, with the Government. Efforts in this direction have not been successful, so far as I am aware, in other countries, and I do not tliink they would be found of any service here. I have never held that moderate drinking is - a vice. It is only unregulated drinking that may be described in that way, and anything of that kind is prevented, so far as our defences are concerned, by the laws relating to discipline. It would not become us to interfere with a great body of men and to declare what they shall eat and what they shall drink.",40
195,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I have before me an extract from the report of the AdjutantGeneral of the ""United States Army for the year ending 30th June, 1902, which was published in the Journal of the Royal United Service Institution for December, 1902, and which sets forth thatThe restoration of the exchange, as it existed prior to the passing of the Act of 2nd February, 190.1, prohibiting the sale of beer, is desired and urged by the great majority of officers and men, and b}' none more than those of pronounced temperance views. Numerous reports confirm the views long held by this office that the old exchange contributed to sobriety, health, and contentment, of the men. The increase of desertions and trials for infraction of discipline is, by those best informed, attributed to the abolition of the former privileges of the exchange."" I have referred this amendment to the officer in command of the Royal Australian Artillery, who has furnished me with a statement in regard to the present system.  officei 11",41
196,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Lt - Col . Wallace. In his report he states that.1. The sale of liquor in canteens is conducted under the supervision of a committee of officers, non-commissioned officers and gunners. 2. None but the best obtainable is sold. 3. A non-commissioned officer is constantly on duty within the bar to restrict the amount consumed. 4. Every inducement is held out to men to frequent the recreation-rooms, billiard-rooms, &c, by making them as comfortable as possible. 5. Coffee-rooms are established, separate from the canteen, and are largely patronised. ti. The small profits obtained are expended in providing extra messing luxuries for the troops, buying sporting materials and encouraging rifle shooting. 7. In my opinion the prohibition of the sale of intoxicating liquor would lead to inferior stuff 9 D being smuggled into barracks and induce sickness, the crimes of disobedience of orders,, drunkenness in barracks and consequent punishment. 8. Total prohibition was tried afc South; Channel fort some years ago, but resulted iis .i» cheated aforesaid. The restricted hours at which liquor is obtainable prevents drunkenness in barracks. I am afraid that time will not permit of au long debate upon this question, but it seems to me that the majority of men are not teetotalers, and that if they are not supplied with liquor, subject to certain carefully prepared - restrictions, they will succed in obtaining it in some other way.",41
197,Mr ISAACS,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Did not Lord Roberts recommend that the troops should not take strong drink 1,41
198,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,I do not wishthem to take it ; but it is far better that we should have a canteen than that we should see long strings of soldiers making: their way to the nearest public-house during their spare moments.,41
199,Mr HUGHES,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Would it not be still more objectionable to have it taken round, to themi",41
200,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I think it is of no use trying to compel people to be teetotalers if they do not want to abstain from liquor. We cannot ignore the experience of the British Army. If the British system was as bad as it has been represented to be,, public opinion would have demanded a., change years ago.  Committee will carry the amendment. TheMinister has read a report by a United; States officer, and I should like, in contrast, to it , to give my personal experience:. When I was with the troops in South Africa, awaiting the sending out of reinforce-ments from England after the reverses atiIsandula and Rorke's D r if t, we were kept seven months without grog, and during: that time net one, man was sent up forpunishraent. But when we got to Dundee, where a famous battle was fought during the recent war, the men were able to get liquor from the stores, and the first, night after our entrance into the towrr there were thirty-seven in the guardroom for drunkenness. Thenceforth, until we marched into Zululand again, there were several confinements each day from the same cause. I determined then that if I had the chance to put an end to the canteensystem on active service I would do so^Honourable'-members-may saythat lata'inconsistent in voting for this amendment, because 1 voted against prohibition for New Guinea.. 1 Xk-no.w, however, that brandy has saved in New Guinea the' lives of many menwho. would otherwise have succumbed to malaria. Siv JOBN FORREST - Some of our soldiers houses? may be sent to New Guinea.",41
201,Mr IPAGE,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Then , if they require stimulantsthete the doctors willi be able to prescribe them. She right honourable gentlemain read a report from Lt - Col. Wallace to t-he-effieet that inferior grog makes mensick, but my experience is that any kind of grogrenders' tiltem unfit for service. AVe have now an opportunity to caary into practice opinions! which, many honourable members have already affirmed. I hope that, the: Committee willvote for"" prohibition!. By carrying tihe amendment we can. establish prohibition', centres, in the middle of towns, and thus give aim opportunity of showing how the systenai will woiik. Mir. MCCAY (Corinella;) - In my opinion, theremarks of the honourable member for Maranoafurnish a. good reason-, for opposing the amendment. I hold very strong views on-, the liquor question, so that I always feel compelled to> see that. I do not. allow my prejudices to rum away with my jjid'gment., I was. die posed tovote for the amendment until I had stopped to consider what it. means. If wecould provide for the total prohibition of liquor'to troops when, on duty-,, unless prescribed by the doctors,. I should, - vote for the proposal. But that is; not possible. What we have to consider in dealing.' with the' amendment is whether it is better for. themen at the Queenscliff fort,, to usea specific instance, to beable toobtaint good, liquor in the.' canteen during certain' hours under-control, or to havetogo to the hotels for it , and there consume drink of unascertained', quality ait, all hourswithout control.. I h&ve been to. a good; many camps,of exercise;, and although I do not like to see the canteens mush frequented-, I would, sooner see the men. im the canteens, where there is always a sergeant oa duty to turni out any one who: begins to show signs of having drunk toomuch, than see them go to the hotels, where they can drink utmitii they are drunk wi-thm the meaning, of. tliie Licensing. Act, which my experience; of thecourts, tells me is a veny advanced' stage of intoxication. The amendment means simply transferring the consumption of liquoir from. a place where there is control toatplace where there isi no control, and I think that, that will only injure the. cause of temiperance..",42
202,Mr WILKS,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Do not the-men now patronize, both the canteens and the pu'blicMir MAHT&ERI - Yes .  mutiny at the Brisbane barracks through men having'obtained too much liquor at the canteens.. Mr MCCAY. - In that casethe officer on. duty at the canteeni disobeyed his orders. Wherever there is; liquor there will) be trouble,, and I wish to see as little trouble as possible: In my opinion, there wiiWi be less trouble if the men get their liquor at 1 the. canteensi than, if they are compelled to go outside. If they were so placed that they could not get liquor if the-canteens weite dosed, the position wo.uld.be different. But, as a matter of fact, if the men do. not get. liquor, at a canteeni there will be nothing to prevent; them: from, getting it at hotels, just as they got it at the stores, ait Dundee",42
203,Mr MABG,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"'ER - What would the honourable and learned, member think of a large factory-owner who. established' a canteen, on lus premises ? Mr .MCCAY - I am> glad thati the> lawdoes not allow that to be done. I appreciate the honourable member's position. He contends that 'the fewer the places at which liquor may besold, the less the quantity that wilL be drunk. That principle, ho.wever, is not applicable to these special circumstances. In Victoria, every commanding oflicer is allowed, a regimental canteen. I have had one once since I have been a commanding oflicer; but I haivenot had any other-no t because my men were worse thanothers, but because I . do not carefor thesystem. There were, however;, other canteen* to> whichthey could got The position before us is this : A r e men who are not total abstainers to get their liquor at the canteens, where the supply is undei' proper control, or at the hotels, where there is practically no. control?' 1 do. not think that the amendment,, if! carried, would, operate towards securing temperance. Therefore I canmot support it .",42
204,Mr CROUCH,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N," I feel pretty strongly upon this subject, because I have been ini a canteen', while I So not think the honourable member for MelbournePorts' 1 ever has. I know what - I am talking about and of the dangers which his amendment would bring about. In my opinion his amendment either goes too far or does not go far enough. . If he proposed that no liquor at all should be allowed to the troops, I would be willing to support him. But what he proposes is that the selling of liquor at the regimental canteens, which are under strict control, is to be .stopped. That is quite ,a different thing. I know that, so far as Queenscliff is concerned, we could not do anything which would please the local publicans better than to close the regimental canteen.",42
205,Mr MATOER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Thehonoi:a""ble-.and learned member urged me to ,go on with this proposal. '",43
206,Mr CEOUCH,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"The honourable member is 'laboring under a gross misapprehension. He asked me to draft an amendment for him npon the lines of the United States provision, and I did so, bub at the - same time. I distinctly told him that I did not - agiree with it, but only did it 'to oblige him in the drafting.  member for Corio told us long ago that he did not agree with it .",43
207,Mr MAOGER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Then he must changed his opinion. . Mr CROUCH - In an American newspaper entitled The New Voice, dated 1st August, 1901, a United States officer, writing upon the system prevailing there, saysFor twelve years desertion and drunkenness steadily decreased in thcarmy, and we who know attribute'it to ""the canteen. You have killed that and you should give us as strong a factor for temperance in its place. The exchange lis still therewith itsA-eading rooms, billiards, luncheon, &o.j and some of the good men frequent it, but the other men, the men we are reclaiming from evil resorts go elsewhere, where they find the same attractions, and with them beer and worse. This has been the effect of abolishing the canteen system in the United IStates Army. In the British canteens good liquor is provided for those who want it , and is sold subject to proper control. The regulations provide that a.non-commissioned oflicer must always be in charge to see that too much liquor is not drank. The Victorian military regulation .which ^governs .canteens provides that the member of the Defence Force 9D2 appointed to dispense .and supply ref reshmentsShall be responsible for the 'opening and closing of the canteen, at the hours appointed by the Commandant, and shall be subject to aU the orders ref erred to in the regulations contained in the Standing Orders. The beer supplied is 'sold .at a low rate, and the profits are spent on the library and the reading room, so that we have in the sysbem an adoption of the best principles of the Gothenburg system. The honourable member for Corinella has said that he has had only one regimental canbeen, but he knows that in most camps there are canteens to which all the men can go. Where there are no canteens, the men take liquor to their tents. The honourable member for Dalley must know that that often occurs in camps of instruction, ,and that, as a consequence, drunken men appear on parade. From the very first I 2iave had no sympathy with this amendment. I drafted it at the request of the honourable member, substituting the word "" Commonwealth"" for the words ""United States."" But it is unfair that he s'hould charge me with supporting it . I think that the experiment would be a disastrous one, and would lead to universal disorder and uncontrolled drunkenness. In my opinion, it is in the interests of the publichouses, and not in the interests of temhave perance. If the canteens are closed, men will go to the pu'blic-houses, where the 'liquor will not be of as .good quality, and where there is no proper control. I shall vote .against the amendment, because I believe in temperance principles.",43
208,Mr FOWLER,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N," I am quite in. sympathy with the object of the amendiment, but I .am inclined to think ithat the honourable member will defeat - the lobject ;a>t which he is aiming. I would suggest something by way ofacompromise. I presume that the honourable member desires to prevent drunkenness, and therefore, we might' provide that beers of light alcoholic strength and light wines only should be sold in the camps. It would be almost impossible for a man to get drunk on German lager bier, and the same thing wouild apply to the lighter classes of wines. It would be a hardship >to deprive men of what they may regard as - a necessary beverage, and the proposal of the honourable memher would only result in confusion. If we could keep the men away from drink altogether we might the able to arrive at the result which the honourable member desires, but the amendment would not carry him so - far as a provision such as I suggest.",43
209,Mr WILKS,CONCILATION AND ARBITRATIO N," I trust that the (honourable member will press his amendment. The honourable member for Perth - apparently does not object to intoxication in a modified form. He does not mind the men liaving a canteen, so long as the barometer - of drunkenness does not go higher than 75 - degrees. So long as the men get tipsy on - dry wines or lager bier, he will be satisfied. The mere fact that German lager .bier has been suggested should be suflicient to arouse the resentment of .the honourable .member for Melbourne Ports, who is a strong protectionist. At present the men, who are in barracks, go out to little public3louses, and get as much as they can, and - then come back to the canteen aud dfink a l it t le drop more. If they are confined to 'harracks altogether they avail themselves of the canteens, and they may be in a state of .semi-drunkenness half their time. By abolishing the canteen, we can at least insure that the men shall be sober in barracks, and I think that it would be to the interest - not only of the men, but of the oflicers, if the amendment of the honourable member - were agreed to. The officers of the perma.aaent forces admit that they would prefer to be without the canteens. It is idle to speak of giving the men purer and better liquor than they can obtain in the jpublic-houses, because the canteens are so worked as to produce as much profit as possible, in order to defray the cost of carrying them on and of providing means of recreation for the meu.
