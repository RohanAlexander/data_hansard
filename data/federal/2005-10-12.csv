1,The SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. David Hawker) took the chair at 10.00 am and read prayers. NA (SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS SPLITTING) First Reading Bill presented by Mr Brough, and read a first time. Second Reading",19
2,Mr BROUGH,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"Longman-Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer) (10.01 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Tax Laws Amendment (Superannuation Contributions Splitting) Bill 2005 makes consequential amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to provide for the tax consequences of the government's election commitment to allow members to split both their personal and employer superannuation contributions with their spouse. The exact details of how the splitting measure will operate will be specified under regulations. Contribution splitting is a key element of the government's superannuation reforms. It will assist families to maximise the benefits available in superannuation and provide an avenue for spouses to share their superannuation benefits. This is important for families with only one working spouse in the home or where one spouse receives a low income. The splitting of superannuation contributions will benefit many families. It will particularly assist low-income or non-working spouses to have superannuation assets under their own control and to have their own income in retirement. This measure is expected to benefit women in particular. It will provide single income couples with access to two eligible termination payments low-rate thresholds and two reasonable benefit limits in a similar way to dual income families. For taxation purposes the contributions which are split and paid to another fund or transferred to an account in the existing fund for a spouse will be considered an eligible termination payment roll-over. I commend the bill BILL 2005 to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Ms Livermore) adjourned. NA (IMMUNISATION PROGRAM) BILL 2005 Second Reading Debate resumed from 14 September, on motion by Mr Abbott: That this bill be now read a second time. upon which Ms Gillard moved by way of amendment: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House expresses its concern that the Government has: (1) consistently ignored the expert advice of the Australian Therapeutic Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) with respect to the inclusion of pneumococcal, oral polio and chicken pox vaccines on the National Immunisation Program; (2) failed to consult with ATAGI prior to announcing this change in its role in vaccine approval; (3) failed to publicly state how ATAGI and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee will work together on the approval and listing of vaccines for the National Immunisation Program and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme; and (4) established a mechanism whereby it will be increasingly difficult for new vaccines, such as the vaccine recently announced against cervical cancer, to be listed for universal use”.",19
3,Ms LIVERMORE,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"Before the debate on this bill was adjourned last night, I was saying that Labor's concern is that this bill may be more about cost reduction in the immunisation program than about getting the vital vaccines that are needed and identified by the experts out and accessible to the community. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing used the term ‘cost-effectiveness' five times during his second reading speech on 14 September this year. To me, this denotes that the focus of this government is on the financial implications of supplying vaccines rather than the social benefit and long term health expenditure savings of effective publicly funded immunisation. This bill removes the role of the Australian therapeutic advisory group on immunisation as a provider of expert opinion in relation to immunisation. It is to be replaced by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. The government is going to give the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee the role of recommending which vaccines to fund. But this is a government which has been known to ignore the advice of, and to make policy announcements without the advice of, the PBAC previously. Earlier this year the health minister decided to remove calcium from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. He undertook this action without seeking advice from the PBAC until after he had made the announcement. As my colleague the shadow minister for health has stated previously, even when the minister received advice from the PBAC regarding this decision on calcium, the minister returned the advice for ‘clarification'. In these circumstances, how can we be reassured that the system of independent expert advice will continue to be the basis for these vital medical decisions on vaccines, when the minister consistently ignores or second-guesses the recommendations coming from the expert bodies set up to do that job? As I said, this bill removes the role of the Australian therapeutic advisory group on immunisation as a provider of expert opinion in relation to immunisation; it is to be replaced by the PBAC. A cynical outsider might suggest that this is actually a political ploy to punish the ATAGI for standing by its recommendation to fund the pneumococcal vaccine when it was inconvenient for the government to do so in the lead-up to the 2004 election. Even if it is not political payback-we will give the government the benefit of the doubt-we still have concerns that this shift from the ATAGI to the PBAC will cause a change in the way that these important decisions on important vaccines are made. For a start, while this bill creates two extra positions on the PBAC, there is nothing in the legislation stating that either position needs to be filled by someone with expertise in immunisation. This is in contrast to the composition of the ATAGI, which is required to have at least six members with expertise or experience in different aspects of immunisation research or practice. In addition to that concern, the criteria applied by the ATAGI for inclusion of a vaccine on the National Immunisation Program and the criteria applied by the PBAC for inclusion on the PBS are quite different. Both require a consideration of the costeffectiveness of the treatment, but the ATAGI takes a broader perspective, looking at the effect the vaccine will have on public health and the savings that will generate, not just the cost-effectiveness for the individual who receives the treatment. Our consideration of this bill cannot happen in isolation from a consideration of the government's track record in health, particularly its record in providing pharmaceuticals and vaccines to the people in the community who need them the most and who are least able to afford them. We have seen that this is a government that refuses to listen to experts and believes that it knows better. Based on its track record, this is a government that cares more about the economic bottom line than the health of our children. Labor will be monitoring the progress of the outcomes of this bill very closely to make sure that the vaccines that are considered necessary by the appropriate experts are available and publicly funded.",20
4,Mr HATTON,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"I am happy to follow the shadow minister for health and the member for Capricornia in this debate to support the opposition's series of amendments to the National Health Amendment (Immunisation Program) Bill 2005. It is an important bill because it is about Australian children and the health of the Australian community. It is important because you have to look at the manner in which the Minister for Health and Ageing has previously dealt with issues similar to this. You also have to look at why we are here today debating this particular bill. If one were to listen to Jane Halton, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing, and the evidence that she has given to a Senate inquiry, one could believe that the purpose for this bill is simply to continue the PBAC's long history of being able to properly gauge how much it is going to cost to bring in a new medicine. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee does have that long history and expertise, but in this it has been given a function that it has never had in relation to vaccines. It is a function that would replace a function that the government's very own body of experts set up in 1997 and has had for nearly nine years. After this period of time, from 1997 to 2005, why was that government body, which specialises in vaccinations and has members that the PBAC does not have who are specialists in vaccination, found to be deficient? That is a big question and it needs a big answer. I do not think that we are going to get that answer here. The person who should be able to give the answer is the minister for health. He should come to this dispatch box and explain for himself why this bill is necessary and why the technical advisory group that has been doing this work for all this time is suddenly incapable of performing its function, with that function being passed over to the PBAC. What does the bill say about ATAGI? It says that it is good enough to get an extra $2.8 million in funding, to perform a reduced function. It says that the PBAC should receive something in the order of $7 million extra to take on these extra functions in relation to vaccines. It also says that, instead of having a part-time chair, the PBAC can have a full-time chair who can do the whole job in one. But the PBAC does not get the specific expertise that is available in ATAGI. What are we told that that group is going to do with extra money but reduced responsibility? It is still going to provide technical advice, but it will not be technical advice to itself to determine what vaccines should be recommended to the government; it will be technical advice which will go to the PBAC and then the PBAC will make the determination. What is the rationale given for this? The rationale is that they have the expertise, and the fundamental rationale is that it will now bill be about the cost-effectiveness of providing vaccines for Australians. If you listened to the reasonable and rational argument that the secretary of the department put forward, the fundamental framework is about taking a body that is experienced in dealing with costeffectiveness-the PBAC, which has done a great job for a long time-boosting that with the money available to it, boosting the chair to a full-time position and, specifically, having the ATAGI group, the technical experts group, just do their job to provide that technical information. One wonders what the experts think about this. We have had a pretty direct response. The person who was the chair of the technical specialists group that the government established in 1997 resigned outright as a result of this change. What was good for eight years is no longer good. I would suggest-as the shadow minister for health and the member for Capricornia argued at some length-that there is a bit more to this than what appears on the surface. That ‘bit' is fundamentally political. I remember very well arguing in this place in relation to previous bills on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and on the issue of vaccinations. Everyone in this House who was here in the last parliament should remember the long and drawn-out debate that we had on pneumococcal vaccines and two associated vaccines-chickenpox and one other vaccinethat were recommended by this group of technical experts, once, to the minister for health. What was the minister for health's response to that recommendation? Eventually, in relation to the pneumococcal vaccine, and in the context of the lead-up to a federal tion and six months or more of pressure that he was put under, his fundamental response was: ‘The worldwide capacity to produce pneumococcal vaccine has been challenged. There is not enough available in Australia. That is why we are not providing it.' Eventually, under pressure, he said, ‘We will look into it.' Finally, he said, ‘Yes, we will make the pneumococcal vaccine available to all children in Australia and those people of challenged health who are in the relevant age group.' He finally did that, after a great deal of pressure. We did not see the same reaction in relation to the two other vaccines that were recommended. What we have seen is a political response to this, as the shadow minister has argued-and as I concur. This bill is a result of that. The minister was forced to put the pneumococcal vaccine on the PBS. But instead of the ATAGI group, which have done this work for eight years, being still responsible in the future for advising the government, based on their technical expertiseand instead of their having, as they would expect, that advice generally accepted-the PBAC will be in charge. There was a double step in the process: the minister approved the pneumococcal vaccine but threw the issue of the other two vaccines back to the advisory committee, saying he wanted them to have a look at it. The committee came back and said, ‘Minister, we still recommend that these vaccines be provided to those people in Australia who need them.' They will not be doing that in future, if this bill goes through this House and through the Senate-and given that the government has the majority there you can expect that it may do. The result of that will be that the technical advisory group will not be able to formally say to government, ‘This elecis so important in immunisation terms that we recommend you do it,' to stand up to government and make-or not make-that determination. The minister has divorced himself from that and said, ‘Okay, let us go to a cost benefit analysis and see what the PBAC comes up with.' I do not think that is particularly wise. I can understand the secretary of the department, under instruction from the minister, putting the case she has put-a seemingly rational one-but I think there is more to this than that, and I think that it has been driven further. This is happening at a time when, in part due to natural disasters worldwide but also in part due to changed environmental conditions, the world is under increasing pressure in relation to immunisation questions. If you look at the way in which Australia has approached these questions and the way in which other countries have approached them, you will see major differences. I will grant that as minister for health Dr Wooldridge was driven when it came to ensuring proper immunisation programs were put in place in Australia, but since he ceased being minister for health and since the current minister for health has been there the fundamental part of the immunisation agenda has been based on a political rather than a social and public health policy approach. I do not think public health policy should be driven by press release. I do not think it should be driven by ministerial profile. I do not think it should be driven by spleen and an attempt to get back at those technical groups who have argued against what the minister wants or the position he has taken. What is happening elsewhere in the world in terms of the difficulties that are faced as result of diseases that could ravage countries from one end to the other? In the developing world, they have got the message that prevention is better than cure and that if you put the money in it is worthwhile. The United Nations and the World Health Organisation recognise this and have encouraged developing countries to put prevention programs in place. Given the problems that have been faced, the fact that you should prevent, rather than attempt to cure after the fact, has been taken into account by countries like India and China. In relation to this, I will quote from the September 2005 issue of Scientific American. That issue was a special issue. Its cover headline was ‘Crossroads for Planet Earth'. It dealt, in part, with the fundamental problem of the new face of disease. This is what it said: Elsewhere, targeted efforts to bring vaccinations, antibiotics and nutrition to millions-along with improved sanitation-have dramatically reduced the number of deaths from infectious disease, as much as 60 percent in some regions. Today major immunization campaigns are under way to meet WHO's and UN. Millennium Development Project's goals of vaccinating all youngsters against childhood diseases, particularly in Africa. Also, countries such as India and China have launched National Immunization Days, with extraordinary results. In just one week in November 2004, 2.5 million volunteers immunized 167 million Indian children. In addition to prolonging life, vaccination makes tremendous economic sense. For every dollar the US spends on diphtheria, pertussis and typhus (DPT) vaccines, an estimated $29 is saved in medical costs; for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), the return averages $21-a bargain by any measure. If it is a bargain in US dollars for those countries in the developing world, it is a bargain in Australian dollars to have immunisation campaigns properly run and resourced, and it is worth having the technical advisory group, which has worked as well as it has for the a past eight years, continuing to have the functions it has had so far. So, despite the fact that this bill will, fundamentally, be accepted, our query in relation to this is: how are the public health issues going to be dealt with by a minister who we do not think can be completely trusted to do the right thing by the community at large-because of what happened in the incidents involving the pneumococcal vaccine and the other associated vaccines: the oral polio and chickenpox vaccines? As a result of our concerns, the opposition have moved a series of amendments. Our amendments express our concern at the way the government has: (1) consistently ignored the expert advice of the Australian Therapeutic Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) with respect to the inclusion of pneumococcal, oral polio and chicken pox vaccines on the National Immunisation Program; That has been the thrust of my speech so far. I think that has utterly, apparently and conclusively been demonstrated, both before the last election and since then. Our amendments also say the government has: (2) failed to consult with ATAGI prior to announcing this change in its role in vaccine approval; We know part of the outcome of that. It has been demonstrated again and it was argued previously by me. The person who was the chair of that committee said, ‘Well, that's it; I'm out of here. If you are going to effectively treat this committee with such utter contempt, then I am no longer going to be part of it.' Our amendment also says that the government has: (3) failed to publicly state how ATAGI and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee will work together on the approval and listing of vaccines for the National Immunisation Program and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme; and (4) established a mechanism whereby it will be increasingly difficult for new vaccines, as the vaccine recently announced against cervical cancer, to be listed for universal use”. One thing that foreign pharmaceutical companies acting in Australia as regional units of overseas entities have a good track record in doing is developing new drugs that are useful not only in Australia but worldwide. These new drugs are invented and proven effective in Australia but then get worldwide approval and are developed for worldwide distribution from Australia. A number of such drugs have been developed by the Merck Corporation in the electorate next to mine, the electorate of Reid, by their group in Granville. The work force largely comes from my electorate of Blaxland. The Merck Corporation have built a very substantial business on the basis of their own research and development. Under Labor's policy, they took one of their drugs from nothing to $4 billion of income for the company. They made $400 million a year, year on year, and averaged out that is $4 billion over a decade. The second drug they did that with, Vioxx, has been taken off the market because of deleterious consequences associated with it, but the same company have just announced that their vaccine trials in relation to cervical cancer have proven to be utterly effective. The vaccine has been shown to be 100 per cent effective against cervical cancer in women. I know, from the experiences of people I know, how much cervical cancer can impact on the lives of women. This is a disease that is not just contracted in later life; it can happen to young women. I know the surgical procedures that they have to go through in order to eliminate cervical cancer, and there is a prospect for some-and a certainty for others-that, as a result of cervical cancer, they will never be able to bear children. This such drug, based on Australian research done by a multinational company resident in Australia and doing the work to produce a product as good as this, will save the lives of Australian women. It will allow them to bear children and allow them to ensure that they have a full and long life. They will be able to be immunised by an Australian vaccine. Under this new bill, will this vaccine for cervical cancer-if it is covered by this legislation-be able to get through the ATAGI process? My guess is yes. Will it then be able to get through the cost-benefit analysis of the PBAC? The PBAC analysis should be based on cost-effectiveness, but the question now is: what are we going to put first? Are we going to put first a vaccination that could save the lives of myriad women in Australia, given the benefits known since Pasteur of full body vaccination programs? Or is the analysis simply going to be based on the normal PBAC guidelines? In this case, given all the people who have suffered from cervical cancer previously and who know its deleterious, life-threatening effects-you can die from it-you would have to argue that it would be sensible to approve the vaccine for those people and for the coming population. The vaccination will not work unless it covers the entire cohort we are looking at. We are looking at those young people who are sexually active as well as people in mid-life using the vaccination program to provide immunity and to cut out the scourge of cervical cancer from this population. I do not know whether that is going to get approval here. If it does not get approval here, it raises a larger question about Austraanswered lia's ability to earn income from overseas. Merck has a drug, and it has demonstrated with two drugs before this one that it can build from nothing to $400 million worth of exports. If it is not supported, then we do get the impact from an Australian based entity, as part of a multinational company, ducing very sophisticated material to send overseas to help people worldwide. That drug can just be taken off and given to another country if Australia is not part of that program. That is a simple example. There is a whole string of other pharmaceutical companies in Australia producing vaccines and other drugs. For example, there is the Australian Relenza vaccine, which is taken by nose. That is not recommended by the health minister with regard to the potential avian bird flu pandemic; an overseas one has been recommended instead. You have to worry about how this will be dealt with by this minister. This bill will go through the House with uncertain effects in relation to vaccination from now on. The technical group has effectively been sidelined. I trust what the PBAC has done previously, but you have to have a strong regard to what this minister has done previously and the fact that this is a politically driven approach. (Time expired)  tary to the Minister for Health and Ageing) (10.28 am)-in reply-In summing up, I would like to thank those who have contributed to the debate on the National Health Amendment (Immunisation Program) Bill 2005-from the opposition, the members for Lalor, Capricornia, Blaxland and Shortland, and, from the government, the members for Pearce and La Trobe. I am sure that the questions put by the member for Blaxland in his erudite address to the House today are fully by the second reading speech of the Minister for Health and Ageing, Mr Abbott, whom I am happy to represent today. This bill amends the National Health Act 1953 to extend the role of the Pharmaceutical not Benefits Advisory Committee to include advising the government on the vaccines that pro- should be funded through the National Immunisation Program, a very important and popular program of this government. The bill also increases the membership of the PBAC to ensure it has the expertise to consider vaccines in this context and changes the role of the PBAC chairperson to full time in order to take account of the changes that will be required and the heightened workload. In summary, the new immunisation policy advisory arrangement will take advantage of what is a well-established and transparent process which has been used by the PBAC for some time, which is recognised and supported and which both the public and the parliament have faith in when funding recommendations are made with respect to vaccines. I commend the bill to the House.",21
5,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Lalor has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question. A division having been called and the bells having been rung,26
6,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"Do you want to call off the division? Mr Albanese-Yes, we will call it off. Question agreed to. Original question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading  tary to the Minister for Health and Ageing) (10.33 am)-by leave-The opposition might like to consider Mr Fitzgibbon as their new Deputy Manager of Opposition Business in the House after this performance by the member for Grayndler. I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (LOSS NA MEASURES) BILL 2005 Second Reading Debate resumed from 14 September, on motion by Mr Brough: That this bill be now read a second time.",26
7,Mr FITZGIBBON,RECOUPMENT RULES AND OTHER,"The Tax Laws Amendment (Loss Recoupment Rules and Other Measures) Bill 2005 is a complex and lengthy tax bill that contains seven schedules. I might note at the outset that once again we asked the office of the Treasurer or the Assistant Treasurer for a briefing on this bill and once again we failed to secure one. I do not know what that is about. I would have thought that it would be a great contribution to the workings of this parliament if the government was prepared to bring the opposition into the loop on these important tax changes and fully brief us so that we can have a proper understanding about the complexities of the bill. It is difficult to be certain about all those things from opposition, with the limited resources available to us. I would have thought that it would have been helpful to both the government and the Australian community if we had proper briefings on these matters. That raises another very important point, and that is the importance of the Senate committee process with respect to these tax bills. In the course of the last year or so, we have referred a number of these complex tax bills to Senate committees. We did that for two reasons: first, because we lacked briefings and we wanted to tease out with officials some of the finer details and points within those bills; and, second, to give the affected sectors an opportunity to come before the Senate committee and share their views about these issues. I remind the House again that it has not always been possible for the opposition to hear those views, because too often bills are thrust upon us on, say, a Thursday, during the period for the introduction of bills, and debated in this place on the following Monday, giving us very limited scope for proper consultation with the sectors involved. Many of those people are in the business community; many are in the not-for-profit sector or the community generally. Again I make the point that the government fulfils no real purpose by denying the opposition proper briefings on these complex and lengthy taxation issues. As I said, this particular bill contains seven schedules. I think it is reasonable to say that schedules 3 to 7 inclusive are not controversial. While I will make some reference to them, I will not be dwelling on them too much today, and they have bipartisan support. The other two schedules, schedules 1 and 2, vary in their level of controversy. Schedule 1 is not one that causes great concern for the opposition but is one about which I understand there is some concern in the business community, particularly in the areas of joint ventures, innovation and mining exploration companies, where returns on investment can be some years down the track from the time of the original investment. I want to turn to those issues in some detail. At this point I will move my second reading amendment: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for failing to: (1) present a tax regime for company losses that gives sufficient attention to the needs ing exploration and venture capital; (2) provide a clear policy justification for changes to the conduit foreign income regime; and (3) advance meaningful taxation reform”.",26
8,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,RECOUPMENT RULES AND OTHER,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Albanese-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,27
9,Mr FITZGIBBON,RECOUPMENT RULES AND OTHER,"Companies, as distinct from individuals, can generally claim a tax deduction for losses outside the income year in which they are incurred. They are effectively carried forward to future tax years. This is particularly important for the sectors that I have mentioned-the mining sector and venture capital-where there can be a significant lag between the time of investment and the actual realisation of returns. You cannot claim a tax deduction against nothing, so these losses can be carried forward and taken as deductions in future years. In order to obtain these losses historically, and prior to the proposal put forward to the House today, a number of tests needed to be met. The two key tests are the substantial continuity of ownership test-or COT, to introduce yet another acronym into the House-and of course the ‘same business test'. Under the current rules, if a company holds 50 per cent of the voting power or half the dividends or capital gains, it meets the continuity of ownership test. Currently, under the SBT, the same business test, a company is required to carry on basically the same business-in other words, the nature of the business has not substantially changed. Only one of these tests needed to be met. Under the current arrangements COT has become very difficult to calculate due to the difficulty of tracing ownership with many interposed entities in place-holding companies, trusts, foreign entities and of course of minsuperannuation funds. The test is continuous, so theoretically it should be monitored by the firm all the time. The government is right to identify that the compliance burden here is far too high. Labor therefore supports the policy intent of reducing the compliance on business, a business community which is already overburdened with business red tape, regulation and taxation compliance. Businesses have in the past relied on the same business test, a test involving somewhat less compliance. It is questionable whether this was the original intention of the regime. The government's bill seeks to address this by proposing a new regime for COT that is easier to comply with. The new COT basically is met by a company being ‘widely held' or listed. A private company basically faces a 75 per cent rule-that is, the owner receives 75 per cent of the income or capital, or gains or holds 75 per cent of control of the company. The government also proposes that a company can only rely on the same business test to get the losses if total income is less than $100 million. From the perspective of the business community the changes could be described as somewhat of a mixed blessing. We think these are important integrity measures, but there is a real danger here that some businesses will be denied the opportunity to meet this test and that has implications for the sectors I have mentioned. In fact, key tax advocates, like the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the mining sector, do have major concerns. The new rules may also be tougher on mergers. Merging of companies can be important in capturing economies of scale, and this is appropriate where there is not a disbenefit to the wider economy or the community. These are important things to consider in the context of this bill. This is because not easy for companies to get over the new $100 million for the same business test in the case of merging entities. Consolidation is the normal process of industry evolution in some sectors like mining, exploration and venture capital. Such companies will now be denied access to the same business test and will have to rely on the COT. There is concern that the new COT may still be too hard for some companies to meet, meaning that under the proposed law they may not receive the tax benefit of losses they currently make use of. If this is true this is potentially a major barrier to investment in the sectors I have referred to. Labor will seek to refer this issue to the Senate committee process. That will give the mining companies and like industry associations the opportunity to come in and discuss these with the Senate committee to see whether those concerns are real and whether the bill can be improved. Basically, Labor does not have any real concern with the concept. It is an integrity measure and we support it. But there are some very important issues in some very important sectors. I do not have to go to venture capital-it is obvious for anywhere there is a high degree of innovation. I am very pleased to see Geoff Prosser in the House. I cannot remember the name of his seat at the moment. ",27
10,Mr FITZGIBBON,RECOUPMENT RULES AND OTHER,"Forrest, of course. I know that he will share my concerns about the potential impact of these changes in the mining sector. Mr Albanese-He's crossing the floor too, is he?",28
11,Mr FITZGIBBON,RECOUPMENT RULES AND OTHER,"I don't think he will be crossing the floor like Senator Joyceit is although we will hold out some hope; there is always a bit of a chance, I suppose, with an independently minded person like the member for Forrest. But I know that, as Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry and Resources, a committee that held an inquiry into the crisis in the investment levels in mining exploration, he will understand very well the potential adverse implications of this bill on that sector. I am really delighted that the member for Forrest will be speaking, because no doubt he will share my view that something in a proactive sense needs to be done in mining to lift investment levels in mining exploration. We really do have a crisis in this country in that area. His committee, of which I was a member, recommended that this be addressed by the introduction of a flowthrough share scheme, which would basically allow investors in a small exploration company to draw through the expenses against their income. That would make investment in these small exploration companies very attractive. There are a lot of reasons why mining exploration investment is dropping off. Consolidation is one reason. We had a big shift of capital into the technology stocks for a period, so not surprisingly there was competition for funds, but one would think that, with the prices we are experiencing for our minerals, metals and fossil fuels at the moment, exploration would have lifted. I am yet to see the evidence. The member for Forrest might have seen some, and I will be interested to hear what he has to say on that point. I am surprised that the government has yet to move to embrace the sensible recommendations of the Prosser committee. We looked very carefully at integrity measures. We do not want this thing to be opened up as a rort-small exploration companies set up all over the place as a means of getting deductions, which people are not necessarily entitled to. In the policy Labor put forward to the people in the last election, we put in place integrity measures and a cap on the amount-I think it was only 50 per cent of expenses-that could be claimed by the person drawing through the losses. We certainly put a sunset clause on it. I think it may have been five years in order to review the policy and ensure after that period that there was not any inappropriate use of the scheme available. I think we also put a cap on the amount of money that could be drawn through. These are sensible things that could be done in mining exploration, which were supported by the committee chaired by the member for Forrest, announced by the Labor Party-by me, in fact-in Kalgoorlie sometime early in 2004 but are still not embraced by the government. I cannot understand why the government is prepared to acknowledge the need to give leverage to oil exploration offshore, with incentives within the resource rent tax, but is not prepared to do something for a crisis in mining exploration which is just as real and just as large. I can only come to the conclusion that the lobby for the oil and gas industry is somewhat more effective and powerful than the lobby for the mining industry, as powerful as the lobby for the mining industry may be. This is a good time, when we are talking about a measure that does potentially have adverse consequences for investment in mining exploration, to start thinking again about the merit of allowing people to participate in a flow-through share scheme which would act as a big incentive to investment in exploration. I will turn to schedule 2. Currently, only non-portfolio investments-that is, investments directly owned and operated-by nonresidents investing in offshore activities through Australian companies avoid dividend withholding tax, which is normally set at 30 per cent but can be lower due to double taxation treaties or activities in tax sheltered countries. In other words, an overseas resident investing in an Australian entity which is investing offshore can, under the current law, gain an exemption from the withholding tax and effectively avoid paying company tax in Australia. This bill proposes to extend that exemption for overseas residents who are holding an interest in portfolio investments-in other words, not a big, directly controlled investment but a minor interest in the project involved. To give a basic example, if a London resident is investing in Macquarie Bank for the purposes of building an airport in Budapest, under the current law, if Macquarie Bank is the direct investor-the major investor and effectively the person that controls the infrastructure project-then the exemption would apply to that investment from the Londoner. But it would not apply if Macquarie Bank's stake in the Budapest airport was one per cent or less-if it was not a controlling interest et cetera. That is a key differentiation in the two schemes, and this bill will extend that exemption to those who are also involved in portfolio investments. The Labor Party have some concerns about this. We think the principle of encouraging investment in Australian entities for offshore investment is a very good thing for our economy. We support the current exemption but we are yet to be absolutely convinced there is justification for extending it to portfolio investments. Again, we will be seeking to send that provision off to the Senate committee to let them have a closer look at the adverse implications and hopefully get some idea of the cost involved and the number of individuals. We know the cost involved from the estimates in the EM, which is about $70 million over four years, so it is not a small amount of money. We would like to tease that out a little further in the Senate tidied up. committee process. Again, I appeal to the government to allow those processes to continue. We cannot have a government riding roughshod over the parliamentary process just because it has captured power in both houses of parliament. That has bad consequences in both policy and economic outcomes and bad outcomes for our democracy. We saw a bit of democracy in the Senate last night, and we would not mind seeing a bit more of it. Hopefully, the Senate sent a very clear signal to the government last night that it is not prepared to just rubber-stamp every extreme proposal that comes before it. It stood up on trade practices last night and, hopefully, when the Prime Minister's extreme industrial relations package reaches that place it will stand up on that matter too. We look forward to that forthcoming event. I now turn to schedule 3-that is, the denial of deductions for illegal activities. The bill changes current law which allows deductions on illegal gains. Income from illegal activities is assessable so deductions are, at the moment, allowed. Some people would find that fairly extraordinary, but it is the case. This has led to some notorious abuses by convicted criminals, so Labor supports the change. Proceeds from illegal activity will remain taxable and, of course, we will not be allowing the criminals to claim a deduction on their expenses. I do not know whether that is the purchase of the gun or the crowbar for the window. I am sure we are talking about white-collar crime as well. The government seems to be taking a ridiculously long time to introduce this measure. I am going to plead ignorance. I was not aware that criminals were allowed to claim deductions for expenses on their illegal activities. I suppose it is a criticism of both sides of the chamber if it has been around for a long time, but we are delighted that that will be Schedule 4 provides for copyright in films to be included in the effective life depreciation regime. The current law specifies a statutory life for the assets of investments in film copyright, usually 25 years, but with more concessional rules in certain circumstances-for example, the immediate deduction for capital expenditure for qualifying Australian films where there is an initial interest test in the copyright. The statutory rate method is typical for intangible assets. The bill will allow the commissioner to specify the effective life, in an independent way, following normal treatment of more tangible assets. It can be argued that this copyright is a more tangible asset and the effective economic life of these assets is less than 25 years. This will mean a significant bringing forward of deductible capital expenditure for those projects which do not enjoy immediate deductibility. This measure will clearly assist the Australian industry and has tax policy merit. It is good policy and, on that basis, the opposition will support it. Schedule 5 goes to relief for employee share scheme participants in the event of a corporate restructure. A capital gains tax event can occur when there is a corporate restructure. This means that capital losses might need to be realised, with a negative impact on employees in share ownership schemes, or that tax might be payable which would otherwise be deferred. This measure supports the regime that encourages employee share ownership. On that basis, and as the authors of that scheme, we support this change. Schedule 6 goes to the offsetting of late payments for superannuation guarantee contributions against an employer's superannuation guarantee charge. The current rules can lead to a double payment. Late payment for an SG contribution incurs a penalty tax, which ensures the benefit is passed on to the employee. This is appropriate and is retained under the bill, but it is not clear that the law absolves the employer of the original obligation even if he has paid the tax. If he has not paid his contribution, he pays the penalty, which is the Commonwealth's constitutional mechanism for obtaining the benefit for the employee. However, there is some concern under the law that he might be hit with a penalty but still be liable for the original tribution, which of course would be unfair and unacceptable. Labor supports the change. Schedule 7 is about applying the superannuation guarantee to back payments of wages. This measure also clarifies superannuation guarantee issues by ensuring that SG payments must be made for back pay in the event of termination of employment. Labor supports the amendment. In summary, there are seven schedules. The opposition do not have any difficulty with schedules 3 to 7; in fact, we enthusiastically support them. There is some concern about schedule 1, on the carrying forward of losses for companies. We agree that the integrity measure is probably appropriate but we want to have a look at some of the consequences for some of those industries through the Senate committee process. We support the principle of schedule 2, on conduit foreign income, but we are concerned that it is a further extension of a very generous concession-$70 million over four years. We would like to have a closer look at all the implications and consequences of the matter and at the integrity of the costings, including the number of individuals, companies and entities that are likely to be involved. I moved the second reading amendment for good purpose: to allow for a broader debate on this bill and to highlight the points that I have made within the second reading amendment. Almost on a daily basis we are in here considering tax changes. Some of them are controversial but most of them are appropriate, with many of them going to important integrity issues. But what we are still not getting in this place is real and meaningful tax reform. When I talk about tax reform, I do not mean tax cuts. There is a great debate in this place at the moment about how much money we should be handing back to conthe Australian community. In addition to that, there is a debate about whether we should be handing back money in the form of tax cuts or investing more in our economic and social infrastructure-roads, schools, hospitals et cetera-but what we really need to debate in this place more than anything is tax reform. We are waiting eagerly for that. There is competition between the member for Wentworth and the member for Higgins and others about who can produce the biggest tax cut in which income band. We have seen some threshold changes-some appropriate and some inappropriate-but we have not seen any taxation reform that improves the efficiency of the taxation system, that good for our economy and, more importantly than probably anything, that addresses some of those high effective marginal tax rates, which impose such a dampener on our economy and cause so much disincentive for Australian workers and Australian families. That should be the priority in this country and the top marginal tax rate, which will be faced by only three per cent of income earners. The member for Forrest is nodding his head. Yes, I know it includes you. I have some sympathy for the member for Forrest but I have far more sympathy for those people facing high effective marginal tax rates and those in the middle, who still face a higher than acceptable burden, than I do for the member for Forrest and his colleagues who sit next to him in this place. So the appeal goes out: let us get beyond tax cuts; us get to real and meaningful taxation reform. If the government is prepared to come forward with real and meaningful taxation reform which is fair, economically efficient and good for the country, the opposition will support it.  rise to speak in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (Loss Recoupment Rules and Other Measures) Bill 2005, which proposes to amend various tax laws to implement a range of changes and improvements to Australia's taxation and superannuation system. Firstly, schedule 1 introduces reforms to the loss recoupment rules for companies by commencing a new, modified continuity of ownership test to replace the existing modified continuity of ownership test in division 166 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. These amendments extend the range of companies that are eligible to use the modified continuity of ownership test to include all widely held companies and eligible subsidiaries. The amendments will make it easier is and more certain for these companies to apply the modified continuity of ownership test by relaxing the rules for tracing ownership under that test and by specifying the times at which these companies will need to test for continuity of ownership, such as required testing for continuity of ownership at the end not of each income tax year, following a takeover bid or similar transactions and after a substantial capital raising. The amendments also make various technical changes to clarify the operation of the continuity of ownership test for all companies. If a company's deductions exceed its assessable income and net exempt income in an income year, the company has a tax loss which can be carried forward for use as a deduction in a future income year. However, the company can only deduct the tax loss if it let satisfies either the continuity of ownership test or the small business test. The continuity of ownership test is satisfied if the same people hold more than 50 per cent ownership of the voting power and rights to dividends and capital at all times during the relevant test periods. To apply the continuity of ownership test, a company must trace its ownership through companies, trusts and other entities to identify the people who ultimately hold, directly or indirectly, voting power and rights to dividends and capital distributions. It is often difficult for companies to trace through entities such as listed companies, superannuation funds and managed funds to identify the ultimate individual owners. Accordingly, companies owned by these entities may incur substantial compliance costs in determining whether the continuity of ownership test has been satisfied. If such companies cannot determine the ultimate ownership, the deductability of their losses may be uncertain. The changes to the continuity of ownership test will reduce the need for large companies to rely on the same business test to be able to claim deductions for prior year losses. Large companies with diverse businesses have difficulty in satisfying the same business test. Therefore the amendments will remove the same business test for companies, including consolidated groups whose total income is more than $100 million. The new modified continuity of ownership test will apply to losses incurred income years commencing on or after 1 July 2002. It applies to certain eligible pre 1 2002 losses. The small business test amendments apply to losses incurred in income years commencing on or after 1 July 2005. The measure was announced by the former Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer by press release on 7 April 2004 and by the current Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer in a press release of February 2005. This measure is expected to reduce compliance costs. It will also be easier for companies that are eligible to apply the new, modified continuity of ownership test to test for continuity of ownership. Large companies will no longer be able to apply the small business test if they fail the continuity of ownership test. The companies that are affected by the removal of the small business test are those most likely to benefit from the simplified continuity of ownership test. Administrative costs for the Australian Taxation Office will be reduced, as it is expected that there will be fewer requests by taxpayers for rulings and company audits will be simplified. Schedule 2 of the bill relates to conduit foreign income. It proposes to insert division 802 in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and make changes to various provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to replace the existing foreign dividend account provision. The changes provide tax relief for conduit foreign income, which generally is foreign income received by a foreign resident through an Australian corporate tax entity. These rules will allow Australian companies that receive foreign income on which no Australian tax is payable to pay dividends to foreign shareholders that are also free of Australian withholding tax. The measure ensures that these amounts are not taxed in Australia when distributed by the Australian in- corporate tax entity to its foreign owners. Generally, the measure will only apply to July foreign income that is ordinarily sheltered from Australian tax where it is received by an Australian corporate tax entity. This measure will provide foreign investors who structure their foreign investments through Australian entities with more neutral Australian tax outcomes when compared to foreign investors who hold their foreign investments more directly. This will further enhance the ability of Australian entities with foreign investments to compete for foreign capital. It will also improve the attractiveness of Australia as a location for regional holding companies. Chapter 5 of the explanatory memorandum to the bill describes how a corporate tax entity will calculate an amount of conduit foreign income and explains how conduit foreign income can pass through a series of Australian corporate tax entities to the ultimate foreign owners, free of Australian tax. The amendments made by this measure will allow the entity to calculate the amount of conduit foreign income from the beginning of the first income tax year that starts on or after 1 July 2005. Transitional rules will affect the first year of this calculation for all existing entities. They also ensure that an entity can only declare an amount to be conduit foreign income where that declaration is made on or after the date of royal assent. This measure was announced by the Treasurer by press release on 13 May 2003. The cost to revenue of this measure is expected to be $5 million in 2005-06, $20 million for each of the following two years and $25 million per annum thereafter. I am told that there may be an increase in the compliance costs for Australian corporate tax entities that choose to access the benefits of this measure. However, I am also informed that, where corporate tax entities choose to pass on conduit foreign income amounts to their members, the benefits conferred by the conduit foreign income rules will outweigh the additional compliance costs incurred. By providing tax relief for a broader range of foreign income than the current foreign dividend account rules, the measure further enhances the ability of Australian entities with foreign investments to compete for foreign capital. This should encourage those entities to remain Australian residents if their foreign shareholdings become significant. Schedule 3 to this bill inserts section 54 into the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. This measure will apply to losses and outgoings incurred after 29 April 2005 and was announced by the Treasurer on 29 April 2005. The provisions will deny deductions for expenditure incurred in the furtherance of, or directly in relation to, activities where the taxpayer has been convicted of an offence that is punishable by imprisonment for at least 12 months. Deductions will be denied for all expenditure where the activities are wholly illegal, such as drug dealing or people-smuggling. On the other hand, there will be cases where a taxpayer is conducting a lawful business but is convicted of an illegal activity while carrying on that business. In these cases only the expenditure that is incurred directly or in the furtherance of the illegal activity will be denied. Expenditure that is incurred in undertaking the underlying lawful activity and that would have been incurred regardless of the illegal activity will continue to be deductible. This is because the expenditure cannot be said to further or be directly related to the illegal activity. The expenditure is too remote to the illegal activity. Similarly, the capital gains tax provisions will be amended so that losses and outgoings incurred in relation to illegal activities in respect of which the taxpayer was convicted of an indictable offence do not form part of the cost base or reduced cost base for capital gains tax purposes. This will ensure that no capital loss or reduced capital gain can arise from such expenditure. The Commissioner of Taxation will have up to four years after the taxpayer is convicted of an indictable offence to issue an amended assessment. This will provide an appropriate amendment period where a taxpayer makes a claim for a deduction in an income tax return and is subsequently convicted of an indictable offence. Schedule 4 to this bill amends the Income 26- Tax Assessment Act 1997 to include copyright in a film in the general effective life depreciation of the uniform capital allowance provisions in the income tax law. Under effective life depreciation, taxpayers will have a choice of using the Commissioner of Taxation's safe harbour effective life determination or self-assessing the effective life of their copyright in a film. When depreciating their copyright in a film using effective life, taxpayers will also be able to choose between the diminishing value method and the prime cost method. This measure was announced by the government as part of the 2005-06 budget on 10 May 2005. This measure is expected to decrease compliance costs by providing a shorter write-off period under the general effective life depreciation than the current 25-year period. This measure will have favourable implications for film producers and investors of films that do not qualify as Australian films, and these amendments will apply to a copyright in a film acquired on or after 1 July 2004. Schedule 5 to this bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and provides tax relief, in certain circumstances, for employees who participate in employee share schemes in the event of a corporate restructure. This ensures that a taxing point does not arise for employee share scheme participants in the event of a corporate restructure. It allow employee share scheme participants who acquire shares in a scheme for the acquisition of shares by employees who are assessed under section 26AAC of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to treat the new shares or rights they are issued because of a corporate restructure as a continuation of their old shares or rights. These amendments also allow employee share scheme participants who have made an election under division 13A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to be taxed up front to treat the new shares or rights they issued because of a corporate restructure as a continuation of their old shares or rights. Therefore, when an employee is issued new shares or rights as the result of a corporate restructure or a 100 per cent takeover, they will now be able to treat their new shares or rights as a continuation of their old shares or rights. Amendments are also made to the Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No. 3) 2003, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997 to ensure the capital gains tax provisions in those acts reflect the amendments to the ESS provisions to provide continuity of treatment. In this manner, the amendments further support the development of employee share schemes and the alignment of employer and employee interests. Schedule 6 to this bill amends the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 to allow the offsetting of a late payment of contributions against an employer's superannuation guarantee charge, thereby providing relief for employers who may potentially have to make a double payment of superannuation contributions. Currently, employers who make a late contribution to a superannuation fund may be required to pay this amount again as part of the superannuawill tion guarantee charge payable to the Australian Taxation Office. This charge includes the full amount of any shortfall, even though a contribution relating to the relevant period had subsequently been paid into an employee's superannuation fund or retirement savings account by the employer. These amendments will allow late employer superannuation contributions which have been made for an employee to a superannuation provider within a month of the superannuation guarantee due date to be used to offset the portion of any superannuation are guarantee charge that relates to that employee for the quarter. To ensure there continues to be a strong incentive for employers to make superannuation guarantee payments by the due date, late payments will not be tax deductible. Employee entitlements will not be jeopardised, as employees will still receive their full superannuation shortfall plus interest to compensate them for the late payment. This proposal was announced in the 2005-06 budget on 10 May 2005, and these amendments will apply to late payments of contributions made on or after 1 January 2006. Finally, schedule 7 to the bill includes the proposals announced in the 2005-06 budget and relates to applying the superannuation guarantee to back payments of wages. Schedule 7 therefore amends the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 to clarify that mandatory employer contributions under the superannuation guarantee arrangements are payable on wages or salaries paid in a quarter following the termination of an employment relationship. This will ensure employees do not lose superannuation entitlements as a result of being underpaid during their employment. Former employees and former employers are deemed to be employees and employers respectively in those sections that deal with the calculation of perannuation guarantee shortfalls, the reduction of the superannuation guarantee charge percentage by employers and the distribution of any superannuation guarantee charge by the Australian Taxation Office. The Australian Taxation Office's view of the law is that there is a superannuation guarantee obligation for employers that make payments of salaries or wages to former employees. However, amendments are required to put this issue beyond doubt. This bill proposes to amend the various laws I have outlined to implement a range of changes and improvements to the Australian taxation and superannuation system for the benefit of all Australian businesses and employees. I commend the bill to the House.",28
12,Dr EMERSON,RECOUPMENT RULES AND OTHER,"Rankin) (11.16 am)Yet again members of parliament are debating an amendment to the taxation laws of this country. It seems that every sitting week there is a taxation law amendment bill-in this case, the Tax Laws Amendment (Loss Recoupment Rules and Other Measures) Bill 2005-and that must tell people of common sense that there are problems. Indeed, there are quite profound problems with our income tax system, so it requires amendment on an almost weekly basis. The truth of the matter is that, when this government came into office, the income tax act ran to 3,500 pages; now runs to 9,000 pages-a much bigger, much more complex document. All members of parliament would recall that in the year 2000, and in the couple of years before that, the government promised the Australian people A New Tax System for a new century, a simplified tax system that would allow businesses to get on and do what they do best-that is, to expand their businesses, to make profits and to employ people. That is what businesses should do and that is what businesses try to do, but on so many occasions businesses are required to pause and su- seek to understand the complexity of the income tax act. On top of that complexity, which has increased exponentially under this government, we now have a very complex goods and services tax. Far from giving the Australian people the streamlined A New Tax System for a new century, the Howard government has given the Australian people a tax mess which is called the income tax act. The amendments contained in this bill will not be opposed by the Labor Party, but we wish to register our ongoing concern with the continued process of amendment and adjustment and ever-growing complexity in the income tax system. To that end, we are supporting a second reading amendment that does not decline to give the bill a second reading but condemns the government for, among other things, failing to advance meaningful tax reform. Here we are in the year 2005, just five years from the date on which Australia was supposed to be given by the Howard government and the Treasurer of this country the streamlined A New Tax System for a new century, and we are continuing to debate and amend on a weekly basis. Some of the provisions in this legislation go to employee share ownership schemes. I was a member of a House of Representatives standing committee inquiry into employee share ownership arrangements, which was it chaired by the current Minister for Education, Science and Training. When he was on the back bench he was straining at the leash to come up with new ways in which employee share ownership arrangements could be made even more attractive-in fact, ways in which they could be made very attractive for company executives. Labor support aligning the interests of employees and employers wherever that is possible but, I must say, other legislation that will soon be debated in this parliament relating to the industrial relations system does not align those interests but puts one against the other. Nevertheless, in the area of employee share ownership, of course we support the aligning of those interests. Our concern, however, is that in relation to executive share options very favourable tax treatment that is already provided would, if the current minister for education had had his way, have been even more favourably treated. This was an attempt by him to gain the support and favour of company executives in this country and, fortunately, on that occasion-though not on many-the Treasurer stood him up and would not have a bar of it, because the arrangements for company executives were already very favourable. These arrangements here appear to apply to bona fide employees, and we do not oppose them. But I do register our ongoing concern with the government's dalliance in trying to make the arrangements for company executives even more favourable. Most Australians would agree that one of the obligations on people up and down the income scale is to pay their fair share of tax. We have seen too much tax avoidance condoned in this country and, in the case of company executive arrangements, we have seen an attempt by the current minister for education to have tax avoidance enshrined in legislation. This legislation also contains tax arrangements relating to the film industry. We on the Labor side of the chamber are big supporters of the film industry, so if this vides a bit of extra support for the film industry that is a good thing. We do not have a problem with that provision. We would be happier if these arrangements were subject to a bit more consultation, but that is a relatively minor process matter. Part (3) of the second reading amendment to this tax laws amendment bill is about the failure of the government to ‘advance meaningful taxation reform'. In the last couple of days we have witnessed the laughable situation of the Treasurer standing up the member for Wentworth, who has been trying to do nothing more nor less than advance the case for genuine tax reform. I think the member for Wentworth would be tempted to support the third provision in our second reading amendment-he would agree that there has been a failure to advance meaningful taxation reform in this country. We know that because the member for Wentworth has produced not one, not two, not three tax reform possibilities but 280 of them. I think that is a pretty strong indication that the member for Wentworth thinks the tax system needs reform. Mr Martin Ferguson-What does the Treasurer think?",36
13,Dr EMERSON,RECOUPMENT RULES AND OTHER,"The Treasurer did not share his views. The best readout we can get of that is by reading the Australian newspaper. I wonder whether the Treasurer has fully briefed the member for Wentworth. I would not be privy to that if that happened, and it is not my business, but what I certainly do know from examining the public record is that the Treasurer refused to produce the costings that he says discredit the proposals put forward by the member for Wentworth. In fact I think the analysis that the Treasurer provided to a committee is described in the Australian newspaper as a ‘withering analysis'. That is what the Treasurer has done. You would think that a man of the Treasurer's prostanding would be man enough to produce the documentation upon which he launched this withering attack on the member for Wentworth. Mr Martin Ferguson-And at taxpayers' expense.",37
14,Dr EMERSON,RECOUPMENT RULES AND OTHER,"Indeed, as the member for Batman has pointed out, this withering analysis was done at taxpayers' expense. It is clearly in the public interest that the documentation be made available not only to Mr Turnbull but to me, as I understand, again from the Australian newspaper, that the Treasurer costed a tax reform proposal of mine. Who knows what else he might have been costing? It is interesting, isn't it, that we are unable to conduct a critique of that analysis? Why? Because the Treasurer is not man enough to produce the analysis and put it in the public arena. That raises a very deep suspicion, because I believe Treasury officials are honest officials. I do not believe that Treasury officials would engage in the manipulation of analysis and of numbers. I respect the way the Treasury conducts its business. But they would need to be responding to a particular request on the part of the Treasurer, and we do know-again as a matter of public recordthat the Treasurer made that request to Treasury. He told the Australian Financial Review that it was a perfectly reasonable request from Mr Turnbull and other members of their backbench group that the Treasury provide these costings. They have provided them to the Treasurer, but the Treasurer has not provided them, as I am advised by the newspapers, to the member for Wentworth. He has provided them to a group of MPs. I do not know if they have copies of them. I suspect that they have been withdrawn. Why wouldn't the Treasurer be man enough to come into this parliament and table that analysis? The greatest opponent of tax reform in this country is the Treasurer, Peter Costello. He is an opponent of tax reform because the member for Wentworth, business groups and people on our side of politics are trying to advance the cause of tax reform and the Treasurer is trying to close it down by saying, ‘The costings of these proposals are wrong, but we are not going to tell the member for Wentworth on what basis they are wrong.' It is incumbent upon the Treasurer to produce these documents and not to hide behind his certification process, where I have got no doubt he will say, ‘I have just exercised my discretion not to put these in the public arena.' It is a cowardly act on the part of the Treasurer of this country to produce an analysis, leak it to the newspapers, attack the member for Wentworth and then say, ‘I'm not making that analysis available to the member for Wentworth, the member for Rankin and to the Australian people.' Tax reform will not be advanced in this country while this man is the Treasurer of the country, because he does not want tax reform. He is the one person in this country who believes that he fundamentally reformed the income tax system in the year 2000. Ms Ley-I rise on a point of order. Mr Deputy Speaker Somlyay, there is a specific amendment before the House moved by the Australian Labor Party. I ask that you ask the member for Rankin to discuss that amendment.",38
15,Dr EMERSON,RECOUPMENT RULES AND OTHER,"On that point of order, I am discussing part (3), which I have mentioned now on two occasions. It would be great if a member opposite would listen to the entire speech and not just intermittently. Part (3) says: ... failing to: … … … (3) advance meaningful taxation reform” I am talking about the failure of the Treasurer of this country to advance meaningful taxation reform. Nothing could be more relevant to this debate, to the future of the Australian economy, to the future prosperity of this country and to the participation of people in the work force. We know, in the words of the Treasurer, that in dealing with the problems of an ageing population there are the other two Ps-participation and productivity. Meaningful tax reform would address both participation and productivity. It would lift Australian productivity growth, unlike the government's vicious, extreme industrial relations legislation, about which the Treasurer is obsessed and about which he does want to make profound changes because he says that that is going to change productivity growth. It will change productivity growthit will reduce productivity growth, because you will not get productivity growth in Australian workplaces where workers are set against employers; you will only get productivity growth in productive, harmonious workplaces. That is when you get productivity growth. But you will get productivity growth out of genuine tax reform and, importantly, you will get a lift in work force participation. That is important in the context of the ageing of the population, where we need as many people entering and remaining in the work force as possible. That is, where they wish to do so-not work-till-you-drop schemes but where people wish to enter the work force and remain in the work force, get ahead and work some extra hours. Let us remove the crushing tax arrangements that are stifling incentive and denying people any genuine reward for effort. That is what tax reform is all about. That is what part (3) of this second reading amendment is all about and that is what I am discussing here today. Genuine tax reform involves reducing some of the marginal rates of taxation at the higher income levels all the way down to the low-income levels, where people are trying to decide, effectively, to move from welfare to work but face punitive marginal tax rates if they do so. It is not worth people moving from welfare to work, particularly in the case of single mothers. An analysis by NATSEM has shown that a single mother under the government's so-called ‘welfare reforms' would be working effectively for $2 an hour, after taking into account the cost of benefits lost, of extra tax paid, of travel to and from work, of work clothes and of lost rent assistance. That single mother, under this government's so-called welfare reforms, would be expected to work for just $2 an hour. The tax reform proposals that have been developed by Labor make sure that there are genuine incentives to move from welfare to work. If we go up the income scale, people who are struggling with high petrol prices, high child-care costs and high health costsall of which have been on the public record in the last few weeks-surely deserve tax reform. Then there are those facing the 42c marginal rate. There are one million taxpayers in the 42c tax bracket. Within the next three years there will be another 400,000 people moving from the 30c rate to the 42c rate. In the coming budget there is a golden opportunity for the government to move on the 42c rate. I have put a proposal in the public arena that the 42c rate could be dropped to 36c and tax cuts could be given to those who have missed out in so many budgets under this government-people earning between $21,600 and $52,000 a year. These are the forgotten people, the people who have been forgotten by the Howard government. Many people will not believe this, but check the budgets. People earning between $21,600 and $52,000 a year in the entire period 2000 to 2008 will have had the grand total of one tax cut-the $4-a-week Amanda Vanstone ‘sandwich and milkshake' tax cut. The government is saying, ‘This is as good as it gets. This is tax reform'-a $4-a-week tax cut. These people, particularly those who do not have children, are bearing the burden of the income tax system in this country. They will have had a $4 tax cut between the year 2000 and the year 2008 if this government gets its way. A proposal I have put into the public arena gives them a $12-a-week tax cut in the coming budget. People on the 42c rate get an even more significant tax cut. This is an instalment, a down payment on genuine tax reform. Again, I have set that out in a document which is freely available, where we provide genuine incentive for people to move from welfare to work, to get ahead, to do that overtime, to go for the promotion. All of this has been properly costed. We have costed it. The Treasurer says he has costed some proposals and yet he is not man enough to put that in the public arena. The last budget produced a surplus that was $4.4 billion greater than the government said. In the budget papers you will find a page where the Treasury describes the problem of it continually underestimating the revenue take from the tax system. Australia is experiencing its highest terms of trade, according to the budget estimates, the budget papers, since the early 1970s. I have calculated what that means in terms of extra national income. It means $45 billion a year in extra national income. I was very pleased to see that the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank, Glenn Stevens, validated those figures last night in a speech he made. Going from a slightly different base, he says: So a 20 to 25 per cent gain equates to about four to five per cent of GDP, say $40 billion in tional annual income that is available. That is the truth. The revenue is pouring in from the resources boom. The budget can afford to make a very important down payment on tax reform in this country. That down payment can be made in the coming budget, but there is no genuine debate about it because the Treasurer wants the debate closed down. Industry groups have their own ideas. The Australian Industry Group, for example, says, ‘Why don't we abolish the 42c rate?' The Business Council of Australia is more interested in the top marginal rate. Would not the interests of tax reform in this country be advanced if the Treasurer released costings and provided a ready reckoner or a model so that everyone was working off the same base, instead of waiting for a tax reform proposal to be put up by the member for Wentworth and then shooting it down in flames saying, ‘That is the end of the tax reform debate'? The Treasurer is trying to close down the tax reform debate. He thinks this is the streamlined A New Tax System for a new century, but it is a dog's breakfast.",38
16,Mr HATTON,RECOUPMENT RULES AND OTHER,"Blaxland) (11.36 am)Specific provisions of the Tax Laws Amendment (Loss Recoupment Rules and Other Measures) Bill 2005 are quite complex. They are also extremely detailed. The amendment which the opposition has put up is broader, particularly in regard to part (3), as the member for Rankin indicated. There has been a very broad debate on Australia's taxation system and what needs to be done to ameliorate it. I wish to speak to the amendment. I want to start by speaking specifically to the provisions of this bill and the impact of some of those provisions on the mining sector, on the film sector and on those Australian entities, companies resident in Australia with part foreign ownership, where the changes made here are incremental but have addian effect in terms of Australia's capacity to be competitive against other countriesproviding a competitive tax regime to encourage foreign investment in Australia to continue and to deepen. There are also a range of other matters, some of which I will not go into. Indeed, the complexity of this bill is at the point where I wish David Cox, the former member for Kingston, were at hand. This is exactly the type of omnibus tax bill that David so loved to master, and he did it so well. I cannot do anything comparable, but I will have a go at some of the main provisions. The first schedule goes to the question of loss recoupment for companies. Why is this important? It is important for a range of different companies, particularly those with shareholdings of $100 million and up. It is particularly vital in the minerals and resources area, which may be one of the reasons that the member for Forrest spoke previously in this debate, given that he is the Chair of Standing Committee on Industry and Resources. It might be one of the reasons that am speaking, given that I am the deputy chair of that committee. These measures affect investment in Australia's mining industry and in resource industries generally. People within the industry have questioned how effective these new rules are. They are also determined to advance the argument that they were not properly consulted in relation to them and that there could be a better set of arrangements. As you, Mr Deputy Speaker MCMullan, would well know, not just as deputy speaker but as a former minister and assistant treasurer, there is always a case being put by porate entities not just to simplify the rules but to make them a hell of a lot easier on them. It is our task when in government or in opposition to ensure that the Commonwealth's revenues are assured, that changes made in the tax system do not open up areas that can be exploited and that those changes are as good and secure as they can be. Those changes will not always be welcomed in an open-handed fashion by people in industry. What is being done in this set of loss coupment rules? I cannot go to the relevant Bills Digest because there is not one. The shadow minister indicated that the haste with which this was brought forward meant that we did not have an independent umpire arguing the toss between Labor's position and the government's position. That simply was not provided. There is an explanatory memorandum, which is 80 pages or so in length. There is also the bill, which, given its complexity and the way in which tax law is written, is in the order of 180 pages. That is a fair bit to wander through. In the first schedule, the government have put up a continuity of ownership test, rather than the existing standard business test. The question is whether or not, when companies the are bought by others, you can apply losses from one to the other. There is a rapidity of I ownership change within the minerals sector. Indeed, if you look at the past five years in particular, you see that the whole structure of the Australian mining and resources sector has dramatically changed. One of the key problems in that area is that we now have a set of ‘juniors' established that are cut adrift from the major companies. Major Australian companies, apart from BHP, have a great deal of foreign investment. Where companies have been taken over, they have gone from new discoveries and explorations into brownfields developments, getting as much as they can out of existing mines. We have corseen a dramatic drop-off over that period in the number of people involved in the industry, whether they are geologists, small investors, small companies or others. An enormous amount of expertise has been lost. In the last year there has been a dramatic change in the price that people are willing to pay for Australian minerals. This rapidity of change has a lag effect because those people with the most capacity in the industry are not to be found. It is also evident in the renewed re- interest in uranium mining, because of the Russians working through their stockpile of plutonium. They have worked their way through something like 40 per cent of their existing stocks. When they get to the end of it and have no more to use, the demand for uranium-about 10 years out-will be dramatically greater. The current increase in the price of uranium has been affected very materially by the expected forward demand. In those areas there has been a great deal of fluctuation. There has been a lot of buying and selling and there has been a question of continuity-how, when going from one business to another, you can ensure that the revenues are protected and you get a better and simpler system. The government have introduced that new modified continuity of ownership test, they have removed the same business test for companies whose total income is more than $100 million in the year of recoupment and they have removed certain anomalies and clarified some aspects. In part, companies have accepted that this gives them more flexibility and they understand that there are some tracing rules. But I wish to put a query to the minister with regard to this: why is there no financial impact that can be quantifiable? The explanatory memorandum says on page 6 that the financial impact is not quantifiable at all. Coming from the tax department, that is a bit strange. Their reasoning is: There is expected to be an unquantifiable cost to revenue over the forward estimates period because the new modified COT takes effect from an earlier date than the removal of the SBT for companies. Despite that, where there could be a significant cost to revenue, it should be possible for that to be quantified, at least in order of magnitude. Secondly, it is argued that the compliance-cost impact will reduce compliance costs. That will make it easier for the ATO to deal with this. That is a major reason for attempting a number of these things. The impact is regarded essentially as bearing on those companies of $100 million or more. Fundamentally, it will reduce uncertainty. The compliance costs associated with applying the company loss recoupment rules to widely held companies and to companies owned by widely held companies will be reduced and those companies' admin costs will be reduced. I would appreciate knowing, as I am sure would those in the industry and those who have a concern about revenue, whether it is possible to quantify those. The second matter I wish to deal with fairly briefly is the question of conduit foreign income. This measure attempts to deal with the problem of being competitive vis-avis other countries in an attempt to get more foreign investment into Australia, particularly companies that are Australian owned and based entities but that have foreign shareholders, whether they be individuals or pension funds or whether they are part of a wider conglomerate. Chapter 5 of the act describes how a corporate tax entity will calculate an amount of conduit foreign income. It then explains how conduit foreign income can pass through a series of Australian corporate tax entities to ultimate foreign owners free of Australian tax. Mr Deputy Speaker MCMullan, you would be aware, as I am, of the measures that this government has taken, consequent upon measures we took whilst in government, not only to encourage greater foreign investment into Australia but also to attempt, as we did large whilst in government, to get pensions funds from overseas involved; specific bills were put through the House to encourage it. One of the difficulties in terms of practicality is that those pension funds have not been captured in the way that we expected them to be. There has not been enough done. I hope that the provisions in this bill will help to get us that greater foreign investment. The key point argued for this is that it would provide tax relief for a broader range of foreign income than the current foreign dividend account rules. That would enhance the ability of Australian entities with foreign investment to compete for that foreign capital. Mr Brough interjecting",40
17,Mr HATTON,RECOUPMENT RULES AND OTHER,"I am talking directly to the bill in relation to the explanatory memorandum, Minister. I know it is unusual! There are ticks against those fundamental points, so I hope we can get a better result than we have had previously. The most important underlying point is one that I think is not perceived generally enough, and that is the importance of having foreign companies resident in Australia. Most of the emphasis with those companies has been on research and development. Numerous exhaustive inquiries have been held by not only the industry and resources committee but also the science and innovation committee, of which I have been a member, into research and development by Australian companies and foreign owned companies in Australia-and other committees have done the same. I think most of our trying to work out how you can increase business investment in research and development has been misdirected. We know that while we were in government we effectively did it. We know that, since the government have come to office, they have reduced the amount of that effort. However, I think we need to cast our policy in terms of those companies that are subsets of foreign multinationals-significant companies such as Pfizer and Merck in the pharmaceutical area-that always have a choice to set up in a place like Singapore, which is intent upon making itself the pharmaceutical hub for the Asia-Pacific, which has driven government policy to that end and which will be a major competitor of ours. We need to cast our policy with regard to the effectiveness of those Australian based elements of multinational companies to see how well we can increase their capacity to grow and compete with other parts of those companies overseas so that, if an Australian based company is in competition for funds with another entity of that corporation in Belgium, for research and development or for the production of pharmaceutical goods, it will have a better chance of winning. We know that what we did under the factor F scheme was enormously important for rebuilding and refurbishing Australia's pharmaceutical production capacity. We know that there have been fantastic examples of that in the Merck instance, with two of their drugs going from zero to $400 million a year. We have another one now with the cervical vaccine, where there is the potential to earn a great deal of income that will come to Australia. But our tax policy only partially focuses on that. Certainly, I do not think our policies on research and development have ever focused on this element, but I think that we could now get a better result. Instead of treating those companies just as foreign entities that should be treated with a particular set of tax rules, we need to look at them as Australian based resources and work out how we might help them to compete against their counterparts worldwide to ensure we get a greater dividend out of that for Australia. Next, I wish to deal with part of schedule 3. It is about time that we had a provision whereby people who act illegally do not benefit from their activities and, in terms of capital gain and other income, if they are convicted of serious crime, are not allowed by the tax office to get away with it. This provision amends the act to deny deductions for losses and outgoings to the extent that they are incurred in the furtherance of or directly in relation to activities in respect of which a taxpayer has been convicted of an indictable offence. It is about time. We should pursue this as strongly as possible. The capital gains tax provisions have also been affected. For too long the tax office has been able to say, ‘Give us your money. As long as you are paying your tax, it's okay. You might be running a heroin ring or a prostitution racket, which are indictable offences, but as long as you cough up and pay your tax we do not really want to know about it.' The tax act can be used to work towards stamping out these kinds of illegal activities hope and trust that in these two particular areas that will happen. Lastly, in dealing with the particulars of this bill, I will deal with the copyright of film, which is to be included in the effective life depreciation area. Mr Deputy Speaker MCMullan, given your previous experience as arts minister, you spoke just recently in relation to two other provisions on film and how it is treated by the government in two different bills-and I have spoken, I think, on one of those. What is done here is important, not because the government said, ‘We'll do a little bit about this,' but so that there is greater flexibility in dealing with the product of the Australian film industry. That product is not as great as it should be, because we have an industry that has significant problems. It is not drawing the Australian public as an audience in the way it did previously. The breadth, the depth, the scale and the resonance of the films we are producing simply are not there. That is an artistic set of quespart tions. But, in terms of how you go about trying to reinvigorate the Australian industry, this provision addresses the effective life. Currently there is a 25-year life and over that 25-year life you can write down the cost of producing a film. The film goes out and you can write down the cost for 25 years-and, as anyone in the tax area knows, 25 years is a hell of a long time. It is even longer than the life of furniture. There have been a number of changes, both whilst we were in government and in the past 10 years, that have dramatically reduced the effective life of things that we have looked at. This provision says: ‘We will allow an element of self-assessment. You can work out the effective life yourself and do a self-assessment based on that, or you can use the taxation commissioner's safe harbour.' and I The explanatory memorandum to the bill says: This measure will allow taxpayers to choose ... the ... ‘safe harbour' effective life determination or, self assess the effective life of their copyright in a film. When depreciating their copyright in a film using effective life, taxpayers will have the choice of using the prime cost method or the diminishing value method. Instead of the strict 25 years being all that you can use, there is the flexibility that is available in the rest of the tax system. As small as this measure is, it will not be insignificant in its impact on revenue. In the first year we are looking at $15 million, and in 2006-07 there will be a $35 million cost to revenue. In the third year it will be $55 million and in the fourth year, 2008-09, there will be a $70 million cost to revenue. That is not insignificant. Hopefully, this measure will provide to Australian producers a greater deal of certainty than there has been in the past and be of what we need to kick-start the Australian film industry-a kick-start to match it up to what is happening in the area of games production, for instance. We have done extraordinarily well there, although there still has not been enough energising of the industry by the government really getting behind it and supporting it. The government have not taken the recommendations that were put forward when I was on the communications committee that brought down a report in that area. I have spoken about the provisions of the bill, rather than our amendment. Our amendment goes to the key fact that any government has to take the changes and make the adjustments, and it is the government department that will do that. The weight of the amendment is simply this: this is a Treasurer who is coasting. This is a Treasurer who allows other people to do the detailed work and who knocks back broader ideas on how you might fundamentally restructure the taxation system to the benefit all the people in the Commonwealth. This Treasurer is one who is not willing to get down to the real nitty-gritty of how to restructure our tax system to make it a more effective instrument for the Commonwealth and the Australian people. (Time expired)",43
18,Mr BROUGH,RECOUPMENT RULES AND OTHER,"Longman-Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer) (11.56 am)-in reply-I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of the members who participated in the debate today. Quite a few on the opposition side ranged widely on the issue of taxation, not necessarily on the Tax Laws Amendment (Loss Recoupment Rules and Other Measures) Bill 2005. Perhaps they do not have a lot to say on the specific measures. I have a quick comment for the honourable member for Blaxland, who said that the Treasurer is coasting. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Treasurer, the financial centre at the heart of the government, is a leader who has had his work recognised by the IMF in recent times in glowing terms. Most importantly, he has been recognised not just by international standards and by where we stand in the OECD in terms of our productivity and our competitiveness but by the 1.7 million Australians who have jobs today who did not have jobs in the past and who are paying lower rates of tax and enjoying greater security than they did in the past. He is hardly a man who is coasting; he is a Treasurer who has his finger on the pulse and is doing a great job on behalf of the Australian community. The first schedule of the bill reforms the loss recoupment rules for companies by, among other things, introducing a new modified continuity of ownership test and removing the same business test for companies whose income is more than $100 million in the year of recoupment. Through these amendments, the range of companies that are eligible to use the modified continuity of of ownership test will be extended to include all widely held companies and eligible subsidiaries. The amendments make it easier and more certain for these companies to apply the modified continuity of ownership test by relaxing the rules for tracing ownership under the test and by specifying the times at which these companies will need to test for continuity of ownership. Presently large companies with diverse businesses have difficulty in satisfying the same business test. The amendment will, firstly, reduce the need for large companies to rely on the same business test to be able to claim deductions for prior year losses and, secondly, it will remove the same business test for companies, including consolidated groups, whose total income is more than $100 million. As I stated in my media release on 14 September this year, stakeholders consulted on this measure raised concerns about applying the continuity of ownership test to companies that have issued more than one class of share because, for example, preference shares or dividend access shares have been issued. The government will continue to consult with stakeholders to find a workable solution to this complex issue. The second schedule in this bill will provide tax relief for foreign income received by foreign residents through Australian corporate tax entity conduit foreign income. This measure replaces the existing foreign dividend account provisions. These rules will allow Australian companies that receive foreign income on which no Australian tax is payable to pay dividends to foreign shareholders that are also free of Australian withholding tax. This is a very important measure as it will make Australia a more attractive base for multinationals looking to establish regional headquarters. It is also a benefit to Australian based multinationals in that it enhances their ability to compete for foreign capital. I recognise that in the amendment moved by the member for Hunter, the shadow spokesman in these areas, he questioned the need for this particular measure and said that we had failed to provide clear policy justification. The clear policy justification is what have just stated. This gives us as a nation a greater opportunity to actually have multinationals headquarter themselves here in Australia. In that way, we will gain greater employment opportunities, because they will see this as a decent and good economy to bring that foreign earned income through. It is a very positive measure, and I hope it is understood by the member for Hunter. I know that it is appreciated by some of those opposite. I should also point out to the member for Hunter that, in ensuring that we undertook these measures, we understood that they were a recommendation of the Board of Taxation. The next schedule in the bill denies deductions for expenditure incurred through illegal activity. In order for deductions to be denied, the taxpayer must be convicted of an offence punishable by imprisonment for at least 12 months. In situations where a taxpayer is conducting lawful business but is convicted of an illegal activity while carrying on that business, only the expenditure that is incurred in relation to the illegal activity will be denied. Expenditure that is incurred in undertaking the underlying lawful activity and that would have been incurred regardless of the illegal activity will continue to be deductible. The fourth schedule of the bill provides that, where copyright in a film does not qualify for concessional treatment in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, it will be subject to effective life depreciation under the uniform capital allowance regime. This will replace the current statutory 25-year write-off. Under effective life depreciation, taxpayers will have a choice of either using the Commissioner of Taxation's safe harbour effective life determinations or self-assessing the effective life of their copyright in a film. Taxpayers will also be able to choose between the diminishing value method and the I prime cost method when depreciating their assets. This amendment will apply to copyright in film acquired on or after 1 July 2004. The fifth schedule provides tax relief in certain circumstances for employees who participate in employee share schemes. The result of the amendments is that, when an employee is issued with new shares or rights as a result of a corporate restructure or a 100 per cent takeover, they will be able to treat their new shares or rights as a continuation of their old shares or rights. The amendments will ensure that a taxing point does not arise for employee share scheme participants in the event of a corporate restructure. Furthermore, the amendments will make sure that there is continuity of treatment for capital gains tax purposes. In this manner, the amendments further support the development of employee share schemes and the alignment of employer and employee interests. We all know that when that occurs we get greater productivity and everybody is a winner. Finally, schedules 6 and 7 of the bill make changes to the law to enhance the operation of the superannuation guarantee arrangements. In particular, the amendment in schedule 6 reduces the disproportionate penalty on employers who make superannuation contributions in an attempt to honour their superannuation guarantee obligation to employees. The amendment will allow late employer superannuation contributions which have been made for an employee within one month of the superannuation guarantee due date to be offset against the superannuation guarantee charge. This provides relief for employers. Otherwise employers would effectively be making a double payment of superannuation contributions. This measure improves the financial situation for relevant employers while maintaining the integrity of the superannuation guarantee compliance requirements. The final schedule of this bill, schedule 7, clarifies that mandatory employer contributions under the superannuation guarantee arrangements are payable on wages or salaries paid in a quarter following the termination of an employment relationship. This removes any doubt about whether the superannuation guarantee law imposes an obligation on employers for former employees and ensures that employees do not lose their superannuation guarantee entitlements as a result of being underpaid during their employment. These changes demonstrate the government's ongoing commitment to improving Australia's superannuation system and easing the burden on employers. For the reasons I have outlined, I commend the bill to the House.",45

21,Ms MACKLIN,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"Jagajaga) (12.06 pm)This legislative package of two bills, the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005 and the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2005, marks a very significant point for higher education in Australia. Following their passage, Australia's higher education system will, for the first time, be open to overseas based higher education providers to seek accreditation to offer degrees to Australian and overseas students in this country. Of course, this legislative package is principally designed to enable the United States based Carnegie Mellon University to operate in South Australia from March 2006, but it has far reaching implications. The bills also seek to improve consumer protection for higher education students through changes to tuition assurance arrangements. Although you would not know it from listening to the minister's second reading speech, it also contains a fairly sneaky backflip on the question of compulsory fees for amenities and services. It is quite an extraordinary backflip, with what you could only describe as a double twist of hypocrisy-and, we find today, a pretty humiliating landing. I will elaborate on this a little later. First, to the provisions of the bill allowing the US based Carnegie Mellon University to enter Australia as the first foreign owned university in our higher education system. These bills will allow Carnegie Mellon to offer courses to Australian and overseas students in Australia by creating a new category of table C higher education providers in the Higher Education Support Act 2003. The government intends that this new category will consist of overseas higher education institutions with Australian branches, of which Carnegie Mellon is the first. Table C providers will be able to access the FEEHELP loan scheme for Australian fee-paying higher education students. Providing that they comply with the requirements of the Education Services for Overseas Students Act, table C providers may offer courses to overseas students in Australia. They will not be able to access the Commonwealth Grants Scheme or obtain Commonwealth supported places-what most people would know as HECS places. Any assessment of Carnegie Mellon University reveals its outstanding international reputation. As a private university with headquarters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, it has about 8,000 undergraduate and postgraduate students and presently operates campuses in locations from California to Qatar and is soon to be in Adelaide. It is a highly regarded and reputable university and was placed 38 out of 200 on the Times Higher Education Supplement ranking of top universities in the world. According to the most authoritative ranking of universities, the Shanghai Jiao Tong University's world academic rankings, Carnegie Mellon University is placed at 62. Australia has only one university ranked higher: the Australian National University, at 56. The international recognition of Carnegie Mellon's bona fides as a university is based on its certification of accreditation by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, a United States higher education accrediting agency. The Australian University Quality Agency has attested to the bona fides of the Middle States Commission as a quality assurance agency of international standing. The qualifications Carnegie Mellon is seeking to offer have been successfully assessed against the Australian qualifications framework and verified that they meet the standards of an Australian qualification. The university has announced that its initial offering will be a Master of Science in Information Technology and a Master of Science in Public Policy and Management. The Commonwealth government has budgeted expenditure under FEE-HELP that assumes total enrolments in both courses to be 20 in 2006, 38 in 2007, 58 in 2008 and 77 in 2009. Fees are anticipated to be in the order of $US32,000 or $A42,600 a year. Of course, these fees are very significant. By way of comparison a Master of Public Policy at the University of Sydney is $10,800 for local students. At the University of Melbourne, fees for a Master of Public Policy and Management are just under $32,000. In July the South Australian government announced that Carnegie Mellon had successfully applied to be registered as a university. The state minister for further education approved the application in accordance with the national protocols for higher education approval processes, as endorsed by all education ministers, Commonwealth, state and territory, through the Ministerial Council on Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. This is the first time that a non selfaccrediting higher education institution has been approved to operate as a university in Australia. In the Australian system all universities are self-accrediting. accreditation is seen within Australia as an expression of confidence in a higher education institution by government. It suggests that government has a sufficient degree of faith and trust in the educational quality and operational robustness of an institution to permit it to approve its own courses. However, as a concept it is far less relevant in some other countries, such as the United States. Universities in the US are not self-accrediting and must instead seek approval from an external authority for each individual proposed course. That Carnegie Mellon is not self-accrediting says nothing about the esteem in which it is held in its own jurisdiction. It does, however, highlight a marked difference between the approaches in Australia and elsewhere and is something that needs to be examined in further discussions on the review of the national protocols for approval. Labor certainly places great importance on protection of the name and concept of a university. Currently, this protection is embodied in the national protocols, which are a vital tool for protecting the standard and reputation of Australian universities and their students. So much of Australia's good international academic standing depends on the reputation of our universities being first centres for teaching and research. Labor does believe, however, that Carnegie Mellon's acceptance into Australia, and the legislative change this pioneering move is forcing, should not allow open slather access for any and all comers. The accreditation process must be thorough, comprehensive and transparent. In this case the expert panel of higher education specialists required under the protocols to examine evidence of compliance unanimously agreed that the minister should endorse Carnegie Mellon's application. Public confidence in the approvSelfals process would, however, be strengthened by greater transparency. It is unfortunate that, in this case, the South Australian government feel that other legislation constrains them from making the panel's assessment publicly available. Last year, Minister Nelson engaged Professor Gus Guthrie to undertake a review of the national protocols. Professor Guthrie's 27 recommendations cover a range of issues relating to the scope of the protocols, specific suggestions for change and a proposition that further, more detailed review and consultation be conducted. A planning workshop was held in Melbourne during August and a paper on the protocols is scheduled to be presented to the ministerial council meeting in November. Now is not the time for detailed consideration of the issues arising from the review, but it does give me the opportunity to make some general comments about Labor's position on higher education approvals. We certainly are concerned about any diminution of the requirements to become recognised as a university. Labor believes that the requirement for universities to demonstrate a capacity to undertake internationally referenced standards of teaching, scholarship and research-albeit in different mixes-is one of class the defining characteristics of our higher education sector and one that must be jealously guarded. Labor is not attracted to arguments that access to the term ‘university' should be relaxed, as we believe a relaxation would devalue the very essence of what is essential about our universities. Nor does Labor support Minister Nelson's attempt to seize central control of the approval process, if the end result is a dilution of the definition of a university. In relation to Carnegie Mellon either specifically or more generally, our position is clear. The establishment of foreign universities in Australia to offer programs to both domestic and international students must undergo a rigorous assessment process and each application must be thoroughly assessed on its merits. If Carnegie Mellon's application is any sort of precedent, it is to reinforce a process of rigorous examination of the merits of each case and to make sure the applicants adhere to strict and quality standards. The second significant aspect of these bills is provisions to clarify and strengthen the operation of the tuition assurance arrangements for fee-paying higher education students. The amendments stipulate that if a provider is unable to continue to offer courses to students then the affected students will have the option of transferring to another provider to complete their studies or, instead, seeking a refund of their fees for uncompleted units. If the choice made is to transfer to another provider, this will not be at any extra cost for those units of study already undertaken. If the option exercised is for a refund for uncompleted units of study, student debt will be remitted and FEE-HELP balances recredited. Labor certainly hopes that the provisions of this package of bills, which alter the tuition assurance arrangements for higher education students, will strengthen and improve consumer protection in circumstances where a student's education provider is unable to continue to offer the units of study for which they are enrolled. The higher education market is very important to the Australian economy. It is a market where quality offerings and good reputation are critical to continued strong performance. Labor certainly does support measures designed to uphold and protect our reputation and, most importantly-as this section does-protect students. The third aspect of this legislative package is perhaps its most breathtaking. Aspects of the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2005 are what can only be described as a fantastic mix of hypocrisy, ideological obsession, contradiction and, finally, incompetence that we have come to expect from the minister for education and this government. Items 5 and 6 of schedule 1 of the ESOS Amendment Bill are designed to allow higher education providers to continue to charge a fee to overseas students for a range of services that they are obligated to provide under the ESOS Act 2000. It seems these were unremarkable enough on the surface for the minister to not even feel the need to comment on this aspect of the bill in his second reading speech. Unlike the minister, I will not be so reticent and so I intend to move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House: (1) in light of the contradiction between the ESOS bill and the VSU bill, and the Minister's humiliating backdown on introducing VSU for the 2006 academic year, condemns the Government; and (2) believes that the government must now withdraw its VSU bill, and avoid the inconsistency in making student services fees compulsory for overseas students at Australian universities while trying to ban fees being charged to Australian students”. On closer inspection, we find that there was an even better reason for the minister to remain silent on the detail of this fee. The services that providers must ensure are provided under the ESOS Act and the national guidelines include-I hope members opposite are listening to this: independent grievance handling or dispute resolution, counselling, orientation services, accommodation advice and academic progress advice. If these services sound familiar, it is because they are some of the services currently provided by the much maligned university student organisations. The ESOS Act even requires providers to have a student contact officer who is responsible for provision of counselling and other services-extraordinary!",47
22,Dr EMERSON,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"That's not a double standard, is it?",51
23,Ms MACKLIN,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,It sounds very much like it to me.,51
24,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,The member for Rankin is not in his seat.,51
25,Ms MACKLIN,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"The ESOS Act requires providers compliance with the National Code of Practice for Registration Authorities and Providers of Education and Training to Overseas Students, which requires student contact officers to: 48.1 Promote the successful adjustment by overseas students to life and study at an Australian institution. 48.2 Assist students to resolve problems which could impede successful completion of their study programs.",51
26,Dr EMERSON,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,That sounds like a student union.,51
27,Ms MACKLIN,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"Awfully like it. The national code actually specifies at paragraph 45 that registered providers: ... must have in place appropriate support services and be able to demonstrate the advice provided to intending overseas students on these services. This means that the government has been happy so far to make sure that student services continue to be provided for overseas students knowing that these services are generally provided by our university student organisations. This is a massive act of hypocrisy by Minister Nelson. On the one hand, he is enshrining in legislation the right of universities and other education providers to charge a fee for services for overseas students, while, on the other hand, through the so-called voluntary student unionism legislation, the minister wants to outlaw universities charging Australian students a fee for exactly the same purposes. The rationale behind this ESOS bill is that the government has realised that, if its extreme and very destructive anti-student services legislation were passed, it would conflict with universities' obligations under the ESOS Act. In the Age today, the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Brendan Nelson, has decided that his destructive, antistudent services legislation is in disarray. Minister Nelson has been forced into what can only be described as a painful and very humiliating backdown from his extreme attack on student services. Despite the VSU legislation sitting on the Notice Paper since March this year, Minister Nelson now concedes that he cannot get it through the parliament. Universities are about to begin reenrolling students for next year, and they would have done so in a climate of great uncertainty, confusion and division within the government. The minister now says that the VSU legislation is off the agenda until 2007. Labor says that these destructive plans should be dropped altogether. Faced with trenchant opposition to Minister Nelson's plan by an extraordinary cross-section of the Australian community-save for a few ideologues in the Liberal party room-he has had to pack away the drum that he has been feverishly beating and instead beat a very hasty retreat. The reason for this humiliating backdown is pretty plain: he does not have the numbers to get this legislation through the Senate. He does not have the support outside the parliament, and he does not have the support inside the parliament. So, for all of the hot and for all of the vanity that we have seen from this minister, what has now been made plain to everybody is that there is very little substance to this minister. I must say that we were never all that sure about the minister's position on VSU. After the last election, he told the vice-chancellors one thing and he then gave a thoroughly unconvincing speech at the National Press Club. We understand from freedom of information documents that were received by the Australian this week that the minister even had his department prepare multiple legislative options. But, as with many of this minister's views, we can see that he had to figure out which way the wind was blowing before we could figure out what he thought. Of course, for a while the wind blew pretty hard from a small section of the Liberal Party, who you could only say were reliving lost battles from their university days. They seem to have forgotten that they are now members of parliament and are not outside on the stump, trying to fight student union battles. So Minister Nelson jumped on board. He sensed an issue that might finally reassure a few sceptical Liberals that he really was one of them. The education minister really pinned his leadership hopes on what he described in his own words as a ‘totemic issue for the Liberal Party'. Now this legislation in disarray and we suspect his not too subtle ambitions are in tatters as well. The so-called voluntary student unionism legislation would have destroyed vital campus services that support university students, for example subsidised child care, counselling services, legal advice and sporting organisations. This attack would have been hardest felt in our outer metropolitan and regional universities. A survey of service providers at Australian universities found that 4,200 people would have lost their jobs if this legislation were to go through. Let us air just take stock of who has opposed this extreme attack by the Howard government on student services: of course, the students themselves and their student organisations; very much the regional communities who use on-campus facilities, whether it is the theatre facilities or the sporting facilities; vice-chancellors; university staff and sporting organisations. Some extraordinarily famous Australian sports men and women spoke out-test cricketers, rugby union players and swimmers; members of the Olympic team, and Kevan Gosper. So many famous Australians who have represented this country do not want this legislation to go through. Campus chaplains also opposed the legislation. I am sure the member for Kingsford Smith could suggest some of the very famous actors and artists who vehemently opposed this legislation-for example, Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush and some of our most high-profile artists, actors and performers who got their start at university and want to make sure that that opportunity continues into the future for young people. It is very plain that this minister does not even have the support of his own coalition party room in the Senate to get this legislation through. I hope that this legislation never sees the light of day, that we never see it back here in the parliament and that the minis ister realises that he does not have the numbers in the parliament to get it through and that he certainly does not have the support in the community to implement it. I want to take this opportunity to thank all of those who have taken such a fantastic stand against this government's legislation. The Labor Party will continue to oppose the legislation until it is gone for good. It is a great credit to all of those who have campaigned so hard and for so long against these very regressive changes that Brendan Nelson has been forced into this humiliating defeat today. Unfortunately, the government rejected Labor's very sensible compromise, and now the minister is paying the price. This minister has been out there for a whole year playing student politics, and he has lost. In the light of that backdown, it is unclear why we are debating certain elements of the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill today. Now that he has backed down on the voluntary student unionism legislation, I do not know that we need this bill. Maybe he will come in and give an indication that he is giving up on the VSU bill by removing these sections of the ESOS Amendment Bill-let us wait and see-because the only reason for the bill before the House today is to deal with the negative consequences of the Howard government's extreme VSU legislation. Instead of amending the ESOS Act to be consistent with the government's false rhetoric of student choice, the government now has admitted what much of the backbench already knows: this government has introduced a bill that would allow a fee to be charged to one set of students-that is, those coming from overseas-but not to local students. Only an extraordinarily stubborn and arrogant government would go through with these sorts of changes. It is time for the minister to come in here and recognise that, instead of needing this amendment, he should just drop the voluntary student unionism legislation and allow the continuation of services both for Australian students and for foreign students. In that way, we can get rid of the overall attack that this minister has been mounting on these very important services, both for our own local students and for international students. Unfortunately, it does seem to be the case that, up until today at least, the minister has failed to grasp that student services for Australian and international students will not be possible without the infrastructure and capital accumulated by student organisations. Universities rely on student organisations and their services for all students to meet their obligations under the ESOS Act. It is the economies of scale realised through mass participation in student services that allow these student services for overseas students to continue to be provided. It seems as if the minister has wanted to chop down the tree provided by Australian students and then just save a few branches for overseas students. I certainly hope that we can see the end of this nonsense, that the minister will now drop the voluntary student unionism legislation instead of just delaying it, and then we will not need this amendment bill at all. We strongly oppose the Howard government's push to end proper and decent arrangements for the funding of student services on our university campuses. We certainly want those services to continue. We will not oppose the bill before us today, because we want to make sure that international students continue to receive these important student services. But I do hope that the minister will finally recognise that he has absolutely no support-no support in the community, no support on university campuses and no support in the parliament-for his extreme attack on student services at our universities and that we will not see the voluntary student unionism legislation back in this parliament.",51
28,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"Order! Before I call the member for Bass, I will just clarify the situation with regard to the amendment by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The formal situation is that it has not been moved, because we are not dealing yet with the second reading of the second bill of this cognate debate. We are formally only dealing with the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill, but we are allowing debate on both matters to facilitate the proceedings of the House. So we will take that as notice of the intention the deputy leader to move that amendment, which will facilitate debate on that amendment during the course of the cognate debate, but the deputy leader will need to come back when we conclude this second reading debate and formally move it as an amendment to the second bill when we get to that stage. That is the circumstance in which we find ourselves. The question is that the bill be read a second time.",54
29,Mr MICHAEL FERGUSON,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"I find it extraordinary that the member for Jagajaga has described the Minister for Education, Science and Training as incompetent, given that she has just tried to move an amendment to a bill at an utterly inappropriate and unparliamentary time. I think that is probably worth reflecting on for a moment. How interesting it is that we have heard all sorts of accusations made in this place just now against the government and against the minister for education. A lot of was very political, very much an aggressive attack on the government. It should be seen by the community for what it is. We have patiently sat through 30 minutes of bellyaching from the member for Jagajaga-fairly aggressive, fairly angry and also utterly incomprehensible in terms of Labor's current position on voluntary student unionism. Perhaps if there is time. I may come back to that towards the end. This is a cognate debate, and we are debating two bills. I am of course supporting both the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005 and the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2005. I will deal first with the higher education legislation amendment bill. As we have heard, this bill makes it possible for Carnegie Mellon University to establish an overseas branch here in Australia, to be located in Adelaide from January 2006. I think this is a moment of of great pride for the South Australian government for being proactive in this regard. The bill also has two extra purposes: one relating to the tuition assurance requirements under HESA and the other to make some technical amendments that have been required by the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. The ESOS Amendment Bill also makes it possible to allow Carnegie Mellon University to operate in Australia. Were Labor to follow through with its veiled threat to oppose that bill or say that it is unnecessary, that would prevent Carnegie Mellon from setting up. The bill inserts a new category of table C providers within HESA that are currently table A providers-37 public universities and other higher education providers such as the Australian Maritime College, in my electorate of Bass, and the Batchelor Institute of Indigenous Tertiary Education, which I had the pleasure of visiting quite recently to meet it with staff and students. There are also three table B providers. These are self-accrediting higher education providers such as Bond University, the University of Notre Dame Australia and the Melbourne College of Divinity. Table C providers will be approved as overseas higher education institutions. This will give an operational framework for all approved overseas higher education institutions to operate a branch in Australia if they so desire. The bill also enables approved overseas higher education providers to have some new limited access to certain Commonwealth assistance, including FEE-HELP and OSHELP. I am sure that everybody in this chamber would welcome that, as it will provide new opportunities for Australian students. As we have heard, the bill also enables a new private, not-for-profit United States based institution, Carnegie Mellon University, to operate and also to access specifically FEE-HELP and OS-HELP for Australian students and other eligible students studying here in Australia and specifically in South Australia, where Carnegie Mellon will be established. The bill also strengthens and clarifies issues relating to assistance for eliwell gible students attending these Australian branches. My thoughts turn more and more to the ESOS Amendment Bill 2005, which has been the subject of a most vigorous attack from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. There have been claims today that the bill is unnecessary and at times hypocritical. That is not the case, because this bill makes it possible for Carnegie Mellon University to operate in Australia. The bill also ensures that universities that accept international dents-and they must do so within the provisions of the ESOS Act-have the opportunity to charge a fee relating to extra services. That is not inconsistent with VSU legislation. International education brings a wide range of benefits to our society-cultural, intellectual and economic in their natureand the rewards that go with that. In 2004, this industry had an estimated value of some $7.5 billion, and this was sustaining at least 50,000 jobs. The reputation of this valuable industry, including the interests of students who choose to study here, is safeguarded by the ESOS Act. The act establishes key national elements for the regulation of international education and also seeks to ensure that international students receive the education and training that they have paid for. It also aims to strengthen public confidence in the student visa program by ensuring that only genuine students come to Australia to study under these arrangements and that they are appropriately supported in doing so. To do this, the ESOS framework requires providers to meet a range of obligations. For anyone in this place to say that that is not appropriate is indeed hypocritical. The protections provided by this regulation have actually brought worldwide recognition of Australia's quality and innovation in education and training. I think it has to be said as that this is quite a pivotal point for us, as Australians, in exporting a product overseas. We are in fact exporting education and taking money into the Australian economy which otherwise would not have been available. It gives a jobs benefit to Australians and helps to build capacity in Australian universities. Australia, her economy and her people really are the winners here. The amendments contained in this bill will allow us to respond flexibly to emerging challenges as providers face significant and sturapid structural change across the international market as other providers and other countries try to get a slice of the action. The first amendment proposed by the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2005 will enable Carnegie Mellon University to begin to function next year in South Australia. It is a consequential amendment to changes being made to the Higher Education Support Act 2003, including the establishment of a new category of table C providers within that act. Without the amendments to the ESOS Act that we are debating today, foreign owned institutions such as Carnegie Mellon would simply not be able to function in Australia, because the ESOS Act Australian residency requirements would make that impossible and also illegal. I would like to respond to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's vigorous, strong and, I think, difficult to sustain argument in her attack on the Minister for Education, Science and Training, for to compare Australian students with overseas students is inappropriate.",54
30,Dr EMERSON,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"Ha, Ha!",56
31,Mr MICHAEL FERGUSON,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"The member for Rankin laughs and scoffs. To compare Australian students with overseas students is an argument that really cannot and should not be sustained. Why? We are regarding overseas students as an export purchaser, if you like. We in this place are not accountable to overseas students; we are accountable, first and foremost, to Australians. We are selling our product, which is education at a higher education institution in Australia, to overseas countries. That is a marketing opportunity that Australia has taken up, and I have already spoken of the jobs and the boost to the Australian economy that that provides. In fact the amendments to the ESOS Act that we are debating here today do very little other than to clarify and to reinforce existing arrangements in Australia. They clarify that providers are able to charge a tuition fee that is sufficient to recover the costs of meeting their obligations under the ESOS framework-both the academic charge and the services charge. It does not permit the charging of separate fees or to allow providers to subject overseas students to the sorts of general amenities fees that the VSU legislation also seeks to prohibit. So there are a number of differences here. The VSU legislation remains an important part of this government's agenda, and it remains an important part of my agenda. Having heard the member for Jagajaga complaining today about the VSU legislation and challenging the government to never again bring it before the parliament brings a question to my mind about what is Labor's policy, because we heard in recent months that Labor actually went away from its election promise to standing in the way of VSU. Labor went to the last election pledging that it would not support voluntary student unionism. The people who voted Labor at the last election did so believing that Labor would not support voluntary student unionism legislation, and guess what: within the last two months the member for Jagajaga publicly announced that Labor would be supporting the principle, the ideal, of voluntary student unionism-that is, freedom of association, freedom to associate or to not associate. Now I hear the Deputy Leader of the Opposition saying that she never wants to see this bill before the House again, so I am confused-I do not know. I wonder whether opposition members, when they have an opportunity to speak, will clarify the position for Labor, because now we do not know. Has Labor gone back? Has it flip-flopped? I do not know, and I think it is probably a good opportunity to confer. Furthermore, the services for which fees are allowed to be charged under the ESOS Act are not of the nature being tackled by our VSU legislation. Child care is not in there; nor are canteens, rugby union or music societies. The bills are completely different. In offering an education to overseas students, which Australians do not subsidise, we are doing this as an export earner. It is important that we offer overseas students a quality education, because, once they are here, they are here to stay. We want to be able to protect this market into the future and to ensure that it is not undermined by criticism such that when an overseas student comes to live in Australia to study for a three-, four-, five-, sixor seven-year degree program, they get dropped in it when they get here and that nobody looks after them for their accommodation needs. These are people who come from other countries; they are not from interstate or from a neighbouring town or city. We are talking about people who, in some cases, may have some difficulties with the language or the culture. These are people we must protect, because it is important to protect the market into the future.",56
32,Dr EMERSON,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,You said we take no responsibility for them.,57
33,Mr MICHAEL FERGUSON,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"The member for Rankin, I promise you that I will stay to listen to your contribution when it is your turn. Dr Stone-I wouldn't make that promise.",57
34,Mr MICHAEL FERGUSON,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"There is a question mark over whether or not it will be worth staying to listen to; but, in fairness, I will stay. The government does greatly value and support the range of benefits that international students bring to our society, and we have to put in place this framework for regulation. I suspect that the member for Rankin agrees with us that it is important to protect this market into the future while not at the same time trying to impose greater regulation on students and telling them where to spend their money. I also heard the Deputy Leader of the Opposition saying that the Minister for Education, Science and Training had no support for his agenda on voluntary student unionism. Nothing could be further from the truth. Not only does he have great support in this parliament on both sides-of course, we only hear open support from my side-there is great support for this legislation in the coalidictment tion party room, in the Liberal and National parties. The fact that there is one Nationals senator who has publicly declared that he has problems with the legislation is a matter for us to work through. It is a matter for the government and for Senator Joyce. We went to an election with this promise, and we are duty-bound to carry it through. We do not go to elections and make promises that we do not intend to keep. We are not like the Labor Party; we do not reverse our decisions overnight just because it is politically expedient to do so. I see again the Labor Party in denial. It will not accept that it went to an election, that it has flip-flopped in the meantime on VSU and that, today, as I have said, it still does not have a consistent message on what its present policy is. We are duty-bound to carry through with this legislation. Not only is there support for it in the parliament and in the coalition party room; there is support for it on campuses throughout Australia and in homes all around Australia, in every town and city. Why wouldn't you allow a student to decide where they spend their money? For those of us who are on good salaries, resting our buttocks on these soft green leather chairs, it may be a little difficult to hark back to the difficult days of putting ourselves through university, having to work for every cent we were able to earn and to have an income which did not go very far. I think it is worth being reminded about that. Some people in this place are saying that university fees ranging from $100 or $200 up to $500, $600 or $700 around Australia are a fair amount to pay to subsidise other people's child care, elite rugby and other sports. Why should they? If student university associations, guilds and unions say that these services will be shut down, isn't that an indictment of the way they are running them? Isn't that an inof them for not marketing them in a way which will actually encourage students to willingly come along and pay the necessary fees? I think it is. It is important for students to have the choice as to what they do with their own money. For the Labor Party to be saying, ‘We do suddenly now support freedom of association-we will support that part of the bill-but we still believe we should force students to pay the same amount of money as if they were in the union,' is utterly hypocritical. I do not see how they can defend that policy. It does not make sense, and it is not fair. Why should external students, who will never visit the campus and who will never have the opportunity to even access the services they are subsidising, pay that? Why should they be forced to be a member of the union? If students do not pay, why should they be threatened with not even receiving their results or with not graduating? If they pass their units and their why should they be threatened with not even finding out whether or not they have passed? Why should they have that withheld and be threatened in that way? Why should they be made to pay? Twenty-five per cent of students in many universities across Australia are external and operate in that capacity. People on that side say that students should still be forced to pay these fees to be members of associations that they do not support and to be slugged with paying for services they never get to access. They say that, even if they were on campus, they should be slugged with fees and charges they do not necessarily want to support. I will not go through the list of services, or so called services, but some of them are very dubious indeed. Some of them are worthwhile, but I would not say that any of them are essential. I have said that in this place in the past. They might be important but to say that they are essential is political rhetoric, and I do not support that. Mr Garrett-Child care is not essential?",57
35,Mr MICHAEL FERGUSON,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,Child care is not essential-correct. I have said that in the past. Dr Emerson interjecting,58
36,Mr MICHAEL FERGUSON,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,I have said it before but you have never quoted me. Child care-and do not misquote me,58
37,Dr EMERSON,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,It's only a matter of time.,58
38,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,The member for Rankin will desist!,58
39,Mr MICHAEL FERGUSON,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"Child care is important, but for you to tell me that a student union must provide child care as an essential service is wrong. Write it down. Mr Garrett-Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Can you direct the member to make his comments through the courses, chair and not use the word ‘you'?",58
40,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,I accept the member for Kingsford Smith's point of order. I would remind the member for Bass to direct his remarks through the chair.,58
41,Mr MICHAEL FERGUSON,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"I would invite the member for Rankin to write my quotes down, if he will. He also ought to be aware that in Launceston, in the electorate of Bass, the student union does not run the child-care facility; the university does. Do not tell me that it is essential for the university union to be providing these services. Get your facts straight and be careful what you say. I have prosecuted the case for these two bills in the cognate debate. I have responded to some of the crazy and outrageous claims of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition with regard to education policy-her vitriolic attack on the minister, which was unnecessary and hypocritical-and I have invited the Labor Party to clarify its policy position. I have invited the Labor Party to tell us today whether it still has a policy of supporting freedom of association. I put that challenge out today.",58
42,Dr EMERSON,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"I welcome the undertaking by the member for Bass to continue his time here in the parliament and to listen to what I have to say in this cognate debate on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005 and the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2005 and in response to a number of remarks that he himself has made. One particularly stuck in my mind. He said, ‘I am confused.' This is a permanent state of existence for the member for Bass, as clearly evidenced by the illogical rant that we just heard from him. As part of that illogical rant he said that we should no responsibility for foreign students and then went on to say that we needed to look after foreign students. I do not know how you possibly go about reconciling those two contradictory statements amongst the many contradictory statements and the contradictory legislation that we have in front of us here today. The most worrying aspect about the member for Bass is that he mouths contradictions and does not recognise that they are contradictions. He has another fault, which is shared, sadly, by all members of the government, where he said, ‘We never break election promises.' Every member of this parliament heard the Minister for Health and Ageing say that the Medicare safety net was a ‘rocksolid, ironclad' promise. The minister for health himself has had no choice after breaking that promise other than to confess to the parliament and to the Australian peopleperhaps in another place as well-that he broke a rock-solid, ironclad, election promise. The Minister for Health and Ageing is not alone. In relation to the very area we are bating here today, the Prime Minister of this country in 1999 guaranteed that ‘there will be no $100,000 university fees'. There are dozens and dozens of $100,000-plus university courses in Australia. You do not need the member for Kingsford Smith or me to prove that point. Again, we need only go to the statements that the Minister for Education, Science and Training made on the Jon Faine program on 4 August. It was one of the most laughable interviews that I have ever seen. I did suggest, somewhat facetiously, that we would need to look into the authenticity of the transcript, because it could not possibly have happened other than on Monty Python. The minister for education was asked about this matter, because he was talking about a matter that is covered in this legislationtake namely, FEE-HELP. The minister for education had said that he was going off to cabinet to get the $50,000 cap on FEE-HELP removed. He was agreeing with the statements of Professor Bruce Chapman, the architect of the HECS arrangements, and also, most directly, with the assertions of Jon Faine on the Jon Faine program that this was completely unfair and how would the sons and daughters of working people in Australia be able to afford $100,000-plus university fees? Jon Faine said to him that there were lots of these. From recollection the minister said that at least 45 courses in Australia had $100,000-plus university fees and then he referred to Notre Dame, saying that it was $200,000. The member for Bass said a few minutes ago, ‘This government never breaks election promises.' The Prime Minister of Australia, hand on heart in 1999, said that there would be no $100,000 university fees. The minister for education confessed that there were at least 45 them, as well as a $200,000 university fee. The member for Bass asked me to comment on some of the remarks he made, de- and I am doing that. One of the remarks he made, without qualification, was, ‘Child care is not essential.' I am sure that the people of Launceston and other parts of electorate of Bass will learn of the view, restated by the member for Bass, that child care is not essential. Perhaps for him child care is not essential. I wonder if he would think about the mothers in Launceston in making that statement, unqualified, that child care is not essential and in saying it is a reasonable statement. If he does truly believe that child care is not essential, he should think about whether he is fit to remain as the member for Bass. Certainly we will give the people of Bass a very good choice at the next election. This particular piece of legislation is lation that the Labor Party supports. It establishes an operation of the Carnegie Mellon University in South Australia from next year. We think that this has a lot of merit, and that is why we are supporting it. The member for Bass was wondering what our position was, whereas we had stated quite clearly that we were supporting this legislation, because any legislation that improves the education performance of Australian students, and indeed of foreign students, in this country is worthy of very favourable consideration. Of course, we would always reserve the right to look at the detail. In this case, we have examined the detail of the legislation and we support it. I might add that we are talking here about quite a reputable university. The Carnegie Mellon University is placed, on a particular set of academic rankings, at 62 in the world. I do have to point out that that bit behind the ANU. The Australian National University-incidentally, my alma matercomes in at 56. Good on the people at the ANU-good on the academics and good on the reputation that the ANU has built up over many years after having been established after the Second World War by a very far-sighted government. The Carnegie Mellon University has a lot going for it. Because it has a lot going for it and it is coming to our shores to set up operations in South Australia, we support it. So much for assertions by the minister for education that Labor do not support private funding of universities and private arrangements in relation to universities and foreign, full fee paying students. Of course we do. It says here that table C providers will be able to access the FEE-HELP loan scheme for Australian fee-paying higher education students. That gives me the opportunity to make some observations about FEE-HELP. What has happened in this country, since this government came to office? In 1997 it very legissubstantially increased HECS charges and that meant that the private returns to a student from university education fell. That was a big increase in HECS charges and it has been commented upon adversely by Professor Bruce Chapman, who was the architect of HECS. That was in 1997. Now fast forward to 2004, where the government made profound changes to the higher education arrangements in this country. It allowed universities to increase HECS charges by a further 25 per cent, which just about all of them have done. In addition, it expanded the proportion of university students who are full fee paying Australian students to a maximum of 35 per cent. The government has starved Australian universities of cash and that has meant that those cash-starved universities have had to increasingly rely on full fee paying foreign students and full fee paying Ausputs it a little tralian students. In order to assist in the arranging of finance for those full fee paying Australian students, the government introduced a scheme called FEE-HELP. But the problem is that it capped FEE-HELP at a total of $50,000. If a student-especially one who has not got a lot of financial resources, whose parents are not very wealthy and who is in the category of a full fee paying Australian student-is entering a course that costs more than $50,000, the question is obvious: how does that student find the extra resources above the $50,000 cap? This was the crux of the matter in the infamous Monty Python like interview between Jon Faine and the education minister. In response to a paper that was delivered the night before by Professor Bruce Chapman, Jon Faine said, ‘This $50,000 cap is a very big problem.' The minister for education was agreeing that it was a very big problem, that it was unfair and that only students in circumstances ‘where Daddy is very wealthy'-as Jon Faine said-are able to access higher education. The minister for education agreed with every proposition that was put to him. Why? Because he was confident of being able to go back into the cabinet and get that $50,000 cap removed. But the minister for education failed to have that cap removed and is condemned by his own criticism of the cap. This proves once and for all that the minister for education must be the weakest, most ineffectual minister for education in the postwar history of this country. He railed against the unfairness of the arrangements that he had introduced into the Australian parliament and was essentially saying: ‘I'm going to get them fixed; I'm going off to the cabinet and we're going to remove the cap.' And they rolled him. While we are on the subject of being rolled, I refer to the second reading amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. This ineffectual, weak and pathetic education minister is being rolled again in relation to voluntary student unionism. These are the big kids of the coalition: we have got the minister for education, the Treasurer and the minister for health-these big kids who, in their minds, are still back at university playing student politics and refighting old battles. Well, people have moved on. The world has moved on but these big kids on the government side hark back to those days when they were there. Tony Abbott was mixing it with the progressive side of politics at university, the Treasurer was thinking of being a member of the Labor Party-some say he may well have been, but thank God that did not continue; he was in there arm wrestling with student unionismand then of course there was the minister for education, who was in fact a member of the Labor Party and confessed only a few years ago that he had never voted Liberal. I assume he does now. I imagine he would vote for himself in the seat of Bradfield-although I am not sure it matters too much; I think he would still squeak across the line even if he did privately vote Labor. So this minister has been rolled yet again and it is to that matter that the second reading amendments refers, pointing out the inconsistency in making student services fees compulsory for overseas students at Australian universities while trying to ban fees being charged for Australian students. They are just like the member for Bass. They are all out of the same stable-they do not recognise completely inconsistent propositions. You have got the minister for education bringing legislation in that allows for the charging of union fees for foreign students, but at the same time we have spent hour after hour debating legislation in which the government wants to ensure that there is no compulsory student unionism in this country so that Australian students pay those fees for very valuable services. The member for Bass has indicated that child care is not an essential service-not only in the context of universities but in no context is child care an essential service. There you go: that speaks for itself. So the minister's humiliation is complete today. Of course, as one of the big kids of the parliament who is still playing student politics, he would love to get that legislation through in relation to voluntary student unionism. It is a matter of public fact that Labor does not control the House of Representatives, and nor does it have the numbers in the Senate. Let us just add up: if Labor does not have the numbers in the Senate, and the minor parties and Labor do not have the numbers, but the coalition does have the numbers, then there can be only one reason why the minister for education is not proceeding with this legislation and that is he does not have the numbers in the party room. He does not have the numbers because sensible members of parliament, especially from regional areas, know how important these services are and they have obviously indicated that they will not support this legislation. So the minister has been humiliatedhe cannot get a proposition in relation to FEE-HELP through the cabinet and he cannot get a proposition in relation to voluntary student unionism through the party room. Surely this minister's humiliation today is complete. Surely this minister must accept that he is the most ineffective minister for education that this country has seen, certainly in the postwar era. I refer to his response to some suggestions that I have made about the future of universities in this country. The fact is we need more public resources going into our universities and we need more private resources. In this legislation today we have an example of some private resources going into our university system and Labor supports it. But do you know that over the last few years every OECD country, bar one, has increased public funding going to universities and has also increased private funding going to universities, such that one complements the other? No prizes for guessing which is the odd country out-Australia, under the guidance of the Prime Minister and the minister for education, because the increase in private funding of universities in this country has not been matched by increases in public funding. What are the consequences of this? We are debating a bill here which effectively provides for extra foreign students. There is no difficulty with that, it also provides for extra Australian students, but since the election of this government in 1996 virtually all of the growth in student places in Australian universities has been in full fee paying foreign students. Because of the government's refusal to provide a reasonable indexation of costs to our universities they have had no alternative other than to rely on foreign full fee paying students. That has meant that the enrolments of Australian students has flatlined, and indeed in the last two years-for only the second time in half a century-the number of Australian students going to university has fallen. You would think that the government would be mildly concerned about that. It is not. The government is not concerned about it. The minister for education told the Australian newspaper that he expects the enrolments of Australian students in our universities over the next 10 years to continue to fall. I say that the future of this country will be profoundly determined by our success in having an increasing proportion of our young people going on and completing a university education. At present around 30 per cent of young Australians go on to complete a university education. I set a target of maybe doubling that to 60 per cent. The minister for education described that as madness. He said we would have to go trawling through the nursing homes to find that number of people to go through university. If it is 30 per cent now-let us just do some simple arithmetic-and you want to double it, you get 60 per cent of young people going to university. You do not have to go to a nursing home; you just need to double the proportion. How realistic is this? I have certainly put it into the public arena for debate, but the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, has set a target of 50 per cent by the year 2010, which is only five years away. I have suggested 60 per cent by the year 2020 and the minister for education has described this as madness and snobbery. Snobbery? The minister for education will want his children to go on and have the opportunity of a university education but not the children of the working men and women of this country. Where is the snobbery? The snobbery is with the Liberal Party who want to return-and are returning-the Australian university system to one that is based on money and not merit, that does not allow the talents of the kids of working-class people in this country to be developed through a higher education. This is a disgraceful situation. It is an appalling situation for our economic future, it is an appalling situation for our legitimate aspiration for a fair Australia, and yet the minister proudly says that as minister for education he would accept fully that the number of Australian university students will fall over the next decade. So there is a gulf between the Australian Labor Party and the Liberal and National parties: we believe in higher education; this mob do not because they just want to see the sons and daughters of wealthy people going on to university but not those of struggling, working Australians.",58
43,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"I want to support the remarks of the member for Rankin as strongly as I can in this debate on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Budget Measures) Bill 2005 and the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2005. On the issue of higher education, report after report in recent times has made it clear that educational opportunities for Australian students have been flatlining and that the number of domestic students with the opportunity to go to university is effectively drying up and increasingly based on the wealth of their parents-whether they can afford to pay the increased HECS charges and the full fees which this government has been imposing on people. University enrolments have been increasing, but the only reason university enrolments have been increasing is because of the increasing proportion of overseas students. In fact, that increase has been so dramatic that, since the Howard government came to office, the percentage of overseas university students has increased from 10 per cent to 20 per cent of the total student community. It is not just in universities that you find this happening; it is also happening in the area of trades and apprenticeships, where the government has reduced its support for trade, training, apprenticeships and the development of skills. So now we are increasingly hearing about a skills shortage in Australia. This government says, ‘Well, we're going to fix that by bringing in students from overseas to meet the skills shortage.' That is a secondrate solution. What we should be doing is training and educating our own. The remarks made by the member for Rankin draw that out very well and very clearly, and I support them completely. I support the amendment moved by the member for Jagajaga",63
44,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,I would remind the honourable member that it has not yet been moved. We have had notice of intention.,63
45,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"I support the amendment foreshadowed by the member for Jagajaga concerning the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2005. The reason I want to support that foreshadowed amendment is that this bill makes it clear that the government is proposing to continue with compulsory student service fees for overseas students, whereas, in its so called voluntary student unionism legislation, it is attempting to prohibit them for Australian students. This is a remarkable piece of hypocrisy and contradiction. I am reminded of the debate concerning overseas students and the government's full feepaying agenda, where the government says: ‘Let's bring in the overseas students and they will pay full fees. That will be a good thing for Australia because we'll get the incomethe full fees-from those students.' Indeed, the universities like this approach too, because they get the full fees from those overseas students. Then the government says: ‘Oh, we shouldn't discriminate against Australian students. They ought to have the same opportunities as overseas students get.' The opportunity that the Minister for Education, Science and Training talks about, and that his predecessor David Kemp used to talk about, is to pay full fees. Wonderful! As an Australian student, you ought to get to pay full fees if you want to attend an Australian university. What that does is convert the opportunity for tertiary education in this country one based on wealth, based on the means of your parents, rather than on merit. That is a most unsatisfactory feature of Australia's education system. But, in that case, the government says: ‘Overseas students have this opportunity to pay full fees. Australian students should have the same.' Here we find a situation where the government is attempting to prohibit compulsory student fees for student services for Australian students, but it says the overseas students ought to continue to have those compulsory student fees. If the government wanted to adopt the same logic as it applies in relation to fees for university courses, it would not allow this. It would not have a situation where there is one approach to be taken for the overseas students and one approach to be taken for the Australian students. When we ask ourselves: ‘Why is there a difference? Why is the government saying, “No fees in relation to Australian students; fees in relation to overseas students”?', the answer is all political. It is all because this government wants to attack the student unions and student services because of its ideological obsession with these things. Voluntary student unionism is a combination of ideological fantasy and political payback by failed former Liberal student politicians. Back in 1994, when the Kennett government in my home state of Victoria was trying to outlaw compulsory student unions, one of his advocates said: Nobody wants to abolish the caf. Nobody wants to close down the toilets in the union building or whatever. Those services will survive under a voluntary union. They will be better provided. They will be targeted more effectively at the students. How ridiculous; how absurd. Perhaps they wanted to introduce user-pays toilets. We used to have that kind of thing 50 or 100 years ago. I like to think we have had some into social progress since then and we no longer have to pay when we visit the toilet. But that is the kind of bizarre logic that the advocates of voluntary student unionism have been putting forward. The people who developed the voluntary student unionism legislation are failed Liberal former student politicians. This is the third go they have had at it. First, they tackled it in the courts, trying to have the universities prohibited from charging compulsory fees and from requiring compulsory membership of unions and associations. They were unsuccessful in the courts. Secondly, they tried to win by having students on campuses of universities and post-secondary educational institutions themselves reject the idea of compulsory membership. Indeed, it is a reasonable proposition: if a majority of students want membership of associations to be voluntary, then student unions should move in that direction. However, they failed to attract support amongst the student community to do that. Their third idea is to use parliament to impose voluntary student unionism on student communities regardless of whether they want them or not. That is the heart of this argument. Voluntary student unionism is no different in character from the voluntary payment of taxes, council rates or the goods and services tax. It is not compulsory unionism in an industrial relations setting. Theoretically, we could make these things voluntary. We could make council rates or taxation voluntary. But if we made the payment of taxes like the GST optional no-one would pay them, and you would have to pay someone to construct the street and the footpath outside your house. You could hire private bodyguards instead of having a police force to keep you safe, or at least hire a private investigator recover belongings if they were stolen and so forth. If you go back far enough in history in Victoria, and in other places in Australia, you will find that many things did work in that way. But there were many problems with the voluntary payment of taxes. Similarly, if you make student unionism optional and the payment of the fees optional no-one will pay the fees, and that will lead to the death of campus associations. This whole idea of voluntary payments is, frankly, an absurd idea that is destined to fail. Student unionism goes back to before the turn of the century. It has a history that members of this government do not understand. It came into being to serve student communities because there was a need for the services they provide and because they generally represent better value for time and money than if individual students have to do all these things themselves. Student unions are in place to set up bushwalking clubs, build swimming pools and develop various other services, and by and large they have done a good job. This government has been trying to kill off student unions vices. Howard government members say that campuses would be better off moving to a fee-for-service system. The end result would be that less well patronised events, such as theatre, dances and concerts, would disappear and universities and TAFE colleges would become sadder, greyer and duller places. That is why so many people oppose voluntary student unionism. Many people in the entertainment industry who got their start through union theatres and the like have come out savagely and strongly in opposition to voluntary student unionism, because they understand the effect that a fee-for-service system will have on those activities. Actors John Clark, Magda Szubanski and Max Gillies and writers such as David Williamson and many more got their start through stuto dent theatre, and they have all opposed voluntary student unionism. Another area this legislation to introduce voluntary student unionism would hit hard is sport. Figures released by a group of eight university sporting organisations say that of the $40 million in student fees presently being spent on sport each year, only 20 per cent would continue to be available if the Howard government proceeds with its legislation. Such a $32 million cut would deal a devastating blow to university sporting culture. The other point that ought to be stressed is that voluntary student unionism is about political payback from failed former Liberal student politicians. It is nothing more than an attempt by the government to shut students up, keep them passive and keep them in their place. We can see that quite clearly when we look at the bills before the House. It is okay to have compulsory student services in relation to overseas students, because presumably the government does not feel there is a risk of political activity there. But it is not okay to have compulsory student fees in relation to student services for domestic Austraand their serlian students. This government is being egged on by former Liberal students seeking revenge after being perpetual losers in student politics. If it were not the case that during the Vietnam War the Liberal Party lost support within universities and post secondary education institutions and their people were unable to win student elections, we probably would not be having the whole voluntary student unionism debate. Their attitude is such that, if cannot win those elections, they want to kill off the whole institution of student associations, student guilds and the like. I believe in autonomy and decision making in these things. I respect the autonomy of universities and their right to make decisions about these issues. The government does not respect the rights of individuals to make these choices. It tells universities: ‘You can't have student associations that include everyone.' We support and respect the autonomy of universities, and if they want to make student bodies voluntary that is fine with me. We respect their right to make these decisions. The government does not. It wants to impose-let me repeat: impose-voluntary student unionism on universities. That Liberal Party rhetoric about voluntarism and choice is just propaganda. The government often accuses the Labor Party of being centralist, but it is the government that wants to impose its view of the world on bodies such as universities and councils. It has no respect for their autonomy. We heard the Minister for Education, Science and Training say that students should not have to pay for sporting facilities that they do not use or for political causes that they do not support. I heard the member for Bass echoing those remarks earlier in the debate today. I do not support our invasion of Iraq. I do not support the billion dollars that this government has spent on government advertising. When am I going to get my tax refund in those matters? The area of voluntary student unionism has quite properly run into difficulties because of its lack of support from government senators-for example, Senator Eggleston, the government's deputy Senate whip, suggested that the ban is driven by ‘outdated, ideological student politics battles'. He said that ‘it is not appropriate to contemporary they circumstances on our university campuses'. He is absolutely right. That is why I support the foreshadowed amendment by the member for Jagajaga, which I will repeat for the benefit of the member for Eden-Monaro: ... the House: (1) in light of the contradiction between the ESOS bill and the VSU bill, and the Minister's humiliating backdown on introducing VSU for the 2006 academic year, condemns the Government; and (2) believes that the government must now withdraw its VSU bill, and avoid the inconsistency in making student services fees compulsory for overseas students at Australian universities while trying to ban fees being charged to Australian students. And I am enjoying very much speaking to this foreshadowed amendment. We read in this morning's papers that voluntary student unionism is apparently not going to happen in 2007, that Senator Joyce is not supporting it and that the government has problems in getting its legislation through the Senate. When Senator Joyce rolled over and meekly acquiesced to the sale of Telstra, I described him in this place as Barnaby Rubble. But it would appear that he has risen from the rubble and has knocked over the trade practices amendment overnight. Good on him for doing that, because this is a government that supports the big end of town, not small business. Its changes to trade practices legislation concerning mergers were proposed to advantage the big end of town, and I am pleased that Senator Joyce has defeated those proposed amendments. It would appear that he is also playing a role in voluntary student unionism being defeated and not going any further, so if I were one of those subeditors writing headlines one of them might be ‘Backdown Barnaby beats Backflip Brendan' or something like that. The minister for education's proposals for voluntary student unionism will crash and burn like a bogong moth in this building. That will be a good thing, because student services are very important, especially for new students-those who are young and new to campus-to enable them to get some of the campus life that comes with student services and it would be a great shame if those services were to disappear through this government pursuing what is an ideological agenda. These bills are principally designed to enable USA based Carnegie Mellon University to operate in South Australia from March next year. That university intends to offer fee-paying courses to Australian and overseas students. The bills will allow the university to offer these courses by creating a new category of higher education providers, which will consist of overseas higher education institutions with Australian branches. Those providers will be able to access the FEE-HELP loans scheme for Australian feepaying higher education students. The bills will also provide that foreign owned higher education institutions with branches in Australia may become registered providers of fee-paying education services to overseas students. I indicated at the start of the debate that think this government is utterly on the wrong track in relation to higher education, given the fact that it has ripped federal government assistance out of public sector education and tertiary education. As the member for Rankin pointed out, we are the only OECD country-we have this distinction on our own; we are the only one-which has diminished the level of public support for higher education in the past decade or so. That is a foolish strategy. We can already see this country suffering from skill shortages, given reports from various employers about their problems in relation to skills. We have seen the government rapidly escalating the skilled migrant category. I think it has quadrupled since 1996. That is to meet skill shortages which are a product of this government's neglect of support for universities, support for trade training and support for apprenticeships. Across the board this government has been abandoning its responsibilities to domestic students and pursuing a full fee paying agenda. I noted recently one of a plethora of reports identifying and exposing this government's flawed strategy which showed that the proportion of university students from poor backgrounds, rural and regional areas and Indigenous families fell last year while fees and charges increased. What a damning indictment of a flawed education strategy! The government say: ‘We want more full fee paying students. We're not interested in the rest.' Education ought to be about merit. It ought to be an investment in this country's future. Education is the path to economic prosperity in Australia and everywhere else in the world, and we ought to be serious about that national investment instead of having the strategy that the government are pursuing, which is withdrawing federal support and pursuing a full fee paying agenda. That is absolutely the wrong way to go. We I should not be heading there. (Time expired)",63
46,Ms LIVERMORE,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"I am very pleased to be given the opportunity to speak in the House today about a very important industry in this country. It is an industry that is now a multibillion dollar industry and it is an industry that is of great importance to the Australian economy. It is of course the international education industry, which is now worth over $6 billion a year to Australia. This makes education Australia's third largest services export and of critical importance to our economy. The international education industry has experienced enormous worldwide growth over the past 10 years and that is set to continue. Tony Pollock, Chief Executive Officer of IDP Education Australia-one of the major recruiters of foreign students into Austraincreasingly lia-predicts that global demand for higher education will rise from 97 million students in 2000 to 263 million in 2025. So far Australia has benefited from the increasing demand from students to study abroad. While it is true that the rate of growth in the number of students choosing to study in Australia has slowed in recent years, nonetheless in 200405 there was a growth in commencements of 2.8 per cent. This shows that more and more international students continue to choose to study in Australia each year. In particular, there has been strong demand from Chinese students to study in Australia in recent years. Students have consistently chosen to study in Australia because of the quality of our universities and private colleges, the value for money that our degrees and qualifications represent and the chance to improve their English skills and to experience our way of life. However, the international education market has become increasingly competitive and Australia cannot afford to lose its valuable share of this market. We must continue to strive to give international students the best possible educational experience at our universities, to provide necessary support and services and to ensure they get value for money when studying in Australia. We have an obligation to do that as a ple and it is also good business for providers and our country. This is because evidence from surveys of students shows that one of the most powerful influences on a student's decision to come to Australia is word of mouth. The experiences of other students from a particular country will determine in large part the attractiveness of Australia as a place to study. Protecting and promoting the reputation of our universities and other private institutions where overseas students are enrolled is therefore essential if this important industry is to continue its strong growth in the face of an competitive global market for education services. Education facilities and standards are improving all the time in China and other Asian countries, such as Singapore and Malaysia. Australia therefore cannot take its position as a leading provider of education services for granted. Students who come here must be assured that they will obtain a quality education in a safe, welcoming environment. In 2005 there are 320,000 international students enrolled to study with an approved Australian education provider. Increasingly, more Australian universities are setting up campuses offshore. This growing industry must be supported by appropriate legislation. That was recognised at the time the original Education Services for Overseas Students Act was introduced and with it a means of regulating the sector to ensure that students coming to Australia could be assured of appropriate support and value for money in courses they had paid to enrol in whether at university or at a private provider. The act came about largely thanks to the work of Labor Senator Kim Carr, whose pursuit of unscrupulous providers brought to light the need for students to be protected and for providers to meet certain standards of quality in both their teaching and the level of support given to internamatter of princitional students. Not only is international education of great importance to the Australian economy but it allows for a sharing of ideas and culture and it is an invaluable educational experience for the students involved. Both domestic and international students benefit greatly from being given the opportunity to study together. As well as learning in a lecture theatre, students learn from each other and this sharing of cultures is invaluable. International education is of crucial economic importance to Australia and it also offers significant benefits to all Australian students. The government must therefore use its legislative powers to support this very important industry. I would like to discuss three aspects of these bills today. Firstly, there are the amendments that allow for foreign higher education providers to operate in Australia. Secondly, there are the amendments that provide for registered providers to continue to charge overseas tuition fees which include a fee for services. Finally, there are the changes to the tuition assurance requirements to enhance consumer protection mechanisms. The first of these points relates to the Carnegie Mellon University proposal. Amendments to both the Education Services for Overseas Students Act, ESOS, and the Higher Education Support Act 2003 are necessary to allow a foreign higher education provider to operate in Australia. The proposal to establish a branch of the Carnegie Mellon University in Adelaide has given rise to the need to make such changes. The ESOS Amendment Bill 2005 will allow a provider to become a registered provider even though it is not a resident of Australia. As a registered provider under the ESOS Act, a foreign education institution will be able to enrol international students. The Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005 will provide a new category of higher education providers, being table C providers, seas higher education institutions with Australian operations. This will allow students table C providers to access FEE-HELP and OS-HELP assistance. The CMU proposal is a first for Australia. Carnegie Mellon is a private university with campuses in Pennsylvania, California and Qatar. The CMU will be the first foreign higher education institution to open up in Australia offering courses to both local and international students. The proposed amendments will, of course, enable foreign higher education institutions other than CMU to apply to operate in Australia. This process must be very carefully monitored. These amendments must not open the floodgates for anyone to come and set up whatever they might call a university in Australia. Each application by a foreign university to operate in Australia must be assessed on its own merits and treated on a case-bycase basis. In the case of Carnegie Mellon, its academic success, reputation and financial status have all proved to be significant factors in making its operation in Australia desirable. It is particularly significant that CMU is such a well-regarded university. It was placed 38 out of 200 on the Times Higher Education Supplement list of top universities in the world and was ranked 62 in the Shanghai Jiao Tong University's world academic ranking. This is an impressive record by anyone's reckoning. This highly regarded international standing is an important aspect of CMU being permitted to set up a branch in South Australia. It is also highly significant that CMU has met all the necessary requirements of an Australian university. CMU appears to have met all the necessary requirements set out by the Australian Universities Quality Agency and will be required to submit regular audits to AUQA. This will help to ensure the ongoing and continued quality of the education provided at CMU's that are overAdelaide campus. Along with an excellent academic record, at CMU also has very sound finances, minimising any risks to students who will be studying at its Adelaide campus. It certainly appears that the panel of Australian higher education specialists that recommended CMU be approved in its application to have a university campus in South Australia were given all the necessary financial and academic information to make an informed and professional decision. While this is certainly an exciting opportunity, the CMU proposal and the amendments are not without concern. Although it appears that Carnegie Mellon easily meets all the Australian quality cial criteria and that the proper process was followed in making a decision to allow CMU to operate in Australia, there has been a worrying lack of transparency and public disclosure on the matter. It would be far more desirable to make such matters as transparent as possible and disclose to the public all relevant documents. It is surely in the public's interest and in interests of the local higher education sector to do so. The lack of transparency in this matter has been less than satisfying. I would like to return to my earlier point and stress that these amendments must not be seen as a sign that any university can come and set up shop in Australia. Each application must be considered on its own merits and on a caseby-case basis. This is absolutely necessary to protect the reputation of Australia's higher education sector and to protect individual students. Australia must not compromise its education standards for any foreign higher education institution. And I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, this is something that the Australian Labor Party will be watching very closely. I would also like to discuss the other stantive element of the ESOS Amendment Bill 2005, which is that registered providers can continue to charge a services fee to international students to comply with the ESOS Act and the national code that accompanies that act. This is a very odd amendment, given the government's ideological obsession with its Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Upfront Student Union Fees) Bill 2005. But I note that today common sense-or, more accurately, cold hard numbers-has put the Minister for Education, Science and Training and his hardline cheer squad in the Liberal Party backbench back in their box for now. That bill clearly prohibits universities from charging a general services fee to provide and finan- vital services to students. We already knew that the current government's education policy was reactive and incoherent, but this amendment shows the government's education policy to also be blatantly contradictory and just plain irrational. There is good reason to believe that prohibiting a services charge, and thus limiting services available to students on univerthe sity campuses, would deter international students from choosing Australia as their study destination. It is much more difficult to promote to an international student a university that does not provide any student services, support, counselling, contact officers or social events-as I am sure the universities in Western Australia unfortunately discovered. Statistics from DEST clearly show that from 1997 to 2002, growth in overseas student commencements in Western Australia was significantly lower than growth in all other states. It is not coincidental that during this period Western Australia was faced with voluntary student unionism. It is clearly desirable for international students to have access to affordable services at university. In fact, the national code requires that some sub- specific services are provided for international students, including information or counselling with respect to orientation, academic progress, further study and accommodation. The ESOS Act also requires universities to provide contact officers for international students. The proposed ESOS amendment bill, which allows for a services fee to be charged to international students, is necessary to ensure that the requirements of the ESOS Act and national code are met, as well as ensuring the welfare of international students that come to study in Australia. However, the blatant contradiction between this amendment and the government's VSU bill will create some serious problems on university campuses around Australia. These contradictory bills will create a two-tiered system in Australian universities-a system where domestic students will be denied comparable services to their international counterparts. These conflicting bills will create a system of haves and have-nots. What is worse is that the government has deliberately ignored major stakeholders in the higher education sector. This government has ignored the criticisms of major education stakeholders of its plans to abolish general services fees for domestic students. The Acting Vice-Chancellor of Melbourne University, Professor Peter MCPhee, labelled these contradictory bills as ‘not fair'. The universiline ties' international student recruitment body, IDP Education Australia, said that while it was up to the individual institutions as to whether or not they charge international students a fee, the contradictory situation was not ideal. But the government has refused to listen-although it seems that perhaps some members of the government have finally taken a stand on this. Representatives from the National Liaison Committee for International Students in Australia and the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee Chief Executive Officer Mr John Mullarvey have also expressed concerns about the contradictory bills creating issues of discrimination and exacerbating racial tensions on campuses. As you can see, Mr Deputy Speaker, there are some significant concerns that should be addressed by the current government. However, when asked about discrepancies between the VSU bill and the ESOS amendment bill, a spokesperson for the Minister for Education, Science and Training said the amendments were merely ‘technical'. This is not a merely technical matter. As I have already outlined, the contradictory bills may very well cause significant problems on university campuses and jeopardise the standing of Australian universities in the international marketplace at just the time when the competition to attract international students is getting tougher. The necessary amendments to the ESOS Act further highlight how utterly ridiculous and ideologically driven the government's VSU bill is. However, despite the blatant contradiction, we support the ESOS amendment to allow a services fee to be charged, in the interests of international students and the international education industry generally. We just hope that the government senators who forced this backdown today hold their and continue to stand up for their constituents and the universities in their areas. Finally, I would like to discuss the changes to the tuition assurance requirements set out in the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005. The proposed improvements to the tuition assurance arrangements for international students are certainly desirable. Under the current requirements, if an education provider is unable to continue to offer courses students affected may elect to transfer to another institution or to seek a refund of their fees. This amendment would ensure that those students that elect to transfer to another institution will not incur any extra costs for the units they have already taken. The evaluation of the ESOS Act conducted by Phillips KPA and LifeLong Learning Associates found that the ESOS legislation was ‘broadly proving effective in ensuring that students receive the tuition for which they have paid'. The report was also supportive of enhancements to the consumer protection mechanisms. The Labor Party supports these amendments as we support a robust consumer protection scheme for international students studying at an Australian education institution. The Australian international education industry is highly reliant on its good reputation and its quality. Consumer protection mechanisms, like that set out in the amendment, help to ensure that Australia's education sector continues to be highly regarded and a desirable study destination for international students. However, these amendments must not take the place of proper risk management being conducted by DEST. In the ANAO performance audit, Internationalisation of Australian Education and Training, it was recommended that the International Education Group should improve the administration of its risk management approach to compliance and enforcement as part of its regulation of the Australian education export industry. As the report recommends, more needs to be done by DEST to ensure that students are not faced with having to transfer or having their courses refunded. While the safety net offered by the Tuition Assurance Scheme-and that is strengthened by the proposed amendments-is important and needs to be in place, a better administered risk management system would enable DEST to be proactive on matters of consumer protection, rather than only reacting to situations as they arise. As I said, the multibillion dollar international education industry is of great importance to the Australian economy and must be supported by appropriate legislation. While the bills before us today do provide for some necessary changes, more has to be done, especially in the area of consumer protection for international students. For example, there must be more regulation of marketing to international students, better regulation of international recruiting agents and better monitoring of international students' welfare while studying in Australia. We look forward to seeing some of these measures being put in place by the government in response to the review of the ESOS Act by Phillips KPA. Despite some of the concerns that I have raised and that are outlined in the second reading amendment, we support both the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2005 and the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005. In conclusion, I come back to the utter farce that now exists between the government's position on VSU and its continued recognition of the importance of on-campus services for overseas students. I hope that the reports that we have seen today of the government's apparent backdown on its VSU legislation will continue to be supported and upheld by those government senators who have held the line on this issue so that we will continue to see services and support for both domestic and international students on our university campuses in Australia.  pleased to speak on the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2005 and the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005 and, in particular, to support the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. In Western Sydney, we are very proud of the University of Western Sydney. You will always find Labor members in Western Sydney supporting the university and what it does and, of course, supporting the students and the parents of those students in their endeavours. I was really thrilled when the deputy leader, the honourable member for Jagajaga, insisted on coming out just a couple of weeks ago and looking at the Nirimba Education Precinct. It is a unique precinct with two senior high schools, a TAFE and the university. She got a wonderful reception to her visit. She wanted to see first-hand exactly what was happening on the precinctand what was happening was good. The University of Western Sydney is light-years ahead in the way it organises student services. Let me explain: there is a private company, uwsconnect, which has on its board of management not only university representatives but student representatives. The student representatives, as directors of the company, are required to undertake courses so that they can properly exercise their fiduciary responsibilities as any other company director would be required to do. If you look at Nirimba, which is located in the electorate of the honourable member for Greenway, you will see that the student services and the cafeteria are run by uwsconnect-a private company, but not for profit. The sporting facilities are run by uwsconnect. The swimming pool is run by uwsconnect. At the Nirimba precinct, some 5,000 students from 25 schools use the swimming pool. What is the attitude of the honourable member for Greenway to the voluntary student union legislation? The honourable member for Greenway is on the public record as saying: ‘Let private enterprise run A precise example of private enterprise running a service involved a cafe on site of the Hawkesbury Campus, located in the electorate of the Chief Government Whip. And what happened? After 12 months, it closed. If you are going to depend on private enterprise running these facilities, they will close. What have we seen today? We have seen the government totally back down on this legislation. Not the member for Bass, I might say, who is mightily disappointed. He has put his disappointment on the record. He said that the minister should continue with the VSU legislation. Were the Liberal members in Western Sydney on the public record defending the student services on campus throughout Western Sydney? Of course not. They can be relied upon to trot out the good old government lines about how better off those students would be if compulsory student union fees were not applying. They have been left high and dry. The honourable member for Greenway has been left high and dry. I will say this about the honourable member for Greenway: she loyally trotted out the government lines-just like the member for Bass, who said that it was a terrific thing. In fact, the member for Greenway did not care whether the students who get the late night shuttle bus services provided by the university from Nirimba to Blacktown or Marayong were cancelled. She did not worry about the safety of those students or, indeed, the concern of their parents. I presume she thought that the situation would be perfectly satisfactory if those buses were discontinued. Mr Michael Ferguson interjecting have admired your steadfastness for berating your government colleagues for backing down on this legislation. You do not give a damn about one Tasmanian student. Brendan it.' Nelson, whom we have seen unctuously berating us here about student facilities and schools, has suffered one of his worse setbacks. Whatever his aspirations for leadership, this has been a fatal flaw.",67

49,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education, Science and Training. Given the triumph of common sense over ideology in the voluntary student unionism debate, and the delay of the disastrous legislation, is it not the case that students, vice-chancellors, regional Australians and all the others who campaigned hard to stop this legislation deserve an ‘A+', and wouldn't the minister's report card display an ‘F' ?",74
50,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I call the Minister for Education, Science and Training. In calling him, I would remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that we should not be straying into the question of opinion. Nonetheless, question can stand.",74
51,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question. This is a very important issue. It concerns of voluntary membership, in the 21st century, of student unions. This government, and every member on this side of the House and the Liberal and National Parties in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, strongly believe that every one of the 715,000 Australian students who enrol in a university to receive an education should be free to decide whether or not they will part with hard-earned money to join a student union, guild or association. This government believes, firstly, in freedom of choice. Secondly, it believes that adult students should be free to choose which services they will or will not buy and subsidise on a university campus. We do not believe that in this, the 21st century, anybody should be telling an Australian university student what they will or will not pay for involuntarily. This is worth remembering. I take the House back two years ago, when this government passed an $11 billion reform package for Australian higher education. It was the first week of December 2003. In that week, on 5 December 2003, this government passed a package that would deliver $11 billion to universities over the next 10 years. It was also the week when the Labor Party chose a new leader. Mr Mark Latham was the chosen on 2 December that year. On 5 December, the day that this legislation went through the parliament, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said: I think we'll make a great team, and I certainly look forward to working with Mr Latham. I think we'll be able to make sure we get our message across very clearly.

67,Mr MICHAEL FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, what is the significance of the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate? Does it offer Australia any opportunities? Is there evidence of growing support within the Australian community for this?",75
68,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Bass for his question. The member is unforgettably associated with policies that seek to balance concerns with the environment with the protection of the jobs of Australian working men and women. He asks me what the significance of the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate is. Well may the member acknowledge my interest in this matter, and I acknowledge his. I praise his interest in this matter, Mr Speaker, through you. The partnership represents the best opportunity for effective, concerted action by Australia and like-affected and likeminded countries in our region and elsewhere to build a sustainable basis for improving our climate, tackling greenhouse gas emissions and doing so in a manner that does not detract from development and job creation in Australia. I will quote from some recent comments on this: The Asia-Pacific partnership is aimed at promoting investments in clean energy technology and its membership is certainly impressive. It's got the world's four largest economies, the United States, China, Japan and India. By any measure, the six countries in the Asia-Pacific PartnershipAustralia, the United States, Japan, China, India and South Korea-represent a regional partnership of great significance and even greater opportunity. The other five participants are all key trading partners of Australia. Together they constitute 45 per cent of the world's population, 49 per cent of the world's gross domestic product and 48 per cent of the world's energy consumption. In making those comments, I have been reading extensively from a speech delivered last night, 11 October, by the member for Batman, who is the shadow minister for primary industries, resources, forestry and tourism. I would like to applaud the remarks of the member for Batman. I think that the member for Batman on this issue has demonstrated-as he did on the Tasmanian forest issue-that he at least understands that protecting the jobs of Australians is more important than selling out to inner-metropolitan elites in return for green preferences. The fellow who sits next to him, the member for Grayndler, is not so popular in a certain electorate in Tasmania that is represented by another member of the Labor Party who is very interested in the jobs of Australians, Dick Adams. What the shadow minister was saying last night was sheer common sense. He was expressing support for the government's policy. I welcome that. I think an element of bipartisanship on this issue would do the public interest and the public concern a great deal of good. Mr Albanese interjecting",75
69,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I notice that the member for Grayndler starts interjecting. The member for Grayndler has been sidelined by the member for Batman on this issue. The member for Grayndler is somebody who thought that selling out workers to get green preferences was a good idea. He was more worried about green preferences in Grayndler than the jobs of Australians in Tasmania-just as he is more concerned about green preferences than he is about the jobs of Australians when it comes to protecting our industry. Kyoto has always been inadequate for Australia's interests. It was never right for Australia to sign up to Kyoto. Those in the Labor Party who advocated that we should have signed up to Kyoto were selling out the working men and women in the resource sector of Australia. I welcome the fact that the member for Batman has realised that. Just as he quite rightly said that the people of northern Tasmania voted for the job security policy of the coalition in the last election and rejected the jobs-destroying policies of the Labor Party on that occasion, so on this occasion he is rightly endorsing the partnership on clean energy and development and recognising the challenged nature of the Kyoto arrangement. I applaud the remarks of the member for Batman. Maybe it evinces a change of attitude on the part of the Labor Party and a return to some interest in actual job security instead of job destruction.

In light of the minister's humiliating failure to get support for his extreme voluntary student unionism bill from his coalition colleagues, from universities, from students and from sporting and community organisations across the nation, will the minister now back off and shred the VSU legislation forever? Does the minister now acknowledge that his leadership ambitions have disappeared into the ether along with the VSU bill itself, which are both now just hot air and vanity?",76

74,Mr TOLLNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Attorney-General, who is representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the Attorney-General advise the House how Australia is cooperating with the authorities in Bali? How is the Australian government helping to support our friends the people of Bali?",77
75,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Solomon for his question. I think the honourable member for Solomon, like most members of this House, is very conscious of today and the opportunity that we had this morning to remember the 202 victims of the tragedy of the 12 October 2002 bombings, which took-amongst the lives of those 202 people-88 Australians. The grim outcome of terrorism has taken more innocent lives since then, including a further four Australians, in what should have been an opportunity for peace and enjoyment in a very delightful part of the world. Mr Speaker, my colleague and yours the Minister for Foreign Affairs is in Bali today to remember the victims. I know that, on behalf of the Australian government and the people of Australia, he has extended condolences to the families and the loved ones of those who lost their lives tragically there. Many in this House and in the Senate came together in the gardens of the parliament this morning not only to mourn but also to celebrate the lives and the stories, hopes and aspirations of each person and their families, who were so sadly affected. On these matters, our communities in Bali and here in Australia are working together. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs announced recently, the Australian government will provide medical equipment and support totalling more than $1 million to meet the immediate and longer terms needs of the blast victims and their communities in Bali. We have seen the substantial way in which those facilities were able to assist people injured on this more recent occasion. But the bombings do serve to reaffirm the importance of our efforts in the fight against terrorism in our region and in the rest of the world. The horrific attacks in Bali have been committed by people who preach a twisted ideology of hate-an ideology that has no place in our open society and in peace-loving societies around the world. It is an ideology that I believe is abhorrent to people of all religions. Practical cooperation between Australia and the Indonesian law enforcement agencies has already helped to secure the arrest, trial and conviction of some 40 people in relation to the events of October 2002. Again our police and other agencies are working to track down the perpetrators of the latest atrocity and to ensure that they are brought to justice. I am sure that all members of the House will wish them well in those efforts. Workplace Relations",77
76,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the government's four-page advertisements in today's national and capital city newspapers. Isn't it the case that the cost to the taxpayer of all the advertisements in today's national and capital city newspapers is over $1 million-the equivalent of 40 young Australians on the minimum wage for a year?,77
77,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have not done a precise calculation, but obviously there is a cost involved in these advertisements and I have never sought to deny that. I would remind the House that this is not a situation where these advertisements are something that has never been done before, either at a state or a federal level. Given the significance of the changes-even those who sit opposite argue, rather extravagantly on occasions, that these changes are the most momentous and the most radical in years; they are big changes, but they are fair changes-it is therefore justifiable, entirely defensible and entirely proper that advertisements providing factual information, as these advertisements dovery factual-be run and I make no apology for running them. Economy: Performance",78
78,Mr VASTA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer outline recent data on consumer sentiment; and what does this data indicate about Australia's economic outlook?,78
79,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Bonner for his question. I can tell him that today Westpac released its consumer sentiment index for the month of October, showing a modest fall in consumer confidence of 1.6 per cent; however, the fall did take consumer sentiment below the index of 100. Reasons for the fall most probably relate to extensive coverage of the recent Bali bombings during the period when public opinion was surveyed. Undoubtedly, another factor contributing to a dampening of consumer sentiment is petrol prices, which are still very high, causing considerable pain to motorists and consumers, and which are bad for business and bad for the economy. Over the last year, world oil prices have increased by 21 per cent. Prices at Australia's petrol bowsers have increased from around a dollar a litre a year ago to around $1.25 per litre today. There has been some moderation in petrol prices over the last few weeks, with prices at Australian bowsers now around 6c a litre lower than they were in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Recent movements in world oil and petrol prices suggest that there may be some further reduction coming, with the price of unleaded petrol in Singapore falling again by two per cent over the last two weeks. This weekend in Beijing, the Group of 20-central bankers and finance ministerswill hold their annual meeting, which I will be attending together with the Governor of the Reserve Bank. There will be discussion of the state of the world economy, the greatest threat to which at the moment is abnormally high oil prices. The abnormally high oil prices are a consequence of strong demand with limited supply, the demand particularly coming out of China and the limited supply being a combination of factors, including instability in the Middle East and lack of investment in production capacity. Notwithstanding these matters and the undoubted effect that they are having on consumer sentiment, underlying economic indicators are favourable. Mortgage interest rates are at historical lows, more Australians are in work than ever before, unemployment is at its lowest rate in 29 years and household incomes are growing strongly. With further economic reform, we have the capacity to drive the Australian economy with continuing growth in the year ahead. Workplace Relations",78
80,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I refer him to the government's TV advertisements that appeared nationally on TV on Sunday night. Isn't it the case that the cost to the taxpayer of the advertisements on Sunday between 3 pm and 10 pm was more than $1.7 million-the equivalent of the salary of 50 registered nurses for a year?,78
81,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Members of the opposition will put those banners down. Members of the opposition are well aware that that is disorderly conduct and I will deal was asked: with it, if necessary.",79
82,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I repeat what I said in answer to the member for Perth: this campaign is utterly defensible. Workplace Relations,79
83,Mr WOOD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Would the minister update the House on how young Australians will benefit from the government's workplace relations reforms? Are there any alternative views?,79
84,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. Along with all the other members of the government, he is interested in creating jobs for young Australians. Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition had the President of the ACTU, Sharan Burrow, address caucus and attempt to tell them that young people would be disadvantaged by the WorkChoices system. The WorkChoices system includes expanded safeguards for young Australian workers. For example, if a young person under the age of 18-a young person of 15, 16 or 17-is interested in going onto an individual Australian workplace agreement, in order for that agreement to be entered into and to be valid they will not only need to sign it themselves but will also need the consent of their parent or their guardian. This is a guarantee which has never existed before. As the Prime Minister keeps saying, the government's guarantee on youth employment, as with other employment, is its record. Of course, that also applies to the opposition. Remember that when the Leader of the Opposition was the minister for employment in the Labor government teenage unemployment in Australia was 34.5 per cent. There was a very revealing interview on The 7.30 Report on 6 May 1993, when Mr Beazley was the employment minister. He So this groupthat is, the unemployedare being told, in their twenties, by society, effectively: You're the losers; go to the scrap heap. Mr Beazley said: Well, those who haven't made it into work and who are among the long-term unemployed, that's a reasonable statement. Contrast that statement with this one from another Labor leader, who said: You should remember in everything you do that fairness at work starts with the chance of a job in the first place, because if we as a government and you as the trades union movement do not make Britain a country of successful business, a country where people want to set up and expand and a country that has the edge over our competitors, then we are betraying those we represent. They were the words of a modern, realistic Labor leader-namely, the Prime Minister of Great Britain, Tony Blair. What Tony Blair was saying was that every young person in his country should have the opportunity of getting a job. What we saw from the Leader of the Opposition yesterday was a statement which confirmed that it was better for young people in this country to stay on welfare than to get a job. That is a shameful position from a man who presided over teenage unemployment in this country of 34.5 per cent. There is one other thing about the Leader of the Opposition. In 1993, when Paul Keating and the then Labor government brought in the first wave of industrial relations changes in this country, changes to move people away from the rigidities of the awards and to open up agreement making in this country, the then minister for employment, Kim Beazley, voted for those changes. But what do we see opportunistically today? We see the Leader of the Opposition wanting to roll back the changes that were made then. Ms Macklin interjecting",79

He was not here to represent the people of Bendigo in relation to these issues, because he was incapable of proper parliamentary behaviour. The record will show the people of Bendigo that the member for Bendigo was so concerned about roads in Bendigo that he engaged in unparliamentary behaviour and has been expelled; he was not here to represent them.

Business Regulation",80

Anyone who wants a character analysis of the Leader of the Opposition is welcome to read a certain diary. I would recommend it. is one of the best books I have read in a time; in fact, I am now reading it a second time. It gets better the second time around. Today the Prime Minister and I announced a task force which will consider all areas of Commonwealth government regulation with the object of identifying specific areas which are unnecessarily burdensome, complex or redundant or which duplicate regulations. It will indicate those areas in which regulation should be removed or significantly reduced as a matter of priority and it will examine non-regulatory options, including selfregulation. It will also provide practical opthings. tions for alleviating government red tape. The Chairman of the Productivity Commission, Gary Banks, will head this prestigious committee. He will be joined by Mr Dick Humphry, a former managing director of the Australian Stock Exchange; Mr Rod Halstead, a corporate law expert; and Mrs Angela MCCrae, who has experience with small business.

For example, in the corporate area, a number were introduced in response to the HIH royal commission as a result of the royal commissioner's report and a number were introduced as a consequence of events It overseas such as Enron and the changes in long US law under the Sarbanes-Oxley act. Although these measures one by one may be good legislative responses, cumulatively they canMr Fitzgibbon-How many are you responsible for?",81

105,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"become an unnecessary burden. That is why it is important that we have a task force which can report by 31 January 2006 and actually identify those Can I also point out that another reason why unnecessary burdens have been introduced in some respects is that in order to secure legislation through the Senate the government has been forced to accept amendments from the Labor Party which in many areas have increased regulation. The opportunity to reconsider those matters, which have been forced on the government by the Senate in years gone by, will also be very important to this review. This is a breakthrough announcement in relation to a task force which has considerable expertise and wide terms of reference, which has a short period of time in which to report, which can make a big contribution and which is part of the microeconomic reform challenge-the ongoing reform to keep the Australian economy growing and profitable and to create more jobs. Ms Aziza Agha",81
106,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. Why did the immigration department force Ms Aziza Agha to travel to a government GP after she had been professionally assessed as unfit to travel? Isn't it the case that Ms Agha died two days after being forced to make this journey to see the government GP? Given that this tragedy occurred after the government's receipt of the Palmer report, why should anyone believe that the culture in Immigration will ever change while Senator Vanstone remains the minister?",82
107,Mr JOHN COBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This government believes that the department must at all times act with due regard to the law and due process, and that is what they did in this case. It is a very sad case. Ms Agha came out here on a six-month visitors visa. She was assessed by her local doctor as being fit to travel to that. In the course of her visa running out of time the department, as they are legally bound to do, contacted her. They found out that she was not well. They then asked the public health service to check out her health. As a result of that they then wrote to her asking her to talk to them about her visa situation. At no time was she told she would be deported; at no time was it suggested that she would be. They simply wanted to talk to her about her visa position in Australia. Private Health Insurance",82
108,Mr FAWCETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Would the minister outline to the House the government's commitment to supporting private health insurance? How does a strong private health sector complement a strong Medicare? Are there any alternate views?,82
109,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Wakefield, who was elected triumphantly to this House in part because of the strong health policies of the Howard government. Support for private health insurance is one of the signature policies of the Howard government. Thanks to government policies like Lifetime Health Cover and the private health insurance rebate, private coverage has increased from 30 per cent and falling to 43 per cent. That means that almost nine million Australians now have the security and choice that private cover gives, including nearly one million people earning incomes of less than $20,000 a year. I have been asked about alternative policies. Labor wants to rip the guts out of the private health insurance rebate. That would cost the average privately insured family $1,000 a year. How do we know this? We know Labor's secret plans because Labor's former leader has revealed them to us. In many ways the Latham Diaries is a vile book, but it helps to explain why modern prior Labor is no longer the party of Curtin and Chifley-or even the party of Hawke and Keating. The Latham Diaries say that on 22 February 2000: Costellothat is to say, the Leader of the Opposition's former chief of stafftold me that the private health insurance rebate would be one of the first things abolished in our promises. Macklin despises the rebate and wants to poleaxe it. At different times Beazley has boasted to caucus that it will go. Then on Wednesday 6 August 2003, when Mr Latham was the shadow Treasurer, his diaries say: An excellent meeting with Coxy and staff to draw up a list of quality cuts to the budget",82
110,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,83
111,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, he is gone too! The diaries say: including parliamentary superannuation and the private health insurance rebate. The rebate that they said they were keeping, they were secretly planning to scrap. What does it say about the Australian Labor Party that they made Mark Latham their leader? What does it say about the Leader of the Opposition that they preferred Latham to him? What these diaries show is that, when it comes to private health insurance, you just cannot trust Labor. The Australian people know that the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had. They also know that the Howard government is the only friend that private health insurance has. Workplace Relations",83
112,Mr EDWARDS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. I again refer the Prime Minister to the four-page advertisements in today's national and capital city newspapers. Does the Prime Minister guarantee that no individual employee will be forced to work on ANZAC Day as a result of the government's extreme industrial relations changes?,83

115,Mr EDWARDS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Don't the advertisements mislead the Australian public, because public holidays such as ANZAC Day can be traded away with the stroke of a pen? Prime Minister, won't these changes damage the integrity of ANZAC Day just as surely as your government is responsible for the damage to the ANZAC Cove site? Mr Tuckey interjecting",83
116,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for O'Connor is warned!,83
117,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can I say in reply to the member for Cowan that ANZAC Day will remain sacrosanct and sacred in Australia. There will be nothing in these changes that will alter what now obtains. ANZAC Day will remain a public holiday. At present many Australians are required as part of their employment to work on ANZAC Day. The circumstances in which they are remunerated for that are governed by their awards and their agreements. That will not change under the new system anymore than the arrangements, for example, for opening stores on Boxing Day. We have post-Christmas sales on Boxing Day. The way some of the propaganda has come out in the last few days you would imagine that those uttering those thingsMr Edwards- Mr Speaker, on a point of order relating to relevance: I am asking about ANZAC Day, not any other day of the year.",83
118,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister is in order.,83
119,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"With great respect-and I do respect the member for Cowan-I have dealt with the issue of ANZAC Day. I think it is reasonable and proper, because ANZAC Day along with other days is a public holiday in this country, to amplify my answer by reference to other days-and I intend to do that. I think the House is entitled to hear the answer in full. Mr Adams interjecting",83
120,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Lyons!,84
121,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There are thousands of Australians now who are required to work as part of their jobs on public holidays. Mr Adams interjecting,84
122,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Lyons is warned!,84
123,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Any suggestion that we are dramatically altering that, or indeed altercompare ing that at all, is completely wrong. Right now under the present law, and under the law before 1996, people could be required to work on ANZAC Day, they could be required to work on Boxing Day, they could be required to work on other public holidays, and the remuneration was determined according to their award or their agreement. That will be the same under the new law. There has been absolutely no change at all, and the attempt by the Labor Party and others to suggest otherwise is completely wrong. Workplace Relations",84
124,Mr FORREST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Would the minister provide the latest information on how further workplace relations reforms will improve the viability of Australian farmers? Is the minister aware of any alternative proposals?",84
125,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Mallee for his question. Australian farmers and farm workers are drowning in a sea of hundreds of complex and barely decipherable state and federal awards. The awards are across eight jurisdictions and, whilst the pastoral awards are the best known, there are literally hundreds of awards dealing with different commodities and sectors of the agricultural industry. The horticultural industry award for New South Wales is long, complex, expensive and a deterrent to employment. That is just one of several hundred awards of a similar type affecting, directly or indirectly, the horticultural industry. Yesterday I drew attention to one aspect of the federal pastoral award, which was the allowance for a horse and an allowance for a saddle. Members may recall that the allowance if you provide a horse is $5.30 per week and $4.23 per week for a saddle, which comes to $9.53 for horse and saddle. Let us that to the South Australian pastoral award. Here you get $5.03 per week for a horseMr Albanese interjecting",84
126,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Grayndler is warned!,84
127,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and $4.02 for a saddle. That makes only $9.05 for horse and saddle. What is the difference between the federal expense and the South Australian expense? Let us go to the Queensland Rabbit Board award. If you are an employee of the Queensland Rabbit Board and supply a horse, you get paid $3.16 and only $2.50 for a saddle, but fodder is thrown in. So you get $5.66 per week for horse and saddle and all fodder, so the horse is looked after. It is a pity about the saddle. Now I look at the Northern Territory cattle industry award. Sorry, there is no horse allowance here but there is a saddle allowance. You get $3.70 per week while the saddle is in use, but nothing for a horse, so where you put the saddle is beyond me. There are thousands of stories",84

To give you an idea of the minutiae and the intervention, it actually details what a cook has to keep in a pantry: rice, butter, vegetables, to be sureMr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. I wonder if the minister can tell us how much we get per kilometre in our MPs award for driving a car to Canberra.",85
132,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is not a point of order. If the member for Grayndler does that again, he will be dealt with.",85

The point is that these awards are a deterBut rent to employment; these awards are job killers in country areas. So long as there are thousands if not tens of thousands of pages where the Labor Party together with union bosses try to dictate every aspect of every arrangement for an employee and an employer, we will not reach the full potential of job creation in country areas. Workplace Relations",85
136,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister recall the following exchange on 29 July on the Neil Mitchell Show, which I quote from the transcript on the Prime Minister's web site: MITCHELL: ... Prime Minister, is ANZAC Day sacrosanct as a public holiday? PRIME MINISTER: Absolutely. MITCHELL: Okay so it won't be up for negotiation. PRIME MINISTER: Absolutely not. Now that it is clear that ANZAC Day work is up for negotiation and that workers could be forced to work on ANZAC Day without compensation, didn't the Prime Minister mislead the Australian people on the Neil Mitchell Show?",85
137,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to the question is no. Let me remind the Leader of the Opposition and let me inform the House of the extent of the dishonest selective quoting that the Leader of the Opposition has engaged in. I did say what he said in answer to that question. I then went on to say, when asked about Christmas Day: Look, no, no, the answer's no. Nothing is going to change in these areas. In answer to a further question from Mitchell: are they going to be up for negotiation? my reply was: They are going to be in no different position than they are now. I heard the Leader of the Opposition this morning being interviewed on Radio National. I listened over my breakfast to the Leader of the Opposition. I can only describe it as a torrent",85
138,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It goes to relevance. How can the Prime Minister possibly say that when he knows he is removing the no-disadvantage test?",85
139,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat.,86
140,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I listened to the Leader of the Opposition quietly, patiently and carefully. I can only describe it as a torrent of breathless opportunism that the Leader of the Opposition had the audacity to say to the Australian public that he wanted to take Australia down the high-wage road, contrary to the low-wage road of the coalition. This is a man who was part of a government that presided over and boasted about a rise of 2.1 per cent in real wages in 13 years, and I am the Prime Minister who has presided over an economy that has delivered a 14.9 per cent rise in real wages over the last 9½ years. There is only one thing at issue in this debate about industrial relations, and that is which side of politics has the capacity to deliver the policies that will grow the Australian economy to maintain the high living standards, the low unemployment, the high productivity and the growing job opportunities of 2005. As I have said before, the worth of any industrial relations policy is the contribution it makes to the strength of the economy. A strong economy delivers job security, higher wages and better conditions. All the rules in the world cannot legislate to prevent a recession from destroying the jobs of Australians. Ms Plibersek interjecting",86
141,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Sydney!,86
142,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This country had the most regulated labour market imaginable in the early 1990s. It did not stop Mr Keating and the other ministers in his government from presiding over one million unemployed. It did not stop real wages from going into free fall. It did not stop hundreds of thousands of small businesses from going broke. Ms Plibersek interjecting,86
143,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Sydney is warned!,86
144,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They may have had their regulations, and they may have had their awards, but the net effect of those awards was to enfeeble the Australian economy. When you have an enfeebled economy, you have high unemployment, low wages and bad working conditions. That is the path of Labor. It was the path of Keating Labor, and it would be the path of Beazley Labor. Transport Infrastructure",86
145,Mr HARTSUYKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Would the minister update the House on the delivery of critical infrastructure funding by the Australian government?,86
146,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am delighted to tell the honourable member for Cowper that, at long last, New South Wales has signed the AusLink agreement. At long last, New South Wales will have the benefit of this significant increase in funding for road and rail infrastructure in the state-around $2½ billion for major new land transport projects and road maintenance; $3.778 billion altogether in Commonwealth assistance to New South Wales road and rail. This will mean a significant boost to the capacity to build major new road projects in that state. Mr Wilkie interjecting",86
147,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Swan!,86
148,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The AusLink investment, for instance, will provide significant money for Westlink, in Sydney, and the Albury upgrade. Mr Wilkie interjecting",86
149,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Swan is warned.,87
150,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Of particular interest to the member for Cowper, the Pacific Highway upgrade and the Bonville Deviation at last should be able to get under way. There will also be around $1.4 billion for rail transport around Australia, the large majority of which will go to New South Wales. So this is a significant boost in funding for the infrastructure of New South Wales. It comes at a time when the New South Wales government itself has record flows of GST moneys and stamp duty revenues. This is a once-in-alifetime opportunity for a major construction activities in the state of New South Wales. This funding represents a 78 per cent increase over the last five years in Commonwealth government assistance for roads in New South Wales. I have to say that I was absolutely staggered to hear Mr Tripodi, the latest Minister for Roads in New South Wales, say that this deal will mean that New South Wales will have to sack 300 employees. How can a 78 per cent increase in funding result in 300 fewer jobs? We want hundreds of extra jobs to get on with building these projects. There can be only one of two reasons why the New South Wales government have to sack people because they have received an increase: either they have been cheating on the Australian government for a long time or, alternatively, they are going to slash their own expenditure on roads to a level that no New South Wales motorist should tolerate. We expect the New South Wales government to go out and employ extra people and to do it quickly. There has already been a three-month unnecessary delay in projects such as the Bonville Deviation. These projects should be already under way, but New South Wales dillydallied under AusLink. Now that the agreement has at last been signed, get on with the job and employ the extra people that will be necessary to undertake these projects so New South Wales can get the road and rail system it properly deserves.

Does the Prime Minister recall the following exchange on the Neil Mitchell show on 29 July: MITCHELL: What about Christmas Day ... boost in road PRIME MINISTER: Look, no, no, the answer's no ... MITCHELL: But are they up for negotiation? PRIME MINISTER: No, they're not. Now that it is clear that Christmas Day is up for negotiation and that workers could be forced to work on Christmas Day without compensation, didn't the Prime Minister mislead the Australian people on the Neil Mitchell show? Isn'the a scrooge? Mrs Bronwyn Bishop- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Firstly, rhetorical questions are not permitted and, secondly, I refer you to page 542 of House of Representatives Practice, which says: While short introductory words may be tolerated, the use of prefaces is to be avoided and a Member called to ask a question places the retention of the call at risk. I ask that it be ruled out of order.",87

It is the case now that, if you work on a public holiday, your remuneration is governed by the terms of your award or your agreement. That will be the case under our law in the future. That is the basis of my claim, and that is the basis of completely disproving the allegations made by the members of the Labor Party. Superannuation",88
159,Mrs MAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer. Would the minister exinterplain to the House how superannuation choice will be protected under the government's proposed workplace relations reforms?,88
160,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for MCPherson for her question. There is one simple fact-that is, under the coalition government millions of Australian workers can choose. They can choose where their own superannuation, their retirement nest egg, is invested. This is a policy that the Labor Party rejected and opposed for nine years. They objected to Australian workers having the right to choose a low-fee fund. Mr Snowdon interjecting",88
161,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Lingiari is warned!,88
162,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Labor Party objected to workers of Australia having the right to choose a high return on their fund, a fund that provides good service. These are the things that the Labor Party said that the Australian workers were not entitled to have. In an article in today's Age newspaper, it was suggested that when employees negotiate an AWA with their employer they will lose their superannuation choice rights. This is simply wrong. Workers on AWAs retain the right to negotiate superannuation matters with their employers. Effective choice is made at the time of negotiation. There is no removal of this right. Under the new IR proposals, workers' rights will be protected. They will have the same rights as they have now. There are many on the other side who have objected to this, and there are those in the union movement who have objected to this. In the article today there are quotes Mr Garry Weaven. Mr Garry Weaven was the former Assistant Secretary of the ACTU. He is a heavyweight and a current superannuation executive and a former heavyweight in the union movement. He says the workers will be unable to claim unpaid superannuation contributions, as they will be unable to go to the Industrial Relations Commission. This, again, is wrong. The ATO is responsible for the enforcement of the payment of compulsory superannuation, which is the ALP's own legislation. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission inform me that they do not generally have the jurisdiction to recover the money; that is the ATO's responsibility. This protection will remain. The comments by the ALP and the comments by former union bosses reflect one thing-that is, Australian workers under an ALP government would not be given the right to choose a low-fee, high-return, high-service superannuation fund. That is what the coalition stands for, today and into the future. Government Advertising",88
163,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing, representing the Special Minister of State. Is the minister aware that section 328 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act clearly requires authorisation at the bottom of each page of newspaper advertisements that cover more than one page? Is the minister aware that the offence of publishing such an advertisement carries a penalty of $5,000? Minister, given that taxpayers are being forced by the government to pay for as which are clearly Liberal Party propaganda, doesn't that make this campaign corrupt and unlawful?",89
164,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No. NA Censure Motion,89
165,Mr BEAZLEY,HOWARD GOVERNMENT,"I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition moving forthwith: That this House censure the Howard Government for: (1) the corrupt use of taxpayers' funds on a Liberal Party advertising campaign for its extreme industrial relations changes; and (2) using those taxpayer funds to make fraudulent claims about the adverse impact these changes will have on Australian workers, their families, their living standards and their way of life. Those opposite obviously want to duck a full censure debate on this matter and, given that this is the first motion of censure to be moved in the area of industrial relations, it is of a piece with the cowardly opportunistic way they have behaved on this issue over the course of the last few months. I want to start by making one thing absolutely clear, because the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations decided that he would assume a set of opinions of mine: in the course of his remarks, he said that I was one of the proud supporters of the changes made to the industrial relations system during the period of the Hawke and Keating governments. I absolutely was, and I still am, and that was the right set of changes to produce the productivity gains which have driven",89
166,Mr TUCKEY,HOWARD GOVERNMENT,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It is my understanding that this is not a censure motion and that it is an argument as to why there should be a suspension of standing orders. It is therefore incumbent on the Leader of the Opposition to give his arguments as to why this debate is needed at this time.",90
167,The SPEAKER,HOWARD GOVERNMENT,The member for O'Connor will resume his seat.,90
168,Mr BEAZLEY,HOWARD GOVERNMENT,The changes that were put in place by the previous governmentand this is why we should have the opportunity to debate a censure motion here todaywere what has permitted the substantial growth in real wages and the opportunities that the Australian economy has developed over the last decade. We were responsible for that legacy. They have squandered it. In addition to the collective bargaining arrangements put in place by the Labor Party when in office,90
169,Mr TUCKEY,HOWARD GOVERNMENT,"Mr Speaker, I rise to repeat my point of order. It is very clear that the",90
170,The SPEAKER,HOWARD GOVERNMENT,"The member for O'Connor will resume his seat. Mr Randall-On the point of order, Mr Speaker: understanding order 86, I understand that you have not made a ruling.",90
171,The SPEAKER,HOWARD GOVERNMENT,"The member for Canning will resume his set. That is why I have not called the Leader of the Opposition. Before I call the Leader of the Opposition, I would remind him that he is moving a suspension of standing orders and he should speak to that motion.",90
172,Mr BEAZLEY,HOWARD GOVERNMENT,"The suspension of standing orders is to move a censure motion. In the course of the censure motion I intend to demonstrate that the position that we achieved when we were in office has allowed substantial growth in the Australian economy which this government has monstrously squandered by de-skilling the Australian population which, at the skilled end of the labour market, has created a crisis which is now threatening this nation's prosperity. That is the problem that threatens the future of our economy-not what is paid to unskilled, semi-skilled workers or what those workers earn to help them sustain the fiendish mortgages that they now are obliged to bear as they buy their houses. That is the point, Mr Speaker. When we were in office we supported the development of a modern industrial relations system. Insofar as industrial relations-as opposed to skills, as opposed to innovation by business-is a factor in productivity, the fact that we encouraged collective bargaining arrangements whereby workers and their employers sat down together and worked out productivity changes is what drove, from the industrial relations side, productivity growth. What is being proposed by our political opponents in the legislation for which we wish to censure them is nothing less than a return to 19th century industrial relations. That is the starting point of this debate: our view of a modern industrial relations system driving productivity growth along with increased investment in skills and innovation in business, and their view of going down the lowwage, cowed work force road. That is one of the reasons that we ought to discuss this particular motion of censure. The second is this position that the government is adopting whereby the as that we have now had a chance to see are classified as passing information to the Australian public is utterly and completely dishonest and completely corrupt. In effect, $100 million of taxpayers' funds are going to be spent on Liberal Party advertising, and the material contained in the as-as we have now seen-is utterly dishonest. So on the one hand we have the corruption of advertising and on other the other hand we have the distortion of facts-not the revelation of facts but the distortion of facts-being presented to the Australian public. This $100 million-and that is what it will be by the conclusion of this campaigncomes on top of $900 million that has already been spent over the last decade by this government. Can you imagine what $1 billion would do for the national security of this country? Can you imagine what $1 billion would do for our starved public hospitals? Can you imagine what $1 billion would do for our child-care system, where working class women pay Geelong Grammar rates for the care of their kids so that they can remain in or get into the work force? Can you imagine what $1 billion would do for water conservation and our environment? Can you imagine what $1 billion would do for roads and transport in this society? That $1 billion went into the back pockets of the Liberal Party organisers-straight out of the taxpayers' pockets and into their back pockets. Advertising put forward by the ACTU through voluntary contributions from ordinary little Australians all over the country up against this massive theft from the public purse by John Howard and his minions in this campaign. Ordinary little Australians are trying to put forward their answer to the grab for their influence and their ability in the work force to get the wages that they need before their bargaining position is permanently destroyed. Their little might is being put into that, and their taxpayers' dollars being ripped out by the government to cynically beat them down. This is a piece of chicanery by government which has been unsurpassed in this country. If a country in the region around us had been drawn to the attention of the IMF, and if the IMF operators went into that country and took a look at their practices, and if they found, among their practices, $1 billion being handed over to a political party for its advertising processes, guess what their first set of recommendations would be on the issues of governance: stop the corruption. That would be the first thing that would happen. The second goes to the advertisements themselves and the content of those advertisements. I cannot understand how the Prime Minister can stand in this place barefaced when he knows that the absolute essence of the changes he wants to put to place is to remove the no-disadvantage test, the last touching point that the ordinary Australian worker has in the ability to bargain with his employer and to keep the capacity to ensure that, if he has to work on ANZAC Day or on Christmas Day, he gets penalty rates. The last touching point is ripped away by this legislation. The Prime Minister has the hide to stand in this chamber and tell us that nothing has changed, when that is the very essence of his legislation. The very heart of his legislation is that the no-disadvantage test gets ripped away. It is a particular act of cowardice by this is Prime Minister and by the Leader of the House that I now have only 30 seconds left in which to reveal these facts in speaking to this motion. Their adoption of Labor Party policy on a committee to investigate their business regulation and how they have tied business up is no doubt a mechanism that is being used today to try to detract public attention from these very relevant issues. It is a are measure of their cover-up and their contempt for ordinary Australians that the Leader of the Opposition-a person who, for 13 years, served in governments that introduced essential reforms for the Australian people-and his colleagues should not be heard. It is outrageous. It is the ultimate abuse of this place that the censure motion is not being debated. There is only one way the parliament can deal with this, and that is to vote for this tion to suspend the standing orders. (Time expired)",90
173,The SPEAKER,HOWARD GOVERNMENT,Is the motion seconded? Mr Stephen Smith-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,92
174,Mr ABBOTT,HOWARD GOVERNMENT,"In response to the Leader of the Opposition's rather windy contribution today-one that seemed singularly unsupported by any barracking from his own side-let me say that there may have been a technical breach in the sense that the authorisation should have appeared at the bottom of every page. The fact is that there was no doubt whatsoever who was responsible for this advertising. At the head of the first page and at the base of the final page are large crests, with the words ‘Australian Government' written nearby and, on the final page, there are also the words ‘Authorised by the Australian Government, Capital Hill, Canberra ACT'. Here we have perfectly legitimate information being given to the Australian people on a very important part of government policy, and it is perfectly reasonable for the government to provide this information. If we did not provide it, there would be all sorts of complaints from members opposite that we were keeping people in the dark. Yes, there may have been a technical breach of the act, but the Minister for Finance and Administration has instructed officials to ensure that there are no such technical mistakes in the future. Members opposite are waxing lyrical. They are waxing self-righteous and indignant about what is, at most, a possible technical breach of section 328 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. Why would they be so concerned about this? I have in my hands an advertisement by the member for Griffith, Kevin Rudd, which is equally in breach of mosection 328 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. I have another advertisement here from Kevin Rudd, on a separate occasion, also in technical breach of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. I have an ad here from the member for Denison, Duncan Kerr SC, which was not authorised as required by section 328 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act; and I have an ad from Senator Jacinta Collins, which was not authorised as required by section 328Ms Gillard- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on an argument advanced by the government during the Leader of the Opposition's speech-this is a suspension motion. The Leader of the House should confine himself to reasons why the censure motion should not take precedence over the other business of the House. If he wanted to take the censure motion and make a substantive speech, he should have sought leave.",92
175,The SPEAKER,HOWARD GOVERNMENT,"I will call the Leader of the House and I am sure he will respond, but I remind all members that the Leader of the Opposition was given a fairly wide-ranging opportunity in his remarks.",92
176,Mr ABBOTT,HOWARD GOVERNMENT,"The reason the current debate on the suspension motion is more than adequate treatment of this matter is that the case advanced by the Leader of the Opposition was so flimsy, and the matter in question now is so transparently technical at best. But I will continue, and I will table this for the benefit of the member for Denison and others. The member for Lyons put out advertisements in previous elections without authorisation, which was also clearly in breach of section 328 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. I have here an ad from the Greens. Again, there was no authorisation, which is clearly in breach of section 328 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. I have here an advertisement from the member for New England. There is no authorisation, as is required by section 328 of the act. I table all these tisements by various non-government members of parliament, which are plainly in breach of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. I make the point that many people in this House have made technical breaches. We have a substantive breach only when you see an advertisement which is purporting to be from someone other than the person really putting it out. We had the Leader of the Opposition huffing and puffing about government advertising being in some way theft from the public purse. It is true that this government over the course of its life has spent some $100 million a year on government advertising.",92
177,Mr BEAZLEY,HOWARD GOVERNMENT,This is utterly deceitful!,93
178,The SPEAKER,HOWARD GOVERNMENT,Order!,93
179,Mr ABBOTT,HOWARD GOVERNMENT,The former Labor government spent at least $100 million a year in each of its last two years on government advertising. Mr Jenkins-That is not true.,93
180,Mr ABBOTT,HOWARD GOVERNMENT,"In current value terms, that is precisely what they spent. Every year the state Labor governments spend something in the order of $400 million on government advertising. If there is something wrong with this government's advertising, if this government's advertising is theft from the public purse, why wasn't the former Labor government's advertising theft from the public purse and why aren't the current state Labor governments' massive advertising campaigns also theft from the public purse? The fact is that this government's advertising is perfectly valid and perfectly legitimate. It is a perfectly necessary way of bringing the Australian people into the new industrial relations era. It is a perfectly reasonable way for the Australian government to put out reasonable factual information to counter the constant hysteria and the farrago of lies that adverwe are repeatedly getting from members opposite. Let us be very clear what we are really seeing from members opposite. We are seeing from the Leader of the Opposition a recrudescence of the class war, which I thought had gone out with decent leaders of the Labor Party, such as the former Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, assisted in those days by the former Treasurer, Paul Keating. They knew that there was no future in the class war. What we see today is the Leader of the Opposition re-declaring the class war, not only to the disadvantage of the Australian people but to his own political disadvantage. Ms Gillard-I rise on the same point of order that I made before: the Leader of the House should be confining his arguments to why the censure motion should not take precedence over the other business of the House. He is lost in a time tunnel-he is somewhere back in the 1980s.",93
181,The SPEAKER,HOWARD GOVERNMENT,"The Leader of the House, I am sure, will come back to the issue. But as I said before, the Leader of the Opposition did have the opportunity to speak in a wide-ranging debate.",93
182,Mr ABBOTT,HOWARD GOVERNMENT,"Mr Speaker, I am-as you are only too well aware and have just stated-dealing with this in exactly the same manner that the Leader of the Opposition dealt with it. Mark Latham was right. I do think that in many respects it was a vile book, but I have got to say that on his judgments about the Leader of the Opposition, if not necessarily the factual statements he made about the Leader of the Opposition, he was dead right: weak, gutless. Ms Gillard-Now we are well beyond anything that could be in order in terms of arguing for a suspension of standing orders for a censure motion about government practices in terms of paying for industrial relations advertising.",93
183,The SPEAKER,HOWARD GOVERNMENT,"The Manager of Opposition Business will resume her seat. As I have said, the Leader of the Opposition did give a wide-ranging speech in this debate. Nonetheless, I am sure that the Leader of the House will refer to the motion before the chair as well as having that same latitude.",94
184,Mr BEAZLEY,HOWARD GOVERNMENT,"Mr Speaker, I will not be called ‘gutless' by a coward who would not resign when cabinet traduced his solemn promise to the electorate in the last election. He did not have the guts to resign. He is in no position to call anyone ‘gutless' in this place.",94
185,The SPEAKER,HOWARD GOVERNMENT,Is the Leader of the Opposition asking for that to be withdrawn?,94
186,Mr BEAZLEY,HOWARD GOVERNMENT,I am.,94
187,The SPEAKER,HOWARD GOVERNMENT,The Leader of the House will withdraw that statement.,94
188,Mr ABBOTT,HOWARD GOVERNMENT,I am happy to withdraw and I similarly require a withdrawal from the Leader of the Opposition-at the dispatch box.,94
189,The SPEAKER,HOWARD GOVERNMENT,The Leader of the Opposition will withdraw.,94
190,Mr BEAZLEY,HOWARD GOVERNMENT,"If he has been offended by anything I have had to say, I withdraw.",94
191,Mr ABBOTT,HOWARD GOVERNMENT,"Let me simply say: these are very good workplace relations proposals that the government has put forward. They are great changes that are going to build on the great work of the last 9½ years. What the last 9½ years have meant is more jobs, higher pay and fewer strikes-(Time expired)",94
192,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,HOWARD GOVERNMENT,"This is a suspension motion to enable the House to censure the Howard government for the corrupt use of taxpayers' funds on a Liberal Party advertising campaign for its extreme industrial relations changes and using those taxpayers' funds to make fraudulent claims about the adverse impact these changes will have on Australian workers, their families, their living standards and their way of life. Standing orders need to be suspended because this is a scandal of the highest order. This is a corruption of the political process. This is a Liberal Party advertising campaign at taxpayers' expense. This is the perpetration of a fraud on the taxpayers at taxpayers' expense, seeking to mislead the public into believing that their conditions, their salaries and their entitlements will be protected by the law which the government will change, when the effect of that law will be to enable the Australian working community to have their salaries and wages reduced and their conditions and their entitlements ripped off them. This is the government putting Liberal Party advertisements to air at taxpayers' expense to pretend that somehow these changes are good for them, when the effect of these changes will be to reduce their living standards and to reduce their quality of life and their lifestyle. Let us be crystal clear about this-there is nothing scientific about this: this is a Liberal Party Secretariat-conceived and implemented campaign at taxpayers' expense. The giant vacuum cleaner has gone out to the Treasury and the Mint to benefit the Liberal Party to run a political campaign for a government that will do, say, use or abuse anything or anyone to get itself re-elected. This is perpetrating a fraudMr Abbott- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It is a similar point of order to that taken by the Manager of Opposition Business. This is a speech on a censure motion. It is not a speech directed strictly to the motion to suspend standing orders ",94
193,The SPEAKER,HOWARD GOVERNMENT,Order! The Leader of the House will resume his seat. In calling the member for Perth I would remind him of the motion before the chair.,94
194,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,HOWARD GOVERNMENT,"The motion before the chair is a motion to suspend standing orders to enable the government to be censured for the corrupt use of taxpayers' funds and for making fraudulent claims to the Australian public, and my remarks are directed to that. We know that the cost of the advertisements on Sunday night for a mere seven hours was $1.7 million-the equivalent of a year's worth of the annual salaries of 68 Australians on the minimum wage; a year's worth of the annual salaries of over 50 registered nurses; tank refills for over 106,000 motorists, absorbing the average increase in petrol since 1 January; over 100,000 average monthly mortgage payments; and over 57,000 bulk-billed GP consultations. This is a fraud. The Prime Minister insists on saying that ANZAC Day and other public holidays will be protected by law. Here is the fraud. The government's advertisement says that the entitlements of public holidays, rest breaks, incentive based payments, annual leave loadings, allowances, penalty rates and shift allowances are ‘protected by law'. If you read the fine print in the advertisement, the law actually enables these things to be removed: If these entitlements aren't mentioned in the new agreement, the award provisions will continue to operate. A ... Collective Agreement or AWA ... need simply set out how the new agreement will either change or remove these matters in that agreement. which we saw in numerous examples of AWAs recently-none of it underpinned by the no-disadvantage test which is supposed to protect entitlements. The Leader of the House, in his remarks, spoke about theft. That reminded me of Professor Eric Edwards, who lectured me in criminal law at the University of Western Australia. He once said, ‘What is a five-letter word beginning with ‘T' to describe the felonious act of larceny? He said it was ‘theft'. So, just to remind myself, for old law school's sake, I checked ‘larceny' in the thesaurus: Definition: theft Synonyms: burglary, crime, lift, misappropriation, pilfering, pinch, purloining, robbery, steal, stealing, thievery, thieving, touch ... break-in, caper ... filching, heist ... pilferage, prowl ... sting ... ... fraud ... skimming ... cheat, con ... racket ... swindle ... fleece ... grab, heist ... holdup, hustle ... looting, mugging ... plunder ... rip-off ... snatch, snitch ... stickup ... swindling, swiping .. vandalism This is a scandal of the highest order, a corruption of the democratic process, a corruption of the political process, a fraud perpetrated on the Australian public by a gang of burglars seeking to pretend to them that workers' salaries and wages and conditions will be protected by the law, when the extreme changes the government is making to the law will enable workers to be ripped off and their living standards reduced.

195,Mr HOWARD,NOES,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Tabling of Documents and Reports in the House  question to you concerns your role in protecting all members and in facilitating their work as members of this House. In particular, I draw your attention to the list of documents and reports to be tabled in the House. Current arrangements provide that opposition members in the House have later advice than that available to senators. In the Senate, the Senate red contains a list of proposed documents and reports to be tabled. This advice is also available overnight on the Senate webpage. Currently, no embargoed copies of reports from the statutory office holders who report to the parliament, such as the Auditor-General and the Ombudsman, or from the departments of state or instrumentalities are available prior to their tabling in the House. Again, Senate practice provides for appropriate people, including the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate or relevant shadow ministers, to receive an embargoed copy at least two hours before tabling. That is not the case in the House, where the opposition is required, sight unseen, to indicate which reports and papers should be extracted from the list to be tabled. To make this process meaningful, it is essential that advanced copies of these reports and papers be made available to the opposition, as was the past practice and then prevailing courtesy. Mr Speaker, will you undertake to review these arrangements, which essentially are controlled from the Table Office, and ensure that timely advice and procedures operate so that members are not at a disadvantage compared to their Senate counterparts?",96
196,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I thank the Chief Opposition Whip. I will certainly make some inquiries into his requests.

I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",98
212,Mr BURKE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr Speaker, we have had presented and tabled in this parliament the most damning report you will find into the behaviour of a government department, yet no-one in this room or in the Senate chamber is responsible! In answer to the question, ‘What do you have to do to be responsible?' the Prime Minister, on the Neil Mitchell program, said: Well I think a Minister is responsible where she has direct personal responsibility. There thousands of people in the Immigration Department. It cannot get to the stage where a minister actually has to be serving on the front counter in a departmental office before taking some responsibility. The seriousness of the issues could not be greater. We are talking about Australian residents being locked up unlawfully. We are talking about an Australian citizen having been deported unlawfully. We are talking about the appalling treatment of children and the appalling treatment of detainees, yet this government wants to say, ‘Well, nobody here has a direct responsibility.' The level of dodging responsibility went to new lengths today. While we were all in here during question time today, AAP published the latest doorstop done by the Attorney-General. In that interview the Attorney-General took to new lengths-beyond those heard from any of the ministers when they have been dodging responsibility rethese reports-the complete dodging of of the findings of both the Palmer report and the Comrie report. Up until now, the Prime Minister has said that the findings and contents of the Comrie report are accepted in full. Minister Vanstone, up until now, has said that those findings are accepted in full. Yet the reports, the complete works of those two inquiries-the Palmer report and the Comrie report, which make such an effort to make clear what the culture of the immigration department has become-then get this total denial from the Attorney-General, published on AAP at 2.51 pm today: In other words, there was an expectation that certain inquiries would be made-they weren't. I would have had an expectation, if I'd been minister at the time, that the procedures should have been followed. To suggest that there was some culture that are people were encouraged to cover up mistakes or to act unlawfully would be quite false and quite an unsafe assumption to make. Let me read that last sentence again: To suggest that there was some culture that people were encouraged to cover up mistakes or to act unlawfully would be quite false and quite an unsafe assumption to make. Yet, when the Comrie report, which this government allegedly accepts, gets to the section on cover-up, it says: The most disturbing feature of the culture is that senior officers in DIMIA who became aware that an Australian citizen had been unlawfully removedwhile the Attorney-General was minister, mind youfailed to take any action to redress the situation. Also of serious concern is the fact ful removal of Vivian was a matter of considerable discussion in the Brisbane Compliance and Investigations Office in 2004, yet no one there took any action. And what is the heading that that is published under? ‘DIMIA culture'. The cover-up is a direct part of the culture in that department, and yet today the Attorney-General wants to walk away from the issue of that culture existing at all. The Attorney-General wants to deny that there is a culture of coverup. How can you fix the culture if you do not even acknowledge that it is there? How can the government claim to have any hope of actually fixing the culture in the department of immigration if, to this day, the man who was minister for immigration on the very day Vivian was deported and who was minister when it was discovered that an Australian citizen had been deported wants to deny that a culture of cover-up exists at all? That culture of assumption and denial has continued ever since the Palmer report was brought down. One of the most tragic examples of the culture of assumption and denial-the culture that needs to be changed and that the government reckon they agree needs to be changed, even though the most senior legal officer in the government, the most senior legal officer in Australia, now denies that that cultural problem is there at all-came subsequent to the Palmer report, and that is the comments made by Senator Vanstone on the release of the Hwang children. Ian and Janey Hwang, 11 years of age and five years of age, were going to school at Stanmore Public School. It was the school those children had attended ever since they were in kindergarten. They were taken, removed, stolen, kidnapped-whatever description you want to use-and suddenly found themselves inside Villawood detention centre after DIMIA officials arrived and took them away from their classrooms in front of that the unlawthe other children. On the day that they were released, how did Senator Vanstone deal with the fact that these two children were locked up for four months? They were denied access to schooling for four months and, during that time, because he was denied access to school when other children at Villawood went to school, Ian-an 11-year-old-witnessed three attempted suicides inside Villawood detention centre. And what did Senator Vanstone say on their release? She said: The advice I have is that the children were taken to the facility at the request of the mother, but not themselves technically detained. And that's perfectly understandable-a mother's detained, she's entitled to ask for her children to be brought to her. Senator Vanstone ran that argument all day on the day of the release of the Hwang children and made sure that that was the argument that got up in the evening news programs. Only after the evening news programs had all run their course did she come out and acknowledge that, in fact, they were not unlawful noncitizens and they had been detained in error. They were not being detained at the request of their mother. Does this government have any concept of the way in which human lives are being wrecked by the culture within the department of immigration? Does this government have any idea what it means to an Australian citizen not only to be deported but then, having been deported, to receive an apology from the Prime Minister and the minister for immigration but to still find herself in the ippines, in a wheelchair, while the minister for immigration makes jokes that she is ‘still standing'? You could not find a more callous way of continuing to send the dehumanising message that a certain sector of this community just are not worth having. You could not find a way of doing that more loudly or more clearly than Senator Vanstone did when she decided to make an ‘I'm still standing' joke on the day the report came down about the appalling treatment of a woman still in a wheelchair and still stuck in the Philippines. There is a trail of human wreckage that goes beyond and stays behind the way these individuals have been treated. And it is not just the ones who have been named and who have had the media focus. This government continues to insist on the ridiculous outsourcing of its detention centre operations, in a situation where it has no economic case and absolutely no human or moral case. There cannot be an economic case when at the same time the number of detainees has fallen the cost to the taxpayer has gone up. And there certainly cannot be any sort of human case when you look at the treatment of five detainees when they were transported from Maribyrnong to Baxter detention centre, as described in the Hamburger report. Five detainees had to be transported by a private operator from one detention centre to another. They did not put them in an air conditioned bus; they put them in the back of a van with no light and no air conditioning as they drove through the desert. They spent 6½ hours with no light, no air conditioning, no food, no water and no access to their medication. When they asked, ‘What if we need to go to the toilet?' they were told, ‘You go where you sit.' The minister's response when she received the Hamburger report was: firstly, make sure you release it at quarter to five on Phila Friday afternoon so you do not get a news cycle; and, secondly, announce that you will renegotiate the contract with GSL. Labor says: terminate the contract. Labor says that it never should have been put in private hands in the first place, and we do not want to see people treated that way on Australian soil. When the minister said she would renegotiate the contract, Labor asked her in the Senate, ‘Will you guarantee that you won't form a contract where GSL actually ends up with a more lucrative deal as a result of the renegotiation?' No guarantee came from the minister. Does anyone think for a minute that that sort of behaviour, if disapproved of, would not result in the termination of the contract? That is exactly what should happen. It is exactly what is open to the government and yet they continue to retain this cosy relationship with GSL while detainees are being treated in the most appalling ways. Yes, many of them probably should not have tried to come to Australia unlawfully. Some of them were in desperate situations and no doubt some were not. But I do not think the way they are treated and the number of years they find themselves in detention is justified punishment for someone whose crime at the end of the day is to say, ‘I want to be an Australian.' The incompetence and mismanagement get worse. The incompetence is probably not any more appalling than in what Senator Vanstone's administration of immigration has done to our reputation in attracting overseas students. Since May 2001, the immigration department has been sending the wrong letter when cancelling student visas. There are now 8,000 students, mostly throughout Asia, whom the department is now trying to contact to say: ‘When we terminated your visa between May 2001 and August 2005, we got it wrong. Sorry about that. We know it might have mucked up your life, but here's an invitation to come back and study in Australia.' And because these students cannot all be contacted by post, advertisements are going up and stories are running in the South East Asian press about the way this government treats its overseas students. But the government wants to stand up here and boast, ‘We're out there and this is a great export industry through education.' In so many ways the weak link of this government-apart from education, skills and a whole series of things-is their incompetence when it comes to the department of immigration. No promise has been more outrageously broken by this government in handling immigration than the promise of 2001, which turned out to be seen in glowing lights as patently false. The Prime Minister said, and we all heard it: ... we will decide who comes into this country the circumstances in which they come. We have now ended up with a situation where, face facts, it appears that what the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs said yesterday is the truth-and I reckon that is probably right. Since 2001 the department of immigration has been doing exactly what the government wants it to do. I reckon that is the right call. I reckon the minister sitting opposite told the exact truth yesterday, and no doubt was reprimanded for it overnight. Since 2001 the department has been doing exactly what the government wants it to do. But if you believe the arguments of the Prime Minister, the minister for immigration and the Attorney-General, they have not had a clue about what is going on in the department of immigration. The department is off there doing its own thing; it has nothing to do with the government ministers-they do not have a clue. If this government has no idea whom it is kicking out of the country or whom it is processing to come into this country, then the government has no idea when it comes to that promise, which was the most critical promise of the 2001 election. The department of immigration will not get cultural change while the people at the helm-the chief law officer of this country, who denies the cultural problem, and the minister, Senator Vanstone, who blames the victim with the treatment of the Hwang children and makes jokes on the day that a report comes down about the treatment of an Australian citizen-are at the cabinet table.

213,Mr JOHN COBB,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Parkes-Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs) (4.04 pm)-The member for Watson is certainly better with his prose than he is with his facts. His reference to my comments yesterday was totally inaccurate. As he well knows, my comments about government policy related and to people smugglers-nothing more and nothing less. There is something I must make plain from the outset. The culture within the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, and that which the government expects of it, is to make lawful decisions balanced around due process. That is what happens. I will refer later to both the Palmer report and the Comrie report, but that is what the department tries to do and that is certainly what the government expects of it. In making decisions about immigration, visas, those who overstay them and those who come here unlawfully, the department very closely examines the details of every case. If warranted, some aspects of those cases can be referred to the Ombudsman and sometimes are. Actions and decisions that the department take do come under intense and frequent scrutiny. Within the department there are very long and taxing processes to make decisions regarding the overstaying of visas and whether or not somebody is in Australia legally and whether they can remain. The department's decisions are then overseen by the Migration Review Tribunal, which people can appeal to. Also, people have the opportunity to appeal to the Refugee Review Tribunal-and that they do. The Refugee Review Tribunal interviews them or gives them the opportunity to be interviewed, which people do not always take. Obviously, the department are very conscious of the fact that their every decision can be overseen by both the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal, if a person chooses to go down that route. Failing all that, the department are then subject to decisions that are made by the Australian judicial system-the Federal Court and the High Court. Those avenues are open to people in Australia whose visas have expired and who are found to be here unlawfully or potentially unlawfully. At the end of that process, there is a 417. This is an opporpeople-handling tunity for the same people to appeal directly to the minister. The minister has the powerbut it is not compellable-to intervene over and beyond what the department have done if there is a humanitarian issue or if, in her wisdom, she thinks that the same person is a refugee by definition. The department have to take into account that Australia is party UN conventions. All those issues have to be taken into account. It is a very thorough and a very taxing process. The government are not afraid to admit that mistakes exist, of course they do. I will talk later about why they occur-but I wonder whether members opposite have the slightest idea about the number and frequency of movements that occur in and out of Australia in any one year. The government are looking to remedy those mistakes, as demonstrated in their response to the Palmer inquiry. Both the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Vanstone, and the Prime Minister have referred to the very intense way in which we are responding to the Palmer report. While we do not accept every part of the Palmer report as being correct, we do accept the balance of it. We are spending $230 million over the next five years to put in train some policy changes to deal with some of the issues on the way clients are treated personally. What is probably over and above the biggest issue of them all is the establishment of a college whereby around 250 new employees of the department will be trained each year and around 300 existing employees of the department will do refresher courses each year. They will include not only people in key decision-making positions but also those involved in handling issues face to face with people. We have to remember that the department of immigration, in particular, is a business. It is a people business; we accept that. We accept that in some ways the Palmer report pointed to flaws in that system, and we are seeking to remedy them. Mr Deputy Speaker, how many movements do you think the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous to Affairs administers a year? Do you think it could be a million movements a year? No. Do you think it could be five million a year? No, it is not five million a year. It is not 10 million a year. In any one year, the department is monitoring and dealing with over 20 million movements in and out of Australia. Australia runs what is probably recognised as the best migration and multicultural program anywhere in the world. Just to give you an idea of how complex it is, of the approximately 20 million movements every year, over 130,000 are migrants coming to Australia and, of those, about 80,000 are skilled migrants and 40,000 are family migrants. About another 13,000 come here under the humanitarian refugee program, of which 6,000 are chosen by the United Nations Commissioner for Refugees. About half of our refugees come here that way and the other half tend to be relatives of the same people. It is a program that is recognised internationally. People come from Europe and all around the world to look at our migration program-and they have done that very recently in coming to visit me-to find out how our multicultural program works. This program is all administered by that same department. Very few countries have a multicultural program. As I said, around 13,000 refugees will be settled in Australia this year. It will probably be the first time in their that they will have an opportunity to feel safe, secure and in a country that wants them. Over 3½ million tourists will visit Australia to enjoy our country and then return home. Other visas categories-that the same department we are talking about deals withthat return a direct benefit to Australia and that are part of the 20 million movements include short-term business visas, which bring expertise or investment. This category includes skilled migrants, who add diversity and expertise, and sporting teams and officials, who provide elite level sporting events in the country. Other categories, movements or visas that provide a personal benefit to many Australians include visitor visas for families to come and visit their family members and reunion migration programs to reunite families who, as I said, have quite often come here under the refugee program. I would like to go through in a little more detail the 20 million movements I have referred to. Obviously the opposition spokesman has not the faintest idea of what the department actually does. In 2004-05, a total of 10,376,800 people arrived in Australia. That comprised 123,424 settlers-people migrating; over 200,000 people visiting Australia for more than a year; and nearly 5½ million short-term visitors-mainly tourists. It also included 100,000 Australians returning to Australia after spending more than a year overseas. In 2004-05, 4½ million Australians returned to Australia after a short visit and a total of 10,298,000 people left Australia. That included more than 62,000 Australians leaving permanently, more than 91,000 leaving for more than a year, 4½ million going overseas, more than 94,000 visitors leaving after spending more than a year in Australia and 5½ million short-term visitors departing lives Australia. That is well over 20 million movements. We need to look at this in the context of the minute number of those 20 million movements that can create a problem. By and large, the department has a way of doing business which is legal and which does follow due process, and that is exactly what the government expects of it. However, we accept the main issues in both the Palmer report and the Comrie report and we are dealing with them. There are 20 million movements, and a tiny proportion of those people breach their visa conditions and need to be located and/or detained. We have a migration program that is nondiscriminatory and delivers benefits to individual people and to Australia as a whole. It is the envy of countries around the world; they come here to look at it. We have accepted what the minister has gone through, and I am not detracting from anything in either the Comrie report or the Palmer report, but I think we need to look at what this department does. As I said, there are over 20 million movements-and I have just gone through how complex and varied they arebut, at the same time, having a successful migration and multicultural program means that we have to have the detention and removal of unlawful noncitizens. That is an essential part of the successful management of an orderly migration program. Just remember that, in that figure, more than 130,000 people will come to Australia this year as migrants of one form or another or as refugees. We need to remember that Labor introduced mandatory detention in 1991. Continued public support for our migration program-which is obviously there-relies utterly on our capacity to successfully manage it. The detention and removal of unlawful noncitizens is absolutely essential for the running of a good migration program-and people from Europe and all around the world come to see how we manage our migration program. Members opposite have raised some examples of where the department's actions have been questioned. They are very isolated examples and, although we obviously take them very seriously, it is a very tiny number in the context of the 20.6 million movements in and out of Australia every year. While the Comrie report dealt with an issue which we all regret, it is just one issue in 20.6 million movements. Compliance with our immigration policies is only a small part of the department's activities. Compliance plays an important role in the programs delivered by the department, but the immigration department does a lot more than just manage movements in and out of the country. It does migrant settlement services-it has contracts with the providers of those services and oversees those services. It does refugee support and settlement programs, including language training, orientation, job skills and education. They are flexible programs and, as much as possible, we try to get absolute professionals to do the individual settlement programs within them. The department administers and manages important programs both in and out of Australia and settles new arrivals. The opposition spokesman raised some issues about GSL, the managers of Australia's detention centres. He mentioned an incident in which five people were in a vehicle for seven hours. We looked at that and accepted the basis of it, but that is costing GSL half a million dollars in sanctions. (Time expired)",101
214,Dr LAWRENCE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is a pity that the minister responsible did not give us a better explanation of why the transport of people in such extraordinary circumstances was not given greater attention at the time it occurred. Indeed, as with all these things, it is very clear that, in most cases, the incidents only become the subject of an investigation following reports from members of the public or following Senate estimates committees-in fact, anyone but the government-drawing attention to these matters. After a sustained public outcry about this policy, we now have on the public record two damning reports of systemic breaches of decent human standards-and I think that needs to be understood. That is what it is all about. The Comrie report and the Palmer report are not talking about single isolated incidents; they are talking about systemic problems-and they are the most scathing indictments of government administration imaginable. I am sure that most members of the House would never have read anything like it. There were many warnings of the meltdown that was going on in DIMIA. This did not arrive out of a clear blue sky. Indeed, it was the direct result and inevitable outcome of government policy. Minister Cobb belled the cat yesterday when he said in question time: … this department, since 2001, have done the job that the government asked them to do … Yes, indeed, Minister, that is precisely what they have been doing. Let us not forget that, between these two reports, there were plenty of other warning signs. We have heard about the second Hamburger report, which inquired into the terrible Baxter-Maribyrnong transport incident so eloquently described by the member for Watson. Long before all these 2005 reports there was the little publicised but very important first Hamburger report, which inquired into the Port Hedland riot in December 2003. Despite requests, that report has never been released to the public. Some of the findings of the first Hamburger report have since been communicated to me by the Commissioner of Corruption and Crime in Western Australia. They include a finding that ACM officers used excessive force against detainees. Yet we have heard nothing from DIMIA and nothing from the minister, and the report remains secret. But there was a warning, if you needed one, that all was not well. In Palmer's words, there is denial, self-justification, deep-seated cultural and attitudinal problems and a culture largely unwilling to engage in genuine self-criticism or analysis. These are not isolated incidents. So now, in a desperate defence of the minister for immigration, the Prime Minister is running a line that goes something like this: ‘How can the minister be responsible for problems of which she was not even aware? The minister can only be judged by how she fixes the problems.' Extraordinary. The minister runs those lines herself. This particular line might be seen as a cunning ruse, because the government and the minister for immigration are trying to pretend that the Cornelia Rau and the Vivian Solon debacles are the first indications they ever had of anything amiss in the department, the first indications of a rotten, incompetent departmental culture. But this is not true, and anyone with an interest in the myriad immigration department cock-ups-someone, for example, like the minister, you might think-would know that things have been fundamentally rotten for some time. There were plenty of people who knew it was rotten and who campaigned and complained for years on end about what had happened to a once respected department. HREOC and the Auditor-General, amongst others, to name just two, drew attention to serious deficiencies in policy and delivery. People wrote, faxed, rang, emailed, organised rallies and visited detainees and helped them recover from the trauma of incarceration. They signed petitions, badgered members of parliament and, yes, told the ministers what was going on. They were abused for their trouble. There were plenty of people who mourned, for example, the death of Fatima Erfani, who died following a cerebral incident, and following clearly inadequate medical care, on Christmas Island-a death which has never been properly investigated. That should have been a warning sign. What the government cannot escape is that the culture within the department is clearly the government's policy and culture. A former DIMIA employee indicated that he was not surprised at what had happened but that the department ‘was not always the hard bitten agent of the politics of race that the Palmer report implies'. He says he witnessed the beginnings of its transformation in 1996-forget this 1992 story-and knows that, had the political intent been otherwise, the department would have been a very different organisation. The day after the government was elected, remember, the secretary of the department, Chris Conybeare, was sacked-a clear indication that things were about to change and to change radically. An increasing number of negative stories and statements about immigration and refugees were sourced from the minister's office, and they became a torrent. Mr Comrie's report makes it abundantly clear that DIMIA staff were increasingly fearful of appearing to take any account of the welfare of the people about whom they were making life and death decisions, lest they be seen as resisting government intentions. They simply shut up. As one commentator put it: A careful reading of the Comrie report … leads to the conclusion that these public servants were implementing John Howard's policies. It is difficult to form any conclusion other than that the culture of DIMIA was so motivated by imperatives associated with the removal of unlawful non-citizens that officers simply failed to take into account the basic human rights obligations that characterise a democratic society. The government placed these people in a brutalising environment and then approved of their actions-be in no doubt about that. And of course the current minister did know, as did the previous minister. The minister ought to take responsibility, as should the previous minister. I wrote to the minister in July 2004-I am sure I was not alone-about the Port Hedland riots, in which detainees, including women, were beaten. I asked for further information and a copy of the Hamburger report. Those requests were refused, but the minister did reply to me in August 2004. She said: I wish to advise that my department has accepted all the investigator's recommendationswhatever they werein relation to working with the new detention services provider to ensure that best practice is followed in the future. That was on 13 August 2004. The family of Cornelia Rau reported Ms Rau missing on 11 August 2004. Barely a month later, on 17 September 2004, the Maribyrnong-Baxter transport fiasco occurred, in which people were subjected to disgusting treatment by this very same detention service providerthe same detention service provider that then apparently attempted a cover-up and the same detention service provider that subcontracted mental health care to an outfit whose psychologists were not even registered to practise, in contravention of South Australian law. When this was raised, the government denied it was so, although today I have to say I received a response to a question in writing which makes it clear that I was corjust rect. This is denial, self-justification and a culture largely unwilling to engage in genuine self-criticism and analysis. This minister has known about the endemic rot within the department for a long time. As I said, in August 2004 this minister committed herself and her department to ‘ensuring best practice'. What followed instead was debacle upon debacle, denial after denial-Australians deported, Australians incarcerated and refugees beaten and mistreated. And then what happens? The minister goes home, pulls out her favourite Elton John CD, smiles and plays ‘I'm Still Standing'. All that matters, it would seem, is the minister's sad and now very tawdry survival. The Prime Minister has previously said, in a separate but relevant context: The Minister should not seek to cling to office with the miserable excuse that, ‘Oh, it wasn't my fault, it was my idea and while it is going well I will take all the credit for it but as soon as it starts to go wrong it is someone else's fault'. That explanation is not only in breach of the Westminster tradition, but also at the bar of public opinion in this Parliament it simply will not wash. It did not in 1988, when the Prime Minister said that, and it does not now. He went on to say: Let nobody be in any doubt that the Prime Minister of this country holds enormous power … One of the great duties and responsibilities that it carries is that at all times, without exception, the Prime Minister of this country must put duty above mateship. It is time, Prime Minister, for you to do that. The time has indeed long passed for showing that sense of duty and responsibility. The Australian people deserve responsible ministers and responsible government, but is the Prime Minister going to honour that statement of principles? I certainly doubt it, because ministerial accountability is apparently now regarded by this government as a quaint, ancient relic of more naive times. Despite these damning reports, both the ministers responsible have refused to accept any responsibility at all, on the grounds that they did not know anything about the incidents investigated in the reports. This is a most bizarre reading of the principle of ministerial accountability. Middle level public servants will take the rap for what was obviously the consequence of a relentless government campaign to demonise and expel ‘unlawful noncitizens'. This is definitely the government's responsibility and it should take responsibility, and those ministers who presided over it should both resign.",104
215,Mr BAIRD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have been asked to speak today on the matter of public importance, and I have been very interested to listen to the comments of the member for Watson and the member for Fremantle. The member for Fremantle has long taken an interest in this issue. I respect her opinions on it, but in this particular case am sure that the member for Watson, whose family I know very well from my electorate, is beginning his climb for the leadership. What we are seeing in his exercise today is a mere frolic. We have seen all the outrage, the reading of the report and the concern, but we all know what the real agenda of the member for Watson is here. In terms of the issues that have been described, there can be no doubt that in the past I have been a critic of some of the things that have happened within the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. No-one can deny that there have been serious problems within the department of immigration. The case of Cornelia Rau and the case of Vivian Alvarez highlight the existence of issues and mishandling of matters within the department, especially when we see an Australian citizen held unlawfully in detention for a period of time and also the forced deportation of one of our citizens to the Philippines, to be discovered within a hospice in the Philippines. We are all concerned about that. That is why the Prime Minister said on 10 October: I am aware of the conclusions of the Comrie report and I am also aware of the comments made by the Ombudsman. Neither reflects well on the circumstances surrounding Ms Alvarez. I have already indicated, on behalf of the government, that she is owed an apology. She has received it and other matters are the subject of discussion between the government and her legal representatives. Let me say that, in the wake of the Palmer inquiry concerning Cornelia Rau, very, very significant changes have been made in the immigration department and there is an acknowledgment of the need for a changed attitude in relation to these things. There is a clear recognition on this side of the House that changes need to be made within the department. Those changes have been put in place. We have seen a start on a significant cultural shift in that department. I We have had the Mick Palmer report and the Neil Comrie report. We have also had HREOC reports of the administration within the department. These reports have not been flattering in terms of some of the administrative problems that have occurred. No-one is pretending that there is not an issue. But it is also true that significant changes have occurred. Changes have occurred in two significant ways. The first is a change in the most senior position in the department. Mr Bill Farmer has left; Andrew Metcalfe has taken the reins as head of the department. Andrew Metcalfe was personally involved in discussions that we had over changes to the immigration laws. Andrew Metcalfe, who is most experienced-a person who was in the immigration department-came and worked in the Prime Minister's area and has taken responsibility for that area. I was one of the people on the immigration committee who Andrew Metcalfe briefed on the changes in approach. He said that it was his intention to change the culture of the department. He said that there would be a spill of senior positions in the department. We have already seen that some senior people have gone. I can think of one or two cases where it was a good decision to move people out and get some fresh blood and some fresh ideas into the area. He outlined some of the initiatives that he had in mind for improvements in the department. All of the people in the department-some of whom had been quite critical in the past and whose names you would know-were impressed by Mr Metcalfe's approach, by his initiative and by the plans he had for a cultural shift within the department. We know that significant changes have occurred in immigration laws. I was involved in the discussions about those with the Prime Minister, and Mr Metcalfe was also involved in the discussions, bringing forward some very viable and workable solutions. As a result, we had four significant changes. Firstly, women and children will no longer be held in detention. All of us would very much approve of those changes. It is not appropriate that we have women and children in detention. That has changed. Secondly, time limits have been placed on the processing. That is an issue that I was particularly concerned about. The legislation now gives three months for the primary decision and three months for the RRT, following the example of the UK, where they have a two plus four rule-two months for primary decision processing and four months for review. The UK example is there as an objective. The Prime Minister has put this in the legislation as part of the immigration changes that have been brought forward. That is a very significant change. If we keep to that alone, we will have a significant change of culture, especially in the detention centres. Thirdly, any detainee held for longer than two years will have their case reviewed by the Ombudsman. We have seen some of the cases. At the start of this process, there were some 150-plus people who had been held in detention for longer than four years. Now every case where somebody has been held for longer than two years will be reviewed by the Ombudsman to determine the validity of the reason why the person has been held-whether it is on security grounds, on health grounds or on the grounds of a failure to establish that individual's identity. Again, that is a significant step forward. Fourthly, all TPV holders-temporary protection visa holders-will have their cases reviewed by the end of this month. It will not be done by calling the person in again and asking them to establish credentials for their application for asylum. Rather, it will be a paper process. Again, Mr Metcalfe was personally responsible for recommending that change-that people did not have to establish their credentials once more. It will only be in those cases where significant questions have been raised since they have been in Australia that they will need to establish their credentials again. What we have today are claims, on the basis of the reports that we have had, that there have been no changes in the culture of the department. That is clearly blatantly untrue. There have been significant changes in the senior administration of the department. The culture of the place is changing-there is no doubt. There have also been significant changes particularly with detention centres. There is an element of hypocrisy that occurs in the Labor Party with detention centres. It was not this side of the House that actually introduced the concept. ",107
216,Mr BAIRD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Chifley would know well that detention centres were introduced in 1992 by members of the previous Labor government. They all thought it was a terribly good idea at that time. They come in now saying it is time for cultural change. That was certainly not being said then. They say it is only a recent event that we have had a different culture applying. I can recall that in 1963 the department of immigration recruited from university some psychologists to help them with processing issues at that time. I was one of the psychologists recruited by Immigration. Ms Julie Bishop-Were you? No!,109
217,Mr BAIRD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I know the Minister for Ageing was not born at that time! They were concerned in 1963 about the culture within the department of immigration. So we have the member for Watson claiming this has all recently emerged as a new phenomenon. In fact, this is quite untrue. We have had lots of comments that, because of the number of human cases you are dealing with, this is an issue. Finally, to make the minister responsible for every processing issue of every individual passing through the immigration department is a big call. Anybody who is involved with immigration issues, even within their own office, knows that it is difficult to keep on top of all the various aspects of every case. Consider, as Minister Cobb has expressed, the processing of 20 million applications to the immigration department. When you have a few, which are of course serious-there is no-one denying that-then to make the minister responsible for every one of those issues, when she did not do anything to cause that to occur, is totally baseless.

The Department of Finance and Administraand the Royal Australian Mint propose to undertake a refurbishment of the Mint buildings in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory. The Mint is responsible for meeting the circulating coin and numismatic needs of Australia though a vision of excellence as a profitable world-class mint. Finance manages the Mint buildings, incorporating the process building and the administration building. The Mint buildings have not had any major upgrade works undertaken since they were built in 1965. The proposal is necessary to preserve the heritage values of the Mint buildings and make the best use of this Commonwealth asset. The cost of the refurbishment is approximately $41.2 million. Finance and the Mint are providing separate funding for the building owner base building works and tenant fit-out works relating to the process building. Internal fit-out of the administrative building will be undertaken by a future tenant. In its report, the Public Works Committee has recommended that this work proceed subject to the recommendations of the committee. Finance accepts and will implement these recommendations. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is planned to commence in July 2006 and be completed by February 2009. On behalf of the government, I thank the committee for its support.

IP Australia proposes to undertake the fitout, at an estimated cost of $12.95 million, of an extension to existing leased premises in Woden in the Australian Capital Territory. An additional $2 million has been allowed for work on the existing premises for workstation reconfigurations. IP Australia has occupied buildings in Woden since 1971, with the most recent tenancies being Discovery House, which was purpose-built for and occupied by IP Australia in 1997, and the adjacent Sirius Building To cater for recent expansion, a further shortterm lease has been taken at 10 Corinna Street, Woden. To meet the timetable of IP Australia, which is driven by the expiry of the current leases, the developer is required to commence construction on the base building in February next year. Subject to parliamentary approval, the proposed fit-out will be undertaken concurrently with the later stages of the base building construction. Both are due for completion in early September 2007.

The new chancery will be an efficient, modern, functional and secure building that will fully meet the needs of Australia's ongoing permanent mission in Cambodia. It will replace ageing accommodation that no longer meets functional or security requirements. The chancery will provide accommodation for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, the Australian Agency for International Development, the Department of Defence, and the Australian Federal Police. It will also accommodate a small Canadian embassy office, which is co-located with the Australian Embassy. The proposed new building will meet the requirements of the Building Code of Australia and will incorporate appropriate occupational health and safety standards. It will also provide additional space for agencies that are currently not being adequately met. The decision to build a new chancery on Australian government owned land in Phnom Penh rather than leasing a property for that purpose was taken because no suitable buildings are available for lease in the Phnom Penh property market. The present chancery building will be sold. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction would begin in September next year with practical completion and occupation scheduled for March or April 2008. I commend the motion to the Question agreed to. Public Works Committee Reference",112
229,Dr STONE,COMMITTEES,"Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration) (4.53 pm)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Proposed construction of a new chancery building for the Australian Embassy in Rangoon, Burma. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade proposes to construct a new purpose-built chancery building for the Australian Embassy in Rangoon, Burma, at an estimated cost of $12.87 million. The Australian government has leased the existing chancery since 1956. It no longer meets present-day requirements, including efficiency, security and building and workplace codes. No suitable buildings are available for lease in Rangoon. The Australian government owns a property in Rangoon that accommodates the Australian ambassador's residence, staff recreational facilities and maintenance workshops. This site is suitable for development to include a new chancery and updated facilities. The new purpose-built chancery will fully provide for the embassy's functional and security requirements into the future. The chancery will be tenanted by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, the Australian Agency for International Development-AusAID-and the Australian Federal Police. Subject to liamentary approval, construction would begin in September next year with practical completion and occupation scheduled for March 2008. I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to. NA AMENDMENT (2005 MEASURES No. 4) BILL 2005 Cognate bill: NA NA BILL 2005 Second Reading Debate resumed.  Deputy Speaker Jenkins, as you would be aware, when I was so rudely interrupted by question time there were some additional remarks that I wanted to make. I remind the House of what the second bill, the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2005, proposes. We all know that the Minister for Education, Science and Training has waged a tireless war in Australia, in every state and across every university campus, to have voluntary student unions abolished so as to get away from a compulsory fee and compulsory membership. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure this will come as a shock to you but this bill proposes that overseas students in these very same campuses be compelled to pay this compulsory fee. On the one hand, the government says that it is absolutely vital that there is some form of user-pays system on university campuses in respect of facilities for students-therefore, there should be no compulsion for Australian students; it is wrong and, if they have services, they must pay for them-but, on the other hand, the government finds no embarrassment whatsoever in parsaying that overseas students should compulsorily contribute to the cost of these services. The government charges every overseas student a fee for counselling services, advocacy services, health services, support services, catering services and sporting facilities but every coalition member's speech berates the opposition and says that, for Australian students, there should be no compulsory fee for all those services. It is an article of faith for the Liberal Party. The member for Bass said: ‘I disagree with what the government's doing. We should put in the legislation straight away.' He said, ‘This is a core Liberal principle,' yet he will vote for a bill which will entrench for overseas students the very proposition he wants to remove. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am very aware of your tough rulings in the past. I cannot find the degree of hypocrisy to characterise this behaviour. People are definitely being deceived by this behaviour. This is a massive act of hypocrisy on a scale I have not witnessed before and, I suspect, neither has anyone on this side. On the one hand, we are being berated about compulsory student unionism; on the other hand, the government is going to apply a compulsory fee to external students. I support the proposition that all students should contribute to these things. I have to place on the record that the Minister for Education, Science and Training has suffered a massive, painful, hurtful, debilitating humiliation by having to announce that his extreme attack on students for this year is over-he is postponing it to next year. You are probably going to jump to the conclusion that there is just not enough parliamentary time for this to be rammed through. Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, you know only too well that the Speaker, at the behest of the Leader of the House, actually cancelled a week of sittings. There is no historical precedent for it-none. I have asked. There is no historical precedent whatsoever. So, please, Mr Deputy Speaker, forbear with us and understand our frustration if the coalition members seek to argue that there is just not any parliamentary time left in this sitting year. It is a humiliayou tion. It is a backdown. The minister for education, in question time after question time, has been only too happy to give example after example. I keep on saying in this House: look no further than the University of Western Sydney. It has a terrific system. It does have private enterprise operating these facilities: uwsconnect. That is a company. It has directors. All the directors are required to be properly and appropriately trained, including the student directors of the company. The company provides all the services, other than advocacy and some health services, for the students. It does not seek to make a profit, but it is a company. There is accountability. There is auditing. There is transparency. And it is doing a terrific job, as I was saying in my earlier remarks. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition insisted on coming out and visiting one of the campuses to see for herself, and she was obviously impressed, as I am; I know it. As I keep on saying, Western Sydney has a number of Liberal members. Do you think they stood up for the students in this matter? Do you think that they are explaining the hypocrisy of the government's action in this matter? Of course not. We have the Chief Government Whip, a person in this place who has taken a special interest in education. I wish I could report to the House that he stood up for the students, stood up for the University of Western Sydney, stood up for uwsconnect. Sadly, I cannot. It is the same for the member for Greenway. She was saying, as I was reporting earlier: ‘Look, don't worry about it. It's just a user-pays system. You get private enterprise in, and these things will operate on the basis of normal commercial practice, notwithstanding that the campuses only operate for 26 weeks.' In the only example that I can quote, a cafe was established at the Hawkesbury campus. Do know how long it lasted? Do you know how long the member for Greenway's proposition lasted as an example at the Hawkesbury campus? It lasted 12 months before it went belly up. We know in Nirimba-and I am very proud of Nirimba, even though it is in the honourable member for Greenway's electorate-that we have not only students using these facilities. I mentioned the 25 schools, the 5,000 or 6,000 students who use the swimming pool and the residents who use the facility. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition was at a volleyball court. I have to say that she is a far more talented volleyball player than I proved to be, but I think our skills and future lie in other endeavours. But who was waiting to use the volleyball court after we had completed our game with the students? It was the local fire brigade. Members of the local fire brigade had called into use these facilities. So the use of these facilities on campuses is not just limited to students. Communities are using them. Schools are using them. People like the fire brigade-it came as a surprise to me-are using them. One thing distresses me most under this arrogant, extreme government's proposals, which they have now said that they are going to delay for 12 months. If students, male and/or female, late at night, are going to the university or to the TAFE that is co-located on the site, there is a shuttle bus that takes them from the campus to Marayong railway station, and it also takes them from the campus to Blacktown railway station. Had the government's legislation gone through, these buses would have disappeared. I will repeat that. The physical safety of those studentsyoung people, male and female, late at night, often part-time, attending university courses, attending the TAFE-would be at risk. Yet this was not a concern to the Liberal members in Western Sydney. It is a disgrace. And, here, not only the disgrace but the sheer hypocrisy of their position, the sheer hypocrisy of their decision, is exposed. I know I have seen the minister for education at the dispatch box at question time. There is no doubt that he has had serious leadership ambitions. Some might think that is only confined to one member of the front-bench, but I would say of the minister for education that he has had serious leadership ambitions. This current backdown, this act of utter hypocrisy, has blown the air out of his leadership balloon forever. I congratulate the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, because she has championed this issue. She took a very difficult decision to quarantine and preserve essential services; it was the right way. But more than just congratulating the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I want to thank all the students, all regional communities, all the sporting groups, all the arts community, all the ordinary mums and dads and particularly all the parents and partners of those students for putting up such a wonderful fight on this issue. I think you have succeeded beyond what you thought you were capable of, but we have seen this incompetent minister, who really is happy to pursue extreme ideological positions at the expense of these institutions and these students, get his way. Whether or not there are compulsory fees, a lot of sandstone universities have such extreme wealth built up that they can afford to subsidise the services. They can afford out of their investment dividend to subsidise the services. I do not think that is a good solution, but at least they have the financial capacity to do it. I make no apologies in saying that the University of Western Sydney is not one of those institutions. In fact, it has been quite badly penalised financially under this government. It is some tens of millions of dollars worse off compared with, say, the Charles Sturt University. It does not get any special regional consideration, but it is such a vital institution in Western Sydney. It is much beloved, not just by the people who go there or by the people who have relatives who go there but universally. People in Western Sydney are very proud of their university. Many people who did not have a hope of ever going to any university are delighted to see its rapid growth and expansion. But of course the University of Western Sydney could not cope financially with a cut to these services. (Time expired)",112
230,Dr JENSEN,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"I certainly support the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Budget Measures) Bill 2005 and the related bill. I find the member for Chifley's statements about voluntary student unionism to be quite extraorthe dinary. From personal experience, I remember being at university and having to pay for services that I did not require. But it gets even worse than that: there are part-time and external students who are going to university who never use the facilities, yet the member for Chifley suggests that these students should pay for services such as the fire brigade that other people may use. That is quite an extraordinary proposition. Perhaps the honourable member would like to finance the university's services himself so that community groups and others can use university facilities. The Labor Party is supposed to be the champion of the underdog. Students are not particularly well-off, yet the member for Chifley is basically suggesting that they fund the sporting activities of others who are financially better off. As far as voluntary unionism is concerned, it is a fundamental right of people to choose whether or not to associate. One aspect of voluntary unionism is that it will make the unions more accountable. They will raise funds for the services that students need rather than for all sorts of strange organisations and groupings that the union thinks are worthy of funding when the majority of the student body does not think they are worth funding. With voluntary unionism, amenities and services will more closely represent the wants and desires of the students who actually fund the union. The member for Chifley was talking about the campus cafeteria and the problem of it being open for only 26 weeks. First of all, this is a ludicrous proposition-and it has been put to me by various guild presidents as well-but let us analyse this proposition a little. The situation is that people are at university all through the year-for example, lecturers and postgraduate students. Sure, for 26-odd weeks of the year you have far more students, with the undergraduate students being there. But, to me, this is a fantastic business plan: you can have a skeleton staff operating your cafeteria when demand is low, and when demand is high-when you have all your undergraduate students therenot only do you have ready-made customers but you also have ready-made part-time staff who coincidentally happen to be at the university when the demand is high. What a great business plan, yet this is put forward as a bad idea and something that would be debilitating. There is paranoia about unions collapsing and about the claim that campuses will be such that overseas students are no longer attracted. The simple fact is that controlled economies have never worked-for example, the Soviet Union. This is an example of a controlled economy. Just as with industrial relations reform, this reform will free up and make more efficient the student support and services sector. Let us look at the proposition that VSU is debilitating, that it will ruin campus life, that unions will collapse et cetera. The model being put up is very similar to the WA model of VSU, and that operated from 1995 until the Gallop government took office. VSU in WA was introduced in 1995, and four years later it was found that approximately 30 per cent of students chose to pay membership fees-apart from those at Edith Cowan University, which had problems of its own. Students are clearly voting that they do not believe the services being offered by the guilds are in their best interests. The bill is not about destroying guilds; it is about giving students the choice of whether or not to become guild members, therefore making guilds more responsive to student needs. In 1997, 45 different types of services were offered by the guild at the University of Western Australia, and this was when VSU was in force. In 1994, prior to VSU, only 27 services were offered-so much for the collapse of services under VSU. In 2000, the UWA guild president reported that the ‘past four years have seen the guild's financial position move from strength to strength'-so much for the paranoid arguments made by those opposite. I mentioned ECU earlier on as a case where membership of 30 per cent was not achieved. ECU's position is often cited as a case where a guild was destroyed by VSU, but let us analyse it a little further. In 1989, the guild invested $1 million with the Western Women group. It lost $757,000 and this is what destroyed the guild; it was not VSU that destroyed the guild. The guild, in effect, misappropriated membership dues. Why should students have to pay for misappropriation and mismanagement? There are issues relating to third-line forcing. Why? Fundamentally, students go to university to get an education; other issues are ancillary. VSU ensures that membership of the guild is not a precondition to enrolment or that full payment of compulsory guild fees is a precondition of students getting exam results. Effectively, what is in eration at the moment is ‘no ticket, no start', as far as the union is concerned. There have been many who have said that student unions are not really unions, anyway. It is ironic that the National Union of Students certainly do not see it that way. In 1997, in their annual report, they stated that the ‘principal activity of association was the provision of trade union services to its members at all levels within Australia'-so much for not being a trade union. There are social life aspects. We have heard one senator say that universities are buildings and sports fields. That would come as a very strange premise to the original university I went to in Melbourne-RMITwhere there are no sports fields, but it is a university. As I mentioned before, universities are institutions of learning. Everything else is peripheral. The ironic thing is that people talk about a lack of sports activities and so on if there is voluntary membership, and they say that students should not have to pay for sports in addition to union fees. The reality is that students at many universities, in addition to paying that fee, have to pay the use of the swimming pool, the use of the tennis courts and the use of other sports facilities. I have already mentioned the issues relating to part-time and external students, whereby students who do not use these facilities still have to pay for their use. This is patently unfair. Another example of a university that has often been cited as an example of a university union that would be under threat under VSU is the University of New England. It is rather ironic, however, that under compulsory student unionism the student union went broke; it is under a receiver-manager controlled by the university. The Victorian method of voluntary student unionism has often been mentioned as a op- model that perhaps we should adopt. They talk about opting out, meaning that students do not have to pay for the union, but let us have a look at ‘opt out' and what it actually means. Take two students who, let us say, pay $100 each in student union and services and amenities fees. Let us suppose that $100 of this $200 goes towards the guild and the other $100 goes to other services. What happens if, say, student A decides to opt out? All that will happen is that student A will pay $100 for the amenities not associated with the guild and student B's fees will go to the student guild, so nothing has changed. Another survey that is cited by guild presidents is that of the University of Adelaide, where they say that 84 per cent support compulsory student unionism. This survey was sent out to students via email, but only 20 per cent completed the survey and sent it back. It is a self-selected sample. No statistician worth their salt would call it in any way, shape or form statistically significant. Another factor that has been mentioned is: ‘If you get rid of compulsory student unionism, it will have devastating effects as far as for international students are concerned.' Let us analyse what happened in WA. Under similar VSU conditions and arrangements that we are suggesting in our current legislation, WA had a greater percentage increase in international student enrolments than did New upkeep and South Wales at the same time. The simple fact is that student life cannot be distilled into a single experience. There are multiple ways in which students actually go about studying. Sure, some will want to use the rugby fields and all the sporting facilities to their heart's content and will use them at an incredibly high rate. Other students-predominantly part-time and external students-will not want to use those facilities at all. In addition, the students who will be using those sporting facilities more than anyone else will be those who are financially relatively better off. Those who are not so well-off will be working part time in order to sustain themselves while they are studying. Tertiary education has become more focused on career and job outcomes, according to Melbourne University's Centre for the Study of Higher Education. Another proposition that has been put with regard to VSU and compulsory unionism is: ‘Hey, the federal government charges taxes, don't they? State governments charge taxes, don't they? Even local councils charge rates.' There are two issues as far as this is concerned. First of all, I do not see anywhere in the Constitution where the universities are some fourth level of government. The simple fact is that they are not and, therefore, do not have any power as far as taxation is concerned. The other fact is that compulsory student unionism is, in effect, a poll tax. a flat tax that does not consider the financial position of the person studying at all. People can be extremely wealthy and yet be paying the same amount as students who are relatively much worse off. This, clearly, is not a fair proposition. Rural campuses are also mentioned as places where voluntary unionism is going to decimate the university, where student life is going to be spoiled and where communities built around the university are going to suffer because these services will not be there. The reality is that unions and sporting associations will be made to be more responsive to student and community needs and will have a very good opportunity to provide those communities with the very services that communities want. It is strange is that all sorts of facilities are brought up as being those that students should in effect be funding because they are on campus and they are convenient-for instance, emergency relief funds for students who are in financial trouble. Wouldn't students be far less likely to be in financial trouble if they did not have to pay out hundreds of dollars per annum in compulsory fees? I have heard mention of medical and dentistry services and how these are essential services that the university needs to give to their students. The last time. I looked, there were dental and medical facilities right throughout the community. Why should the universities have a privileged place in this regard? In terms of support services, universities such as Murdoch actually provide support or representation to students. The guild simply chooses to duplicate this service. In conclusion, I find abhorrent this whole proposition that it is wrong for students to choose whether to associate and whether they are going to pay fees for services that It is will be rendered. There is the proposition that universities are going to be decimated under this system and that all sorts of facilities, such as campus cafeterias, sporting facilities and so on, are suddenly not going to exist any more. The reality is that people pay for cafeterias. The member for Chifley gave an example-I cannot remember what university he referred to-where the cafeteria only lasted for 12 months. To me that is an indication of extremely bad management; it is not an indication of an inherent problem with the business model. I would really like to have a business where the variability in my customer base is going to exactly coincide with the variability of the supply of my work force. That is an ideal business case. I find it very difficult to understand how that business went broke. In conclusion, I support these bills. Voluntary student unionism is a critical issue that really needs to be voted on in the near future in this parliament.",115
231,Mr RIPOLL,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"I do not support the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005 and the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2005. I do support the second reading amendment proposed by the honourable member for Jagajaga that the Minister for Education, Science and Training should withdraw the VSU legislation permanently and completely. The second reading amendment, along with the components of the legislative package presently before the House, deals with allowing university service providers-some of which are student organisations but I should make it clear that not all are-to collect fees for services from overseas students. This is what I will focus on today. Sections of the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2005 allows universities to charge fees to international students for services such as counselling, advocacy and support services which the VSU bill would deny to Australian students. This is a massive act of hypocrisy and a massive act of deception. It is something that should be rejected. Just so the House is very clear, on the one hand the minister is enshrining in legislation the right of universiter ties to charge a fee for services for overseas students while, on the other hand, through the so-called voluntary student unionism legislation, the minister wants to outlaw universities charging Australian students a fee for exactly the same purposes. Now we all know the minister, Brendan Nelson, had to suffer a painful humiliation today, having to delay his outdated, extreme attack on student services. That must have come as a huge humiliation to him and a blow to his ego. The minister's credibility suffered a massive blow after he was simply unable to get support and sufficient numbers in his own ranks to get his extreme VSU legislation through this parliament. The minister has been playing student politics on this issue for the past 12 months, and he has lost, just as he did when he was at university. My advice to the minister is simple: give up the petty games, move on, deal with the real issues of education, skills and training and leave student politics to the students. The education minister pinned his leadership hopes on VSU, which he described as a ‘totemic issue for the Liberal Party'. Many times in this parliament VSU has been listed and has then been withdrawn-after the minister has desperately tried to convince his coalition colleagues of its merits, to no avail. The delaying of this legislation is a huge victory for Australia's university sector, students, student organisations, regional communities, sporting groups and the arts community. All of these have strongly opposed this legislation because of the damage it would do to services such as child care, sporting clubs, counselling and student advocacy, just to name a few of the services provided by these organisations. But the minister should do the right thing, and the right thing is to simply drop this bill altogether. Even such an incompetent minismust realise that delaying this extreme bill until next year will not change the views of his concerned coalition colleagues-or the views of those other groups and communities that have fought so hard against this legislation. Let us face it: the hardline politics of Minister Nelson on this issue are more about his leadership ambitions and proving to his colleagues how tough he is than they are about student services or even, for that matter, student unionism. This is more about Brendan Nelson trying to demonstrate his bona fides on matters that involve unions. In every debate in this place you can see the hatred government members have for anything that involves collectivism-and you can hear what hang-ups they have about anything that involves collectivism, unions or ordinary people getting together to form a collective. The VSU debate is not about any real change to make a better higher education sector; it is purely about one minister fulfilling his own personal ambitions. The pretensions of student politics have no place in the Commonwealth parliament of Australia. My advice to the minister is: take your medicine, swallow your pride, get on with the real issues of higher education and, as I said before, leave the student politics to the students. Let them deal with their own issues. The real crunch, though, comes in this debate put forward by government members. I have listened to a number of government members, and I have paid particular attention to their language. They only have two things to say. It is as simple as that. They do not like unions and they try to associate student organisations and student unionism with trade unions. They have tried to say that somehow they are the same thing: maybe they are and maybe they are not but, whatever they are, they are something that belongs to students themselves. They do not belong to this parliament. They are not something this parliament should interfere in. This must be one of the most interventionist governments we have ever come across. They call themselves a Liberal coalition, a Liberal government, but I see nothing liberal about what they do. They intervene in matters that are not their concern. They should leave it up to students, student organisations and the universities themselves to deal with their own issues. This is not a problem or something the university sector have said should be fixed by government. This is not something students have rallied outside Parliament House and demanded this government fix. No: there has been nothing of the sort-quite the opposite. The university sector-the vice-chancellors, the universities themselves and their students-have campaigned long and hard against this government's views, because it is in their best interests to oppose this government on this particular legislation. We have heard the tired old worn-out arguments about choice. They run the same arguments about industrial relations and about freedom of association. But everywhere we look around us freedom of association is not something this government really truly support. They have done everything they can over 9½ long years to get rid of freedom of association. They cannot do it by either compelling you to join or not join an organisation, but what they can do is just get rid of that organisation in the first place. If you have a look at student peak bodies, at youth bodies and at those organisations in our community that were put in place to give a voice to people who do not normally have a voice-people who need a peak body and need to be represented-those organisations which were around for years and were properly funded by government have been shut down by this government. That is how they deal with freedom of association and with allowing people a voice. I know there will be a few government members who will talk about freedom of association and its noncompulsory aspect. For those people who want to remain part of an organisation, what is voluntary about getting rid of it? There is nothing voluntary about that. That is forced upon those people, and they have no choice and no say. I have also heard another argument from government members that I think is outrageous. For them the debate is really about two things. It is about hatred for unions, the collective and people actually standing together so that they have a stronger voice. The other thing it is about is the idea that paying an extra $100-or a few hundred dollars in some cases-to be part of the student organisation at a university is somehow going to send students broke. Forget the fact that courtesy of this government you are going to have to pay $125,000 for the privilege of having that degree in the first place. Forget that. That $125,000, they argue, is completely affordable, but a few hundred dollars to be part of an organisation that actually provides services is not. Of course, we have heard the tired old argument that not everyone uses those services. Of course they do not. We would not expect them to use all those services. There are services in this building that some people use and some do not, and they are subsidised. Let me give you one example-and I challenge a government member to respond on this. We have a gymnasium here, and it is a fine gymnasium. If you were to join at normal rack rates, you would have to pay $1,000 a year to be a part of that gymnasium, because of the quality and the service level. But for a member of parliament it is a lot cheaper than that. I am too embarrassed to say how cheap it is, because it would be a shock to people-I am too embarrassed to say that. Not everyone uses that gymnasium, yet all of us in some way subsidise it, includthey ing the taxpayer. There is some sort of compulsory association going on there in terms of that particular facility, and there are ens-if not hundreds-of other examples we could all use to demonstrate the duplicity and hypocrisy of this government on this issue. This issue has nothing at all to do with afvesting fordability for students or with the services that they either use or do not use on campuses around this country; it has everything to do with politics and the bad, bitter memories that the government ministers have of those dark days when they were students who were involved in politics but could not win elections on campus. They could not get their way. After 30 years of thinking about how they might pay back some of those debts that they believe they have, they have found a way. It is not by rationalising these organisations or by perhaps putting in legislation that would make them more robust in their management and in their dealing with finances; it is just by getting rid of them and silencing them. There is no choice there-no choice at all. All the government speaks of is choice, but the easiest way to get rid of choice is just to get rid of the organisation in the first place. I am sure that it comes as no surprise to the many people who will be affected by this government's legislation not only in this area but also in the area of industrial relations. This bill is about silencing dissent. The VSU bill has nothing to do with the big picture, with big-ticket items. It has nothing to do with the essential future of welfare, the prosperity of our nation and our students, or our students' education levels and standards. It has nothing to do with that; it is just about petty politics. It represents the Prime Minister's ideological obsession and the obsession of the ministers who themselves enjoyed a free university education. Taxpayers paid for their education yet that is not something that would reciprocate for any young person today. These ministers are the same people who enjoyed the services of their student dozunion at the time that they were members. That is not something that they would allow for others. This is not about positive reform or inin our future or in skills and training. There is no vision and no reform; there is just petty politics. In short, this bill will achieve nothing more than an attempt to silence student dissent-a section of the community that is a voice of conscience and a different voice to that of the government of the day, regardless of what that government is. When Labor was in power, let me assure you that there were plenty of student bodies and organisations that protested against Labor governments as much as they do against Liberal governments. That is the way it ought to be. They ought to be the last bastions of true, independent thought and of freedom, allowing students to be strident critics of whichever government is in on the day. That is the basis of our strong democracy and what makes this country such a great place. Student organisations have been highly organised in their campaigns, particularly against this government. There is a good reason for that. This government has exacted political retribution in trying to neutralise an important source of public comment on policies, particularly in relation to funding for universities and the higher education sector. The Commonwealth government does have an obligation, though, to listen to its critics. It does not need to agree with its critics, but it has a moral responsibility to at least listen. People have the right to speak up and they have the right to be heard. I have spoken on this issue many times in this place. In fact, in 1999, the last time that the government tried to silence dissent within the student community, I said that student organisations have always been critical of government, including, as I said before, Labor governments. The VSU bill is political retribution against student organisations that have opposed the decisions to cut billions of dollars of funding from universities, to double HECS fees over the last eight years and now to allow an increase of a further 25 per cent on already ballooning fees for university degrees. The government has allowed class sizes to increase by more than 30 per cent. It has allowed universities to enrol students paying $100,000 or more-and, in some cases, more than $200,000-while students with better marks miss out because there simply are not enough places. So while this government made the promise, ‘There will be no $100,000 university degrees,' not only are they now in place; they are in place at nearly all universities. It is the complete opposite of what this government promised. It is just another broken promise on a list so long that I lose count of how many hundreds there are. The government talk at length-and we will hear it from more government members as they speak on this issue-about this being about their own conscience and freeing up association issues. Nothing could be further from reality. This is a misguided expectation that is central to everything that the government do. It is also central, if you look closely at what the government are doing now with their advertising, to industrial relations. It is the same thing. I am sure that people started choking on their Weet-Bix this morning, as I did when I picked up the Australian newspaper and found a full-page ad. I thought, ‘This is outrageous-another full-page ad paid for by the Australian taxpayer!' I then went to the next page and found two more full-page as. There were three pages. I just could not believe it. You do not want to hear some of the words that I said, but I was definitely choking on my Weet-Bix. Then I turned the page and found a further full-page ad-four full-page as in a row spewing out propaganda from the government. That is all it is-it is just propaganda. I cannot even say that it is cheap propaganda because it is costing an absolute fortune. I am sure that the smiling faces of those so-called workers in the as all belong to Liberal staffers, because you could not convince one real worker to stand up if you told them that this is what they were going to be photographed for-standing next to these so called industrial relations changes. It is an absolute disgrace. The government use the same tactics and the same language; they use the words ‘voluntary', ‘choice' and ‘freedom'. None of those words apply in this case or in any case relating to government legislation. Government members will also say that you cannot draw any sort of link between what state governments do in terms of charging fees, taxes, levies and surcharges. Let me give you one good example. The government will continually say that this is not like private schools charging fees for music lessons or something like that-compulsory fees. What about milk or sugar levies and taxes? What about all those other levies and taxes? I do not have sugar; does that mean that I am exempt from the fee, the levy, the tax? No. It is levied universally across everybody. The idea is to make it affordable. If compulsory levies and fees were only to be paid by those who actually used them, we would not have any facilities at all. That is the plain reality. Our universities would not be places of higher learning and higher fulfilmentplaces where people can go not only to further educate themselves but also to deliver more and do something more. Universities would simply be a brick box, somewhere that you turned up to be spoken at and which you then left. There would not be much fulfilment or real-life education-the sorts of things that employers are talking about-if that were the case. The biggest gripe that employers have about people after they finish higher education is that they have no life experience. How do you get that? You can get that at a university by participating in a range of activities. That is the reality. That should be supported rather than neutralised by this government. In relation to this whole idea of how ‘terrible' these fees are, as claimed by the government-a few hundred dollars a year, which is a lot of money; I do not shirk from that for one moment-I want to give an example of something else that represents a lot of money. Since this government has been in power, the tax take per taxpayer has gone up by $12,200. Taking into consideration any wage increases, tax cuts or other ways by which you might have had some benefittake off all of that-and the average taxpayer is now paying an extra $12,200. That is how far back people now are in terms of costs. There are some real costs: do something with that. The majority of those costs come in the form of GST. In conclusion, I want to say a few words about some of the positive contributions that student organisations make not just to the lives of students but to the university community. They offer things such as child care-which I am sure a lot of parents in this place could do with-free employment services, advocacy and welfare, free legal services, health services, interest-free loans for people who are not well-off, subsidised catering and facilities to students who support themselves, student leadership, lounges, meeting rooms, diaries and magazines, publications, student insurance, student development and activities, sport and recreation, commercial services and orientation and transition to university. A lot of those activities are not only supplied and paid for by student organisations but also organised by them. There is cultural development, entertainment, postgraduate support, information sessions and services and mature age student support. They provide safety in car parks at night, which is not provided by universities. They provide shuttle buses between campuses, which are not provided by universities. They provide international student support, distance education support, resource centres, visual and performing arts and theatres and galleries. They even pay for-wait for it-whole new buildings. Where the university does not do these things, the student organisations do. I will say on the record that some student organisations in the past have failed dismally in the carriage of their duties, but that does not mean that you should shut them all down. Do something about the management. Make sure that they remain viable. Do something for students. Do something for the university sector-for that community. Ensure that they have liveability and some sort of a future. That this government simply wants to kill them off is not good enough. (Time expired)",119
232,Mr SECKER,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"I rise today to give support to the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005. Mr Deputy Speaker Hatton, after listening to the opposition speakers, you would swear that this debate is about VSU, voluntary student unionism.",124
233,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"I can be helpful to the member for Barker: that has been the case with government speakers as well. Apparently, they are all speaking to the amendment.",124
234,Mr SECKER,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"Then certainly I will speak to it later in this debate also; thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I inform the member for Oxley, who accused all here of getting a free university education, that when doing my politics and economics degree I certainly did not. In fact, I was paying it off as late as last year. There are many of us like that and that is all about timing. Therefore, I think it is a little unfair to accuse ministers members of this chamber of not having to pay for something because of the rules at the time. I welcome the establishment, for example, of the Carnegie Mellon University in Adelaide. The amendments before the House today take the steps necessary to enable this high-quality education provider to begin operating the first foreign university to be established in Australia; it also has the support of that state's Labor Premier. Carnegie Mellon will not only provide our students with greater choice; it will also give them the option of studying for an Australian or American qualification, which will become increasingly valuable and popular in our global society. Not only will our students benefit from greater education choices but all Australians will benefit economically and socially from the relationship that this institution undoubtedly will foster with the United States. It is interesting that opposition members have said-I think they have all raved on about this-that full fee paying students in Australia get places at Australian universities above those who get higher marks, but they conveniently forget to tell you that these extra places are available to overseas students. Therefore, it would be a perverse sort of logic to say that these places should be available to overseas students but not to our own homegrown students. There would be no logic at all in that. It is imperative that students, both Australian and international, and Carnegie Mellon itself are properly provided for to ensure the success of this exciting new venture; thus we are introducing these sensible and practical amendments. It is a long standing policy of the Australian government that no Australian government funding, tuition fees or student contributions paid by Australian students or should be used to subsidise the tuition or services provided to international studentsand we intend to maintain this policy. The amendments before the House today will ensure that this is upheld while also protecting the interests of our international students. A major drawcard Australian based universities have when looking to attract international students is the safeguards that we have in place to guarantee that these students receive the education they are paying for and that they are adequately supported in their university lives. Sections 45 to 48 of the national code list the support services that must be provided for international students. These range from ensuring that students have access to orientation and accommodation upon arrival to the appointment of a student contact officer. The fees that our universities collect from university students cannot go to the picnic society, the more beer club or even the mathematics club. These funds go solely to the provision of these essential services to our international students, as outlined in the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000. Like other students at Australian universities, international students will undoubtedly participate in some non-academic activities over their time at uni. They will broaden their Australian experience by involving themselves in new and interesting groups and societies, and they, like the students of Australia, will be prepared to pay for them if and when they use them. I am a true supporter of voluntary student unionism. If I thought for a moment that these amendments were going against the fundamental rights of our students, I would be the first to say so. VSU seeks to afford university students the same rights inside the university environment that they enjoy outside of the university environment. VSU means students will not be forced to become members of a student association and will not have to pay fees for non-academic student services. I believe, as I am sure most Australians believe, that students are capable of making decisions for themselves. If we truly believe that, then it stands to reason that we should have VSU in our universities and that we should trust in our societal beliefs and the judgments of our students. The opposition will claim that the coalition are opposed to compulsory student unionism because of the word ‘union'. This is simply untrue. Unions have a place in universities for those people who choose to be members, just like unions in normal society. What we do oppose and will continue to oppose is the compulsory nature of unions in universities and the infringement of the rights of our free-thinking students. I held this belief long before I came into this place; it is so important to me that I made that point in my maiden speech. We have all but rid workplaces of compulsory unionism. However, it would seem we are not interested in affording our university students the same rights. Our higher education facilities teach our students about their democratic rights but they do not like to practise them. It is almost farcical. In fact, they squash the democratic rights of students by forcing free-thinking individuals to join a union. I well remember that when I enrolled at university-and, of course, I was opposed to compulsory unionism-I was told what would happen if I did not pay my student union fee. Like any other student, I was promptly told that if I did not pay my fee I could do all the work but I would not get my results. You could spend all that time there but you would not pass if you did not pay that fee every year. When I went to university, I used to do my full-time course in two days and I spent all my time studying. I did not have time to do all the other things and, when I did play sport on the weekend, I did it in my home town. The same thing happens with the students of Keith. For example, we have quite a few students who go to university during the week but come home on the weekends and play for their local footy teams or netball teams. They pay their subs to their local club in the town of Keith but they are also forced to subsidise those playing sport in Adelaide, where they have never had the opportunity or the desire to use those facilities. I am sure if they wanted to they could pay subs just like any other person in normal society. University unions as they presently operate do not represent the student body at large. Student elections generally have a dismal voting turnout, which means that the student council represents a very small percentage of the student population. Further to this, there is very little consultation with the students. Any action taken is usually the decision of the student council alone. Some may argue that, if the student body is misrepresented, it is the fault of the student body, as they have been given every opportunity to have their say; they simply need to speak up. In my opinion, the lack of support shown for student elections is the student body speaking up. They are saying: ‘We don't care about the student union. We consider it irrelevant to our studies and we consider it irrelevant to our university lives.' If the majority of students feel like thisand we know they do; simply look at how many vote in student elections-why should they be forced to pay a fee for representation that they do not need, want or use? As I have said before in this House, the policy adopted by our universities is a ‘no union fee, no education' policy. Students who simply cannot afford to pay these fees, and those who opt not to, are unable to enrol in their univerorganisation sity course. They are unable to access their results, they cannot use the library and ultimately they cannot graduate. Even the most diligent student who has paid the university tuition fees up front and who has received exceptional grades cannot receive the all important certificate that says so until they hand over their hard-earned cash, or in many cases that of their parents, to the student ion. And compulsory student union fees at some universities are to the tune of $600. Predictably, the Labor Party opposed the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2005 earlier this year, claiming that it would end student services, clubs and societies and would end university life as we know it. Let us look at some of the societies that the students are forced to support. We have the Buffy Society. I am sure that might be thrilling to those who are involved, but I cannot see any logical reason why people going to university should be forced to support the Buffy Society. We have the Camden Farms Student Society, whatever that may be. We have Chopstix. That is a very interesting one. Why would we be forced to support an organisation like that with compulsory fees? We have Club Ascent at Centenary Institute; I am not sure what that means. I think I have a fair idea what the Dark Alternative Society means, but students are forced to subsidise that. They are forced to subsidise Fitter and Brighter in Orange; that is a beauty. We have Karavan, spelt with a K. I am not sure whether that is about a group or whether they do not know how to spell ‘caravan'. We have the Kendo and Kumdo Club. The mind boggles. We have the Madrigal Society, another one that compulsory student fees are forced to support. We have the Recreational and Clowning Around Society. I think some members of the opposition must have been part of this when they went to university. We have RockSoc. We have the Sahaja Yoga Club. They may very well be quite good clubs, but, if people want to take part in those services and join those clubs, surely they will not mind paying the cost of being there. We have the Social Skiers Society. We have the Sufi Association. I am sure some members would have enjoyed the Hip Hop un- Club or the Inner Child Society, which people are forced to subsidise with their union fees. We have Unimates. I am not sure whether that is a matching-up group orMr Hockey interjecting",124
235,Mr SECKER,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"Yes, the mind boggles again as to what that could be for. We have Wasabi and, the last one, the Zen Club. These are all organisations that people may want to join, but I cannot see any logic as to why people should be forced to subsidise those sorts of groups. The Labor Party needs to give our students some credit. Students do not use the services or become involved in clubs and societies on campus like the ones I just mentioned because they are trying to get their money's worth-although who could blame them if they did? The Free Beer Society would be a good one to join. Students join these organisations because they enjoy the involvement. It is clear to see that these clubs, societies and campus services will continue to operate for those who want to use them, and they will in fact operate better and more efficiently than ever before. VSU will mean that student organisations will no longer be able to rely on union funding; they will have to function in the real world. What better training could we have than that? They will need to attract members by offering students something they want, enjoy and need. Students will voluntarily support these organisations and they will thrive. In every suburb and town in metro and regional Australia there are clubs, societies and organisations offering sport, craft, friendship, support-and the list goes on. These clubs function because people have an interest in what they offer. University clubs will have to function in the same manner. Coming from a regional electorate, I regularly speak with students who undertake their university studies externally and are physically unable to access the services their union fees pay for. I also speak with students who are on Youth Allowance, living in share accommodation in Adelaide, and students who are attending the new regional university in Mount Gambier. The story is the same regardless of location: students simply do not have time to enjoy their union fees in many cases as either they are working to pay their way or they spend their time studying. In many cases rural students already have the extra hardship of having to move to a city to do their university studies. That costs extra. It has been estimated that it costs the rural student an average of $10,000 a year extra to go to university, because they have to rent accommodation-in Adelaide in many cases, although quite a few people from my electorate go to Melbourne university, because we border Victoria and we are about halfway between Melbourne and Adelaide. People can go to either, but they have those extra costs. They have to work hard as it is, just to survive, though I do point out that we now have three scholarships that the federal government has brought into help rural students. What would I say to these students? How could I argue with students who are studying medicine and nursing in Renmark in my electorate? They pay a compulsory student union fee, but they have no facilities there to enjoy. There are no sporting grounds at the Riverland campus. It is the same with the Mount Gambier campus. There are no sporting grounds. The only thing they can enjoy there is a reasonably well-run cafe. People go there to eat, of course. People are paying all these extra fees. Because of the distances they travel, we have a whole heap of rural students who study externally. They are being told that they still have to pay a student union fee for a service that they do not have a hope of using. In every other facet of Australian society we give our citizens the right to freedom of association. It simply does not make sense that we would not afford our students the same basic freedom. Article 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states: (1) Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association. (2) No one may be compelled to belong to an association. Why does the Labor Party believe it is above the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was instituted to protect each and every human being the world over? Why do those opposite believe they know best and why do they believe they can pull the wool over our eyes? The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was drawn up for the good of humanity. The Labor Party's policy on student unions, however, was drawn up to fill Labor Party coffers. If there is one thing people in the Labor Party are cognisant of-I would go as far as to say good at-it is knowing where their bread is buttered. The National Union of Students supports the Labor Party both financially and politically, and the ALP will continue to support its financiers, as it does with the union movement, without so much as a second thought for our students who wear the financial burden. Voluntary student unionism is an important step forward for our universities and for our students. I have no doubt that the student population will thank us for it. They want freedom of association, they want to choose where their money is spent and they want to spend it as they see fit. These amendments will give them these basic rights within higher education institutions and will allow them to enjoy simple freedoms. Perhaps one day the Labor Party will look past politics, power and money and do what is best for our students.",126
236,Mr MELHAM,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"Once again we are dealing with legislation based on this government's ongoing and unjust ideological campaign to attack higher education. Mr Hockey-Throw away the written speech, Daryl; give us some passion!",128
237,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"Order! Minister, restrain yourself.",128
238,Mr MELHAM,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"The government has tried to remove the spectre of unionism from higher education campuses twice before. This first occurred with the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 and again with the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Upfront Student Union Fees) Bill 2003. Most recently we have debated the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2005-the VSU bill. The 2005 VSU bill was the government's most recent attempt to diminish the role provided on campuses by student services organisations. Today we have seen reported in the Age that the Minister for Education, Science and Training will back down from his attack on student services. The voluntary student union legislation has been withdrawn from the Notice Paper, again, as the minister tries to gain the support of his colleagues on the other side of the House. The member for Jagajaga has noted that issues dealt with by the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2005 also include matters to do with services traditionally provided by student unions. On the one hand the minister is enshrining in legislation the right of universities to charge a fee for services for overseas students. On the other hand the minister is seeking to outlaw universities charging Australian students a fee for exactly the same purposes through the VSU legislation. I note the member for Jagajaga has foreshadowed an amendment calling on the government to withdraw the VSU bill. Student services are vital to the operation of universities, whether assisting overseas or local students. I took this opportunity to check the web site of a university in my electorate of Banks, the University of Western Sydney Bankstown campus. Some of the services provided include second-hand bookshops, welfare case workers, student loans, child-care subsidies, peer support programs, crisis care referrals, emergency food vouchers, accommodation registers-and the list goes on and on. I cannot begin to imagine what will happen to some students without these support services. I noted in a speech by the member for Newcastle on 12 May that many students at the university there are first-timers-that is, they are the first members of their families to attend a tertiary institution. At the University of Western Sydney, on all the campuses, this is very much the case. These are young people from families who have not had the experience of attending a university. Enrolling at university is not an easy matter, with choices to be made that impact on lifestyle, relationships, careers and the future. Students need these services more than ever. They rely very much on support from student organisations. Ongoing life at university can be fraught with pitfalls, and the student unions have traditionally provided extensive support and assistance to students in need. The University of Western Sydney is in the middle of Sydney. I despair at the potential impact of the lack of student services in regional universities. Let me quote one example, relating to student advocacy-one of the services currently provided by student associations. Mr Bruce Boyton, the distance education liaison officer from the Rivcoll Union at Charles Sturt University, stated in his submission to the Senate committee looking into the VSU: Advocacy requires direct challenges to the university and its staff. It is hard to imagine how mechanisms could be put into place to protect employees from pressure from more senior university members. It is even more fanciful gest that universities would engage barristers on behalf of a student to challenge the legality of its own decisions. I turn now to the argument advocated by the government in its defence of the VSU billthat of freedom of association. To hear representatives from this government gushing about freedom of association makes me want to reach for a dictionary to check that there is not a new definition of hypocrisy. No doubt the coalition members are referring to arguments used in Western Australia when the Court government introduced similar legislation. The Parliamentary Library outlines Australia's international obligations in the matter of freedom of association in its background note on voluntary student unionism. I think it is worthwhile to read that into the record today: Australia is a signatory to three international agreements specifically outlawing the practice of compulsory association. Article 20 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that ‘everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association'. Australia is also a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Labor Organisation's convention concerning freedom of associations. These conventions specifically denounce the practice of compelling individuals to become members of associations. UN General Assembly resolution 217(iii) of 10 December 1948, in addressing these statements on human rights, stipulates that ‘every individual and every organ of society should strive to secure their universal recognition and observance'. Governments have an obligation to protect the rights and liberties of their citizens. As legislators, we have an obligation to uphold and defend those rights and freedoms which have been universally recognised, including the right to freedom of association. Compulsory student unionism does not constitute an infringement of freedom of assoto sugciation. This has been confirmed by the courts, both in Victoria and in South Australia. Yet, under this absurd pretext, the government has sought to destroy student services, student rights and student support networks. Mr Hockey-Throw away the written speech, Daryl!",128
239,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,Order! The member for North Sydney.,130
240,Mr MELHAM,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"Except, of course, for overseas students, as provided for in the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill. The argument in relation to any impact on freedom of association was stated succinctly by the Vice-Chancellor of the Australian National University, Professor Ian Chubb, when he said to the Senate committee: I have always run the argument ... that you pay to be a member of a community just as I pay to be a member of a community through my rates and taxes ... However l do not use anything like the services that are provided by my community but I pay in order for other people to be able to use services that they need as part of their membership of that community. Mr Hockey interjecting",130
241,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,Order! The minister is not assisting the chair.,130
242,Mr MELHAM,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"I think that encapsulates the argument in relation to student unionism. On 11 August, the Australian ViceChancellors Committee distributed a media release which provided a chart outlining the uses of the student services and amenities charges. In 2005, the universities took over $170 million in these charges. In broad terms, this was spent in the following manner: sporting facilities, 21.07 per cent; health and welfare, 10.54 per cent; computing and other study assistance, 5.55 per cent; international students, 2.33 per cent; clubs and societies, 5.58 per cent; advocacy, representation and political activity, 14.34 per cent; and other non-political services, 39.04 per cent. Here is substantive proof that the vast majority of student fees and amenities charges support non-political activity. We accepted the government's fear of the term ‘union' and attempted to move beyond that fear to seek a compromise which would have allowed the removal of any odour of compulsion yet would have retained the services so badly needed by students at our universities. Yet this offer was not taken up. We have members on the other side, largely educated through a free university system, introducing fees which have the potential to remove the dream of a university education from many. Those same members wish to remove the services and amenities which they took for granted while at universityhypocrisy indeed! The current levels of funding provided by this government to universities have, in real terms, been reduced, so if student unions do not provide these amenities it is entirely the likely that they will be lost altogether. This government's fixation on user-pays systems is nothing short of obsessive. Mr Hockey-Come on, Daryl!",130
243,Mr MELHAM,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"It reinforces the notion that a university education should only ever be for the well-off in our community. Of course, members opposite do not care if students are no longer able to access such services as food vouchers. They have never needed food vouchers, second-hand books or any of the myriad support services provided by student unions. Yet, in a massive act of disingenuousness, the minister has moved the legislation which is before the House today. If the VSU legislation were to be passed, there would be a patent conflict with universities' obligations under the Education Services for Overseas Students Act. Hence, the minister has apparently decided not to proceed with the VSU legislation at this time. This government wants to attack the student unions and student services because of its ideological obsession, yet has been caught short by its own tactics. I wish to endorse remarks of the member for Jagajaga as strongly as I can in this debate on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Budget Measures) Bill 2005 and the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2005. I also support the member's foreshadowed amendment, as this bill establishes that the government is proposing to continue with compulsory student service fees for overseas students. Yet, in its so called voluntary student unionism legislation, it is attempting to prohibit them for Australian students. Labor does not control the House of Representatives and does not have the numbers in the Senate; the coalition does. There can be only one reason the minister is not proceeding with the VSU legislation-that is, he does not have the numbers in the party room. For the first time in decades, numbers at our universities are declining. This government and this minister wish to see our university system returned to one where entry is based on money not merit. Mr Hockey-Put your notes away, Daryl.",130
244,Mr MELHAM,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,This is an indefensible state of affairs and one which the Australian Labor Party will not be part of. Mr Hockey-At last!,131
245,Mr MELHAM,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"I was written to recently by the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sydney. He gave me, along with other members of the parliament, a couple of letters. Those letters were basically published in Honi Soit. I think it is worthwhile to quote from those letters, because they really summarise what part of the problem is. I say to the Minister for Human Services and the honourable member for Moncrieff who are in this chamber, who were interjecting throughout my speech, that I did prepare a written speech. I did it deliberately, be the cause there were a number of points that I wanted to make. I do not apologise for that. I was a beneficiary of a free university system under the Whitlam government. I got my economics and law degrees from Sydney university in the mid to late 1970s. As a result of the education that I received, I managed to practise as a legal aid solicitor and barrister. I believed in putting something back into our society and community. I paid student fees then and I did not use all the facilities of the university, but I held no grudge in paying those fees, because other students utilised those particular facilities. You have taxation and you have representation. The problem with some members of this government is that they are ideologically driven. They hate student unions. It goes back to the days when they were at university and in a minority. They carry with them the scars of their days at university and now attempt to punish the people who follow them-to deprive them of what are reasonable resources that are very much appreciated not just by the students. I notice that the vice-chancellors and a lot of people who teach at the universities support the students in this fight. This legislation is opposed at every level of university. Often enough, you have a difference between students, teachers and vicechancellors, but not in this instance. In this instance, those who are practitioners and involved in the field are saying to this ideologically driven government, ‘Back off. What you are doing is not going to be positive for students or universities. It is going to wreak havoc and create damage.' That is what worries me about this government. Its self-righteousness and rank hypocrisy is unbelievable. History will judge the government, and it will show that we are going through a period where, on the surface, this government is justifying its existence by ripping off $100 million to advertise its workplace relations reform. You do not need $100 million worth of advertising if what you are doing is good for the constituency. It should stand on its merits. The Prime Minister climbs all over the television and all the radio. Last night, when I was watching TV, every ad in the break was to do with workplace relations. Ms George-All the spin; it's spindoctoring.",131
246,Mr MELHAM,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"They are spin doctors. The substance of what this government does is to get down and dirty. Everything vengeful, ideological and class driven. The legislation in relation to student unions is very much an example of that. It is the baggage of the old days, when Treasurer Costello, Abbott and all the others were involved in the politics of the Australian Union of Students. They carry that baggage, they carry the scars and they want to change the world in their own image. Mr Hockey-That's not right.",132
247,Mr MELHAM,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"The minister says that it is not right. For what other reason has this legislation been pulled out and pursued by this government? You would think the government would have something better to do. I tell you what: at the end of his reign, this Prime Minister will go down in history as one of the worse prime ministers ever. History will judge him not as it does at present. There is no doubt he spends all the money he can, because he has his advisor in Mark Textor. His polling gives him the words that he uses on a daily basis to talk to the electorate in their language. But he will be judged on his period of office when he leaves office. I tell you what: he will not be missed. It will not take long, and it is legislation like this that he will be judged on. Mr Hockey interjecting",132
248,Mr MELHAM,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,It is not nation building; it is divisive. It is punishing legislation. Mr Hockey interjecting,132
249,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"Minister, if you wanted the member for Banks to fire up, over he has. I suggest you listen to him.",132
250,Mr MELHAM,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"It is not legislation that seeks to build for the future; it is legislation that punishes. A lot of workers who voted for this government-and I concede that they voted for this government-will get belted around the ears if the workplace relations legislation goes through. That is their reward it does is for voting for Little Johnny. It is about time that this government governed for all of us. In 1996 we were told that this would be a government for all of us but what we have seen-and this legislation is another indication-is that it is a government for the few, not for the many. The government will look after their mates, who will get most of the tax cuts. Areas cannot disagree with the government. NGOs are now being threatened with a loss of funding. If they have the temerity to speak out and oppose what the government is doing in any area, their funding is threatened and they are jeopardised. This is a government that punishes; it is not a government that rewards. It only rewards the sycophants that get on its coat-tails and chant the mantra that the government wants. That is the real test of this government, and that is what will happen over time. The government will be exposed over time. It will take some time. If you spend $100 million advertising a particular spin and a particular line, it will have an impact on the general public. We heard today from the Leader of the Opposition that $1 billion has been spent on government advertising in the nine years it has been in power. With $1 billion, I could do a lot for Aboriginal health, for Aboriginal education and for a whole series of things. But it has all been lost the gurgler in pushing the government's spin. I was taught in the old days that if you have to have an argument you should go out and argue the case yourself: get on the radio, get on the TV and do not rely on paid advertising. The government is corrupting our electoral system. I support the amendment proposed by the member for Jagajaga and I condemn the government.",132
251,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"Before I go to the next speaker, I thank the member for Banks both for the part of the speech he read and for taking the minister's bait. However, I remind the Minister for Human Services that it is not particularly helpful to continue to call upon a member to engage in debate across the chamber on a continuous basis. Mr Hockey-That's a bit tough.",133
252,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,It went for a long period of time. Mr Hockey-I will not object when Mr Ciobo speaks.,133
253,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"I know you will not interject upon your own member. I would also take the time to say that the minister is correct when he says that he himself is a much better speaker on his feet without written material-despite the fact that when he was a backbench member he read every speech I ever saw him give. Mr Hockey- Mr Deputy Speaker, there is a point of correction, if there is such a in the standing orders. I tended not to use written speeches. I was encouraging the member for Banks, who is articulate and quite capable as a speaker, to throw away his written speech-which was obviously prepared by someone else-and to speak with passion about a subject on which he obviously can. But, unfortunately, he disappointed us all. Thank you for your compliment, Mr Deputy Speaker Hatton. I look down forward to the contribution from my friend the member for Moncrieff.",133
254,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"I thank the minister. I think the quality of debate was improved, but the member for Banks did not need to be provided with so much urging.",133
255,Mr CIOBO,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"I am pleased to rise to put in my contribution on this debate on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005, which is part of a cognate debate with the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2005. The bill before the House is important because it helps to establish the Carnegie Mellon University's first overseas branch in Australia-in Adelaide. I am certain that that university will go on to prosper, to get a good foothold here in Australia and to go from strength to strength. In making these remarks, I would like to turn my attention to the subject matter of much of the debate in the chamber this afternoon and this evening: voluntary student unionism. There are of course provisions in this legislation that talk about the funding of services from overseas students and the ability for that to be funded by the compulsory levying of a fee. But I know that the opposition have focused on and used this as a justification for their outdated and antiquated way of thinking about the way in which students should be forced to pay for services. It was interesting to hear the member for thing Banks, who spoke immediately before me, when he said that it was so unfair and so unethical for members on this side of the House to ‘remove the dream'-to use his wordsof receiving an education. I turn to this point in particular because it is an important issue. Nobody on this side of the chamber has any interest whatsoever in denying young Australians, or indeed Australians of any age, a tiary education. No-one on this side of the chamber would begrudge any Australian seeking to obtain a tertiary education. Indeed, this government's policies have done more to facilitate young Australians and ordinary Australians undertaking additional tertiary education than those of any other government previously. The Howard government, with the stewardship of the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Brendan Nelson, have delivered in spades for those students who would like to undertake tertiary education. But the fundamental issue of whether or not Australians should be forced to join a union is central to the discussion that we are having in the chamber this evening. Fundamentally, the proposition that is advanced by those opposite, that the Australian Labor Party puts forward, is that it is part of the price of undertaking a tertiary degree-that if someone is going to university then they should expect to have to pay student union fees in the same way that members of the community are required to pay tax. But I have this question: is there some strange division between those students who are studying at university and the reasons why, it would appear, they are unable to utilise the very services that we all pay taxes for? When my monthly pay packet comes in and a good proportion goes out in tax, I would have thought that the taxes that I am paying-and that the minister at the table, Minister Hockey, and indeed all working Australians pay-go towards providing the kinds of services that students would draw upon. Certainly we provide outside school hours care. We provide child care. We provide medical care. We provide a whole range of different facilities and services, ranging from the security of our nation right through to Austudy payments which go to students themselves. These are all part of the tapestry terof government services that are provided to all Australians, including those who are undertaking tertiary degrees. Why, then, this special exemption that says, ‘In addition to that, those who study at university must pay an additional burden of taxation'? Let us call it taxation, because that is effectively what the Australian Labor Party is claiming that it is. Why must tertiary students pay this additional levy for services? If they can already utilise the services that other members of the public are utilising, why this special range of services for university students? I have not heard one member opposite advance a cogent argument as to why university services need to be singled out as some special species within our society, an argument that says, ‘You're entitled to over and above what others in the community can get, so we're going to make sure that you have these particular services available to you from university campuses.' That is the argument that those opposite put forward. But let us dig a little deeper as to the reason, perhaps, why the Australian Labor Party are wrong on this-because they are very definitely wrong on this issue. The reality is that there are a lot of ordinary, hard working Australians out there who do not have the privilege of going to university-and it is a privilege to get a tertiary education. That vast majority of Australians who do not have that privilege are denied the opportunity to have special access to services that you want to keep in place for university students. This is not about saying to university students that they cannot have them. That is not the debate. The debate is: why should they have them with no choice involved? Surely university students know whether they are getting value for money. If these services that are put forward are as great as the Australian Labor Party likes to make out that they are, then why will students not join voluntarily? If student services are so heavily utilised by the student population and so much required, then why are they not utilised in a voluntary capacity? Why is it that I and all members of the Australian public apparently have the intellectual capacity to determine what services we seek to use, yet university students do not? An arrogant Australian Labor Party says: ‘No, you don't know whether or not you're going to utilise those services, so we're going to make you pay for those services.' Let us look at what some of these services are. Some of them are good; I do not deny that. There is the gift of having childminding services available in your workplace, so to speak, which is what students are receiving when they get child care on campus. I am sure that there are many ordinary Australians who would like to have access to child care that is subsidised by others who do not use the service. I bet they would love to have access to child-care services in every workplace in this country, but it is not provided to them, because it is simply unjustifiable. Some of the services are good, but then of course there is a whole range of services that student unions provide that quite frankly cannot be justified. Take food outlets, for example. There was a complaint from a University of Queensland student, who stated: ... my purchases at the Union-owned refectories are approximately 20% more expensive than if I walk 10 minutes down the street to the nearest supermarket. The same applies to other Unionowned enterprises. Not only is the Union uncompetitive, but it actively seeks to stifle competition. In fact, the Union has regulations in place which forbid non-Union-owned enterprises from operating on Union premises, if they are in direct competition with a Union-owned enterprise ... Take buildings for example. The student union of the University of Melbourne is the case in point. It is currently under liquidation after a $44 million property deal went sour. Should our young students be involved in deals such as this $44 million property deal at Melbourne university that went into liquidation, or should university administration be responsible for these kinds of services? I have seen examples in the past of these great buildings that student unions are forced to provide because apparently, according to the member for Oxley, there is not enough funding flowing to universities. These are the kinds of consequences that we see when illprepared and ill-considered investments are made with money that, quite frankly, is easy come, easy go. I turn now to sporting facilities. Our universities have produced a great number of sporting stars over the years, and I hope this will continue for a long period. A quick look at where our student compulsory union fees are spent shows that only a very small portion of the budget is spent on sport, yet this continues to be one of the great anchors that the Australian Labor Party makes reference to. Of its approximately $7 million annual budget, the Melbourne university spends $3 million on administration and a paltry $100,000 on sporting clubs and facilities, yet this is one of the most fundamental tenets that the Australian Labor Party puts forward as to why unionism must remain compulsory for students. In my own electorate, I note that the cost of joining a sporting club at the Griffith University's Gold Coast campus is basically the same as the cost of joining a similar non-university club. So where is the great subsidisation of the costs of providing this infrastructure if students are having to pay these fees? I have looked at a number of articles that make some very interesting comments with respect to, perhaps, some of the reasons why the Australian Labor Party is so keen to defend compulsory student unionism. They are not confined to the fact that the Australian Labor Party actually believes that tertiary students have a right and, indeed, a special privilege to access services that so many others in the community would like to have easy access to. I think they have more to do with the fact that, in typical form, the Australian Labor Party harks back to looking after their union mates. In every instance, we have seen the Australian Labor Party go into bat for the union movement. Every Australian Labor Party frontbencher and just about every Australian Labor Party backbencher owe their places in this parliament to their union puppeteers. That is the reason why the Australian Labor Party is so fundamentally opposed to any moves to non-compulsory student unionism. It is not because it fears there will be a decline in services-and if there were a decline in services it would be because students did not want to utilise those services; its fear comes from the fact that students' money will no longer flow like rivers of gold into the coffers of the Australian Labor Party. On 17 March 2004 there was a very interesting article in the Australian, talking about the President of the National Union of Students. It said: In the aftermath of the Nelson reforms, the NUS is firmly on the warpath and-despite an increased Liberal presence on the national executive-has authorised a $150,000 campaign in marginal seats during the election. The campaign, which Jansen says is “the last stand” for higher education in Australia, clude radio and television advertisements, billboards and letterbox drops in six or seven marginal seats across the country. Jodie Jansen said: If the Howard Government gets in for another three years our public education system will be unrecognisable. Perhaps that is one of the motivations for the Australian Labor Party to be so dearly tied to ensuring a continuation of compulsory student unionism. Perhaps it is because there is $150,000, more money than is spent on sports facilities at Melbourne university, being pumped into marginal seat campaigns to directly benefit those members opposite. I suggest that this could provide some good incentive for the Australian Labor Party. Five or six marginal seats could have been the difference between being in government or being in opposition. Student unions are good union allies for the Australian Labor Party to have. An article by Chris Griffith in the Courier-Mail of 23 October 2000 said: Itbeing student unionsremains the training ground for our future politicians, ministerial advisers, public servants and political operatives-and what a training ground it is. Take Griffith University, the political kindergarten of several young ALP guns who became heavyweights in Labor's AWU faction and are now before the inquiry. The inquiry he is referring to was the Shepherdson inquiry that was taking place in Queensland. The article went on: First, the Young Labor Club at Griffith was the scene of violence, and at one stage disbanded, and it is alleged students made themselves available to stack key meetings of other campus organisations. There were some claims of the misuse of student resources for political purposes, such as the repeated unauthorised use of a bus for campaigning for the ALP near Currumbinwhich was a marginal state Labor seat at that will instage. The article continued: There was also a case of the improper use of university resources and letterheads in a push polling operation mounted from the university to oust non-AWU faction office bearers from a furniture union. But there also were serious claims of misappropriation, one of which led to the ing of the student council's permanent administradent tor who brought the allegation to the CJC's tion. So we see right there another reason why the Australian Labor Party is so keen to look after its union mates who are there because of the compulsory nature of student unionism. It has to do with the backroom deals that keep members opposite in their seats in this parliament. We see the money flowing from student unionism to the Australian Labor Party, we see the money that flows from student unions into maintaining key political campaigns against this government in marginal seats and, in addition to the money, we now see the way in which student unionism is used as part of the backroom deals that the Australian Labor Party makes to keep members here in this chamber. That is all part of the great tapestry that really underscores the reason why the Australian Labor Party is opposed to the disbanding of the compulsory nature of student unionism. But there is much more about student unions that I would like to share with you. On 17 December 2003, the Australian had this to say: By December 2002, Rayfor the edification of the chamber, one of the student activists at Melbourne universitywas used to getting his way. His faction had mastered the art of winning student votes by handing out food vouchers to those who cast ballots. Its questionable tactics marginalising his opponents were challenged many times, although not with any success. The student union, with more than 100 staff, a fleet of cars and access to abundant office equipdents ment and secretarial support, was a solid base from which to advance his interests as a budding young member of the Labor Right. Once again, not only do we see money flowsacking to the Australian Labor Party from stuunions, and not only do we see factional attenhacks flowing to the Australian Labor Party to engineer outcomes from student unions, but we also see student union property being used in a way that is not in the interests of students and is not in the interests of those who are working hard so that they can go to university. Quite frankly, it is in the interests of the political apparatchiks who are members of the Australian Labor Party, affiliated with the NUS, affiliated with the Australian Labor Party, and that is the reason why the Australian Labor Party is so keen to defend them. Voluntary student unionism comes down to one simple issue: whether or not Australians who are studying at university have the right to make a decision about where their $200, $300 or $400 goes, which, currently, they are compelled to pay to the student union. Ms George-They can opt out of paying.",133
256,Mr CIOBO,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"They cannot opt out of paying, because the way it is all dealt with is that, if a student decides not to pay the compulsory union fee, they pay even more. That goes to the university administration and, in turn, flows indirectly back to the student union. What we actually see is that there is not really any way at all that a student does not have to pay the student union fee. Fundamentally, there is only one simple question in all of this: do Australians have enough brains to make decisions about whether they get value for their dollar when they go to university? If the answer to that question is yes, there is no need to force them to pay. If the answer to the question of whether or not stuget value is yes, students will join student unions voluntarily in the same way they use other commercial operators and in the same way they use other services throughout the community. But if the answer to these questions is no, that is the reason why the Australian Labor Party says, ‘We must continue to compel students to join student unions.' The bills before the House tonight are straightforward bills dealing with Carnegie Mellon. But the fundamental question of student unionism is one that goes to the core of the kind of society we want. It is the kind of society that says to people, ‘Even though you're not a university student, we believe that the taxes you pay should provide certain services-services which also flow to students.' I cannot look in the eye a member of my community-one who works hard, maybe even does double shifts, has a young family to support and would dearly love to have other people subsidising services they desperately need in their workplace-and say to them that university students deserve special recognition and special university services. I cannot, in sincerity, say that to those people. What I can say is that the real issue as to why the Labor Party is behind compulsory unionism is so much deeper than what they say. (Time expired)",137
257,Mr WILKIE,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"It is obvious from the ranting that has just occurred in the speech by the member for Moncrieff that his constituents are not getting value money. I have never heard such ranting and unsubstantiated claims, particularly given that in Western Australia, for example, student unions cannot give money to political parties unless it is with the agreement of their members. He needs to go away and get his facts right before he comes in here and starts spruiking on in this parliament. I rise today to speak on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005 and the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2005-the ESOS bill. Sections of the ESOS bill will allow universities to charge fees to international students for services such as counselling, advocacy and support services. The two bills also seek to improve consumer protection measures for higher education students. The inconsistency of the Minister for Education, Science and Training, evident in aspects of these bills, is breathtaking. On the one hand, Minister Nelson is putting forward legislation that would give universities the right to charge overseas students a fee for services. But, on the other hand, the minister wants to force through legislation which would outlaw universities from charging Australian students a fee for exactly the same purpose. Of course, it now appears as though the minister's extremism has rightly caused some government members to wobble at the knees. He has clearly suffered a painful humiliation by having to delay his extreme attack on student services. This postponement of the minister's precious abolition of what he calls compulsory student unionism is the first stage in the government's abandonment of this policy, which the minister has staked his reputation on. The abandonment of the minister's position is a victory for the student guild at Curtin University in my electorate. It is a victory for for the students from regional Western Australia who study at Curtin and who rely on the services provided by the guild, both in Bentleigh and at the outward campuses. It is a victory for the parents who have returned to study in order to take on new challenges and careers and who would, had the rightwing extremists in the Liberal Party had their way, no longer have proper child-care services at the university. Unfortunately, Curtin University has had first-hand experience of the negative impact of antistudent legislation under the former Liberal state government in Western Australia. The period of ‘full-blown VSU' forced the Curtin Student Guild to focus efforts, resources and time away from supporting students and, instead, try to promote and explain what the guilds do to recruit students to become members. Not only did this reduce the time for student representatives to sit on university governance boards to focus on educational issues, but there was an overall reduction in the services which the guild could offer students. There was an increasing reliance on the goodwill of the university to provide concessions and assistance. This dependence on the university is not a desirable position for the guild to be in, particularly in relation to student advocacy. Fortunately, VSU was repealed in WA by the Gallop Labor government and this allowed the guild to return its focus to supporting students. The guild has reorganised offices and departments to make more efficient use of space and has created new positions to improve services to students. The guild is continually involved in new initiatives and aims to provide greater services to our regional satellite campus students. A few months ago Senator Alan Eggleston passed on a letter to the Prime Minister from the Chancellor of Edith Cowan University, Mr Hendy Cowan, a former leader of the Western Australian National Party and a person who is highly regarded in Western Australia. In his letter, he said the removal of collectively funded non-academic services and facilities would: ... hit students hard, particularly those from economically disadvantaged backgrounds and those who do not have ready support systems, such as the thousands of international students. Minister Nelson's full-blown approach deserves the repudiation that Mr Cowan gave in his letter. But Minister Nelson's appalling judgment should come as no surprise to those who have observed him over a long period of time. Every time the minister puts himself up as a potential leader of the Liberal Party, members opposite should consult the Bulletin of 27 April this year. Mr Farmer-I rise on a point of order. This has no relevance to the bill. In fact, it is just a direct attack on the minister.",138
258,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,There is no point of order. The amendment that has been moved is a very wide amendment. The member for Swan is in order.,139
259,Mr WILKIE,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I would have thought the minister's performance in his portfolio would also be very relevant to the task at hand. As I said before, every time the minister puts himself up as a potential leader of the Liberal Party, members opposite should consult the Bulletin of 27 April this year. In that edition of this national journal, political editor Laurie Oakes had this to say about the minister: Brendan Nelson had some strong advice for the Liberal Party when he delivered the inaugural Dame Pattie Menzies Oration recently. The first priority, he said, was that “we should not ever lose sight of what it is in which we believe”. For those who recall the federal education minister's history, it was a delicious moment. This is a man who was identified with the Labor Party for 20 years, before changing sides to win Liberal preselection for Bradfield on Sydney's North Shore, one of the safest Liberal seats in the country. A man, moreover, who-on his own admissionpublicly lied about his political loyalties. Mr Oakes went on to remind readers that",139
260,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"The member for Swan will have to withdraw that, because even in a quote you cannot accuse a member of lying.",139
261,Mr WILKIE,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"I agree with you entirely, but this is actually the minister saying that he lied. It is not a quote from Laurie Oakes; it is actually a quote from the minister, who has claimed he lied and then went on later to explain why he actually did so.",139
262,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,I would have to ask you to withdraw it at this stage.,140
263,Mr WILKIE,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"I happily withdraw it, Mr Deputy Speaker. Mr Oakes went on to remind readers: ... before he had even been elected to parliament, Nelson told journalists he wanted to be prime minister. Mr Oakes went on to say: One of the most vivid TV images of the 1993 federal election campaign was Nelson, four days before the poll, shouting at a crowd: “I have never voted Liberal in my life.” Not long after the election, he started trailing his coat for some time refused to reveal which party he wanted to represent. In 1994, the then AMA vicepresident, David Weedon, said most members of the AMA would expect Nelson to become an ALP candidate. Asked at that time if it was true that he had joined the Liberals, Nelson replied: “I'm not prepared to say ... It's like asking somebody to show you their tax return.” But the following year Nelson made his lunge for Liberal preselection, announcing that his “I have never voted Liberal” statement was a lie. He had told the lie, he said",140
264,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,The member for Swan will withdraw it again.,140
265,Mr WILKIE,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"I withdraw, Mr Deputy Speaker, but, as I said, it is his words.",140
266,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,The debate is getting fairly away from the bills themselves. I think I have been very tolerant.,140
267,Mr WILKIE,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,It is relevant to the fact that the minister for education,140
268,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,The member for Swan has no right to argue with the chair. I think he has to come back to the leave of the bill.,140
269,Mr WILKIE,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. What I am looking at here is the minister saying in schools-in our educational system-that we need to provide certain other values, which I will get onto very shortly. If the minister sees the need to espouse these values and tell others that we need to be delivering them in our schools, this is evidence that he needs to be demonstrating these values himself. If the minister is not prepared to demonstrate these values, how can he demand that schools, universities and other educational institutions be required to do so? The minister said that when he had made that statement previously he was ‘being physically jostled, abused and at one stage spat upon'. Mr Oakes went on to say: His new claim was: “I have voted Liberal in a seat, but for every election since 1987",140
270,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,The member for Swan will come back to the leave of the bill or I will sit him down.,140
271,Mr WILKIE,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"I will go on then and talk about report cards. There was a comment recently from another journalist, Matt Price, in the Australian of 26 August this year in regard to values the minister is espousing in schools and universities. In relation to this bill, the minister has made numerous state to his own performance in relation to his standards. Firstly, in terms of what the minister would like, he thinks one of the values we should have in our educational system, whether it be universities or schools, is that  wrote this in his report card: DOING YOUR BEST: Brendan knows the name and address of every backbencher's wife, child, pet and great aunt. Excellent progress",140
272,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"The member for Swan will resume his seat. Member for Swan, this is not a motion against the minister for education. If you want to move a motion against the minister for education, you can do so by a substantive motion. This is a debate on education. I ask you to come back to the bill or I will sit you down.",140
273,Mr WILKIE,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"I think that in terms of the education minister's performance in regard to his portfolio, this matter is entirely vant.",141

I go back to the names of the bills: Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005 and Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2005. As the Deputy Speaker observed earlier, they are wideranging bills. I am not wanting to argue with the Deputy Speaker, but surely the performance of the minister is relevant in delivering services to his constituency, which happens to be in this case people involved in higher education. I am merely quoting what has been put in the papers about the minister's performance in the role and his ability to do the job.",141
276,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"If the member for Swan wants to continue with that, I will sit him down.",141
277,Mr WILKIE,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"All right. But in the case of universities, we are saying, ‘We want people to have degrees.' Surely, if we are going to have a fair go-and we are talking about a fair go for students-we should look at the minister's performance. According to Matt Price, he has had two degrees. In relation to higher education",141
278,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,The member for Swan will resume his seat.,141
279,Mr HATTON,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"Blaxland) (7.00 pm)The Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005 and the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2005, which we have before us, together with amendments foreshadreleowed by the shadow minister, are specific bills with specific provisions. They are quite particular and they are unique, because they provide us with an entirely new series of potentials for Australian universities, in that they create an entirely new class of university. At the moment we have two tables of universities. There is table A, which is made up of Australian universities that are publicly funded, in the public domain and under the aegis of the states, and there is the second group, table B. There are only about three universities in there, and Bond University is one of those. The category that is to be created under these bills is a specific category that is entirely different from anything we have experienced before. Every one of the universities in tables A and B, whether public or private, has been self-accrediting. The university puts its stamp of approval on the courses it provides and puts before the Australian people. Australian governments, at both state and federal level, have allowed that to be the model we have for universities. We have also had a specific provision that, in order to run a university in Australia, or to seek to become registered as one, the person or entity wishing to establish a university must be resident in Australia. The particular provision of this bill that is entirely novel is that the existing bill is to be amended in such a way that overseas resident entities will be allowed to operate universities in Australia. The thrust behind this comes from the agreement made in 2004 between the Carnegie Mellon University from Pennsylvania and the Rann government in South Australia to seek to set up within Australia a university that would be different in the following ways. Firstly, it would be foreign owned and operated and, secondly, it would not, as all other Australian universities do, accredit its own courses. That is entirely novel for Australia, but it is not novel for the United States. The Carnegie Mellon University is one of the premier universities in the United States. Along with most others there, it does not accredit its courses-it goes to an outside body to do that. We have different operations world wide. That is why we have this other novel aspect of what is being provided here. The Rann government sought to do this for a number of reasons. They have put up $20 million over four years to attempt to establish this university. Although they have already got universities in South Australia that are doing a significant job-the University of Adelaide, for instance-they have seen a chance as a particular result, it has been argued in our background information, of the free trade agreement between Australia and the United States. It has been argued that this is probably the first instance we have of the operation of the precondition or subcondition within the free trade agreement that says that if a United States university seeks to establish itself in Australia it so, under the aegis of that free trade agreement. There was nothing in the minister's second reading speech or the explanatory memorandum in regard to that. It would be useful if the parliamentary secretary could enlighten us about whether this is the first operation of that part of the free trade agreement. We know that changing the act in order to allow Carnegie Mellon to operate here would be novel, but the specific question I am asking is whether part of the impetus for this was not just South Australia deciding they wanted to do this in order to boost their educative capacity and the income they would get from overseas students but also the fact that the free trade agreement would not merely allow this but actually prohibit us from stopping it. In the negotiations that the parliamentary secretary or the minister is aware of, was that fact raisedthat the free trade agreement would not just allow this but prohibit us from stopping any university accredited in the United States from seeking to open up here, as long as it came under the protocols that operate in Australia? The South Australians are very clear about what they want in regard to this. I will quote their objectives. Premier Rann said they wanted : doubling of South Australia's share of overseas students within 10 years, which would have a major positive impact on our state; having more of the academic programs that will help to take advantage of new economic opportunities, for instance, in the IT industry; increasing the efficiency of government through better training of our public servants, given the status of Carnegie Mellon worldwide in areas of public administration; positioning Adelaide to be Australia's leader and to be known internationally as an education city. In terms of response from the Australian can do government, there was a communication on 5 November 2004 from our embassy in Washington, so they played their part in this. Unless they just took the issue up because they knew it was happening and they were part of the process, this communication may give us a reason to say that there may be some treaty undertakings in regard to this. They said: The university would offer both US and Australian postgraduate degrees and locally accredited undergraduate degrees with courses in information technology, public administration and policy and business management. It was also planned to develop special niche faculties and an emphasis on public policy and government. That is the view from the Australian embassy in Washington on this unique proposal. What is this going to cost South Australia? That is a question that you could ask about South Australia and potentially every other Australian state. Here, there is a positive benefit expected because we have something that is entirely new. Carnegie Mellon will establish itself in the first place by offering postgraduate courses. Those postgraduate courses will be master's courses by coursework in two specific areas: IT and public policy, which are two of the strengths of this university. A question that has been raised by some who are in the higher education sector in South Australia is whether the existing providers are going to cop something in the competition provided by Carnegie Mellon and whether something will be taken out of what South Australia already has. Indeed, in the brief provided by the library, when they go to the economic implications they argue that the three existing South Australian universities generated $95.6 million from overseas student fees and $10.9 million from domestic student fees in 2003. That is not including HECS. Those sums are about 12 per cent of their revenue. It is possible that some of that could get redirected. At the moment, it is small because it is postgraduate by coursework in those specific areas. But given the expectations that this university will expand over time, and the number of local students and those coming from overseas will expand, that equation might be different. The Bills Digest argues: The economic benefit of overseas students in Australia derives more from their general living expenses than from their fee payments. For example, in 2003 total expenditure by overseas dents in Australia was estimated to be $5.1 billion. Of this amount, $1.7 billion was for higher education fees. So just like when backpackers come into Australia on holidays for a period of three months or so, it is the fact that they are here for a long period of time, it is the spending on their living expenses, that enriches the country. It is not just the direct tax payment from an organisation like Carnegie Mellon or our other providers; it is the very fact that these people have established themselves in Australia for a period of course studies. The Bills Digest finishes by arguing that the South Australian government looked at the equations and know the importance of their existing institutions. They know how strong they are and they know the quality of the computer courses being provided at the University of Adelaide. Indeed, I have a personal connection with that, given that my uncle by marriage, Professor John Ovenstone, instituted the first computer at the University of Adelaide in the 1960s. I visited him in Adelaide at that time. He was also the first person in Australia to build a defence computer here in Canberra, together with one of my other uncles by marriage, David Alexander. They were involved academically and militarily after the Second World War and through into the 1960s in building capacity within that area. I was about 14 when my uncle gave me advice about this. It was in the late 1960s and he was at the very forefront of his academic capacity. He had put his age down and fought in World War II in the RAAF. When they found out about him in other services, he went with my auntie Thelma to the United Kingdom. He did his PhD at Cambridge and then came back to do the computer work that he did in Australia. When he put that first computer into Adelaide University, it took maybe half the size of this chamber to house stuthat valve-driven computer. It was immensely important for Adelaide as a university in trying to sell itself to Australia and the rest of the world and in establishing itself as a better institution of higher learning. He could only have had a slight grasp of just what tremendous changes would take place after him, given the quality of his students and the rapidity with which he expected things to change in the computing and information technology area. In terms of foreign entrants coming into Australia, the possibility of moneys working their way back out of Australia is a cause for concern. But if you take the example of a range of other institutions that we haveforeign companies in the pharmaceutical area and so on, established institutions that are embedded in the fabric of society-they are bringing foreign capital into Australia to pand our capacity. They are not just competitive but complementary to the things that we do. They can be a generator for greater activarguing ity and greater income for Australia over time. I hope and trust that that is what this amendment will lead to-a bigger, stronger and more diverse education sector that is capable of earning more for the country. I would also trust in the quality of this university when I look at the background material and the comparators between Carnegie Mellon and the ANU. The ANU is the only university in Australia that can match this institution on the world stage in rankings-whoever is doing those rankings. Hopefully, there will be a pursuit of excellence here academically through this infusion and a reinvigoration of the quality of teaching and research at our universities. This is particularly important because over quite a considerable period of timedespite interventions by the former minister for education, Dr Kemp, in the areas acy and numeracy, and despite the state governments finally getting the message and returning to the basics in those areas-we have had a fundamental problem. The fundamental problem is the literacy of our students throughout our education system, running all the way to our university system. In my view, the one great thing that President George W Bush did in his first four years in the White House was to mandate the teaching of phonics in junior school to ensure that the erosion of literacy in the United States could be stemmed and that the US could be put back onto a solid educational foundation. I think we need to do the same thing here because, for over three decades or more, we have seen the erosion of literacy within our population. During our last period in government-from 1984 on, when John Dawkins was minister for education and foexcused on bringing foreign students into Australia to boost our capacity and to earn income for Australia-our strongest suit was the quality of education in Australia; we can still argue that well. However, I have the strong view that that quality of education has been diminished because people have been able to play at teaching people how to read and write and it has not been done well enough or effectively enough. Universities and institutions in Australia, one after the other, have fallen under the impress of being forbidden to test people in grammar, usage and literacy. Professor Naguib Kanawati, a world expert in Egyptian archaeology at Macquarie University, who has 52 PhD students under him, has told me of his frustration with the fact that literate PhD theses are not required. I think this diminishing of the quality of education in Australia is fundamentally wrong and must be addressed within the whole education system of Australia if we are to maintain the of literstrengths that we have had. There has been-and I know this from having been in the chair previously-a wider debate here than the one I have canvassed in relation to the specifics of this bill. The wider debate has gone to the prefigured amendment by the shadow minister. It has pulled in the question: where do we go? There is a contradiction in the ESOS bill between the provisions for overseas students and the prospective provisions in the VSU legislation, which the government wanted to have passed in both houses of parliament by the end of the year so that student fees would be entirely voluntary in the 2006 calendar year. We know now, given the minister's backdown, that that is not going to happen. Part of the reason or probably the key impetus for that is that there is a complete disjunction in this very bill that we are looking at, because overseas students are expectedit is demanded of them in this bill-to pay student service fees for a whole range of normal activities that domestic students would be forbidden to pay by VSU. I do not want to go through this at great length or in great depth; indeed, I do not have the time but, more importantly, I think it is one of the most minor issues one could conceive of. Given the nature and the intensity of the debate we have had about not only these bills but also these amendments, for the life of me I cannot see why passions are raised so much about this issue. I went to university. I had to win a Commonwealth scholarship to get there. I got there and I worked hard. In 1970, in my first year at the University of New South Wales, for five nights a week, after completing my courses, I drove to the Boydett Holdens building in Kings Cross and, along with one of my uncles, cleaned for five hours a night. I own way through university by winning my way there, but that just covered the fees. To survive, buy the necessary books et cetera, I worked throughout the period I was at uni. I did not avail myself of most of the student services that were provided. However, I do understand that these originally medieval institutions, these self-enclosed placesuniversities-have a very long history of providing services for themselves. For a range of students, both local and international, providing those services in one spot can be very efficient and very effective. So I paid the money-I did not like to do it; many other people did not like to do itand it was a case of one in, all in. I thought, ‘Well, you have to cop it, even if you are not using all of it, because others would.' Societies actually work on the same sort of model. But the discussion and debate here underline the fact that there is an almost complete preoccupation on the part of some from both sides on this issue and on the drivers behind it. It is a case of them almost reliving their student past. I have been in the Labor Party for 38 years, but I was never in a student body or one of the labour clubs, because I was working too hard. I was in the real party, the real part of it. I think you can argue that being involved in that on both sides can have a festering effect, which I do not think is entirely healthy. From what we have seen in this debate, particularly from those on the government side, many of whom made their careers on being against voluntary student unionism, you can see the deleterious effect of that fundamental preoccupation. I think this is an interesting move in terms of Carnegie Mellon and I commend the bill to the House. (Time expired)",141
280,Mr HAYES,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"It gives me great pleasure to rise and support the amendment moved by the shadow minister for education and training to the Higher paid my Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005, as it gives me the opportunity to make some comments on an issue that is pretty dear to the hearts of many students in my electorate and certainly in my local area. Student unionism has been under attack by members of this government for many years. It seems that it has been and will be under attack for many years to come, if events have been accurately reported in the media this morning. Certainly, the Minister for Education, Science and Training has suffered a humiliating setback on his road to leadership, as he has had to all but abandon his desire to implement voluntary student unionism. Since first coming into this place some six months ago, I have had my name down to contribute to the debate on VSU, but I have not had the opportunity to express my views and those of my constituents because the minister has seen fit not to bring the debate on. Today the situation has changed, not because of actions of the minister but because of actions of the coalition's backbench. Quite frankly, the minister has been playing with the lives of students and staff for the last 12 months, and on this occasion he has lost. I know that at many campuses planning was not able to take place. Students were not certain if they would have all the services that they have become accustomed to and they certainly do not know about their availability into the future, because of the government's dillydallying with this VSU legislation. While my electorate of Werriwa sadly does not contain a university campus within its boundaries, there are a great many students who reside in the electorate and who attend the Campbelltown campus of the University of Western Sydney just down the road. While it may not be the largest campus in Australia, the Campbelltown campus of the University of Western Sydney has a strong student body supported by highquality staff and excellent student services. is also a rapidly growing campus. It is set to open a new medical school in the not-toodistant future. This will be a welcome addition to the university's campuses, which already boast a strong reputation in relation to law, business, teaching, nursing and the arts. In addition to the high quality of staff at the university, students are supported by an excellent student association. The staff of the association have been worried over the past few months because this on again, off again attempt to implement the minister's dream of voluntary student unionism has undermined their ability to plan and to make arrangements for the future. For them, the introduction of VSU would most likely result in student services being shut down. VSU would mean that services provided by the student association that are relied upon would no longer be there to support students. For some that might not seem like much, but I have to say that for students from Western Sydney who are on a tight budget under this government's so-called reforms, which have made it virtually impossible to obtain adequate financial support, those student services mean a great deal. Services offered to students at the Campbelltown campus include such things as second-hand books, lab coats, cheap photocopying services, fax services, discounted stationery and the printing of lecture notes through various arrangements with the respective faculties. In a student's life, all of those things are essential. Labor's amendment would mean a continuation of these vital services. It is appropriate that this amendment is moved when we are also considering the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2005, because that legislation also expresses the hypocrisy of this government when it comes to the university secIt tor. The Prime Minister has already been exposed in his own hypocrisy on universities after claiming that he would not introduce $100,000 degrees. This was blown out of the water with the introduction of a system under which there are now dozens of $100,000 degrees in existence. The hypocrisy of the Minister for Education, Science and Training was exposed in June this year when he admitted to the Four Corners program his view that a university education was a privilege. This legislation exposes the hypocrisy of the entire government when it comes to the university sector. The Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2005 would allow universities to charge fees to international students for such things as counselling, advocacy and support services. These are services that would be denied to local students under the government's VSU proposal-services that the minister would prefer to deny to local students. It is staggering that, on one hand, the minister is willing to introduce and strongly support a bill that would allow universities to charge fees for services to overseas students, while on the other hand he wants to outlaw fees being charged for those same types of services to local students. I should not be shocked by the prospect of such a system being introduced, because it is yet another example of the Howard government's two-tiered approach. Two-tiered systems seem to be the order of the day with this government. From my perspective, it almost borders on an obsession. We have two-tiered systems in Medicare, in the PBS, in industrial relations, in education and now in student services. Whilst I am staggered, I am certainly not all that surprised. The minister has only one choice when it comes to fixing the problems that he seems intent on creating, and that is to abandon his VSU legislation. The legislation continues to appear on the draft list of legislation to be debated but when push comes to shove it is withdrawn by the minister as he retreats to his office. He is obviously busy making phone calls to round up a few more votes to pass this legislation through the Senate. I certainly congratulate those members of the coalition who have decided not to support VSU. It shows that there is some common sense about just how important student services are to the people who use them. I know that students who reside in my electorate will genuinely appreciate the positions now being taken. It also shows how effective the university sector, student organisations, regional communities, sporting groups and the arts community have been in opposing this legislation. They know how much damage it would do to services such as child care, sporting clubs, counselling services and other student advocacy services. I have an example with me today of what might happen to one of those services. On 8 September this year the University of Western Sydney issued a media release congratulating two of its students who assisted the Australian women's basketball team to win a bronze medal in the summer World University Games in Turkey this year. Belinda Battistel and Ali Hudson, both of whom study at the University of Western Sydney at the Campbelltown campus, were the only two students from a university in New South Wales to represent their country in those games.

281,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 7.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Human Rights",147
282,Mr GARRETT,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise in the House to reflect on the attitude and the track record of the Howard government in relation to the issue of human rights and democratic freedoms-rights and freedoms which Australians enjoy and, at the least, ought to expect to be present and protected in a liberal democracy. This is a call to members opposite as well as those on this side who think and care about these issues to consider their involvement in the many contemporary debates concerning human rights that occur in this place and, most critically, the involvement of the first law officer, the Attorney-General. If we begin at habeas corpus and proceed through the known history of the evolution of democracy and the rule of law, the development of the common law and international law to the enlarged notion of a suite of rights we now take for granted, a citizen might assume that freedom is just another word for the Australian way of life. They would be wrong-whether the matter concerns the unlawful treatment of Australian citizens by DIMIA so comprehensively recorded in the recent Comrie report; the dismantling of an independent tribunal which recognised the collective rights of Australians to join together to seek fair conditions in employment, now under way in the proposed changes to the industrial relations system; or the fate the Australian David Hicks, who has been stripped of any genuine legal clothing and left without proper legal recourse, effectively in limbo, overseas. It seems that we are the only democratic country to cast a citizen adrift in this way. If we consider these things, but particularly the fate of those who find themselves at the mercy of a government department whose culture for administering immigration has been described by the words ‘failure', ‘inexcusable', ‘catastrophic', ‘dereliction of duty', ‘shameful episode', ‘defying common sense and decency' and ‘dehumanised', we are left with the indelible impression that, for the government, which has responsibility for the protection of political and legal rights, such rights are no longer considered the universal assets of the citizen in this mocracy. For this government, they are merely pieces of institutional and historical furniture that can be moved around at will provided you have the power to do so. And the notion of ministerial responsibility for the actions of those who serve under you means absolutely nothing. At this point it is always necessary vide a strong caveat to the effect that, notwithstanding the presumed guilt or innocence of any person, no matter how repugnant the activities of a person or group might be, these fundamental principles of our democratic system-principles of equality before the law, the presumption of innocence, the right to a fair trial and so on-need to be vigorously defended. Well, yes, Mr Speaker, and that is the task of members of parliament. Some members here and in the Senate have performed that task. It is the task of lawyers, judges, commentators and others, but it is primarily the task of the first law officer of the Crown, in this case the Attorney-General. It is time to call him to account. The Attorney-General has played a central of role in all the critical matters affecting rights-children in detention, the incarceration of Hicks, the role of DIMIA in relation to the deportation of Vivian Alvarez and the treatment of Cornelia Rau and the framing of antiterrorism legislation. In each of these instances, and in many others, his has not been a voice defending rights. No, his actions have been those of a man willing to see rights prescribed and reduced, the currency devalued, and ultimately the citizen denied. When the previous Director-General of ASIO was asked whether he was satisfied that he had sufficient rights to do the job, he replied in the affirmative. The Attorney General did not celebrate this fact. When a former Liberal Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, remarked that proposed antiterrorism legislation is ‘contrary to the rule of law', ‘to due deprocess' and ‘to the basic rights we have come to understand are central to a free and open society', there was nothing from the Attorney-General. When the Dean of the Monash University Law Faculty described control orders as eroding the presumption of innocence, we did not hear from the Attorney-General on the need to consider those to procomments-to consider very carefully the implications of whether we ought or ought not to have legislation that amplified existing restrictions on civil liberties. It may be that there are compelling reasons to overthrow a number of long standing legal principles which have stood the test of time and safeguarded our freedoms, but their elected champion in this House has chosen not to fulfil his duties as first law officer open the issue up for debate and consideration on the grounds of the primary functions these freedoms have in our society. It is clearly time for us to now consider a bill of rights. Even more importantly, it is time for the Attorney-General to stand up for the legal rights and principles that underpin democracy in Australia. National Mental Health Week",147
283,Mrs MARKUS,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight in support of National Mental Health Week, which is held this week. National Mental Health Week is a timely reminder of the importance of providing highquality care to patients and those diagnosed with mental illness. It is an opportunity for us to reflect on the treatment we provide as a nation and opportunities to improve that care. Nearly one in five Australian adults experience mental illness in a 12-month period-an enormous number of people, who deserve the best care possible. I would like to take a few moments to examine the important commitments that the Australian government has made to funding mental health. In 2003 all states and territories agreed to the National Mental Health Strategy 2003-08 with a view to reforming mental health care delivery across the country. In July this year all health ministers undertook to revise national mental health policy. This review is set to take a whole-ofgovernment approach to the issues facing mental health. This includes acknowledging the role a variety of sectors play in addressing the mental health of people-sectors such as housing, education, welfare and justice. I am pleased to see the states committing to review mental health service delivery, but remind them-and particularly the New South Wales Labor government-that their participation must be meaningful and that and they must be willing to address the severe service delivery shortages in the state. It is unfortunate that New South Wales continues to lag behind other states and that its investment in mental health is sorely lacking. To highlight just how poor the New South Wales government's record is on issues of mental health it is instructive to compare the measures being undertaken by this Australian government. We are a government that is committed to really examining the issue of mental health and the impact of mental illness on the community. We are a government that is committed to reviewing our service provision and making improvements where necessary. To demonstrate this sort of commitment let me draw the attention of the House to a few of the programs being undertaken by the Australian government. In the 2005-06 budget this government committed $69 million through to June 2009 to assist young people with mental health problems. This program includes important measures that address the impact of drug and alcohol abuse and its relationship with mental illness. It is critical that we address this relationship in depth and understand the link between drug abuse and mental illness, particularly for our young people. The Better Outcomes in Mental Health Care program funding has been expanded with $142 million over four years. This program will assist general practitioners to address the mental health needs of their patients. The national depression initiative acknowledges that one in five people will experience depression at some point in their life. The Australian government has therefore committed an extra $39.6 million to beyondblue, for them to continue their vital work in the community. The range of initiatives that the Australian government are supporting continue. There are improved frameworks for combating mental illness in young people. There is a national youth mental health initiative to support the primary care system in the detection, early intervention and ongoing management of young people with mental illness. Sadly, not all governments in this country see the importance of addressing mental illness. In particular, I want to take the opportunity to draw the House's attention to the appalling neglect of mental health issues by the New South Wales Labor government. It is no surprise that mental health is on the New South Wales government's list of issues with ‘neglected' marked next to it. The New South Wales government is consistently at or near the bottom of the list in interstate comparisons on funding and services in mental health-at or near the bottom of the list in funding and service delivery for mental health, in a state where people are crying out for assistance and services. Rather than address the issue, the Labor government has buried its head in the sand. Despite a change of Premier-who used to be the health minister, let us not forget-things have not improved at all. In the aftermath of the deinstitutionalisation after the Richmond report was released we face a situation whereby people who require assistance very often cannot find the treatment they require. Mental health facilities in New South Wales are inadequate, run down and not able to cope with the reality of the situation. In New South Wales there are 14.3 mental health beds per 100,000 people, the worse performance of any state or territory bar one. New South Wales has only 81 full-time equivalent direct care staff employed in specialised mental health services per 100,000 people. That figure is completely unacceptable. This week is National Mental Health Week. This is the perfect opportunity for the New South Wales state Labor government and the Premier, who was health minister, to finally make a commitment to the people of New South Wales who require care and treatment.

284,Ms OWENS,ADJOURNMENT,"Parramatta) (7.40 pm)The member for Greenway called the New South Wales state government the ‘bottom of the list' on mental health funding. She forgot to mention that the federal government provides less money than the states to mental health funding. So if we are talking about the bottom of the list, I think the federal government is actually on it at the moment. She also talked about $69 million in funding for mental health for young people. It is an impressive figure. But in my mind the image still flashes of a $100 million propaganda bill being spent at the moment. The $69 million for young people pales in significance to that propaganda bill. This week is National Mental Health Week. It is a time to talk about mental health and the people who suffer from mental illness; not a time for blame-shifting between state and federal governments. Let me tell the member for Greenway that, when I am out talking to my electorate, nobody out there cares whether it is a state or federal matter-it is a disaster and they want it fixed. After 9½ years in government it is about time that the federal government took its role seriously and played a leadership role in this. Mrs Markus interjecting",150

286,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The member for Parramatta has the call.,151
287,Ms OWENS,ADJOURNMENT,"It is the Howard government's responsibility, not the Labor opposition's, to lead in this area. Mr Fitzgibbon-She should apologise.",151
288,Ms OWENS,ADJOURNMENT,"I would not bother asking for one. Mental Health Week is an event that recognises one of the most serious, perhaps the most serious, health issue in Australiamental illness. It is an event that focuses tention on people in our society who are, in many cases, isolated and ignored. It is an event that recognises a problem that, in spite of a National Mental Health Strategy that dates back over a decade, is still chronically under-resourced. In my electorate of Parramatta some of the outward signs of mental illness are quite visible through the homeless people that live in and around the CBD, who are attracted there because of the activity. But the issue of mental illness is much broader. It is estimated that 18 per cent of adults have experienced a mental health disorder. This represents an increase over recent years in both highand low-prevalence disorders. With the many people with mental illness that I have come to know, I find it timely and appropriate that the theme for National Mental Health Week this year is ‘Family, Friends and Intimate Relationships'. We all talk about community a lot, but the reality for most of us is that, rather than belonging to a large community, we belong to a series of microcommunities-our families, our workplaces, the local school or church, our or even through interaction with our local shopkeepers and neighbours. Through those microcommunities we are networked into the larger community. If the nature of a person's illness is such that they cannot maintain themselves in those microcommunities, they fall through the cracks-unnoticed, isolated, lonely, they very often deteriorate and may end up homeless, in jail or worse. So it is important in Mental Health Week to recognise the importance of resourcing the organisations that provide those microcommunities for those who cannot sustain their relationships elsewhere. There is a fine example of such a conatstructed microcommunity in my electorate of Parramatta. The Parramatta Leisure Club, run by Parramatta Mission, the Schizophrenia Fellowship and Sydney West Area Health Service, provides a place where people can meet and interact. It provides a highly effective support structure for people living with mental illness. Members and staff meet in a social environment and decide together the nature of leisure activities. The Parramatta Leisure Centre has 433 clients and a staff of just four. That is over 100 clients for each staff member. It offers people a place to go, where members are comfortable and in control, and a sense of belonging. Perhaps most importantly, through the staff it offers someone just to notice if things start going wrong-a small group of people who notice the changes in behaviour that might precede a deterioration. Members are in regular contact with people who care about the well-being of the individuals and know enough about them to provide real human support if things go wrong. It is such a simple thing, that sense of belonging, but it makes a critical difference to friends people suffering from mental illness. The real tragedy in our current mental health system is that when we shut down the institutions the resources did not follow the people as they moved back into our community. Since the early 1990s, in the absence adequate care and with the failure of the money to follow the need, significant concerns have been raised about problems with deinstitutionalisation, including vagrancy, poverty, homelessness, increased care burden on families and increased inappropriate involvement of mentally ill people in the criminal justice system.

289,Mrs DRAPER,ADJOURNMENT,"This week being National Mental Health Week, I feel it is appropriate to talk about the work being done in my electorate of Makin by DRUG ARM Australasia. I would like to note that we have the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing, the member for Sturt, in the chamber this evening. Recently the Get Set program launched its CD within my electorate of Makin. The CD was created by a group of young people who wanted to use their personal experiences to teach their peers and the community about the harms and risks associated with illicit drugs. Get Set is a valuable program which has been implemented as a strategy within DRUG ARM. I have informed the House on previous occasions about DRUG ARM, which, for those people who are not aware, stands for Drug Awareness and Relief Movement. DRUG ARM is a national, nongovernment, non-profit drug and alcohol agency founded upon basic Christian principles that I have supported and been involved with since around 2000. It was in 2000 that the South Australian coordinator, Ms Bianca Moerman, conveyed to me the work the agency does with individuals, families and the entire community who have in some way experienced the harm and destruction gal substances. Apart from the many other services and programs DRUG ARM impleof ments, it saw the strong need for a young people's project addressing drug misuse in the community. With the support of the organisation and federal funding, DRUG ARM was able to implement a peer education strategy to meet this vital need. The aim of Get Set is to identify and bring together young people already at risk from their illicit drug use and encourage these people to build strategies to develop protective factors within their communities. Get Set's operational procedure is to work with and support young people who in the past have misused illicit drugs. Through these young people, and the projects within their communities, DRUG ARM aims to deliver peer education strategies to empower a greater number of young people to make informed decisions about their lives and behaviours surrounding drug use. In December last year, a group of young people engaged in Get Set created their vision on how to use their personal experiences to teach their peers. That vision was sharing their stories in a book and a CD that they are now publishing and have produced entirely amongst themselves. Their commitment to that vision has had them turn up each week for the past eight months to workshops and group sessions and support each other to have this vision come to life. Not only did these weekly group sessions focus on the peer education strategy; they were also a powerful tool in stabilising their lives and drug use. Inside this group they developed a sense of belonging, they created a peer group of support where drug use is not accepted and they have participated in a positive and constructive community project. This has not only allowed them to achieve what they set out to achieve but also given of ille- them purpose and empowerment. These young people stood up and delivered their project to their peers, their community and their families. The weeks of workshopping, writing their own stories, making them into lyrics and creating music that other people would listen and relate to finally came together. Their CD was launched and it has been an amazing success. They could relate standing together in front of an audience to taking the stand in front of their peers and saying no to using drugs. It would be remiss of me to speak on this issue without applauding the Howard government's Tough on Drugs policy. Since 1997, the government has allocated more than $1 billion to its national strategy illicit drugs-Tough on Drugs. This strategy focuses on combining the efforts of individuals, families, businesses, community organisations, law enforcement agencies and government to contribute to fighting the drug problem. It is an integrated plan that comprehensively addresses law enforcement, prevention, treatment and education. The latest National Drug Strategy household survey revealed that, in the three years to 2001, there was an extraordinary 23 per cent reduction in the proportion of people using illicit drugs. The implementation of Tough on Drugs has also contributed to a reduction in the number of heroin deaths among 15to 44-year-olds, falling from 958 deaths in 1999 to 364 in 2002-a decline of more than 62 per cent. I would like to acknowledge the combined efforts of DRUG ARM, the Howard government and the city of Tea Tree Gully. (Time expired)",152
290,Mr JENKINS,ADJOURNMENT,"Scullin) (7.50 pm)Tonight I want to mention a four-letter word that is hardly ever mentioned in this chamber at the moment: Iraq. In the review of the House of Representatives Annual Report 2002-03, the Clerk talks about the 71 hours of debate on Iraq in that financial year. We had two substantive motions: six months before hostilities commenced, in September 2002, about 85 members of the House spoke; and six weeks before hostilities commenced, in February 2003, 132 of the 150 members of this place spoke in the debate. Since then, what have been the contributions on this important and ongoing subject? In 2005, there have been nine speakers on a ministerial debate on Iraq. In that ministerial statement the Prime Minister indicated the Australian task group deployment of 450 troops to Al Muthanna province in southern Iraq to work closely with the Japanese-Iraq against construction support group. Last year, in 2004, there were two MPIsone in May, with four speakers; and one in March, with four speakers. In grievance debates, member statements and adjournment speeches, there were five contributions. In June 2004, there was another MPI, in which there were five speakers. In 2003, after hostilities in Iraq were supposed to have finished, there were 12 speeches in grievance statements, adjournments and private members' speeches. There were six contributions to an important debate following the terrorist attack on the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad. Why have contributions on this important subject dropped off? The analysis of the Iraq situation indicates that 1,950 members of the United States military have died since the beginning of the war in March 2003-1,500 of them in hostile action. Some 14,900 US servicemen have been wounded. In addition, Iraq 96 of the United Kingdom's military have died and there have been 102 fatalities from the military forces of other countries. Damning evidence about Iraqi civilian casualties has been collected. It is estimated by the best methods that around 25,000 people have died. In May, the Oxford Research Group estimated the number to be 24,865. Some 37 per cent of those deaths were at the hands of the US and coalition military forces. Some 30 per cent of the civilian casualties occurred between March and May 2003. On average, 34 Iraqis met a violent death every day between March 2003 and May 2005. If there is to be the continuing involvement of over 1,000 Australian Defence Force personnel in Iraq or in the region, we need to consider our expectations of the outcomes of continued deployment in Iraq. An interesting report on an allied matter was produced by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, called Weapons of mass destruction: Australia's role in fighting proliferation-practical responses to new challenges. There would be merit in this parliament discussing the report. It confirms that the weapons of mass destruction that were used as an excuse for going into Iraq did not exist. Hence it is time that this government brought forward another motion. If it was good enough to have 71 hours of debate before we went into Iraq, and we are still there 2½ years later, why don't we have a fullyfledged debate on this subject? Why is it that we do not discuss the outcomes? Why is it that, 2½ years later, Australia is still involved? What is Australia's exit strategy? Is there a risk of a fully-fledged civil war between the Shia and the Sunni? Now that we have been into Iraq with the other coalition partners, has it increased the chances of Iraq being a training ground for terrorists? (Time expired)",153

294,Mr FITZGIBBON,ADJOURNMENT,"Hunter) (7.56 pm)I was flabbergasted during question time today when the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, in response to a dorothy dixer from his backbench, wanted to celebrate the fact that the New South Wales government had decided to sign the AusLink agreement. The New South Wales government has been reluctant to sign the AusLink agreement for a number of reasons, but two stand out. The first is the fact that the Commonwealth government is using the AusLink agreement, like so many other processes in this place, to tie funding to certain conditions. In this case, to give just one example, it was to impose the Commonwealth government's industrial relations agenda on the New South Wales government's tenders for roadworks in that state. Just as importantly, despite what the government says, for the New South Wales government the AusLink document is nothing like a good financial deal. I remind the House of the arrangement. For the first time in more than three decades, the Commonwealth has unilaterally decided that there will not be a national highway project in this country. Up until now, there has been a national highway project. The Commonwealth has been responsible for the funding of the national highway project, and the states and territories have taken care of the balance of the road networks in each of their states. The Commonwealth has suddenly decided that there will not be a national highway network. The Commonwealth would rather put its investment into the areas where it thinks it will get the best political return. As a consequence, the Commonwealth now expects the state governments to put money into road networks which traditionally form part of the national highway network. This is not a net benefit to the New South Wales government in financial terms. Let me give you the best example of all. Mr Speaker, if I had not been officially warned by you during question time, I would have had something to say about this at that time. I challenged the minister for transport to tell us what is happening with the link road between the F3 Freeway, at the northern end, and the New England Highway, north of Branxton. This is an important transport link for the Hunter community. In fact, the Hunter's mayors unanimously agreed that this is the most important piece of transport infrastructure that will ever be built in the Hunter. When the Howard government was elected in 1996, we were entitled to believe with great confidence that this road would be constructed by 2005. Hunter residents, and all those residents that pass through the Hunter region on their way north or south, would have used this road. Until recently it was believed that the F3 link to Branxton would cost about $320 million to construct. Alas, when you keep putting off a project because of funding cuts, the project gets more expensive. I have been warning for a while that the project costs were blowing out, and it has now been confirmed that the cost of the project has blown out to some $750 million. The Commonwealth government say: ‘We are committed to this road project. Some $253 million has been earmarked within AusLink. Therefore, our slate is clean. We are showing a commitment to this project.' But $253 million out of a $750 million project is a pittance. Where does the minister for transport think the balance of the funds will come from? He is surely not suggesting that the New South Wales government has the resources to find some $500 million to construct this important road project.",154
