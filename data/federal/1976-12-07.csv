Budget 1976-77 To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That; the Budget will increase unemployment to unprecedented and crisis proportions at a time when hundreds of thousands of Australians, especially school-leavers, young workers and apprendces, are without work; The Budget completes the dismantling of Medibank as a PETITIONS simple, effective universal health insurance scheme, providing basic coverage for the total community; The Budget, by its heavy cuts in urban and transport programs, will worsen the quality of life available to many Australians; The Budget will compel state governments to reduce their services and increase charges; The Budget reduces spending on Aboriginal affairs by 30 per cent and returns expenditure on Aborigines to pre-1972 days; The Budget seriously disadvantages migrant groups, most notably in employment and health, and leaves room for concern over the future of ethnic radio; The Budget, despite the government's earUer rhetoric about defence threats to Australia, continues to hold the size of the armed services at present levels; and the Budget, despite all the above, still cannot be expected to reduce Australia's annual inflation rate below twelve per cent; Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the 1976 Budget be redrafted to provide for economic recovery within the guide-lines laid down by the Australian Labor Government's I97S Budget And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Charles Jones, Mr Les MCMahon and Mr Antony Whitlam. Petitions received. Governor General To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That, although we accept the verdict of the Australian people in the 1975 election, we do not accept the right of a Governor General to dismiss a Prime Minister who maintains the confidence of the House of Representatives. We believe that the continued presence of Sir John Kerr as Governor General is a cause of division among the Australian people. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your honourable House will call on Sir John Kerr to resign as Australian Governor General. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Charles Jones and Mr Les MCMahon. Petitions received. Telephone Services To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Respresentatives in Parliament assembled.

And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Bungey. Petition received. Australian Broadcasting Commission To the Speaker and the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That many Australians are concerned by the fact that the onset of daylight saving time in the southern States makes it impossible for many people in Queensland to hear certain current affairs programs of the Austrahan Broadcasting Commission. We your petitioners do therefore humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government require the Australian Broadcasting Commission to make appropriate adjustments to its programming so as to allow such programs to be more widely heard in Queensland.

And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. byDr Cass. Petition received. Nature Reserves in the Australian Capital To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned in the Divisions of Fraser and Canberra respectfully showeth: That in response to the National Capital Development Commission proposals for urban development of the foothills of Mount Ainslie and Mount Majura we wish to make it known that we are opposed to any urban development of these foothills beyond that which already exists, for the following reasons. 1. The foothills are important to Canberra as a city with an outstanding international reputation for promoting balance between urban development and the preservation of environments which complement that development, a balance which would be lost if urban development is permitted to extend any higher on the foothills. 2. The area is of significant scenic value as an integral pan of the Walter Burley Griffin Canbena plan, a plan which has been adopted by Canberra's citizens and which embodies the concept of a garden city; the natural bushland of the foothills being a vital element of that concept. 3. Having this unique woodland area in the centre of the National Capital provides a readily accessible facility which enables people to identify with what remains of their bushland hentage. 4. The foothill woodlands have considerable educational value in theirflora,fauna, geology and geography in close proximity to students of diverse age in the formal and informal education process. This value will increase as Canberra 's population increases. 5. The foothills have recreational value to a wide range of people for trail walks, school outings, children's recreation and development, leisurely walks for more elderly residents, for fitness and training exercises, for orienteering and for relaxation and retreat from the pressures of urban life. This recreational value will increase particularly if areas in old Canbena as it now exists are developed to house a larger population. 6. The foothills remain one of the best surviving examples of Eucalyptus melliodora and Eucalyptus blakelyi woodland. 7. The foothills and the mountain together form an environment which sustains special members of Australia's fauna, the grey kangaroo and swamp wallaby, which can be frequently observed grazing on the foothills. The area is in practice an open faunareservein the heart of the National Capital. 8. Canbena residents and local residents in particular have come to appreciate the foothills as a permanent element in the landscape of their city. Local residents in particular have made investments and lifelong decisions on the basis of the permanence of the bushland which exists at this time on the foothills. 9. The foothills are a unique and irreplaceable property asset to the community as a whole, an asset which should not be transferred to a very small minority as would occur if urban development is permitted. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government recognise the recreational, educational and environmental value to the Canberra community and to the National Capital of the bushland of the Mount Ainslie, Mount Majura area of which the foothills form a vital and integral pan and that the Government takes measures to ensure that there is noresidential,commercial, roadway or other urban infrastructural development beyond that which Territory already exists on these foothills and that the Government takes measures to ensure the preservation of this area as a nature reserve for the benefit of the present and future generations. citizens of Canberra and electors by Mr Fry. Petition received. Australian Capital Territory Mental Health Ordinance To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectively showeth. We, the undersigned, including the Citizen's Commission on Human Rights, believe that the Mental Health Ordinance proposed for the Australian Capital Territory contains various clauses which should be reviewed immediately. These clauses include: Definitions of mental disorder/illness which are vague enough to allow a psychiatrist to exen arbitrary judgment on who is or is not actually ill. The section dealing with control of standards of treatment could be employed to stop faith healers, naturopaths, lay counsellors and others who play a very important part in society. The section authorising police and ambulance officers to enter any dwelling to seize any person is a breach of privacy. The section dealing with compulsory treatment of minors should be amended as it makes it simple for a psychiatrist parental consent. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that this Ordinance be reviewed and submissions be requested from interested groups so as to ensure that the Ordinance when finally drafted does protect the interests of psychiatric patients. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Haslem. Petition received. To the Speaker and the House of Representatives in Parliaschool ment assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens Australia respectfully showeth that many Australians are concerned at the recent outbreak of racial riots and killings in South Africa. We your petitioners do therefore Australian Government: (1) Call upon the South African Government to eliminchestra, ate apartheid and racial discrimination; (2) Withdraw the Australian Trade Commissioners from South Africa in accordance with the UN resolution 341 !G(December 1975). And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Haslem. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned showeth: (a) That the use of uranium as a source of energy is currently unacceptable radioactive waste, military implications and environmental degradation. (b) That there can, at present, be no assurances that radioactive materials exported for peaceful purposes will not be used in the production of nuclear weapons. (c) That there is not, as yet, any known safe method of disposing of radioactive wastes, nor is there likely to be. (d) That the export of uranium tionally irresponsible and is not, in the long term, of benefit to Australia. (e) That the export of uranium from Australia discourages importing countries from investing research and development funds in finding viable alternatives. (f) That only the overdeveloped industrial nations will benefit from Australian uranium and the gap between these countries and the energy-starved third world will increase yet further. (g) That the securing of land rights by Australian Aborigines, promised by successive governments, is prejudiced by uranium mining. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Government will immediately cease the mining and prohibit the export of uranium until perfectly safe methods of final disposal for radioactive wastes have been guaranteed; will greatly increase expenditure on research into safe, clean and inexhaustible sources of energy; and will aid underdeveloped countries in their efforts to secure a fair share of the world's energy resources, while at the same time honouring its obligations to the future of humanity. to commit or treat minors without And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray,  Petition received.

The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth: citizens of Australia respectfully That the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill 1976, does not satisfy the Aboriginal needs for land in the Northern Territory. as it presents problems including Your petitioners most humbly pray that the House of Representatives, in Parliament assembled, should: 1. Extend the freeze on European claims to the unalienated crown lands of the Northern Territory until 12 months after the passage of the Bill; and to provide for the speedy lodging and hearing of Aboriginal claims. The hearing of Aborigmal claims has been postponed as a result of Government decisions. Aboriginals should not be penalised. from Australia is interna2.

The Honourable Phillip Lynch was appointed as Treasurer to administer the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Finance. The functions of the new Departments will be as indicated in my statement to the House on 18 November except that the general and Ufe insurance functions will now be a responsibility of the Treasury.

5,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,NOTICES OF MOTION," I give notice that at the next day of sitting I shall move: That, acknowledging that the increase of the income burden since 1972 has been totally disastrous, and noting stated intention of the Government to promote taxation reform of which tax indexation is the first instalment, House is of the opinion that such reform should embrace the following considerations: (1) Income taxation should be adequate to serve revenue needs of government and that the increased total tax revenue should be related only to the increase in number of taxpayers, productivity and incomes in real (2) It should be fair as between persons and households; (3) Marginal rates of tax should be reduced as suggested by the Aspreyreportand that the maximum marginal should be reduced towards 50 per cent as conditions (4) To recognise the importance of tax concessions promoting incentive and investment but not so as their principal value to the taxpayer dependent on the tax forgone; (5) The contribution of the rebate system in acknowledging that people placed equally should be treated equally and that many income earners especially those on the lower tax scales fail to claim adequately for concessions; (6) That where rebates are transferred to social welfare ayments the transfer compensates for the value of the reates for each taxpayer or the household supported by the taxpayer, (7) The effects of taxation and proposed changes in tax lands rates upon real disposable incomes should be acknowledged by the Commonwealth Arbitration Commission; And that alterations in the taxation system should seek to abide by these principles whether or not they are accomplished at the one Ume.

6,Mr BEAZLEY,EYE DISEASES AMONG ABORIGINES,"I ask the Minister for Health the following question: Is the ophthalmological expedition under Professor Fred Hollows still moving among Aboriginal communities, engaging in treatment of their eye diseases? If the expedition is continuing, is it receiving the cooperation of State governments in relation to access to Aboriginal communities and has it the support of State health departments?",20
7,Mr HUNT,EYE DISEASES AMONG ABORIGINES,"As far as I know, Professor Fred Hollows and his team of ophthalmologists are continuing their task force operation. They certainly have our authority to continue. I do not know whether they are presently working but, as The Tariff the honourable member knows, I had a meeting with Professor Fred Hollows and dismove: cussed with him some of the longer term probthe lems that the task force will face next year in carwith the rying out its work. We are making sure that the various State governments and the health departments in those States co-operate. I have Income Tax asked my Department to be responsible for coordinating the work with the various State governments so that there is no misunderstandtax ing between the State authorities and the task the force. I would like to take the opportunity to say that we have received excellent co-operation this from the Minister for Defence and from the Army, which has brought into the northern part the of South Australia mobile theatre and a mobile in unit to assist the task force in carrying out surgithe cal work in the field. I think that great credit must terms; go to Professor Hollows and those associated with the task force for the work that they are rate doing. It could well set a pattern of health care allow; delivery to Aborigines living in remote areas of in Australia and also to white people living into make difficult circumstances and suffering from ill health in remote areas of Australia. CURRENCY DEVALUATION: PRICE",20
8,Mr FISHER,EYE DISEASES AMONG ABORIGINES,"Is the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs aware that many business suppliers have advised their retail outlets that as from 29 November, only one day after devaluation, all goods would be increased in cost by 20 per cent? Can the Government take any action to halt this rip-off of consumers? Do small business people or their customers have any powers of recourse if they are aware of price increases obviously not related to the effects of devaluation upon imports?",21
9,Mr HOWARD,EYE DISEASES AMONG ABORIGINES,"I have had brought to my attention some instances of people being concerned that this has occurred. I should uke to make it very clear that, as the Prime Minister indicated immediately after devaluation, the Government would be extremely concerned if any re-sellers or importers were to take advantage of devaluation for the purposes of any unreasonable mark-ups. I think it has to be recognised that in circumstances such as this it is totally impossible and beyond the power of governments to prevent completely this type of thing from happening. We have taken some action in relation to the Prices Justification Tribunal. As I indicated last night, I conferred with the Chairman of the PJT yesterday afternoon. The Tribunal had been specifically requested to scrutinise carefully any price notifications which seek an adjustment on account of devaluatoin. In the statement. I made. I also reminded companies that the Tribunal's power is not Umited to a scrutiny of notifications but that also section 16 of the Prices Justification Act gives it the power to investigate a price increase made by a company, whether or not that company is required to notify price increases. I mention also, particularly in respect of small business, that consumers who feel that unjustified price increases have been made should report those complaints and concerns to their local consumer affairs bureau. The machinery in this area at a State level is quite extensive and I believe that consumers who have a worry that unreasonable price mark-ups are occurring in the small business area should take advantage of that facUity and should made their complaints to that quarter.

With the multiplier effect of inflows assessment into the banking system being up to live-fold, INCREASES with no changes to statutory reserve deposits, does this not mean an increase in the volume of money of up to $5,000m last week? Does this explain the 2 per cent up-valuation announced today? May we expect variations to our currency values each time there is a major inflow or outflow? How are the changes to our currency being calculated? Is the old basket being maintained? Will the Treasurer help to overcome the terrible uncertainty about these currency matters which pervades the community?",21
11,Mr LYNCH,SPECULATIVE FUNDS,"I am happy to have the opportunity to answer the Dorothy Dix speech which has just been made by the honourable gentleman. It is characteristic of the honourable gentleman and those who sit with him that he should seek to create a scare in the market place at the present time. I simply want to say to the honourable gentleman that any suggestion of $1,000m flowing into the country during the days of last week is a matter of manic speculation and is without foundation. It is not the custom of a Treasurer in this House responsibly to give daily reports on the flow of foreign capital into Australia. I should have thought the honourable gentleman would have understood that. Of course I receive those figures. The honourable gentleman is very much aware that they come out on a periodic basis through the Reserve Bank. I beheve that the provision of that information best rests with the officers of the Reserve Bank. As for the change which has been made, I am sure that the honourable gentleman is aware of the statement issued this morning by Mr Harry Knight, the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia.

The working of the trade-weighted 'basket'.of currencies Since September 1974, the weighted average exchange rate for Australia has been calculated by averaging the movements in exchange rates for the currencies which account for virtually all of Australia's trade. The relative importance of each of these countries in basket is assessed by reference to exports and imports combined. For this reason, such exchange rate anangements are often referred to as a (conlink stant) trade-weighted exchange rate regime. In practice, the averaging lating each day a rate for the Australian dollar in terms US. dollar. This is only a matter of convenience. Exactly same result would be produced by using any other cunency or, for that matter, the SDR as the numerator in the exercise. To take a hypothetical example: Suppose Australia's trade is limited to three countries in the following proportions: rate, thus permitJapan-4 0 per cent UK -30 per cent USA -30 per cent On day 1 the exchange rates for the currencies of these countries are: $US 1 - Yen 290; f0.66; $US 1. On the same day $A1 -$US1.2500. On day 2 the rates are: $US1 =Yen 300; f0.65; $US1. In these circumstances, how is the trade-weighted value of the $A kept constant? If no adjustment were made, the trade-weighted value of the Australian dollar would change. The extent of the the curchange, relative to the value of day 1, would be: (_40 300) + (JO .65) + (JO JO x x x (100 .66) (100 1) = .04138 + .2955 + .3000 = 1.0093 curIn other words, if no adjustment was made, the Australian dollar would on average be worth .93 per cent more on day 2 than on day 1. To offset this, and to keep the trade-weighted average rate at the same level as on day 1, would require a advantages in the depreciation as follows: 1.2500 stable in that period. 1.0093 This produces a rate of: $A 1 = $US 1.2385.

Arrangements in force from 29 November 1976: On a day-today basis, the $A remains pegged to the existing trade-weighted basket of currencies; this aspect of the of countries exchange rate regime remains unchanged. The change that was made from 29 November affects the the method of shifting the value of the $A in relation to the our trade with them, i.e., 'basket'. The anangements previously existing comprised a fixed (a 'peg') to the 'basket'of currencies. (Average value of $A constant, rates for individual currencies varying day by system used operates by calcuday.) of the In contrast to this system is an anangement which has the been adopted by some other countries known as a 'float', in terms of which there is no fixed link either to an individual currency, or to a 'basket'. (The average value of the currency can vary from day to day, and rates for individual currencies can also vary day by day.) The arrangements now adopted in Australia retain the principle of the link to the trade-weighted' basket' of currencies, but it is intended that time as necessary, in aflexibleway, but without going so far as to 'float'. Unless a deUberate decision is taken to vary the link to the 'basket', the average value of the $A will remain unchanged (but rates for individual currencies will continue tofluctuatedaily). As decisions are taken from dme to time to change the value of the $A inrelationto the 'basket' (as has been done today) a further factor offlexibilitywill enter the determination of the exchange value of the $A. The degree of variability will however be less currency. Extract from statement by Treasurer of 28 November 1976: 'The Treasurer said that as well as the initial change in the exchange rate to a new level ($A1 =$US1.0174) which would give effect to the devaluation, a changed pattern of management of the exchange rate would henceforth be adopted. The changed arrangements would comprise a variable link to a trade-weighted'basket'of currencies. The Australian dollar had since September 1974 remained pegged in a fixed relationship to the average of a trade-weighted 'basket' of currencies. The pegging of the rate continued; the level of the 'basket' of currencies will be kept under review, and the Government would, in effect, be adopting a flexibility administered rate, somewhat along the lines of a managed float. When the assessment of allrelevanteconomic factors indicated a need for movement in the level of the exchange rate, this would take place by means shifts in the relationship of the Australian dollar to the 'basket'of currencies. The Treasurer will beresponsiblefor these arrangements. The Governor of the Reserve the Treasury and the Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, would comprise the group which keeps the level of the exchange rate under review. The Treasurer said that the arrangement was an appropriateresponseto the changing nature of economic conditions abroad and of Australia's international trading relationships; the arrangement was designed to avoid the building-up for the future of expectations of major shifts at long intervals in the exchange rate. The changed system would permit the use of the exchange rate, by means of changes upwards or downwards in the rate as appropriate, as a moreflexibleelement amongst the available arms of economic policy.'

13,Mr LYNCH,AUSTRALIAN EXCHANGE RATE,"As for the details of the change itself, I should have thought that they would be understood by the honourable gentleman, if he has regard for what was said last Sunday evening. However, I will seek to explain it to him and I will take a little time, having regard for the nature of the question. Hitherto, management of for lengthy periods was now disexchange rate in relation to the the exchange rate has been directed to maintaining for lengthy periods a fixed relationship between the Australian dollar and the trade weighted basket of cunencies.

Under the new pattern of manageBank, with the Secretary of ment of the exchange rate, a trade weighted average rate will continue to be computed daily on the same basis as previously. However, the exchange rate will no longer necessarily be pegged, on afixedrelationship to the basket of currencies. Instead, as the Government has made clear, it will be kept under review and varied, as appropriate, in the overall context of management of the economy with emphasis upon economic factors. This new pattern of management of the exchange rate will enable more frequent, more timely and smaller adjustments to be made to the rate.

A close watch . . . . 1.1910 1.275 0 will, of course, be maintained on the manner in 1.416 7 which affairs develop from this point. I should say in explanation to the House that the management committee, which consists of the Governor of the Reserve Bank, the Secretary to the Treasury and the permanent head of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet met in Sydney on this matter on Monday morning. The Governor of the Reserve Bank reported to me the recommendation of that committee yesterday afternoon and the recommendation put by the committee was adopted by the Government. This led to the statement this morning of the Governor of the Reserve Bank. NA",23
14,Mr GRAHAM,AIRLINES AGREEMENT,"Has the Minister for Transport been informed of statements made during the Tasmanian election campaign by the Premier of Tasmania to the effect that if his Government is re-elected it will challenge the two airlines agreement in the High Court of Australia? Has the Minister's attention been drawn to a report in last Saturday's Australian that a mainland company had contributed large sums of money to the Australian Labor Party in support of the challenge to the two airlines agreement, with the intention of establishing a third national domestic airline? Can the Minister inform this House whether there was any official communication on this important subject between Mr Neilson and himself prior to the opening of the Tasmanian election campaign?",24
15,Mr NIXON,AIRLINES AGREEMENT,"I must confess at the outset that am somewhat amazed to learn that the two airbe lines agreement has become an issue in the TasReserve manian election and that it has been made an issue on the initiative of the Tasmanian Premier. In the almost 12 months that I have been Minisof ter for Transport I am not aware that I have received even one communication from the Premier of Tasmania expressing any concern whatsoever with the two airlines agreement or any aspect of it. I will double check after question time to see whether or not he has written any ter, perhaps to the Prime Minister or to myself, but I am almost sure that he has not. I view with very serious concern the fact that in the dying hours of the election campaign, he now wants make the two airlines agreement current with the story that money is being made available to the Australian Labor Party in Tasmania to fight the campaign and also apparently to assist a fight against the two airlines agreethe ment at some time after the election. I will be concerned to know what Mr Neilson's views are about the two airlines agreement. I will be concerned to learn what mainland company is supporting Mr Neilson in this campaign with view to challenging the two airlines agreement. I will be concerned to learn the real implications of Mr Neilson accepting such money if such money has been available to him. I repeat that as far as I am aware there has been absolutely no communication from Mr Neilson on this matter in the past 12 months. I am staggered that Mr Neilson should fall for the 3-card trick in accepting funds from a mainlander who may well want to challenge the two airlines agreement. The fact is that the two airlines agreement has provided a very stable service to Tasmania over the years. Very few of the complaints I get about airlines into Tasmania rest on the two airlines agreement itself. NA",24
16,Mr WILLIS,CURRENCY REVALUATION,"My question which is directed to the Treasurer refers to the Government's latest exercise in exchange rate yo-yo. Does the 2 per cent revaluation not mean that the original decision to devalue by MVi per cent was excessive? If not, will the Treasurer explain to the House why a revaluation has now become necessary only 9 days after a devaluation? Will the Treasurer also give the House an assurance that the currency will not be further revalued or devalued before the weather changes?",24
17,Mr LYNCH,CURRENCY REVALUATION,"That is a fairly typical question from the honourable gentleman. I think it does I not bode well for the honourable gentleman to expressing criticism of the Governor of the Bank in this House. As for the honourable gentleman's assertion that the 17te per cent devaluation was too much- I think this is the nub the question which is before the House- I say to him that he completely misconceives the position. The Government changed the rate to meet a substantial situation that had emerged. The matter is in the past, but the facts are clearly a matter of public record and I do not need to letrepeat them here. We also changed the system so that we could adapt flexibly to future needs instead of having new pressures on the exchange rate building up again. I hope from what has to been said both by the Governor and by myself an issue, conthat that is clear. The group of officials which as I mentioned to House a few moments ago was appointed to watch the exchange rate position concluded that the turnabout in the situation has been such that within a period of 10 days there should be an initial adjustment of the exchange rate in terms of the new flexible system. That change has been in a the direction of an appreciation. To make a Questions Without Notice change was something we expected and somerecovery. thing for which we provided in the initial rangements. That the situation has so improved that the first change is a small appreciation think a development which ought to be welexchange comed on both sides of the House. The decision announced today is a reflection of the original decision. For the honourable gentleman to ask me to speculate on future movements is as irresponsible as the general context in which question was framed. NA Mr Gillard proceeding to address a question to the Acting MinisterforNational Resources",24

20,Mr SPEAKER,DISALLOWED QUESTION,Order! The honourable gentleman is out of order. FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN AUSTRALIA the,25
21,Mr KEATING,DISALLOWED QUESTION,"I direct a question to the Treasurer. The Treasurer will recall his recent visit to Europe and the visits of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Foreign Investment Review Board to preach the virtues of the investment potential of Austraha in an endeavour to attract foreign investment capital. Given that new struggling foreign investment is held off in anticipation of change in the parity of the Australian dollar, how does the Treasurer now propose to deal with what must result in an absolute torrent of overincreased seas funds into Australia? Does the Treasurer plan to use the variable deposit scheme or other schemes as an inhibitor to massive funds? If so, how does he reconcile the imposition of such a scheme with the attractive tions he issued to foreign companies?",25
22,Mr LYNCH,DISALLOWED QUESTION,"It is true that, during a visit cendy to Western Europe, I emphasised that any Australia needed overseas capital and that over the seas capital was welcome in this country-unlik the ideologies of the honourable gentleman and his confreres. An important objective of devaluation was to encourage resumption of the inflow of long-term investment capital that will underannounced write and support the process of economic 7 December 1976 REPRESENTATIVES 3367 As I have pointed out in a number of arprevious statements, much of this inflow was delayed, as I think the honourable gentleman is I inferred, because of uncertainty about the rate. As a result of decisive action on the exchange rate, the Government expects that there will be a welcome pick up in overseas capital coming into Australia. I emphasised that it will be long-term investment capital coming into the Australia for purposes which are quite proper and which are welcomed by us. I have noted some comments about the possibility of a significant inflow of short-term speculative capital. I remind the honourable gentlman and the House that the embargo on funds with a term of 6 months or less must remain in force. Nevertheless, as I have said, the external position will be monitored closely, including to developments in capital inflow. The Government has a number of arms of pohcy which can be brought to bear on that question as soon as action is required. Of course, the Government is concerned to ensure- I think this was the final point raised by the honourable gentleman-that the objectives of monetary policy are not to compromised by developments in the external field. NA",25
23,Mr HOLTEN,MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES,"I ask the Prime Minister: Does Government have as one of its major objectives the encouragement and expansion of the manufacturing industries of Australia? Is it a fact that manufacturing industries provide many jobs and also provide jobs for many people other than those actually employed in those industries? Is it a fact that manufacturing industries are desperately with high costs mainly bea cause of the absurd wage levels in Australia compared with the rest of the world? Will one of the side effects of devaluation unfortunately mean costs of imported raw materials and plant for some manufacturing industries, thus offsetting many of the incidental extra tariff proinflow of tections through devaluation?",25
24,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES,Order! I call upon the invitahonourable gentleman to ask his question.,25
25,Mr HOLTEN,MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES,Will the Government exercise reextreme caution in reaching any decision to cut tariffs? Will any affected industries be given chance to be heard and to state their case bee fore any decisions are implemented?,25
26,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES,"The general pohcy of the Government Parties, which was before the last election, is that there would not be tariff reductions of the kind that were made across the board by the previous Admiriistration, which began the great damage, amongst other pohcies, to manufacturing industries. That action began the export of tens of thousands of jobs offshore and was a significant contributor to the increasing and much too high unemployment level in this country. We have had a situation in manufacturing industry in which about 100 000 jobs have been lost as a result of reduced competitiveness and moves off shore. In a period in which Australian wage levels rose by 130 per cent, in the United States wage levels rose by 53 per cent and in West Germany they rose by about 70 per cent. The poUcies remain but across the board moves are not part of the Government's policy. It also has been said that if there is room for the Government to move in reducing tariffs in areas that do not take a competitive advantage away from Austrahan industry then the Government will be able to do that. I would expect my colleague the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs to be able to make a definitive statement on these particular matters later today. I would add that the Government has a great concern for a profitable and efficient manufacturing industry in Australia. Unless there is a fitable and efficient manufacturing industry in Australia we will not get back to what most people in this Parliament would regard as proper and acceptable levels of employment in Austraha. I would believe that all those in support of manufacturing industries, and especially those who are representative or claim to be representative of the trade union movement, would support the Government's moves in that direction.",25
27,Mr HAYDEN,MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES,"I direct my question to the Treasurer. Does he remember stating on a private number of occasions that the level of consumping, tion in the economy was too low for the health of stand, the economy because the savings ratio was too high? Specifically, does he recall stating in statereflects ment No. 2 of the Budget that 'inflation and mary, inflationary expectations . . . caused conencouragement sumers to save more, and spend less, or current incomes.'? In view of the fact tion recently announced will lead to some rather fierce increases in the rate of inflation in the country, if his assumptions about household savrelation ings ratios being affected by inflation can we expect that the savings ratio will further increase and consumption become even more severely contracted? If this measures has he in mind to offset it in the interests of a healthier economy?",26
28,Mr LYNCH,MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES,"The growth of 4 per cent that was put down in the Budget estimates was in fact, as I think I made perfectly clear to the House, not a strong growth but it was consistent with the approach towards a sustained recovery. The honourable gentleman should consider the elements which went to make up that 4 per cent. First he would recognise that a good deal of the growth will come in stocks. The sharp stock dechne of last year should turn round to stabUity or even to a modest increase. Apart from that factor, of course, in relation to the 4 per cent of non farm output, the honourable gentleman, not that he mentioned it here, obviously would know the impact of the external situation. I am referring specifically to exports. If he aggregates both of those and then asks me about the question of private demand against the background of 4 per cent, I must say to the honourable gentleman that the increase infinaldemand on an underlying trend upward month by month may be no more than 0.2 per cent or 0.3 per cent. If the honourable gentleman is simply seeking from me an earnest of where the demand comes from, if he thinks about devaluation and considers the proposition specifically then obviously the reference to the export sector must leave a compelUng impact on him. He conveniently overlooks the appUcation of that. So far as stocks are concerned, as the Prime Minister has just made very clear to this House, devaluation will provide very real incentives for people to get moving and to invest. Of course, that is behind the flow of development capital to this country. When the honourable gentleman understands the investment procedures he wtil know that as people invest they will, of course, SAVINGS go out and spend on machinery, plant and equipment. That willflowthrough the general area of demand and consumerism. As for the question of the savings ratio, which has been fallas the honourable gentleman would underas the profit ratio has been increasing, this again the Government's success. In sumI am saying to the honourable gentleman that devaluation will be helpful because of the that it will provide to a number that the devaluaof basic industries.",26
29,Mr HAYDEN,MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. In view of the fact that the answer bore no to the question, can I provide an answer are correct for the Treasurer?",26
30,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES,There is no substance in the is so what sort of point of order. NA,26
31,Mr DONALD CAMERON,BANNING OF RELIGIOUS GROUPS,"Has the Attorney-General seen reports that some State governments are contemplating banning a Christian religious group called the Children of God? Does the Minister agree that an incredibly dangerous precedent is set when a government commences passing judgments on any reUgious group, Christian or non-Christian? WUl the Minister assure the House that this type of legislation will not be introduced in the Commonwealth Territories? WUl the Minister advise the House whether it is constitutional for State governments to move against religious groups?",27
32,Mr SPEAKER,BANNING OF RELIGIOUS GROUPS,"Before I call upon the Attorney-General to answer, it seems to me that there are questions of fact to be answered and that there is also an invitation to announce pohcy. It is a matter for the Attorney-General whether he will respond to the policy part of the question.",27
33,Mr ELLICOTT,BANNING OF RELIGIOUS GROUPS,"I think I have previously referred to this matter in the House. I indicated that I would take the matter to the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. I think I have since indicated that the Committee was not of a mind to take up the matter. A further matter that I have indicated is that the question will be kept under review by me to see whether any protection can be given to young people particularly who are taken by advantage in relation to this sort of activity. I have already indicated that a delicate question is involved as to the reUgious freedom that to some extent is enshrined in our Constitution. Therefore, any government would have to be very careful, when introducing legislation in this area, to ensure that religious freedom was not tampered with. To that extent I must agree with the honourable member that any government that is thinking of moving in this area needs to be very cautious. On the other hand, one cannot overlook the fact that many parents in this country are continuously concerned about their young. I simply regard it as a matter that we, as administrators and legislators, ought to keep under review. At the moment there is no intention on my part to recommend any specific provisions to amend the law in the Austrahan Capital Territory or the Northern Territory in this regard. NA",27
34,Mr YOUNG,DIVISION OF TREASURY DEPARTMENT,"I direct a question to the Treasurer. WUl the splitting of Treasury automatically lead to a more efficient handling of the economy, or is the decision to split Treasury just a move to get square with Treasury for the Cabinet leak regarding the Prime Minister's attitude to devaluation, as reported by Kenneth Davidson in the Melbourne Age of 10 November?",27
35,Mr LYNCH,DIVISION OF TREASURY DEPARTMENT,"Frankly , the quesuon is beneath contempt. I regret that the honourable gentleman has sought to raise what has been a basic decision by government on a very important area of substance and has sought to align that with what he referred to as an alleged leak. The fact is simply this: Administrative structures are not sacred. They must be responsive to the needs and objectives of one's particular operation. This matter came before the Prime Minister and me when the first Ministry was announced. We decided at that stage to do nothing about it. I might say to the honourable gentleman that he and his colleagues at times waxed eloquent about the need to change the structures of Treasury, but in their usual bungling manner they did nothing about it. This Government talked about the need to change the structure of the Federal Treasury and we acted-and we acted decisively. I have every confidence that that change will work well and will meet the objectives of government. In the first place the creation of a new Department of Finance will enable more concentrated and specialised attention to the financial management area of government. I think particularly of expenditure control and review procedures, and associated activities including forward estimating and program analysis. Secondly, the removal of these expenditure control functions from Treasury will relieve pressures from that direction on senior officers in Treasury and enable concentration on matters of economic and financial policies that in fact will remain with them. Thirdly, as I think both the Prime Minister and myself have emphasised in recent days, the creauon of a new department and its concentration on the expenditure control and related functions will broaden and strengthen the channels of advice on economic issues avaUable to the Government. The decision was taken by the Government after a full examination of appropriate options avaUable here and abroad. It is in some ways a reflection of the Canadian system, but it is not a Chinese copy of it. I believe that the system will work well. UNION ELECTIONS: SECRET BALLOTS",27
36,Mr DRUMMOND,DIVISION OF TREASURY DEPARTMENT,I direct my question to the Prime Minister. How many secret ballots for union elections have been conducted under the Government's new secret ballot legislation? How many of these ballots have been conducted free of charge by the Commonwealth Electoral Office? Does the Prime Minister consider that this legislation will lead to a reduction in industhe trial disruptions by minority controlled unions?,27
37,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,DIVISION OF TREASURY DEPARTMENT,"I have given some information to the House concerning this matter. On 23 September this year I indicated that in 1974 about 20 elections were conducted by the Commonwealth Electoral Office under the then legislation for union elections but that by the same time this year 39 elections had already been held and 77 were in hand, making a total of 116. At the end of November 112 elections had been completed under the new legislation conducted by the Commonwealth Electoral Office and 49 were on hand, making a total of 161 elections. Thesefiguresshow plainly that a very large number of trade unions are opting to take advantage of the opportunities provided by the Government's legislation to have their elections conducted by the Commonwealth Electoral Office, in which case they are paid for by the Commonwealth. I beheve that over time the legislation will come to have an impact on the management of trade union affairs. I think it is worth noting that a number of people have asked whether we can make arrangements to ensure that a forewarning is given of when union elections are to be held. The people who have made that request have been wanting tofightthe militant extreme left groups in the trade union movement who I believe do not represent the great bulk of their constituents. Regulations are being drafted so that there will be a requirement on trade unions to place on notification with the Industrial Registrar when their elections are due. It ought also to be noted that this legislation does not apply to trade unions only. It is legislation that applies also to all organisations tered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. In that case the legislation does not involve trade unions only but it involves also employer organisations. It is quite plain that a very large number of trade unions are using this legislation and the opportunities provided by it and are liking it. It is also plain from the objections are coming from the other side of the House in respect of this particular matter that members of the Opposition wish to deny trade unionists the opportunity for secret postal ballots in which they can vote without fear or favour without any possibUity of bullying by a few union officials. NA NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs a quesuon. Is it a fact that when the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission for first time sought to purchase a property-it was at Archer River in Cape York Peninsulaand the consent of the Queensland Lands Minister was sought, the apphcation was referred to the Queensland Cabinet and, after 5 months delay, was refused? Is it also a fact that when the vendor asked the Queensland Minister why he had refused his consent he was told that he should talk to Comalco Ltd which might have to acquire land Uke this which was close to Weipa? I ask: Does the Government support the action of the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission in purchasing properties for the benefit of Aboriginals? If so, has the Minister protested to the Queensland Government about this frustration of its policy? I also ask the Minister whether a decision has yet been made on the report of the working party of last July on the problems of Aboriginal unemployment, including the impact of unemployment benefit payments on Aboriginal communities.",28
38,Mr VINER,UNEMPLOYMENT,"It is a fact that the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission sought to purchase a property at Archer River. That property is governed by the laws of Queensland and the consent of the Queensland Minister for Lands, Forestry, National Parks and Wildlife Service is required in order to allow the transfer of title. When the application for transfer was lodged it was rejected. The Land Fund Commission, I believe, has had correspondence with the Minister concerned. I also have written to the Minister inquiring the reason why the application for transfer of title was refused. I have not yet received an answer but I assure the honourable gentleman that I wuT be following this matter up because I regard it as of considerable importance regisnot only to the operations of the Land Fund Commission but also to the Aboriginals on whose behalf the property was to be purchased. As to the other matter referred to by the honourable gentleman, that is, the working party on employment amongst Aboriginals, I have before me at the present time a draft proposal with regard that to the conversion of unemployment benefits within communities into work project payments, if I can summarise it in that way. I also have before me a draft proposal prepared by the Department of my colleague the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations on the general question of Aboriginal employment throughout Australia. NA",28
39,Mr CARIGE,BEEF SALE TO RUSSIA,Has the attention of the Minister for Primary Industry been drawn to an article appearing in today's Press stating that a large tonnage of beef had been sold to the Union of Soviet SociaUst Republics? Does this sale indicate a change in the demand for beef and mutton? Can beef producers of Australia expect an improved demand for their cattle in the year 1977?,28
40,Mr SINCLAIR,BEEF SALE TO RUSSIA,"The announcement this morning that another sale to the Union of Soviet Socialist Repubhcs had been contracted is a very worthwhUe and much needed boost to the beef industry. It is not only a question of quantity although it is true that since July Russia has emerged throughout the world as a major meat buyer. She has purchased some 54 500 tonnes of beef and 14 000 tonnes of mutton from Australia alone. In addition, I understand that she has purchased a fairly significant quantity of mutton from New Zealand and has been making some inquiries of Argentina. So, there has been quite a broad spread of demand instituted into a market which had been veryflat.This gives some promise of the recovery which the honourable gentleman foreshadowed. I turn to the other significant factor in this ter. I think only the expected gross returns from the sale have been announced publicly. It does seem that this sale has certainly provided for Australian producers some of the expected return from devaluation which, in the beef industry, it had been anticipated might not have been passed on to producers to the degree to which they and the Government would have liked. If it is true, as the newspaper reports and the published statements of the private exporter who has negotiated this sale suggest, the price payable in this particular order will give promise not only of improved returns to Russia, which is significantly an opportunity purchaser, but also similarly to the United States of America and to Japan. At the moment a negotiation is going on with the United States Administration, presided over by the Secretary of the Department of Overseas Trade, which is most important in relation to the opportunity for access of Australian beef during 1977. If there is, as would seem, a greater demand from these occasional opportunity purchasers, the prospects for the whole of the beef industry during 1977 would seem to be significantly brighter than they were. Coming at a time when the beef industry's prospects had been so flat, this is a very worthwhUe symptom of some generally improved conditions which may prevaU throughout 1977. NA",29
41,Mr UREN,INTEREST RATES,My question is directed to the Treasurer. I ask: WUl the housing and consumer durable industries be affected by the Reserve Bank's attempts to isolate the export sector from interest rate increases? What effects will this have on employment in these industries? What effect will the necessary interest rate rises in these sectors have on the consumer price index and subsequent wage pressures?,29
42,Mr LYNCH,INTEREST RATES,"I believe that devaluation will have a beneficial impact on the industries concerned. As I have made perfectly clear before, the results of devaluation will be mixed in a series of industries but overall I believe it will have a beneficial impact. I remind the honourable member of what my colleague the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development said recently. The honourable gentleman should be thefirstto be aware that recently there has been a very strong flow of finance into the housing industry. I will not take the time of the House to go through all the indicators, but if the honourable gentleman speaks to the authorities he will find that that strong flow offinanceinto the housing industry has in some areas been leading to an unsustainmatable position because of the pressure which it has been placing upon prices, and upon land prices in particular. I assure the honourable gentleman and the House that the decision to devalue and the monetary measures that the Government has taken will not interfere with an adequateflowof finance into the housing industry. We have made that perfectly clear. As I have said, the rates on official securities have been established. The rates on the savings bond have been established. As the honourable gentleman knows, it is a marginal movement from 9.8 per cent to 10 per cent. In some quarters the Government has been criticised because, in the view of some people, that movement is insufficient. I say to the honourable gentleman in relation to the savings bond and the bond market generally",29
43,Mr UREN,INTEREST RATES,But you know that it wiU go higher.,29
44,Mr LYNCH,INTEREST RATES,The honourable gentleman is behaving in his usual irresponsible way. I was saying that that movement has ended. I made it clear in the House yesterday that no movement in bank administered interest rates is in contemplation. NA,29

Does the Statute of Westminster affect this position? When she ing as Queen of Australia, are her appropriate advisers the Australian Government or the Brithink tish Government?",29
46,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,QUEEN ELIZABETH II,"As I understand the the position, the States traditionally have comadministered municated with the Palace through the British Government;, that has been their decision and that hitherto has been their wish.

Has similar action been taken through the Reserve Bank or has an indication been given that similar protection will be given to the mining sector and to the manuTransport)-Fo facturing sector of the economy. If so, on what justification has this been done? Can the home builders, the home purchasers, the consumers and the ordinary retailers-the ordinary businessmen-be assured of similar protection? Will the Treasurer also give us the benefit knowing the arrangements, if any, that have been made to cushion exporters and importers against the vacillations that will occur from to time in the exchange rates? is act Mr LYNCH-The honourable gentleman is a little slow in catching up with these matters. I that if i refer Mm to yesterday's Hansard he will be suitably encouraged with the statement that he finds there, which indicates that at present time there is no increase in bank rates. No increase is contemplated. So I do not find myself in a position where I want to respond to the hypothesis or the ramblings of the the honourable gentleman. There are no secret deals. I saw a reference to that in the Press this morning, but I repeat again that the interest rate changes have taken place, the bank has acted in in the market place in conjunction with me, and no them to bank administered rate changes are PRIORITIES REVIEW STAFF: BORRIE NA",30

53,Mr SPEAKER,ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION REPORT,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted.",31
54,Mr JAMES,ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION REPORT,"I now present the report of the drift Twenty-second Commonwealth Parliamentary to Conference held in Mauritius in September last. The Conference was attended by delegates, secretaries and official branch observers from branches, representing some 9000 parliamenfrom tarians, and by observers from associated socio-political organisations, including the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth Secretariat. Australia was represented by 6 delegates from the Commonrecognised wealth Branch and one delegate from each of the States and the Northern Territory. The Comprocess monwealth delegates were Senator the leader of the delegation and myself as deputy leader; Senator J. I. Melzer; Mr K. L. Fry, MP; Mr S. E. Calder, MP, and Mr M. H. Bungey, MP. Senator G. S. Davidson, the Australasian regional councillor, also attended and Mr D. Blake, V.R.D., the First Clerk-Assistant of the report House of Representatives, was the secretary. Conference was opened by His Excellency, the Acting Governor General of Mauritius in an impressive ceremony in the Mahatma Ghandi egation Institute. The Conference was conducted in both plenary session debates and in panel discussions. All members of the delegation took part in both sessions, as indicated in the report. The 14 items of the Conference agenda were under 4 main headings: International Affairs, Economic Proban lems, Social Problems and Parliamentary Instithe tutions. The first heading concentrated mainly upon developments in the Indian Ocean and southern Africa. Although these were burning issues to a large number of delegates, particuwho larly those from the littoral states, they were debated in a spirit of tolerance and mutual understanding usually associated with the Coming monwealth Parliamentary Association. The poshis itions of most countries in the area are fairly known to members of this Parliament and they werefirmlyheld. There was a good deal of common ground in the discussion of economic problems and I commend this debate to members of the House, particularly in respect of the stabilisation of commodity prices and the disposal of surplus food stocks; alternative methods of providing professional and technical educational aid and joint ventures and transfers of technology in respect of co-operation in industrial development. Discussions on social problems concentrated on the protection of the environment, the control or elimination of pollution and the need for international co-operation in these matters; the growth in population, unemployment and urban poverty and a pressing need in some of the less developed countries to arrest or even reverse the to the cities. In the last respect it amounted a plea for decentralisation and the provision of better amenities to raise the quality of life in rural areas. There was a general awareness that the 86 parUamentary institution is under some threat socio-economic pressure groups and from extremists; from a too centralised bureaucracy; from a too rigid party system and from too much inconsequential legislation. It was that the main aim, for want of a better term, was for economic democracy and it was agreed that this must be advanced but that in the the freedoms of democracy should never D. B. Scott, be sacrificed. The verbatim report of the discussions will be issued by the General Council of the CommonM. wealth Parliamentary Association. The summary of the discussions is included in our report. Copies of the report have been placed in the The Parliamentary Library and are available from the BUls and Papers Office. In conclusion, I should like to acknowledge the debt of the delto the secretariat of the host branch, led by Mr Guy dlispaignet, the Clerk of the Parliament in Mauritius; to the General Council secretariat, who organised the Conference; to the Legislative Research Service of the Parliamentary Library, which provided the delegation with excellent background brief; to the secretary to delegation, Mr D. M. Blake, V.R.D., for being such a good secretary; to the Foreign Minin ister, who made available His Excellency Mr Truelove, who is based in Dar-es-Salaam and was a superb host of the delegation. We saw him much of the time in Mauritius. In briefing the delegation, he advised us what was happenin that part of the world, in accordance with responsibilities to the Department of Foreign well Affairs and to the Government of Australia. I should also like to pay tribute to the Government for its generosity in providing funds to enable members of the delegation to extend their travel in order to gain the maximum value for their abroad, as a result of which I was able to chase this Mauritian suit.

56,Mr SPEAKER,ECONOMIC POLICIES,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The ad hoc economic policies of the Prime Minister the Treasurer. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required the Standing Orders having risen in their placesNot",32
57,Mr HURFORD,ECONOMIC POLICIES,"The obviously Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) have destroyed any crediThe bility they may have had as economic managers. For an inadequate, naive and simplistic policy obsessively concerned with just one economic aim, a pohcy which led to massive and disastrous devaluation, they have now substituted virtually no pohcy at all; or are we to revalue back to 1 per cent in dribs and drabs at 2 per cent a time? this what will happen in the name of a viable policy? I might add that the Prime Minister the Treasurer also treat this Parliament with utter disdain. Today is no exception. I mentioned in a speech that I made last week on the economy that they do not come into this Parliament and defend their measures. Neither of them are here to defend the grave claims made against them this debate on a matter of public importance. Instead we have the most junior member of the Ministry and a back bencher, neither of whom were involved in any way in the decision making. They may be able to articulate better than the Prime Minister and the Treasurer about what devaluation has occuned but they are not responsible for it. I take this opportunity to state again that for trip 10 months now, as Shadow Treasurer, I have purbeen seeking to debate economic pohcy with the Treasurer in the media-o n television and radio-bu t on no occasion has he fronted. Instead, we get people Uke the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Eric Robinson) or today, the Minister for Productivity (Mr Macphee). Let me outline some of the inconsistencies, some of the reasons why this Government now has no credibUity and some of the examples of how it has left chaos and uncertainty in the country in failing to specify clear and consistent economic policies. I quote first from the Budget Speech of the Treasurer which reads: We have made our first priority the absolute necessity to combat inflation. This was the constant refrain of all Government economic spokesmen until 10 days ago.",32
58,Mr SHIPTON,ECONOMIC POLICIES,That is right.,32
59,Mr HURFORD,ECONOMIC POLICIES,"How can any honourable member say that it is right now when the Government has completely thrown out that policy. The Prime Minister said on 15 November: - 'We intend to be unrelenting in our anti-inflation and policy'. He also said on that day: 'Getting back to a fully satisfactory basis of economic policy won't be possible until inflation is beaten'. Mr Lynch said in his Budget Speech that reducing the rate of inflation was the central aim of the by Government. Let me quote him further: merely because of the direct hardships that inflation bnngs, because unless we can break inflation we shall not succeed in restoring full employment. obsessive pursuit of this single aim was used by the Government as justification for imposing enormous costs on the community. A universal and simple health insurance scheme was destroyed. Spending on housing and on decentralising urban services was slashed. A deliberate polIVi icy of retarding economic recoveiy was pursued. Is By reducing real government outlays-in other words government spending in real terms has and been reduced, a policy unique to Australia amongst member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Developmentunemployment was increased and maintained at historically high levels, alienating and demeaning scores of thousands of youths entering the in workforce for the firsttimeand humUiating tens of thousands of established wage earners. Investment was discouraged and structural distortions introduced to the economy which will take years to correct. All this was done in the name of reducing the rate of inflation. Even before the the anti-inflation policy was not consistently pursued. The Medibank levy will add in the order of per cent to the annual rate of growth of prices. The effectiveness of the Prices Justification bunal is being severely curtailed by changes legislation. Indirect tax cuts which could have reduced another couple of per cent from the of growth of prices were not introduced. On 28 November, after constant categoric and even contemptuous denials, the Government ing. devalued by the largest amount in living memper ory, or should we say that the Prime Minister devalued. Not a single person has denied that this devaluation will contribute substantially inflation. The inane comments member for Higgins (Mr Shipton) and the honourable member for Barton (Mr Bradfield), who are seeking to interject, will not change that one iota. Devaluation will add markedly to inflaunder tion and there is no responsible commentator who would gainsay that. Published estimates the addition to the rate of growth of prices from 2 per cent or 3 per cent a year to 10 per a year. A conservative estimate cannot realistimassive cally be less than 3 per cent or 4 per cent a year. Mr Bradfield-That is quite right.",32
60,Mr HURFORD,ECONOMIC POLICIES,"I am glad that the honourcountry. able member for Barton says that this is quite right. Of course this will add to inflation. Honourable members should compare this with the the extraordinary pressure from the Government for the introduction of plateau wage indexation, which at the most will contribute only 0.8 per cent to a lowering in rate of growth of prices. For short term sectional reasons the Prime Minister and the Treasurer by devaluation have made a decision which more completely underof mines their previous aims than could any other possible policy. They have fuelled inflationary expectations-the principal driving force behind price growth-and by refusing to examine the implications of their decision or to set alternative policies for controlling inflation they have set no limits to the growth of inflationary expectations. The Government says that it will control inflaiveflowinto tionary effects of devaluation by preventing price increasesflowingon to wage earners through indexation. This claim is not credible. The eral and National Country Parties rejected powers over wages and incomes by opposing the referendum 2 years ago. There would be massive community opposition to the abolition of the ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission. Yet there are stUl hints that this is to be done. Despite the utterly reasonable and understandable cies of the trade union movement the Governdevaluation ment continues to set the stage for vicious conconsequences. frontation. The Government does not have the analysis. 2 will or the goodwUl to come to reasonable terms with the wage and salary earners of our country. TriI understand that further announcements comto its ing from the party meetings of today will do nothing more than exacerbate the relationships rate with the trade union movement. Some selective tariff cuts could dampen the inflationary effects of devaluation. But the Government is vacillatThe devaluation has resulted in about an 80 cent increase in the average rate of protection. Yet immediately after the announcement the Prime Minister declared that there would be to no reductions in the tariffs to offset the inflaofthe honourable tionary effects. More recently the Treasurer and other Ministers have said that thepossibUity of tariff cuts is consideration. The principal point is that this issue was not thought through when of devaluation was being discussed by Cabinet. The vary devaluation decision was not part of an cent integrated package of economic policies. The devaluation was a reversal of policies without the effects on the other arms of economic poucy being thoroughly explored as they should have been by good economic managers of this The same is true of monetary policy. The Treasurer said that devaluation was forced on the Government by a host of other enemies of State yet, he says, the benefits of devaluation will be enormous. He quotes the possibility of an inflow of investment funds of up to $7 bUlion. If even a small portion of that amount of capital flowed into Australia, how could the Government cope with the increase in the money supply without stringent restrictions on the availability credit and a sharp increase in interest rates? We have already seen some of these increases in interest rates. Does anybody believe that we have seen the end to increases in interest rates if anything like the $7 billion of funds comes into this country? Of course they do not. What about the multiplier effect of this massthe banking system? In a question I asked today I showed that the multiplier effect could befive-fold.Of course something has to be Libdone with regard to variable deposit ratios, statutory reserve deposits, or a combination of the two. What do we have? We have no policy at all. We have a vacuum. All we have is dribs and drabs of upvaluation of currency-this time 2 per cent. The Government's attitude looks more like a denial of the logic of what is happening than a polirealistic appraisal of the consequences of and of ways of coping with those It is rhetoric rather than rigorous In the Budget the Government described a rough monetary target for a growth of 10 per cent to 12 per cent in the volume of money over the course of 1976-77. Although such targets can never be more than tentative, the Treasurer has continued to state that this remains his target for the money supply. This target is now clearly impossible, given the acceleration and the rate of inflation which inevitably follows devaluation. Even his chosen advisers like Professor Hogan and Professor Snape say it is impossible, if i read correctly the article by Tony Thomas in the Age of today. Yet no alternative indication of the expected rate of growth of M3 has been forthcoming, and this has left all branches of the capital market in a state of severe uncertainty about the constraints that will be placed on the rate of growth of money supply and therefore on the monetary conditions in which they will be working during the rest of the financial year. Money market operators are bitter. They had trusted the Government in its statements of its strong intention to reduce inflation and had designed their policies accordingly. Now they have been betrayed. With their resentment goes the hope of proper management of Government loans and of proper and adequate funding of the money supply in this country. All Government theories about recovery have been abandoned. The year began with the assertion that investment was the key to economic recovery, but when it became clear that businessmen were rational profit maximisers who would respond to the level of effective demand the Government switched to looking for a consumer led recovery. In the absence of any sign of improvement in retail sales-in the most recent months there is an absolute decline in retail sales-the Government appears to have switched to looking for recovery led by foreign investment and exports. This is an inadequate approach also. Enormous concessions to foreign investors lead to continuing growth in the proportion of the mining industry, in particular, which is owned outside Australia. Unnecessarily generous concessions are being offered to mining companies. On the other hand, the Government is turning to the hope of an export led recovery at a time when economic growth in the rest of the world is faltering. In fact, the rate of growth overseas is slowing down sharply and is causing grave concern in the financial and industrial centres of the world. On Friday, the Prime Minister said that devaluation would permit manufacturers to increase production so enabling them to contain costs. He said: 'They have a great responsibility to do so'. This is utterly naive. It is the Government's responsibility to create the conditions which make it possible for manufacturers to contain costs. To top it all off, we had today's announcement of a 2 per cent revaluation. If ever there was a confirmation of the blunder of the devaluation announced a week last Sunday, this is it. Let no one be misled into believing that this is a reasonable result of the managed float. It is nothing of the sort. Such a 2 per cent change so soon is extraordinary. It will create more uncertainty in financial circles in Australia. It has brought enormous windfall profits to speculators. It is no substitute for other necessary monetary and fiscal measures, as I have already indicated. The only ray of hope on the horizon is that there appears to be now a de facto recognition by the Government of what the Opposition has been saying all along-that is, that the Government must attack inflation and unemployment together rather than simply concentrate on inflation. Both aims are important and both can be tackled together. However, by its devaluation decision, the Government has made such an attack even more difficult because inflation has been exacerbated and the effects on employment are likely to be small. There will not be any great increase in employment in Australia. Australia desperately needs rigorous and enlightened economic management, free from doctrinaire obsessions, with reductions in the public sector outlays and attacks on trade unions. The intention of this debate is to draw attention to this lack of leadership. For the sake of Australia, I hope that the Government, with its advisers, can quickly work out a comprehensive and detailed set of economic policies so that all sections of the Austrahan community can plan effectively. Indeed, planning for such a recovery is desperately needed. I do not believe that this can now happen under this Prime Minister and this Treasurer. The disarray on the Government back benches in the last week leads me to the conclusion that Government members are demoralised and bewildered, and understandably so. There is only one thing that Government supporters can do for Australia. Presumably, for their own skins, they will not want an election so they must put a stop to the ad hockery and to the inconsistency. They must speak out for the hundreds of thousands of unemployed Australians. They must act for the millions whose hving standards have been cut in the past year. They must get rid of these men-the Prime Minister and the Treasurer-wh o have led us into this mess.",33
61,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ECONOMIC POLICIES,Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,35
62,Mr MACPHEE,ECONOMIC POLICIES,"It will disappoint the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) to know that members of the Government backbench are not in disarray and their morale is not destroyed. In fact they have been exercising a most commendable independence of mind in expressing constructive nuances on the economic strategy of the Government. This is a healthy attitude. It is to be encouraged. It is always encouraged by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Treasurer (Mr Lynch). These constructive comments have been in marked contrast to the number of negative comments which have come not only from the Opposition in this chamber but also from certain people in public positions. The important point is to examine the serious economic situation which still confronts Austraha and to try to examine the strategy which has been adopted consistently by the Government. I refute any suggestion as made by the honourable member for Adelaide, that the Government is embarking upon a course of confrontation with the trade union movement. This is not so. There is no solution for anyone in confrontation. I refute also the allegation that the control of inflation is no longer the main task facing the Government and that the Government has departed from its strategy of curbing inflation. Inflation has been reduced. Employment opportunities will increase and the level of unemployment will decrease. The important point is that the Budget strategy, which was announced in August, is consistent with the economic policy adopted by the Government from the beginning of the year and is still the thrust of the Government's economic strategy. The only departure from that strategy is in relation to devaluation. I shall come to that in a moment. The honourable member for Adelaide remarked on the absence of the Treasurer in the House during this debate. I shall refer substantially to remarks made by the Treasurer so that his absence will not be felt in terms of substantial discussion. I direct the attention of honourable members to the Budget strategy which was the core of the Government's policy and still is the core of the Government's policy. I should hke to refer to my own summation of that strategy on 7 September this year at page 763 of Hansard. I stated: . . . . the Budget strategy has S basic principles. These may be stated as being; making the reduction in rate of inflauon the essential aim of government the time being; restraining government spending in order to allow the private sector to expand and create jobs in the medium term;restrictinggovernment taxation revenue in order to encourage further wagerestraintand improve both business profitability and confidence,reducingthe size of the deficit in order to moderate increases in the money supply; and continuing to implement selective social programs based onrecommendationsof the Henderson report on poverty and on a philosophy of assisting the most disadvantaged and assisting others to help themselves more effectively. That, in a nutshell, is the economic policy of the Government which has not been departed from in any way. There is no way that it can be said that we have adopted ad hoc economic measures. Those 5 basic principles have been adhered to by the Government. It is still our concern to have as ourfirsttarget the control of inflation. What has occurred has been an un-sought devaluation- a devaluation which has positive impacts that have been ignored. Most attention has been focused on the inevitable unfortunate impact which comes from any across the board measure. I turn to the Treasurer's own statement of 28 November in which he announced the decision to devalue. The statement reads: The changed system would permit the use of the exchange rate, by means of changes upwards or downwards in the rate as appropriate, as a moreflexibleelement amongst the available arms of economic policy. The Government has been forced to devalue, Mr Lynch said, because of the deterioration that had occurred over recent years in Australia's underlying external situation, as a result of the higher increase in wage costs than in our major trading partners and the continuing loss of reserves. The Treasurer went on in that statement to explain that the Government, although it knew that the exchange rate was overvalued compared with other currencies, nonetheless sought to obtain the necessary discipline within the Australian community in order to reduce inflation and to create more job opportunities. When this action became inevitable, for reasons set out clearly in that statement by the Treasurer, the Government could adopt no course other than to devalue. I repeat: That course does not depart from the S principles contained in the Budget strategy and the earher statement of economic pohcy which has governed the pohcies of this Government. Page 4 of the Press release issued by the Treasurer on 28 November states: This decline inreserveshad continued despite the additional monetary measures announced on 7 November and had left official reserves at 26 November at around $2,100m, sufficient to cover less than three months' imports. It is worth interposing that when Labor came to office reserves stood at a record level of $4.6 billion. The Treasurer went on to say: Added to that the Government faced the prospect of an the even greater rate of outflow around the end of Decempolicy for ber/early January period. The Treasurer in that extract of 28 November stated further There would also be a close monitoring of the volume lending by the variousfinancialinstitutions to ensure that growth in lending came back from recent excessive and unsustainable levels to a pace consistent with the sound development of the economy. I quoted that to refute the suggestion that the policies are ad hoc and that for some reason there is a vacuum of pohcies. It is perfectly clear to volved anyone who really wishes to look at the matter objectively that all arms of policy to which the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have referred over recent days are being monitored constantly so that steps can be taken to control any aspect of pohcy which appears to be putting further pressure on inflation. The various terms of pessimism which have been mentioned by other speakers only talk down the economy and do not improve it. Seeing that reference has been made to the fact that the Treasurer is not here I want to again quote something which needs to be repeated. I quote from a statement made by the Treasurer in this House on 30 November in which he said: Suggestions that the Government's economic strategy has failed are without foundation; the continuation of efforts to hold the exchange rate. It has not been possible because of the obvious limitations in the extent to which reliance can be placed on any single instrument of economic policy. Let me repeat: Assertions that the Government's economic strategy has not worked neglect the achievements that are the result of that strategy. The rate of inflation has moderated in each quarter since the S.6 per cent increase in prices recorded in the December quarter of last year. Prices increased 3 per quarter, 2.S per cent in the June quaner and 2.2 per cent in the September quarter. Figures published recently shows that Australia's rate of inflation is now broadly in the OECD average. Industrial production hasfirmedsince July. Activity in the housing sector remains buoyant. Registrations of new passenger vehicles have recovered to more normal levels, following the due to the introducuon of more stringent emission control standards. The weakening in the labour market has been largely arrested over the course of the September quaner. I think that statement is a matter of which the House should again take note. It shows the consistent nature of Government policy and the achievements of that pohcy, bearing in mind the constant stress by the Prime Minister that it is a long haul and that a slow recovery is what the Government is aiming for. It will be a slow sure recovery; it will not be a yo-yo such as the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) implied at question time today. I quote another extract from the Treasurer's speech on 30 November. He said: The fact is that, faced with were only 2 alternatives; the options put to the Government by its advisers were devaluation or borrowing on official account, of the order of $1 billion, to shore up the reserves position. In these circumstances the Government could have allowed the situation to drift on and attempted to arrange of funher borrowings overseas tofinancewhat would inevithe tably have been funher outflows of private capital. The announcement of large additional borrowings, m a situation where our underlying external situadon remained out of line with our competitors, would have had perverse effects, leading to an escalating increase in the rate of loss of reserves. Such a loss, together with any additional borrowings the Government had been able to undenake would have inenormous costs to the authorities in the event that we were forced to make an exchange adjustment I want to quote one more extract from that speech but in the course of doing so let me remind the House that we would have had to borrow at least another $1 bilUon from international sources and this, in the estimate of the Treasurer, would only have bridged the situation temporarily. It would not have averted speculation, it would not have averted capital outflow, it would not have preserved jobs and it would have led to an eventual decision about devaluation. It was with reluctance but with wisdom that the Government took its decision to devalue. Towards the end of that speech on 30 November in this House the Treasurer said: The devaluation will restore the long run growth prospects for this sectorwhat has not been possible is That is the mining sectorand increase annual expon returns significantly-perhap s by approaching half a billion dollars. The devaluation will also go a long way towards offsetting the effect of excessive wage increases on costs of manufacturing and service industries such as tourism, enhancing their competitive ability. Theremovalof uncertainty about the exchange rate will recent in the March store investor confidence. What Australia requires most of all is investline with ment. Our scarcest commodity is capital. We have seen, even in 1973 and 1974 when we had record increases in wages, further squirreling and further saving by wage earners. People who talk sharp decline in July and August of a consumer led recovery have not found the means whereby we can unlock people's savings. We recognise that we need investment in Australia. We have a situation where because of speculation about our over valued dollar money was not coming into Australia-o n the contrary money was going out of Australia-and investment was not taking place in manufacturing industry, the industry which provides employment and in which the greatest unemployment has occurred. Export potential unquestionably will be increased as a result of the devaluation decision and will lead to further investment and more jobs. Much has been said about the trade unions. It the rundown in reserves, there is fair to say that the rank and file of the trade unions have recognised that if those who are currently in employment can minimise their wage demands then those who are unemployed will have a greater chance of gaining a job. wage increases in fact can really come only we have a substantial increase in productivity. We do not seek to improve productivity merely by improvements in technology alone, nor by managerial decisions alone. Nor do we seek improve it by decisions of the rank and file regarding their systems of work and their conPrime tributions. We seek to do it by mutual cooffices operation, a recognition that there is mutual interest in improving our efficiency and reducing our costs of production-that is improving productivity. It has been the decision of the Government look at the long term productivity prospects parallel with the economic strategy begun the day the Government came into office. That a strategy aimed at a medium term recovery. one suggested it was to be a short term panacea, a short term recovery. That economic strategy has continued unabated. There is nothing ad about it as suggested by this discussion. The mates of an inflationary impact concerning devaluation cannot be quantified. One has to the Opposition whether it seriously looks at alternative to devaluation. If it seriously looks at that it would realise that the economic situation of Australia would be infinitely worse over the next few months than it will be as a result of decision to devalue. I can only stress again that the Government is other constantly monitoring all the arms of pohcy and will adjust them according to need. The problem of this across-the-board measure was very much we the result of a series of across-the-board ister measures taken by the Labor Government-up ward valuations, across-the-board expenditure, inflation which had an across-the-board effect and tariff cuts which were of an across-the-board lines nature. We have reduced speculation, reduced Australian capital outflow, increased capital inflow, Mexico Way'. increased investment prospects and industries have ceased going offshore. We have increased the employment position as a result. We can compete with imports, we can have higher exports. We can gradually get ourselves back to full the standard of Uving which all Australians seek if they have the patience and the restraint to Uve with the Government's strategies.",35
63,Mr KEATING,ECONOMIC POLICIES,"The matHouse ter of pubUc importance the Opposition raises today concerns 'the ad hoc economic policies the Prime Minister and the Treasurer.' Frankly, the Opposition resents the presence of the Ministhese ter for Productivity (Mr Macphee) and the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Edwards) to defend the actions of the Treasurer (Mr Real Lynch) and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm when Fraser). Two shadow Ministers concerned with economics raise a matter in the House-a n attack upon the Prime Minister and the Treasurer-ye t we get a junior Minister, one who has been in the to Cabinet for 4 weeks, in here to defend the Government on 2 consecutive days while the Minister and the Treasurer hide in their downstairs. It is not good enough. It is not self good enough particularly for a government which has absolutely distinguished itself by a our total lack of consistency in economic pohcy. We raise the question of ad hockery because to that is the very essence of this Government's in present policy. When it came to power it from smashed the Labor Government's Budget. It is rejected the concept of a consumer led recovery. No Now we are in this position: We have no consumer led recovery and savings banks deposits are climbing. We have no investment led hoc recovery and investment in Australian manufacestituring industry is dropping all the time, as the Minister for Productivity well knows. The investask ment aUowance has had no effect whatsoever the and now the anti-inflation pohcy has failed. Just a day or so ago I asked the Treasurer in this House a question about import prices affectthe ing domestic prices and he had to admit that there would be an increase in domestic prices. In words, there will be an increase in inflation. So the Government has nothingrariningfor it in terms of a coherent economic pokey. Yet when raise this matter in the House we get the Minfor Productivity and the honourable member for Berowra here to defend the Government. I say that is not good enough from a Government which is very much under attack and under a cloud in this country. Look at the kind of headit is getting. The editorial in today's Financial Review is headed 'Down That is the way the Press regards the manner in which this Government is governing Australia. Let me quote the last 2 sentences: Mr Fraser stated in the 1975 elecuon that it could take a 3 years to restore the economy after the Whitlam years. A year later the scenario for recovery is even worse. It is even worse after a year. Yet the Prime Minister and the Treasurer cannot come into the to defend their poUcies. All this is the doing of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer- a of demented idealogue and his subservient deputy; the great economic managers, we were told; great men of business! What now is the fall-back strategy for the economic recovery of Australia? Bash the unions, pressure organised labour and hold down wages, in desperation, to save themselves at the next election. Let us examine their latest atrocity, the IVA per cent devaluation, because that is the rock on which their economic policy perishes. When introducing the Budget last August the Treasurer said that the Australian dollar was over-valued. If that is notttailingyour coat, I do not know what is. At the Cabinet meeting which discussed devaluation, only Senator Cotton, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the Treasurer were in favour of holding the line on the dollar. Even the Prime Minister was not in favour of it. And who would believe the assurances of the Treasurer to the House and to the nation when everybody knows that the Prime Minister and two-thirds of the Cabinet were in favour of a devaluation? If we get down to the nitty-gritty, Mr Fraser was probably Davidson's leak because Mr Fraser wanted the devaluation. Let us look at today's Inside Canberra. On the last page this passage appears: One of the Prime Minister's senior advisers told Inside Canberra this week the Government had no plans for reductions. He said tariff reductions would not be practical this stage because of the possibility of a significant revaluation of the dollar in the near future. That revaluation of the Australian dollar was announced today. It was revalued by 2 per cent. That story is in Inside Canberra, which would have been printed a couple of days ago. The information came from the Prime Minister's office. So the blame can be laid on the Prime Minister who always was a leak and who always will be a leak in any government in which he serves, even if it is his own. Let us look at the situation in respect of the reality of devaluation. Look at the reserves in 1973. They were $4.2 billion-excessive . What were they on 26 November? They were $2.1 billionnot dangerously low. In fact there was a strong and improving balance of payments, $629m surplus in the first 4 months of this finanBusinessmen, cial year. So if one talks about the basic strength of the currency or about it being over-valued, as honest the Treasurer did, there is the answer. Obviously they it was not over-valued. There was a trade surcarry plus. That meant that there was a responsibility on the Government to manage the invisibles-t manage the deficit. It could have done so in number of ways. It failed to do so. It allowed speculative outflow and did not check it. As honourable member for GelUbrand (Mr WilUs) pointed out not long ago, one of the reasons had the speculative outflow was that the Governmand ment, in its stupidity, allowed companies to what would otherwise have been the quarterly the nation. income tax collections. Companies were awash with money. They had money to burn. They put it out in speculation. It was the money which left Australia which finally forced this situation. We ask: Why were there not prohibitions on the export of money? Why was there not more scnitiny by the Reserve Bank under the Foreign Exchange Regulations of the reasons why companies wanted to take out money? Why were there not prohibitions on the repatriation of profit, or the variable deposit scheme in reverse? The reason was that the Prime Minister was in favour of devaluation and was prepared to do anything to get it. These companies have been rewarded with a 1TA per cent devaluation and a huge capital gain. Where is the consistency? The issue is the Treasurer's role. What is the Treasurer's role? He said that he would go to Cabinet and fight for the Treasury line against devaluation. He walks in, leaving Sir Frederick Wheeler and Mr Knight outside the meeting. The Secretary of the Treasury and the Governor of the Reserve Bank were not even invited. The tariff Treasurer presents thefiguresto the Prime Minat ister; the Prime Minister says: 'Yes. We must upward have a devaluation', and the Treasurer, cops it sweet. There was no argument. Who set the figure of 17V4 per cent? The Treasury would not have a bar of it because Sir Frederick was locked out of the discussions. Mr Knight would not have a bar of it. So the Government foolishly set its ownfigureof 1 IVi per cent. Now it has had to climb down today by 2 per cent because it had made the figure so high. AU of this happened because of the pigheadedness of the Prime Minister and because of the lack of any coherent economic strategy. I get back to the Treasurer's role. At this moment he is totally discredited. Everything he said in the House has been discredited. He has no coherent economic policy. I quote what he said in showing a December last year. consumers and members of the community generally can now look forward to stable, responsible and government under the coalition parties. In doing so, can take heart also from the fact that the incoming Government has a clear and positive economic strategy to through. o That was said by Mr Lynch last December. Nona sense-absolute , arrant nonsense, because there is now no poUcy. The Treasurer is discredited. the The only honourable course avaUable to him is to resign. That must be being put to him by his we back bench. We on this side of the House dehis resignation. We call for his resignation. hold He has misled not only the Parliament but also These 2 Mmisters, the Prime Minister and Treasurer, are obsessed with big projects. They think foreign investment will save the day them. It will take four orfiveyears to get projects off the line. They will mean nothing terms of Australian economic recovery. All tripping around the world that the Treasurer inviting foreign capital here, has to be squeezed off by the mechamsms, to which he referred question time, of the Reserve Bank, because if foreign inflow comes into this country and if Government beUeves it has to manage the proposed money supply rigorously it wiU have to close down aU lending available to the Australian community for housing and for all other things such as general manufacturing and all the areas where there is employment. If the Government accepts and does not regulate the inflow of speakers foreign capital there can be no recovery. There will be no consumer confidence and therefore there will be no long term recovery. The whole issue is this: The Government practised absolute ad hockery. It is now talking about cushioning primary industry against excesses of interest rates. It is now talking cushioning the export sector, manufacturing, the mining industry and the rest. What about all other people who do not get cushioned?",37

67,Dr EDWARDS,ECONOMIC POLICIES,"The insinwant cerity and opportunism of the Labor Opposition in bringing forward this matter are beyond bedeterioration Uef. For months honourable members opposite the have brought forward economic matters as matters of public importance for discussion in this for House. They have cried that the mix of poUcy big which we then had meant that the economy was in on a disaster course. I know because I responded the for the Government in these debates on a did, number of occasions. Now that there has been a change in the mix they tell us we are still on a disat aster course and the Government's economic poUcies are in disarray. I say that is opportunism the and is insincere. The matter of pubUc importance for discussion refers to the poUcies of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, but the poUcies are the poUcies of the Government. They are said to be aa hoc. The Government's strategy is said to be in disarray. This is not so. I will not waste my time attempting to answer Opposition point by point. Rather I will set out systematically the Government's economic pohcy. That policy is to achieve for this country lasting-I stress 'lasting'-economi c recovery, has restored growth and thrust, and Ml employment. That is and always has been the overriding the and dominant aim of the Government. To about achieve this we have focused on the importance of beating inflation because inflation is a princithe pal, if not the main cause, of unemployment. We have done this by attempting to rein in government spending, to get the deficit in the pubUc accounts under control and also to implement an But that has not been the only thrust of our policy. We sought by containing inflation I stress, indirectly-to promote recovery and greater employment. But we also designed directly- I stress, centdirectly-to encourage thrust and investment are at the centre of restoring employment. Let us remember that it is today's investment It hasthat creates the permanent jobs of tomorrow. Consequently, far from doing things to discourfor age investment, as the honourable member for (Mr Hurford) said a moment ago, we implemented the 40 per cent investment allowSo there was a mix of inflation, and thereby indirectly is not to promote recovery and employment, and to investment and increased employment direcdy by the 40 per cent investment allowance and other measures. There has been a change in that mix but not overall strategy because of changing circumstances. The principal circumstance to which I to draw attention is the increasing perception both at home and abroad of the very serious in this country's international competitiveness. The most insidious and potentially destructive legacy that this Government inherited from the previous Government was this significant deterioration in our economic competitiveness. This has proved a very great drag on the capacity of export and import competing industries to invest and to increase their activities and employment opportunities. As we know there has been an increasing movement of manufacturing activities offshore because of their lack of international competitiveness. Also manufacturing firms have increasingly become importers, and all at the cost ofjobs in Austraha. As I have said, there has been an increasing perception of this trend not only here but also overseas. A report in the Australian Financial Review of 30 November referred to the calculations that had been carried out in a company in Americathis was done in many companies in America-in an attempt to quantify the deterioration in competitiveness. The report stated that the company's calculations put the decline in Austrahan competitiveness over the past 3 years at between 12 and 14 per cent. In these circumstances not only was a change in the mix of policy all but inevitable but also it was a proper adaptation to that changing circumstance. The benefit to Australians will be increased investment and increased employment opportunities. With the devaluation of the Australian dollar the competitiveness of export and import competing industries is restored. It is not denied devaluation means that inflation will not get down as quickly as it would otherwise. Nevertheless, our resolve to beat inflation is as strong as ever. Our efforts to do this will involve, among other things, selective tariff changes, and renewed efforts in the area of prices and incomes. That means resolute action by this Government to prevent undue pricerisesand profiteering and an effort to restrain the futile process of price increases following wage increases and wage increases chasing prices. The honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) a moment ago said that what will happen is that there will be an onslaught against the unions, that we will resort to bashing the unions. It has always been an essential part of our total inflation pohcy to rein in this futile process to which I have referred. I believe that a majority of the Australian people recognise and support that view. In 1974-75 real wages-no t money wagesincreased by the order of 12 per cent. As Bob Hawke himself put it, that meant three or four years of normal growth in wages rolled into one year. That was the biggest factor contributing to the deterioration in the competitive situation which has brought on this change; it was the biggest factor contributing to an increase of200 000 people unemployed. Now there has to be a breathing space. I beheve that the majority of the Australian people recognise that. In pursuing this objective we have done various things to cushion the impact on the lower income groups. I am sure that other Australians will recognise the need for restraint.",39

69,Mr MCLEAY,BANKSTOWN AND LIDCOMBE," I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the PubUc Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the ParUamentary Standing Committee on PubUc Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Consolidation into Bankstown of the Bankstown and Lidcombe Government Aircraft Plants operated by Hawker de Havilland Australia Pty Ltd. The proposal involves the provision of additional facilities at the existing Bankstown plant to enable the transfer of all aircraft engine and helicopter transmission overhaul and repair operations and some machine shop operations now that being undertaken at Lidcombe. Both plants are operated by Hawker de Havilland Australia Pty Ltd. The estimated cost of the proposed work is $7.1m. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, in recommending the construction of these works, concluded that: 1. There is a continuing defence requirement for an aircraft repair and overhaul facility in the Sydney area; 2. This requirement can be met most efficiently by the consolidation at Bankstown of the Bankstown and Lidcombe government aircraft plants; 3. The Committee is satisfied that the present role of the Bankstown airport will continue through to the early 1990s. Upon the concurrence of the House in this resolution, detailed planning can proceed in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee.",40
70,Mr KEATING,BANKSTOWN AND LIDCOMBE,"The Bankstown airport is in the electorate of Blaxland and I am interested and have taken an interest in the consolidation of the Hawker de Havilland Australia Pty Ltd plant. The history, briefly, is that the Lidcombe plant is owned by the Government and leased by Hawker de was Havilland. It was an ex-wartime plant. In interests of economies the Government has deconsidered cided to merge the 2 plants at a cost of $7m. not cavil at that because this move will improve the competitiveness of Hawker de Havilland the aircraft industry. Most of the material coming from Lidcombe to Bankstown is of a manufacmake turing or service nature. It should not add a nificant amount of air traffic to the Bankstown airport. However, on that point I am very concerned because last year air traffic movements at Bankstown numbered 302 000. It is now the busiest airport in Austraha. There has been positive plan on the part of any federal or State government, up until now, to estabUsh another general aviation facUity on the north side ney. Unless there is some reUef at Bankstown someone will be lulled. There were S deaths 2 years ago. The air traffic must increase as it is only inner city outlet for light aircraft traffic sides the Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. Much of its Ught traffic is coming to Bankstown. The expansion of the Cessna Aircraft Company, the Piper Aircraft Australia facUities for assemwhat bly and now Hawker de HavUland is just adding to the infrastructure of industry around the airindustry. port. It hasflyingschools. More and more people are going there. Air safety is an urgent matter which has been forgotten by successive governcomplaints ments. The problem must soon be rectified. Theflightpatterns at Bankstown airport pass lic over 6 schools. The result will be that deaths must occur with the traffic demands at this So, I urge the Government to look favourably at estabUshing a new general aviation facility on the north side of Sydney, where 45 per cent of Bankstown's traffic comes from, in the interests of providing facUities for people in that area fly and also in the interests of safety and of giving some reUef from noise to the people of the located. Bankstown community. I do not oppose the consolidation of the Lidcombe plant because basically it is a manufacturing facUity. But I would not Uke to see consoUdation involving Hawker de HavUland become the vehicle by which Bankstown gets additional traffic.",40
71,Mr GARLAND,BANKSTOWN AND LIDCOMBE," I am very press glad to have the opportunity to support this motion for the consolidation or rationalisation, as it has been known, of 2 segments of the depacity fence aircraft industry in the metropoUtan area of Sydney. This consolidation has been all foreshadowed for many years. As a former Minister with an interest in this area, I know that this an important part of the proposed rationalisthe ation and increased workload schemes being in 1971 and 1972. The rationaUsation I do proposals go back a good deal earUer. The honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), in who has just spoken, has for some years displayed a considerable interest in this area. I bold to suggest that he has displayed an siginterest in defence, and aircraft in particular, quite apart from the needs of his constituents. Unfortunately, this rationalisation has been delayed far too long. It is many years overdue. I must say that I believe a former Minister for Defence, the Honourable Lance Barnard, did all no that he could in 1973 to hasten the rationaUsation. Unfortunately, he was stopped in the Australian Labor Party Cabinet of that day. I do not of Sydsay that the matter was treated by former Liberal-Country Party Governments with the high degree of urgency due to it. While welcomthe ing the proposal and supporting all the reasons begiven by the Minister for Construction and Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLeay) who moved the motion, I draw attention to these delays which have taken place and I believe is the unfortunate downgrading in priority over many years of the defence aircraft No doubt, if this country is ever in a position of requiring defence and military aircraft production capacity, there will be great about this Government not spending the time and proceeding with such matters urgently. But the truth is, that in general the pubis not very interested in this area either. As has been said in the report which came from the Parlevel.Uamentary Joint Committee on Public Works, there is a need for some defence aircraft capacity in the metropoUtan area of Sydney. It will certainly be much more efficient and, one hopes in the long term, cost saving to move machine tools who from Lidcombe where no airport is located to Bankstown a distance of some nules where one is Furthermore, the buildings and machinery at Lidcombe are old. All logic is in favour of the rationalisation. One can only wonder how it is that it has taken the national parUament and national governments so many years to get this process into motion. If I might be permitted, I exan element of despair and exasperation in this debate. As for the main matter referred to by the honourable member for Blaxland, the caat Bankstown is a problem but I do not believe it is a matter which should influence us at in a consideration of this change because there is already an existing defence capacity at Bankstown. Everything is in favour of consolidating the machine shop which exists at Lidcombe with something which will be more worthwhile. Hopefully the day is not too far off when we will see an expansion and rationalisation in the wider sense of the term throughout the whole defence aircraft industry in Australia. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA (PROHIBITION OF CERTAIN EVIDENCE) AMENDMENT BILL 1976 Bill-by leave-presented by Mr Ellicott, and read afirsttime.",41
72,Mr ELLICOTT,FOREIGN PROCEEDINGS,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to make certain amendments to the Foreign Proceedings (Prohibition of Certain Evidence) Act 1976. The House will recall that this Act was passed as a matter of urgency on 18 November 1976 because proceedings were then pending in the Supreme Court of New South Wales to take evidence for the purpose of proceedings in a court of the United States of America. In the course of the debate in this chamber and in another place, attention was directed to some aspects of the Bill which appeared to deserve further consideration. At the time there was a need for the Bill to be passed into law without delay, but in the other place my colleague, Senator Durack, indicated with my approval that the Government would give close consideration as soon as possible to matters that had been raised and introduce an amending Bill to correct any deficiencies. The Government has now been able to give the matter further consideration and has concluded that the amendments provided for in the present Bill are desirable. The principal change provided for in the Bill is the abolition sub-section (2) of section 4 of the Act. This section provides that the validity of an order of the Attorney-General is not lenge in any court. The argument has been advanced that provisions of this kind are not generally desirable and should be confined to those situations where they are really necessary. In the context of the present Bill the Government has concluded that this provision is not strictly necessary and its repeal is accordingly provided for by the present Bill. The Government has concluded moreover that the Parliament should be able to disallow an order made by the the Attorney-General in the same way as it would be able to act if the orders were made by regulation. The Bill accordingly provides for an order to be tabled and to be subject to disallowance by either House in accordance with the procedure under the Acts Interpretation Act which applies to regulations. There are 2 grounds provided in section 4 upon which the Attorney-General may act in making an order under section 5. One is that a foreign tribunal is exercising jurisdiction in a manner that is contrary to international law or comity; the other is that an order is desirable to protect the national interest. Logically, an order made on thefirstof these grounds should be confined in its operation to the particular foreign triSecond Reading bunal that is breaching international law or comity. As this is not the position under the existing Act the Bill provides for it to be so. Different considerations apply, of course, where an order is made on the ground of national interest. In such a case it is appropriate that the order should apply to all foreign tribunals and not be confined to any particular tribunal. That is now the position under the Act. Another matter that was the subject of comment when the legislation was being debated by the Senate related to the definition of a foreign tribunal. Doubts were raised as to whether this definition might cover the Privy Council. In view of those doubts the Bill provides for an express provision to make the position clear. Under this provision 'foreign tribunal' is not to include the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the exercise of jurisdiction in respect of appeals from any court in Australia. Two other amendments to the ensure the legal effectiveness of the legislation are proposed. One avoids a distinction under the existing Act between an order that has been served and one that has been deemed to be served. The other provides that where a person is prohibited from making evidence available to a tribunal in Austraha, the tribunal is not to be of able to require a person to act in contravention of sub- the order. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Lionel Bowen) to be subject to chal- adjourned. HISTORIC SHIPWRECKS BILL 1976 Second Reading",42
73,Mr ELLICOTT,FOREIGN PROCEEDINGS," I move: That the Bill be now read a second dme. This Bill will provide machinery to protect the large number of historic shipwrecks and relics on continental shelf of Austraha. It also provides controls for the recovery of such wrecks and rehcs and for their disposition. In particular, Bill makes provision for the protection of the Dutch shipwrecks and relics covered by the 1972interest agreement between the Australian and cases Netherlands Governments. Under this agreeunaware ment the Commonwealth has accepted responmetals sibilities in relation to the Dutch East India pany vessels that were wrecked on or off the coast of Western Australia. There is at present specific Commonwealth legislation on historic shipwrecks, although some control is possible under the Navigation Act. Western Australia does have legislation, but the validity of this legislation has been contested before the High Court. The decision which may resolve the ter is awaited. The Government beUeves that Commonwealth has the necessary constitutional powers to legislate in this area and considers it should introduce appropriate Commonwealth legislation into the Parliament sittings. Should the relevant ment be handed down in the meantime, the Billmonwealth agenciesofand will be reviewed in the Ught of that judgment. I am sure that all Australians will agree there is an urgent need for effective legislation this field. The Committee of Inquiry on monwealth Museums and National Collections has pointed out that a wealth of historical material Ues neath the waters off the Australian coast. More than 500 shipwrecks have already been located and identified, and about 1500 more ships known to have been wrecked around the coastAustralia's line. These ships are an important part of Australia's heritage and a vital part of its history.monwealth Many were involved in the early exploration this region. They reflect European man's early contact with Australia. Many were involved in the carriage of migrants to this land. Many wereServices involved in the vital cargo trade that was first Australia's lifeline and later essential to its growth and ultimate prosperity. For the historian their contents provide valuable guidance to the habits and customs of the period. For every traUan they are a reminder of the courage, initia-are tive and skill of our pioneer sailors. The Government shares the Pigott Comissue mittee's view that these shipwrecks must be pro-shipwrecks tected-fro m acts of outright vandahsm, from as are considered indiscriminate looting, from impetuous souvenirrounding a declared ing and accidental damage or destruction. declared a protected zone Already future research in marine archaeology controls to be appUed to any has been severely impaired because of the manyoccur in the area. shipwrecks which have been damaged, by accident or design, in the last 2 decades. I am sure most of those who take part in the increasingly popular sport of diving in search of shipwrecks are aware of the need to respect and preserve the these memories of our past. But there have been oldcases when shipwrecks of immense historical have been wantonly destroyed. In other well meaning souvenir hunters have been that, following exposure to seawater, become unstable and require expensive Com-and lengthy conservation treatment. As a result, >eople acting in the best of faith have deprived no! inure generations of reUcs of great historical value. I stress that the Government is particularly appreciative of the major role being played by Western Australia in preserving that part of Australia's history represented by shipwrecks lying off the Western Australian coast. The Westmat-ern Australian Museum, through its Fremantle theBranch and associated conservation laboratory, leads Australia in marine archaeology and the thatpreservation of historic shipwrecks. during the current theAcontinuance principal purpose of the Bill is to provide for on a sound legal basis of the High Court judgexisting high level co-operation between Comsuch State institutions as the Western Australian Museum. The Bill that therefore contains provisions that will allow inagreements to be entered into between the Comand the States relating to implementation and enforcement of the legislation. These beinclude provisions enabling the Minister to delegate his powers for these and other purposes. Such agreements would enable States to conare tinue and expand their efforts to preserve maritime heritage under secure national legislation. At the same time, the Comwill be able to act in the national of interest when this becomes necessary. I turn now to the main provisions of the Bill. Under the Bill, the Minister for Administrative is authorised to declare as historic shipwrecks or historic articles the remains of ships or items from them that are of historic significance. These then become subject to the protective provisions of the Bill. Under these provisions perAus-sonsfindingor having possession of such items required to notify the Minister. The Minister is then empowered to give directions as to how the items are to be dealt with, and he may also permits for the exploration or recovery of and rehcs subject to such conditions appropriate. The area surwreck or article may be and this will permit activity that may In its report, the Pigott Committee pointed out that any legislative action should be accompanied by compUation of detaUed wreck records. The Government endorses this suggestion. As a result, the Bill provides that a register, to be known as the Register of Historic Shipwrecks, will be maintained. This register will be open to public inspection. I believe all Australians will welcome this move to protect, preserve and record important aspects of Australia's early days. Maintenance of the register will not only assist in preserving these shipwrecks, it should also provide a valuable guide to those who wish to see, but not interfere with, the reUcs of our past for themselves. I would point out that one of the major aims of this legislation is the preservation of our links with our past history. As I mentioned previously, perhaps fewer than one-quarter of the known wrecks have been located. While protecting these wrecks, the Government is also anxious to ensure that exploration and discovery is not inhibited or prevented. Even on a recreational basis, the process of exploration is a costly one. As well, many of these vessels contain valuable cargo. To reduce temptation while at the same time encouraging exploration, the Bill provides for the payment of a reward for the discovery of hitherto unlocated historic shipwrecks. The amount of the reward will not be contained in the legislation, but will be determined from time to time, according to the relative money values of the day and the importance of the discovery. The aim of this reward provision is to encourage exploration and discovery without offering incentives to pillaging. By way of illustration, the money value of the coins found on the Dutch shipwrecks off the Western Australian coast amount to many hundreds of thousands of dollars. It would be unfair and unreal to deny totaUy any prospective discoverer some reward for his effort. Dutch shipwrecks, which are mentioned in the 1972 agreement between the Netherlands and Australia concerning old Dutch shipwrecks, are automaticaUy brought within the protective provisions of the Bill without the need for prior declaration by the Minister. The agreement and a list of known such vessels and their locations are presented in schedules to the Bill. Further shipwrecks will be placed on the register as appropriate. I wish to express my thanks to the Western Australian authorities for the advice that has been given to the Commonwealth while this legislation has been under preparation. This has ensured that difficulties that might otherwise have arisen have been avoided and that legislation able to meet the needs of the States has been produced. Before concluding I wish to foreshadow 3 amendments I propose to move to the Bill that arise from points made during the debate on the Bill in another place and from further consideration of the Bill by the Government. The first relates to clause 9 of the Bill. It has been suggested that, as the clause stands, a person who, quite innocently and legally, has in his possession an article that comes within the protection of the legislation may be prosecuted for failing to notify the Minister that he has that article, despite the fact that he did not know that the article is, in fact, a protected one. My colleague, the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Withers), has considered this matter and has agreed that it would be reasonable to provide a defence to a charge brought in such circumstances, and an amendment to achieve this will be moved at the appropriate time. The second matter relates to clause 17 of the Bill. Sub-clause (2) of that clause sets up a defence for a person who faUs to give the required notice with regard to the discovery of a wreck. It makes it a defence against a prosecution if the person charged can prove that someone else has given the necessary notice. It has been suggested that it should also be a defence if a person has reasonable grounds for beUeving that the necessary notice has already been given. The Minister for Adniinistrative Services has also accepted this point and an amendment to cover it will be moved at a later stage. Finally, the Government has given further consideration to the terms of clause 23 of the Bill. It is now proposed to speU out expressly that selfmcrimination constitutes a reasonable excuse for the purposes of sub-clause (5), thus confirming that this is a defence to a prosecution for failing to comply with a requirement to answer a question under sub-clause (1). This reflects the Government's concern to ensure that civU liberties are clearly accorded proper recognition by Commonwealth legislation. I believe that this proposed legislation will adequately serve the purpose of protecting an important part of Australia's national heritage and I commend it to the House. Debate (on motion by Dr Cass) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1976 [No. 2] In Committee Consideration resumed from 6 December. Clauses 1 and 2-by leave-take n together and agreed to. Clause 3 (Interpretation).",42
74,Dr CASS,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Depending upon what happens later, this clause may need be amended. Clause postponed. Clause 4 agreed to. Clause S (EstabUshment of Tribunal).",45
75,Dr CASS,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION," I move: After proposed section 10, sub-section (4), insert lowing sub-section: *(4A) A person who immediately before the day held office as a full-time or pan-time member Board for a term expiring after that day shall be appointed as a member of the Tribunal and shall hold office equivalent to the remainder of the term to which he would have been entitled but for the provisions of this Act.'. This amendment would make this legislation consistent with an amendment that the Government has moved to legislation dealing with the appointment of commissioners to the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Our view is that, whatever the purpose behind the Government's legislation may be, if it is not to be seen to be simply aimed at getting at people who have been appointed to statutory bodies for a statutory period, the present occupants of these positionsnamely, the Commissioners or members of Australian Broadcasting Control Board-shoul be permitted to see out their terms of appointupon ment. We are not suggesting that they should given an extension or that they should be vides reappointed after their present term expires. But, consistent with what we think is a fairly mental principle, that is, that no government should be seen to be sacking appointees to statuing tory authorities, we thought that this amendment should be moved. We are not arguing against the abolition present Austrahan Broadcasting Control we are not begging afighton that. We concede that the proposed Australian Broadcasting Tribunal would be a reasonable body. It is going be quasi-judicial body, as the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson) mentioned in his second reading speech. Neverbe the less, it will perform the most fundamental duties that are now encompassed within the responsibUities of the present Australian BroadMalcolm casting Control Board. So, to avoid the suggesto tion that the whole purpose of the exercise in abolishing the Control Board is simply to get those office holders, we propose that they should be appointed to the new Tribunal, not for the full term as specified in the Bill for office holders, for the balance of the term they would have as members of the Control Board. As I understand it, that would mean that only two of the present office holders appointed by to the Labor Government would continue in office; that pretty well straight away-in fact, from 1 January-the present government would have a majority because, due to the normal efflux of time and the normal periods of appointment, 2 vacancies wiU occur irrespective of the legislation. There is already one person who was appointed by the present Government. That the folwould mean that from 1 January three out of the present 5 office holders will have been appointed commencing by the present Government. So honourable of the members could not say that the Tribunal would be suffering from having been stacked, as for a term has been claimed in respect of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board-and I dispute that claim. Mr Donald Cameron-Mariu s Webb does not.",45
76,Dr CASS,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"We are not talking about the Australian Broadcasting Commission; we are talking about the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, a different body. It is quite clear that from 1 January, no matter what happens, it will not be possible to claim that the Tribunal is burdened by a majority of people appointed by the prethe vious Labor Government. That will be mathd ematically impossible. I am trying to impress the Government the point that it should not be be seen to be breaking a convention which prothat, by and large, statutory office holders see out their terms of office; that they are not cut fundaoff in mid-stream by incoming governments. True, the Government is changing its broadcastand television legislation and hence is changing the name of the Act, but this could be seen as simply a device to achieve the purpose of sacking somebody who was appointed by the Labor of the Government. For those reasons we have moved Board; the amendment to clause 5.",45
77,Mr COHEN,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"I regard to this as a very serious matter, as I regarded the previous proposal that all the Commissioners of the Australian Broadcasting Commission were to sacked. A very great danger in this sort of legislation is that we will politicise broadcasting, which is exactly what the Prime Minister (Mr Fraser) has claimed he does not want do. I am pleased to see that the Government has decided not to go ahead with the sacking of at the ABC Commissioners. But once the practice is started of sacking commissions and setting up new bodies, or of sacking all those appointed by. but a Labor government or by a Liberal-National had Country Party government, then that part of government becomes politicised. We would create a situation whereby automatically when there was a change of government there would be wholesale sackingsmembers of all statutory bodies, committees and commissions who were appointed by the previous government would befired.This could be done by sacking them and setting up a new body. The result is the same. Once we start to bring that practice into government-it is a very dangerous practice-w e will have a situation such as the one that exists in the United States of America whereby when a new government takes over it brings in all its Democrats, Republicans and so on, and the reverse happens when the other party wins. We do not want that to happen in Australia. I believe that the fact that it does not happen in Australia is one of the strengths of our system. I hope that in this case the Government will change its mind about this Tribunal, as apparently it has done about the Australian Broadcasting Commission.",45
78,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"The Government rejects the amendment. It is not a question of concern or speculation that the Government wants to have 'its nominees' on this particular Tribunal. The Tribunal will be quite different from the Australian Broadcasting Commission. It will be an entirely new body. As honourable members will know, 2 members of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board will retire at the end of December this year anyhow. I do not rule out that people who have served on the Control Board might be invited to serve on the Tribunal. The Tribunal will not have part time members; it will have associate members. I see no relationship, in principle, to the comparison with the Austrahan Broadcasting Commission. We want to have associate members with specific knowledge about problems which will be tackled by the new Tribunal. I reject any suggestion that there is any attempt at poltiical interference. The Australian Broadcasting Control Board is being disbanded. This is an entirely new body. The Government cannot accept the amendment. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clause 6. Section 16 of the Principal Act is repealed and ing section substituted: ' 16. (1) The functions of the Tribunal are to perform duties and to exercise the powers imposed or conferred upon it by other provisions of this Act and, in addition(a) to determine the standards to be observed by licensees in respect of broadcasting or televising grams; (b) to determine the conditions subject to which advertisements may be broadcast or televised by licensees; and (c) to determine the hours during which programs are to be or may be broadcast or televised by licensees, and include such other functions in relation to broadcasting stations and television stations as are prescribed.'",46
79,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION," I move: In proposed section 16(l)(c),omit'aretobeor\ I have received some submissions to the effect that some people are concerned that the addition of these words may be too restrictive. The Government therefore moves for their deletion. Amendment agreed to.",46
80,Dr JENKINS,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"I move: After paragraph (c) of proposed sub-section 16(1) insert the following paragraph: '(d) to ensure that adequate and comprehensive programs are provided by commercial broadcasting stations and commercial television stations in the best interests of the general public' This is always a fairly deUcate situation with regard to the operation of these stations. This clause already gives the Tribunal the power to deterrnine standards and the conditions under which advertisements may be broadcast or televised and to deterrnine hours. With the power such as the commercial media has, there must also be a great deal of responsibility. It is suggested that there should be a self-regulatory type of mechanism with regard to the types of urograms. I have had occasion over the years to ! ook at this problem of self-regulation in other areas, including the area of advertising, where ethics are laid down. One concerns the Press, where there is now a Press Council. I, Uke many people I talk to in the community, have grave doubts concerning this self-regulatory type of mechanism. In fact, a tribunal which determines these other conditions should also have some regard to the types of program that are being broadcast or televised over these stations. They should present a comprehensive picture. One of the problems that we have in Australia is the overwhelrning control of the media by a few groups. It is often stated that apart from the ABC, the Australian media is effectively controlled by 4 companies-the Herald and Weekly the followTimes, Fairfax and Sons, News Limited and ConsoUdated Press. I do not think that in any the other country in the world is there such a concentration of the mass media in such a circumscribed area. When we look at these adequate and of procomprehensive programs, we must also have some regard to the question of what is happening concerning the question of local content in programs. Approximately 37 per cent of the propower grams on commercial television are made in Australia. Both the United Kingdom and the United States have a local content component at least 85 per cent. I appreciate that their facUicommercial ties for doing so are much greater than ours. They have a much greater viewing audience that there is a possibility of getting this higher percentage. But I beheve, in requesting comprereading hensive programs, that we should also be asking that there be more than 37 per cent local content. It has been stated in this House many times fore, with regard to these programs, that an hour-long American drama costs $400,000 to produce. The same type of program can be produced in Austraha for $40,000 but the American programs are imported for about there $5,000. If the Tribunal, amongst its responsibUities, can use its influence in this way, it will be to benefit of the community generally. In addition, some concern has been expressed within the community that the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations and ation of Australian Radio Broadcasters believe that in many ways the ABC should not compete with the commercial stations. They believe that only a section of what is available should be left in the ABC area. If this attitude prevails, along with the financial cuts that have been made, we will suffer very much in the area of nontalked commercial radio and television. At the moment the newsroom of the ABC in Melbourne is on the 15th floor of Marland House at 570 Bourke Street. It is in the position of having antiquated equipment and with staff going It is quite inadequate as a newsroom and it is unable to give the coverage that we expect to receive from the ABC. The Labor Party is not alone in asking that regard be given to the types of programs that are exhibited on commercial radio. A public meeting was recently held in MelLabor bourne concerning this matter. It passed the folallows lowing resolution with regard to the fundamenvision tal principles of Australian broadcasting: This meeting, in the interests of ensuring that the community benefit is achieved as a result of the bate on Australian broadcasting, urges all participants due regard to the following fundamental matters: (a) That the commercial sector be required gramme a significant and expanding proportion of all types of Australian productions so that our broadcastregulatory ing truly reflects Australian society and culture utilises the talents of Australians to the maximum extent. The amendment goes further than that. It deals with other areas but I believe these worthwhile objectives. I do not suggest that be given to the Tribunal to use the big axe m the commercial area but that it should have a general responsibUity to see that there is adof equate and comprehensive programming by the stations in the best interests of the general pubUc and not just programming which so is necessarilyfinanciallyrewarding. I did not have the opportunity to speak during the second debate on the Bill and so I feel somewhat restricted. Therefore, I shall speak to this clause which, in deaUng with the powers of the beTribunal, mentions standards, conditions and hours. Now, this amendment deals with the type of programming that should be undertaken. But it seems to me that it is an indication of how hastily this legislation has been prepared that are so many other factors that should have been the subject of public debate before the matter was brought before the Parliament. There are matters in the Green report-no w a pubUc report the although the result of a private mquiry-whic h would better have been publicly debated before the legislation was brought forward. Parliament should have been allowed to make a decision be the Federfore the Bill was introduced. I refer now to the further responsibUities of the commercial stations in regard to the Tribunal. I think we should realise that commercial stations in this area have great privUege in being able to run their services. While self-regulation has been about, I have to admit that I have far more confidence in the responsibUity residing with Parliament than with a few entrepreneurs in the private sphere. I urge the Committee to consider seriously giving this further responsibiUty down the drain. to the Tribunal.",46
81,Mr CHIPP,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"I am rather surprised that this amendment comes from the Labor Party, particularly when the honourable member for Maribyrnong is leading for the Party in this debate. This clause virtuaUy the most stringent censorship of our telescreens. I know what the honourable member for ScuUin (Dr Jenkins) is driving at on the question of standards. I sympathise with him. greatest But I am rather persuaded to the view of the current deMinister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr to pay Eric Robinson) that we ought at least to give the private commercial interests and the Australian to proBroadcasting Commission a chance to be selfin the question of standards. They are and the experts and they, I think, know what the pubhc wants. They can assess what the public wants. If commercial interests assess wrongly their ratings go down. A self-regulatory process is that there are already m the system. The honourable member for Scullin suggested that the ultimate arbiter on this matter should be Parliament. God forbid that we should have politicians determining television standards and what is in the best interests of the public. I wonder, with great respect, whether this amendment has been thought out very clearly. Let me quote the words of the amendment. They call for a subjective judgment. The amendment, which refers to the Tribunal, reads: to ensure that adequate and comprehensive programsWhat the hell do 'adequate' and 'comprehencertainlysive' mean? The amendment continues: are provided by commercial broadcasting stations and commercial television stations in the best interestsCan somebody tell me what that means? Does that mean that the best interests are served putting on television a whole host of religious programs? If so, what religion? Should we be preaching for chastity before marriage or nonlocal chastity before marriage? Should we say that the best interests of the people lies with cowboy Indian shows? The more one discusses this more absurd the situation becomes. The last of the amendment is classic. It reads: of the general public. Politicians, I think, spend most of their lives trying to search for that very elusive person, the employed general public. Who is he? Where is he? Are the series. Theinnumber honourable member for Scullin and the honourable for Maribyrnong saying that, with a show such as Alvin Purple- I raised this matter in the 9000 House previously-whic h extraordinarily grabs going 33 per cent of the viewer ratings, somebody can weeks of say that it is not adequate and that it is not comprehensive. From reports I have heard, certain scenes are very comprehensive, but I was never vision privileged to watch any of them. Will anybody very say that Alvin Purple is not in the best interests of the general public? The amendment seeks a very subjective judgment. It smacks of censorship. For that reason alone I would oppose it. The honourable member for Scullin did not deal to any great extent with an area about I am deeply concerned, that is, the self regulatory functions of local content. I hope I do not mislaissez-faire, quote the Minister, but I understood him to say series. that the Government has made no decisions on this and that this is one of the things that the Government will ask the Tribunal to would not want to pre-empt the considerations of the Tribunal about whether commercial stathink tions should determine their own local content. agree with the honourable member for Scullin that here is an area where Parhament ought to step in and give some direction or indication the Tribunal. I am completely persuaded that our national and commercial television should contain ample local content. I hope I am not mistaking the position, but I understand that all the licensees promised, when they got their licences, that they would include at least SO per cent local content in their programs. I am informed that last year- I tliink it is worse this year-loca l content was down to 36 per cent. That 36 per cent local content included things such as the news, weather reports, sportingfixtures,sporting replays, Moomba parades and so on which Mr Jull-Thos e programs use a lot of staff too.",47
82,Mr CHIPP,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Agreed. I thank my friend for the interjection. I was about to say that these local by content programs are certainly good. Perhaps I should be more specific and say that I would like to see the preservation of drama and the usage of talent such as actors, writers and directors. I propose to cite somefiguresgiven to me. I do not and vouch for their veracity. They were given to me the by the Actors and Announcers' Equity Associpart ation of Austraha and I put them on record. Whether they are believed or not does not matter. If somebody can assail thesefiguresas being untruthful it would be useful to the debate. In 1974, 6000 actors and 15 000 others were drama-that is, serials and other dropped in 1975 from 6000 actors to 4000 actors and from 15 000 others to others. In the same period local content dropped from 44 per cent to 37 per cent. Ondrama production dropped from 421 production in 1974 to 269 weeks in 1975. I am not blaming the commercial telestations. People involved with the commercial television stations, thank goodness, are responsible and able businessmen. The commercial television stations are all public companies. They have shareholders. Of course they are impelled to maximise their profits. They are not in the business of idealism, altruism, or nationalism. I beheve that we in Australia are which very fortunate with the caUbre of our productions and television stations. If we gave them of course they would buy the Kojak",48
83,Mr COHEN,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,You don't like Kojak! He is the look at. I only one who is any good.,48
84,Mr CHIPP,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"It is my favourite program. I it is fantastic. Why should it not be? It costs I $400,000 an episode to produce and our commercial television stations can buy it for something like $5,000. I am told that it would cost to $50,000 to produce a comparable Australian program. If I were the managing director of a commercial television station I would go for Kojak rather than the Australian production. But it is important that we maintain the good tralian productions. I think that a nation has have an ability to look at itself, to laugh at itself and to be critical of itself. We might all cast persions on Number 96, The Box and Alvin Purmarket ple which are produced here-the y do not capand ture my fancy-bu t at least in these programs Australian can see himself mirrored. One of problems about Australia and Australians is that we do not laugh at ourselves enough and we not fully see ourselves as we really are.",48
85,Dr CASS,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,Ludicrous .,49
86,Mr CHIPP,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"I think it is important it is basic. This is all I propose to say about matter When the Tribunal examines the selfenable regulatory functions concerning content, I would be very distressed if that was left entirely to commercial television stations.",49
87,Mr COHEN,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION," I was prised at the comments of the honourable memtalked ber for Hotham (Mr Chipp). He expressed surabout prise at the comments of the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass). We are aU being surprised by one another. I happen to remember that, when the honourwith able member for Hotham was the Minister for Customs and Excise in a previous Government, he led the way in liberalising censorship. At that time he had great difficulty in denning the phrase 'acceptable community standards'. The same criticism that is now being been levelled at him at that time. I agree with his comment that the amendment moved by the position is vague. But this aspect was vague at the time when he was a Minister. The phrase ceptable community standards' was difficult define then and it is difficult to define in an amendment of this kind because it is a vague concept. I think all honourable members know what want to see in this Act. We want to see certain standards maintained and an attempt to lift standards of television and the media. I do not think we should apologise for taking that attiicals, tude. I notice that the Minister for Post and Teleterms. communications (Mr Eric Robinson) is smUing. Perhaps he is not smiling at me. Is it that we should be slaves to the rating system? have all turned on commercial radio and teleting vision, particularly radio, and have flicked from station to station. We find one station after another pushing out the same sort of program, whether it be in Canbena, Sydney or Melbourne. I like listening to a certain percentage of popular music. I can tolerate even a little of Bay City RoUers. The point is that there is another listenAusing audience. AU honourable members will be to aware that the eight or ten commercial radio stations in each city are aiming at that particular asrating which gives them the percentage of the which enables them to obtain advertising make profits. The difficulty is that those staan tions are aiming their programs at 51 per cent of the the listening audience. Those who want something different-who, in the case of radio want do more current affairs and talk-back programs and, in the case of television, want more current affairs programs, serious music, ballet and so on-miss out because those programs do not get and I think good ratings. the I would be opposed to any words that would any suggestion of censorship to be read into our amendment. I do not think that we can the define in exact terms what we seek. It is the same sort of problem that the honourable member for surHotham had when he was the Minister and about 'acceptable community standards' 5 years ago when he did such a good job of liberahsmg censorship in Austraha. He had that problem as would any government. A problem which concerns me-it is not connected directly the debate today because we are now getting down to a bit of the nittygritty-is the public debate which has taken place during the past few weeks about broadcasting. Almost aU the debate has been about the ABC and criticisms of it. Mr King-The ABC has been criticising the made could well have legislation. Op Mr COHEN-The ABC quiterightlyhas been criticising the legislation because it has a great 'acfear of what this Government has in mind. to Government back benchers in the last few days seem to me to have come to their senses. I am not surprised that the ABC and the Opposition are fearful of what the Government has in mind after the vicious attacks that were made upon the we ABC by the Government's spokesman, when it was in Opposition, the present Minister for the Transport (Mr Nixon), who did not stop trying to label ABC staff as a bunch of left wing rad'pinkoes', 'commies' and other abusive wrong to say Mr Donald Cameron-Hear , hear! We Mr COHEN-Do not interject; go back to getgirls to jump out of cakes. We do not want the poor man's Hugh Hefner displaying his wisdom. The problem that concerns me is that the Liberal and National Country Parties have hated the ABC for as long as I can recall. They have never stopped abusing it. They have never stopped trying to denigrate the ABC and accusprograms ing it of left wing bias. That is why I am scepticalmunity. of the sudden change of heart displayed by the Government. I propose to speak to a number of other amendments but I did want to make the point that somebody has to oversee the stanBroadcasting dards of radio and television and must attempt lift the standards just a little; hopefully, the tural level of programs will be lifted too. might smack of elitism, perhaps it does. I do think we need to apologise for it. We do not apologise for it in our education system. We not apologise for it in a range not see why we should apologise for attempt to improve the quality of the media Australia.",49
88,Mr JULL,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION," I will keep my comments on this clause brief. We are dealing with the establishment of the Broadcasting bunal in this clause. I think this is one of the ter parts of the legislation. Apart from the fact that the Tribunal will be issuing licences, it has responsibility to determine such matters Austrahan content. If we are perfectly frank and perfectly honest with ourselves, our history in regard to legislating about Australian telean vision program content is an absolute disaster. we have only 37 per cent Australian content the air at the moment we have nobody to but ourselves and the bureaucrats who meddle with the system. We did have a percentage system. It was very easy for commercial television stations to fiddle that system. It was easy for a station to increase its percentage as it could put on cheap programs. There were many ways and means of getting sidearound that system. We saw another attempt to He adds: increase Australian content in programs when You the Department of the Media was estabUshed. It around introduced the points system which, quite frankly, was absolutely catastrophic. If Ausand tralian content has dropped to that 37 per cent we can refer to that points system and blame low percentage on it. That system pletely and utterly unworkable. I agree with some of the comments of the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp). thought that some of the points he made were very good. Who are we to arbitrate on the tastes and the requirements of the Australian lation? We have tried it. We tried it with the points system. We tried it in the area of dren's programs which I mentioned in a speech earUer when the guideUnes for commercial telewas vision stations were set down. Some expensive children's programs were made but nobody watched them. What is the point in making such if they are not accepted by the comIt is time that we brought together those involved in the industry including the general public, members of Actors Equity and others in the area to sort out the whole problem. The Tribunal could take such steps. I tobeUeve that this is what is meant by selfculregulation. It is an opportunity for the whole That community to come together, to examine the not problems that exist in Australia and to make some constructive suggestions. The industry do could then investigate ways of improving the of other areas. I do system. it in our Mr DONALD CAMERON (Griffith) in (5.13)-The honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen) made reference to what he described as hysteria on this side of the Committee. He said that Government supporters had Tria feeling that the Australian Labor Party had bet-made the ABC its front. Of course, we are dealing with the Broadcasting Tribunal so proposed also by this clause. The. honourable member for as Robertson ran off the rails for a moment. I should Uke to correct his comments. He referred to Government members regarding the ABC as ALP front. For the sake of the honourable Ifmember for Robertson I should like to relate to on the House the words uttered at a conference by blame Mr Marius Webb on 28 November 1975 when he referred to the ABC commissioners. His comments have caused some concern on this side of the Committee in recent times. He said: The Commissioners are now all Labor appointees of Connie Benn, Richard Harding, Hackett, Lashwood, Smith and Harris and Jacobsen are all pretty much on cultivate Harding a bit? Yes he is good. He walks the corridors handing out 'Shame Fraser, Shame' buttons but other than that . . . so it goes on. If the honourable member for Robertson sat down one day and read this tranthescript of the address given by Marius Webb a was comyear ago, he would learn",50
89,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,Mr GILES) Order! I am not sure but I think the honourable I member is talking about the Commission and not the Tribunal. This clause does not deal with the Commission. Will the honourable member poputie his remarks to the Tribunal?,50
90,Mr DONALD CAMERON,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Mr Deputy chilChairman, you allowed the honourable member for Robertson to talk about the Commission. I only correcting what he said because later his remarks will be forgotten and lost. I was saying that the Commission was a cesspool of people with Labor leanings. I will not go so far to say that its members were 'commos' and 'radthat icals'. I want to speak to the clause we are supposed to be dealing with and which relates to the open Tribunal. I would like the Minister for Post and tion, Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson) to exthe system plain to the Committee how he that the Tribunal will be responsive to comAmen. munity needs. I note that proposed new section 16(1) (b) contains the words 'to deterrnine the conditions subject to which advertisements may be broadcast or televised by licensees'. In weeks there has been growing concern in this country about the quality and effect of advertiseness ments shown during what might be described children's hours, that part of the day set aside viewing by children. Children are frequently used in the advertisements and the advertisesubjective ments are frequently directed towards children. We know that television advertising is very pensive and no advertiser is likely to outlay huge sums of money to produce an advertisement less he is convinced that it is going to bring about a profitable return. It would therefore seem that advertisements directed towards children pay handsome dividends. One honourable member remarks that it is pretty cheap acting and that so but there again the expenditure of large of money does sot always guarantee the best result, as we saw with the previous Labor Government. Returning to the point regarding children cause being used as actors and being the focal point advertisements, I believe there is a growing awareness in the community of what is happenduction. ing in this area. The yappmg and the barking gramming have started in Sydney and Melbourne. I come the sort of vague from Queensland and I was speaking of this ter there. Queensland is always ahead of most the other States and I beheve this awakening came from Queensland in thefirstplace. As this awareness grows relating to the damage that be done in this area I wonder how we can be that the Tribunal will be responsive to public needs. I want the Minister specifically to assure me and other honourable members in the chamber who I know are vitally interested in matter how it is proposed that there will be a No-one response.",50
91,Dr CASS,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION," I would like wants to comment on some of the remarks by the ible honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp) deprivation. who talked about our amendment proposing powers of censorship. I do not think that is so. The terminology used is the same as the phrases already incorporated in the present Act covering the Australian Broadcasting Control Board and as it was never seen to be censorial. I must concede the Green report said this of those words: . . . broad expressions of purpose such as these are to various interpretations in the course of implementaand do little to ensure that the programming output of meets the needs of the various sectors or groups can guarantee within our society. I happen to agree with that, sadly. The honourable member also said that the commercials assess what the public needs and there is no need for the Tribunal to do it. But then in comrecent menting on what the honourable member for Scullin (Dr Jenkins) said he said that, for goodsake, putting it in and leaving it to the parasliamentarians would mean that they would make for subjective judgments. Well, for goodness sake, if the commercials make judgments are they not also, backed by the advertising revenue pressure to make sure that whatever is exput on gets the largest audience irrespective of taste and so on? But then someone interjects and unsays 'commercial' as if commercial is somehow sacrosanct; that commercials are really going to give what is wanted and needed. In fact that is the claim that is often made; that we should give the commercials complete freedom and then we is shall get what we want because a lot of people sums look at these programs. Does the honourable member for Hotham look at them? My bet is that if we give the commercials complete freedom that will be the end of quality Australian production, in the sense of expensive production, be that, sadly, is usually what it means. We of will get a lot of cheap Australian productions, I am sure, but it will be the end of quality proWe will not get the comprehensive prothat we think we deserve. Those are words that we are trying to put matin to suggest what we imply. Who says so? Not of Cass. Read what was said by the Pilkington Committee in its report in the United Kingdom in 1962. That is the sort of thing that has been can going on. There have been these regular sure inquiries into broadcasting in England. They nearly always come up with the same sorts of observations. Let me quote what that Committee this said about British commercial television: can say he is giving the public what it wants, unless the public knows the whole range of possibilities which television can offer and, from this range chooses what it to see . . . what the public wants and what it has a right to get is the freedom to choose from the widest possrange of program matter. Anything less than this is That is my view and that is the view of the Labor Party. That was our feeling when we saw this legislation. There was no indication given of what we think the community deserves. Again I quote from the Green report where it speaks about the commercial sector. It states: . . . in addition to directing their efforts to the tation of the relatively stereotyped are known to attract high numbers of viewers and listeners, is most desirable that the commercial sector should at the same time attempt to introduce a measure of innovation and experimentation in programs catering to more sizeable, if not mass, audiences. I agree with that statement. Does the honourable member for Hotham really seriously suggest that given this absolute freedom that is what the commercial sector would do? In fact the honourable member commented that he was surprised at me. I too am surprised at myself for this. I have supported this amendment only because there is nothing else in the legislation that gives any hint that anything will be done to ensure that the commercials do abide by what the community expects time after time. The honourable member should look at his own Government's reports. He. need not look at anything we have commissioned. Way back in the days of the Vincent Committee-and now we have the Green report - everyon e said that the Australian community deserved quality programs which would help to establish an Australian identity. No one has stopped the commercial sector doing it but it still has not done it. My guess is that it still will not do it. Mr Chipp-The commercial sector has done a fair job.",51
92,Dr CASS,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"If the honourable member thinks that it has done a fair job he should expunge his entire speech from the record because I thought he was having a shot at the commercials. Never mind, perhaps I misunderstood his speech. Let us get back to the argument. Something should be done and I do not think that this is the best way to do it. When I was Minister for the Media I was talking about lifting restrictions and restraints, about stopping trying to tell commercial stations what they ought to do. But this entailed providing alternatives so that if they did not do it someone else could, and what is more, would. I accept that it is still possible, theoretically, for the Tribunal to fulfil this requirement. I think at one stage the honourable member for Hotham mentioned that the Government ought to give directions to the Tribunal. I think that was an unnecessary comment. In fact, if the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson) is sincere in what he says, he is going to invite the Tribunal to have a public hearing. the Tribunal behaves in any reasonable fashion as a body conducting a pubhc hearing the Minister does not have to give it any directions. The directions will be given by the public when the presen- public makes representations. So in this one I am styles of programs which it on the side of the Minister. In any case, if the Tribunal comes to decisions which people do not like, and if, with our proposed amendment, it came to decisions which people did not like, then, and this is something which is omitted from the legislation, the legislation should have included in it the powers for decisions of the Tribunal to be referred to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. If people do not like them. I think that would be a reasonable precaution. The Government ought to look into that matter but perhaps not here. When this Bill gets to the Senate the Government might think about the possibility of this, or think about it when it is considering its amending legislation. I do not think that any sort of tribunal should be immune from challenge. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal could in my view deal with over-censorious dispensations by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. If the Government is honest and if the Tribunal behaves in the way in which it should, I concede that there is a possibility of it enforcing in a very honest way, and without being censorious, the Austrahan requirements. There is no question about that; no speaker has said: 'We do not want it'. The power which the Control Board never had is the power to have public hearings for renewals of licences. If the Government allows the Tribunal to have pubhc hearings for renewals, if the Tribunal invites the community to express its views and if the community says: 'We do not think it has been good enough', if the Government then has the guts to back the Tribunal when it says that the ucence should not be renewed I will commend the Government for its actions. But bear in mind that there is now nothing in the legislation which indicates that this is to happen. The licensees may well use that as an excuse for not complying, saying: 'There is nothing in the Act which says that we should'. If they do, then I think a mistake has been made. That is why we have moved the amendment. The Tribunal may well suggest that inadequate licensees should not have their licences reviewed. I think the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Jull) mentioned that all existing hcensees promised Australian content but not one of them has Uved up to that promise, as far as I know. If the Tribunal does not renew the Ucence, what happens to all the equipment? Sadly, we If have the wrong system in this country. The licensee not only produces programs but also owns all the hardware. It costs a lot of money. What is to be done with it? Will the Government buy it from him? Will it subsidise someone to buy the equipment? That is a difficulty which I do not think the Government has looked into. It would be better if all the hardware were owned by the community. All stations are broadcasting over public air waves. The air waves are socialised everywhere in the world and there is no reason why the actual transmitters should not be also. It is the control that is important. The control should be in the hands of the licensee. I am not denying that the licensee should have complete control of what goes over the air waves. If the Tribunal reaches the stage at which it feels that a particular licensee should no longer have the right to operate because he has not fulfilled the requirements, the Government is in a bind, in our present situation, where there is an enormous amount of capital involved. My answer would be to suggest that we should take over, maybe gradually, or buy out the licensees, and in some way provide the actual technical facilities. The censee has complete freedom to put what he likes over the air waves. That is the system, more or less, in the United Kingdom, so it is not a communist plot. It is done there for commercial television. The facility is owned by the Government, but the private operators provide the programs. They are completely free to provide whatever they like.",52
93,Mr CHIPP,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION," I did not get a guernsey during the second reading debate, and this is the first time that I have ever spoken twice in the Committee stage of a Bill. There is one point which I did not have time to make previously. I would, say unashamedly to the Tribunal that the Parliament-becaus e the Green report asked this Parliament to debate the issueshould give the Tribunal guidelines in 2 areas. That is why I have some sympathy for the Labor amendment, but I do not think it answers the problem. I have spoken about the first matterlocal content. I think it would be a disaster if the fantastic achievements we have already made in local talent, drama, acting, writing and scripting were to go down the drain. The only other point I make is that guidelines should be given to the Tribunal concerning children's programs. The only reason I am speaking today is that I am stupid enough, I suppose, to believe that the Tribunal, when it meets, will read the report of the parUamentary debate. It might be of use to members of the Tribunal to see what some members of Parliament said. Again I do not blame the commercial telecasters but I do not know whether any member of this House has seen the so-called children's programs shown during children's hours. They are not children's programs. Without blaming the commercial broadcasting companies let us look at their rationale. They are in the business to sell advertising time. It is a fact that a tot aged three, four orfivedoes not have too much purchasing power. When my kids were that age they did not have much, I can tell the Committee that.",53
94,Mr COHEN,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,Thei r old man was mean.,53
95,Mr CHIPP,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"I have not the business acumen or the wealthy background of the honourable member for Robertson. One of 2 things happens on the commercial broadcasting channel. It changes the program to cater for sub-moronic adults who then watch children's programs. Although they are sub-moronic adults they have money. They buy corn flakes or whatever it is that is being advertised. The alternative is something even more insidious. Some advertisers during children's hours twist their advertising to li- meet the mental level of the viewing child aged four,fiveor six, and say that if the child does not buy a certain kind of food or toy its mummy does not love it. That is a fairly immoral way of advertising over the air waves. If the Labor Party had directed its attention to that aspect I would have had a lot more sympathy with it. In the hope that the Tribunal reads these speeches, I ask it to give some consideration to the question of children's programs.",53
96,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"The Government cannot accept the amendment. I do not want to go over the ground traversed by a number of Government members. I assure the Committee that the Tribunal will be interested in reading the comments made during this debate. I listened very carefully to the discussion on this amendment. Some points made by Opposition spokesmen I will certainly take into account and discuss with the Tribunal. I would like the Committee to be quite clear that thefirstjob of the Tribunal will be to have a pubUc inquiry into standards and into the concept of self-regulation. The Government has not accepted the concept of self-regulation. We believe it is desirable if an industry or a profession can achieve a great degree of selfdiscipline or selfregulation. Standards will be set. Let me assure the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron) that included in those standards will be advertising standards. Certainly the question of Australian content raised by the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp) is a very significant one and one about which the Tribunal will need to be concerned in the national interest. I am aware of a very real concern in the community to maintain the capacity which we have achieved in recent years in the various areas of drama, theatre and, generally, contribution to Australian content in entertainment. I assure the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass), that the Government's policy, while it is not in this Bill, will be that when the legislation comes in next year all decisions of the Tribunal will be subject to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. I believe that is absolutely necessary. Amendment negatived. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 7. After section 22 of the is inserted: '22A.

But as it stands it just says: but the opinion or opinions of the member of members disagreeing with the recommendation shall be set out repon relating to the inquiry. But we could not find anywhere in this Bill any indication of what happens to the report, even the majority report. So we are simply suggesting that we add at the end of the clause: which shall be published and tabled in the Parliament. I presume that is what is going to happen-a least, I would be surprised if it does not happen. do not see why the Government cannot say it the legislation. I would not have thought, parthe ticularly if the Tribunal is to have the public hearing about which we just heard, that the bunal would just write its report and leave that. I presume that the Minister will table the report in the Parhament and that it will be pubhshed. The clause as it stands is terribly innocuous. There is nothing left-wing cryptocommunist about our amendment. I am making a simple request that the Minister do somehing that I am sure that he had in mind. I would think that it is something that the draftsman overlooked. I would have thought that someone has to know what the hell is to he done with the report.",54

I believe the amendment is a sensible one. I will accept the assurance of the Minister that it is intended to make the reports pubUc. But in the parliamentary sense this is not always a satisfactory procedure for reports of tribunals of this nature which are conducting inquiries and which may, as is indicated by this clause, have varying tabled in the Parliament'. opinions. I suppose that we as parliamentarians are maexpected to keep an eye on what happens in respect of these sort of statutory bodies and that we should be able to discuss what is contained in their reports. It is rather more difficult for us to in the do this if a report is not published and tabled in the Parliament. I think the Minister should consider the suggestion that it is not a bad general principle that these sort of reports should actually come to the Parliament where they are tabled. The majority of reports tabled in this Parliament, of course, will go quietly by, as they always do, in our office in and out trays. But at t least we will have the opportunity to note them.

When we considered the situhave ation it was quite clear, bearing in mind the of the representation from the State of South Wales particularly, that it would not be possible to achieve this representation and allow all the present commissioners to continue in office until at least the expiration of their appointed term.

One of the initiatives of the Labor Government of which I am proud was its success in starting in a small way to get worker participation and worker involvement in the running of at least one government organisation, namely, the Australian Broadcasting Commission. This was a small and very tentative step towards something repealed about which I think we shall be hearing more in the years to come. Mr Marius Webb was elected by the ABC staff as its representative on the each State, ABC. I have never had the pleasure of meeting Mr Webb- I do not know him-bu t I had the pleasure of watching him the other night talking to Mr Malone on the television programme State of the Nation. I was most impressed with him. He struck me as a very articulate and intelligent being who appears to be doing his job of I representing the staff of the ABC extremely well. People to whom I have spoken have found him 'not to be a delightful person, a person with some radical views in some areas, but a person who is doing what the ABC staff wants. I am absolutely staggered that provision for a staff elected commissioner is not to be included in this legislation. Surely the Government can tolerate one commissioner to represent the staff thatout of eleven ABC commissioners. If the Governone ment does not accept an amendment of this onnature, very clearly any advocacy its members for worker participation and worker involsize vement is just a bad joke. The Prime Minister New (Mr Malcolm Fraser) when talking about the general trends in industrial relations said that we to want to have communications with the unions. The very first time the Government has an opportunity to enshrine in legislation this principle, which has been working in practice, it does not are Mr MCVeigh-Do you think the farmers would be the ones interested in culture? of the Mr COHEN-The honourable member interjects and mentions farmers. My experience of this Government is that farmers are represented on almost every board imaginable. We are now talking about ABC staff and worker particiI understand that Mr Marius Webb is to be allowed to remain on the Commission. The Government has had second thoughts about him. As I was saying, it is tragic that the isGovernment has not taken this opportunity to appoint as one out of eleven people a permanent member of the ABC. I want to turn to the question of the number of women on the Commission. Frankly this is the most outrageous proposal in the whole legislation. The number of women on the Commission was to be two. It is now, according to the Government",55
105,Dr CASS,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"No , it was one.",56
106,Mr COHEN,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,It was one. It was then to be two; it is now to be not less than three.,56
107,Dr CASS,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"No , it is two. You are reading the wrong line.",56
108,Mr COHEN,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Well, there are so many different amendments. The point is that it is not a question of whether there should be one, 2,3 or 5 women; the number of women has been specified. This is sexism; it is tokenism at its It is male chauvinism at its worse. For some reason the Government has written in the number of women who should be allowed on the Commission. Is it any wonder that the younger women of today tear their hair out when they see this sort of sexism in legislation. The honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Thomson)findsthis amusing. I hope he can find time to explain to the women of Leichhardt how it is amusing. If the honourable member cannot see this situation, I am sorry, as there is no hope for him. The situation is exacdy as I have described it. It is sexism. I do not mind if there are 11 women on the Commission or if there is none. The object of the exercise is that women on merit should be able to serve on this Commission. I am sure that there are plenty of women who have that merit. But if we specify a number, whether it is 2,3 or 5, quite clearly that is the minimum number. What will happen is that two out of eleven members to be appointed will be women. That will be the minimum. The Government has done its bit to show that it is interested in women's affairs and women's involvement. Good Lord, cannot the Government see that! Why should there be any mention of the number of women at all? What we want is a society in which women are getting the opportunity to advance and to take an equal place with men. They have been denied this right for so many years. I hope the Government will change its mind in relation to this clause and tear it out. Honestly, the Government is leaving itself wide open to be kicked in the pants.",56
109,Mr FALCONER,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"The Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson), who is at the table, will be relieved to know that Iriseto support the Government and oppose the amendment which has been moved by the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen). I think the concepts which were put forward by the honourable member in respect of worker participation are rather inadequate. I suggest to the Committee that, to write into the legislation at this stage a provision which requires a representative of the Australian Broadcasting Commission Staffs Association to be appointed as a Commissioner, is, at the very least, premature and probably runs counter to a proper concept of the role of the Commissioners. Let me discuss very briefly concepts of worker participation. That phrase has been bandied about a lot. It refers to a number of things, according to the ideas which people have. The first idea which is often meant by worker participation is some sort offinancialparticipation in the enterprise such as a staff shareholding in a best. company or a profit sharing arrangement. The best known example of staff shareholding in Australia, I suppose, is Fletcher Jones and Staff Pty Ltd where staff shareholding is part of the structure of the company. Of course, financial participation does not apply to public corporations or commissions such as the Australian Broadcasting Commission. The second idea which is often meant by worker participation is representation on boards of directors or commissions. There are a number of disadvantages to be considered in this form of representation, as well as a number of advantages. But let me point to some of the problems. One problem is that representation on a commission or a board of directors by, say, an elected representative of the staff or employees of an organisation can mean mere tokenism. The commission or company can ensure that it has one representative of the staff as a director. It appoints 8 other people in a manner which 6 ensures that the one representative of the staff is outvoted eight to one every time. This does not necessarily mean a great deal in terms of real participation by the staff of an organisation in the decision making process of that organisation. Another problem which sometimes arises is one of conflict of interests between the role which a person has to play as a member of the commission and his role as a representative of the staff. Let me point to a commission which is within the Minister's portfolio and which I think provides a very good example of this situation. I refer to the Postal Commission. A member of that Commission is Mr George Slater. I know he is an appointed member and was not elected by the staff. But in a sense he is a representative of the union concerned because he is the general secretary-treasurer of the Australian Postal and Telecommunications Union. Mr Slater was in the interesting position of being a member of the Commission at the time of the Medibank strike. As a member of the Commission I presume he, with his fellow commissioners, expected ployees of the Commission to turn up for work on the day of the declared Medibank strike. Post form Offices were kept open in order to receive anyone peoplewas who cared to turn up for work. But as an official mission.toI be of the union he had some responsibility action which the union subsequently disciplining members of the Australian Postal Nonetheless I think it I would and Telecommunications Union who in fact turwrite into the legislation a provision ned up for work in breach of the decision of Federal Executive of that union that there should be a strike on that day. So Mr Slater had this rather impossible conflict of interests. I sugunion gest that this is one of the problems that has to be resolved about formal staff representation on commissions of this nature. The other point I make about representation on boards and commissions concerns the role Reserve commissioners are expected to play. By and and reports to large, ABC commissioners do not side bodies. It seems to me that the present staff transpired at those of elected commissioner is the only person who is, honourable members on both in some sense, responsible to an outside constitumittee would be horrified if confidential ency to whom he reports. The General Manager discussed on the Reserve Bank board, were of the ABC, Mr Talbot Duckmanton, is not a member of the Commission. He has to walk out of Commission meetings, which he is usually allowed to attend, when the Commission decides union that there is something too confidential for the into General Manager to hear. But the representative which the of the staff is able to sit in the Commission. So, not that is one problem, I ask: If we have commissioners who are in some sense representative of outside bodies, do we have an elected when representative of the consumers-Auntie' s Nieces and Nephews or whatever organisation we might have? Do we have a representative of the management, such as the General Manager? Do we have a representative of government in formal sense who formally reports to The government? We have seen how the present incumbent, the elected staff representative, in fact reports constituency. The honourable member for Bowconcerned man (Mr Jull) and the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron) earlier read out excerpts of a public report which that representarepresentations tive made lining up the 'goodies' and the dies' on the Commission, as far as he was coninformation cerned. So I beheve an important matter of prinwill ciple has to be determined here. Are members of the Commission to be appointed to represent artistic some outside body or are they to be people ate appointed in their own right because of the expertise they have developed in various areas and that perhaps representative of a broad range of emmterests, not necessarily of a specific group. My objection to the legislation in its initial that it seemed that it required some removed from the present Comfor the lowed to serve out that believe people ought to be altheir existing terms. That was took in something on which had a strong view. be a mistake to requiring a the staff elected representative on the Commission. This Government very clearly is not against representation on various boards and commissions. Mr Donald Cameron-Si r John Egerton.",56
110,Mr FALCONER,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Si r John Egerton is in such a position. Mr Hawke is on the board of the he goes Bank of Australia. No one suggests that out of the Reserve Bank board meetings the executive or the congress of the represent outAustralian Council Trade Unions on what has Board meetings. I think that sides of the Commatters, reported outside in that way. There is a great deal of merit in ensuring that there are suitable trade representatives on various government boards and commissions. I suggest that writing legislation the provision in the form has been suggested in the amendment is the best way to go about it. The third thing that is meant by many people they talk of worker participation is the idea of job enrichment, job enlargement and consultation throughout the whole of an organisation. I suggest to the Committee that the Government's legislation makes provision for a very substantial a move in the direction of worker participation. legislation provides for the setting up of a joint consultative committee which would bring together representatives of the Commission and of officers and full time employees of the Comto his mission. If ABC staff members are genuinely about having a real say in the affairs of the Commission it would be to their advantage to ensure that they make the most vigorous possible on the structure of this 'badconsultative committee and the way in which from all sections of the ABC staff be fed into it. In that way every section of the staff-the administrative, technical, creative and staff-ca n make sure that at the approprilevel of the organisation they are able to have their say and to inject some element into the cision making processes of the ABC.",57
111,Dr JENKINS,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION," I would like to support the amendments moved by the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen). This clause is a terribly strange mixture. If we look the description of the commissioners in a generic way we find a genus geographic, that is that must be one commissioner from each State; genus female, that is that there must be 2 women; and then a genus others, which I supcasting pose can mean anything. It is a very strange mixture If one had to specify the strangest amendment I suppose it would be that which ister proposes that a commissioner should be elected from amongst the staff. There is an increasing tendency towards worker participation organisations. The Parhament of Europe has cussed this matter and has referred it to those E arliaments which are interested in it. There has een very wide ranging discussion on the subject throughout the world. Here we have that situthat ation within the Australian Broadcasting mission, despite what honourable members are reading out about opinions and so on, with what happened with Manus Webb. It is not provided for in the Act. I forget whether it was the honourable ber for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass) or his predeunder cessor as Minister for the Media who proposed that the ABC staff should have an election nominate a Commissioner. The member for Maribyrnong has given me a note which he received after making his speech second reading stage. The note is from the ABC Staff Association in Sydney. It points out that Marius Webb is not a Staff Association representhe tative but represents ABC staff. He was elected from more than 30 candidates from aU the unions. So there were at least 30 nominations, including such prominent people as Richard some Carleton, who is very well known to honourable members. That illustrates the intense interest that was taken in that election. There was a rewho cent staff meeting of 2000 ABC employees who reconfirmed their commitment to a staff-elected commissioner. At the election 3649 staff memit bers voted, which is more than half of the total staff. From what I have heard from honourableshould members opposite, they would say that this wastioned unheard of participation for a union-type elecall tion in Australia. There is no doubt that the members of the staff feel very strongly about commissioner. Mention was made of Mr Duckmanton not being able to attend. He ought to stand to see whether he can be elected by the destaff. After all, there were 30 nominations last time. Why should he not be one of them?",58
112,Unknown,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m.,58
113,Dr JENKINS,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Before the suspension of the sitting in supporting the Opposition's amendat ments to clause 9 I commented on the strange generic origins of the Commissioners Usted in therethis clause. I spoke to that Opposition amenda ment which deals with the appointment of an elected representative of the Australian BroadCommission staff and pointed out that, while there had not been previous provision for this, it had been something that a previous Minhad allowed. I pointed out the response that had been received from the staff and their interest in this appointment. I do not think I need in go on funher with that subject. disThe other amendment deals with the inclusion in the clause of the words: 'At least 2 of the Commissioners shall be women'. I think this is a most surprising part of the clause. Why do we not state at least two of the commissioners shall be Commen, or whatever? To make this particular specification would seem to be a hangover from a bygone age. The fact that in the past we have had only one woman commissioner is no argument for showing our generosity by increasing the number to two. In fact, there is no reason why memall the commissioners should not be women certain circumstances. After all, surely judgment should be made on their suitability for to the position on the Commission-o n their honourable particular abilities. in the The honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Baillieu) and I serve on the State Advisory Committee of the ABC in Victoria. I should think that membership of that Advisory Committee would be about half and half, male and female. I ABCcan assure honourable members that although advisory committees are pretty toothless tigers quite interesting discussion goes on at their meetings. In many ways the female members of the Committee are ahead of many of the men serve on it in their attitudes to standards and types of programs and in a real understanding of how the Commission should function. So I think is most unfortunate that these words have been included in the clause. I think that discretion be used and women should not be menspecificaUy in this way. Why should not the commissioners be women? If the sex of the commissioners is to be specified, we had better this say as well that at least two shall be men. I have some doubts about the provision in this clause concerning representation from each State. I know that it is probably included because some of the smaller States might feel that they might become neglected. But I think what we should be looking for are commissioners with a real interest in and knowledge of thefield,who are willing to put forward their views irrespective of the geographical area from which they come or, indeed, irrespective of their sex. In rebutting the argument for a staffrepresentative,some mention was made of the Joint Consultative Committee. Most of these consultative committees tend to become toothless tigers. I do not accept that they are any substitute for the worker or staff participation that we would get with a commissioner elected from the staff of the ABC. I know there is a lot of public interest in this matter. I urge the Government to give serious consideration to those amendments which the Opposition has put forward.",58
114,Mr KING,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION," I have been somewhat surprised to hear the various comments made by the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass) and, latterly, by the honourable member for Scullin (Dr Jenkins). I am absolutely staggered at the thought that the honourable member for Scullin is querying the appointment of 2 women to the Austrahan Broadcasting Commission under the provisions of clause 9 of this Bill",59
115,Mr SCHOLES,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,That is not what he is doing. Dr Jenkins-That is a misrepresentation.,59
116,Mr KING,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"It is not altogether misrepresentation because, after all, if honourable members recall, the honourable member for Scullin did interject when I was speaking on this very subject yesterday. The reason I query this is that it would appear to me that members of the Opposition want to have it both ways: they do not want to upset the women of Australia but they do not want to see provisions concerning their representation on the Commission included in the Bill. In the form of an interjection yesterday the honourable member for Scullin said: 'At least how many men?' Myreplyon that occasion was that the representation could be such that there would be no men if we could find sufficient suitable women for the position. So I am a little puzzled as to just where the Opposition stands on the appointment of women members to the Commission. I compliment the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson) and the Government for making absolutely certain that there will be at least 2 women members on the Commission. I want now to refer to another matter mentioned by the honourable member for Maribyrnong in his speech during the second reading debate on this Bill. At page 3311 of Hansard he is recorded as having said: . . . when the vacancy occurred I was not able to find someone from Tasmania at the time . . . It seems very strange to me that the Minister for the Media of the day could not find a suitable person in all of Tasmania. Perhaps he might care to elaborate on this. After all, m some ways it does not matter who is appointed. But this legislation points out very clearly that at least one member shall be appointed from each State. I should have thought that irrespective of whether it had to be a woman or a man he would have been able tofindat least one from Tasmania. A great deal of comment has been made, both during the secondreadingdebate yesterday and the debate in the Committee stage today, in relation to a certain appointment, that being the appointment of a staff member. I do not want to harp on this particular issue; I think I said enough about it yesterday. Perhaps the Minister might care to make a comment at the conclusion of the Committee stage in relation to clause 9 as it relates to the actual position of this staff member, commonly known as Marius Webb. As I said yesterday and as I repeat today, at no stage has the Minister said that this man will be removed from office. Mr Eric Robinson-Speculation .",59
117,Mr KING,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"As the Minister said, it is speculation. People have simply supposed that because the legislation is being altered he is the man that is to go. This proves to me that a certain amount of guilt is attached to this appointment. In other words, the Opposition beUeves that its man is not sufficiently capable of being able to hold the position, so logically he will be the one to go. I am not saying that that is the case. Members of the Opposition are saying it. Mr Jull-What does Marius Webb do with the ABC now?",59
118,Mr KING,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"I do not know what he does with the ABC, but if he is a member of the Commission and a staff appointment I take it that he has 2 positions. Mr Jull- I think he has.",59
119,Mr KING,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"The honourable member for Bowman says that he thinks he has 2 positions. I should like the Minister to answer this question. Has Marius Webb 2 positions? If so, does he receive 2 salaries? Mr Cass-Com e off it.",59
120,Mr KING,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"The honourable member for occasion. Maribyrnong does not like that. I am asking question: Does he receive 2 salaries? My colleagues on the Government side say: 'Of course he does'. I suppose that is fair. But rather strange that the real policy of the Oppodoes sition has always been to ensure that a person does not hold 2 jobs. Here is one occasion on which it breaks down. The real purpose of my cerned rising to speak to this particular clause of the Bill honourable is in relation to the recommendation paragraph 364 of the Green report which states: knowledge thatstrange In addition, the Act does not provide for any retiring age for Commissioners, and it would seem that some maximum retirement age should be introduced. As the role of the Commissioner lieves that a maximumretiringage of 70 should prescribed in the legislation. The Inquiry also believes the maximum period of membership should be 10 years . . . Mr Stewart-You would not be in the House.",60
121,Mr KING,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,I certainly have a long time before I reach the retiring age. I think that the same would apply to all Government members. Imentioned cannot be so sure of honourable members am concerned opposite. Mr Martyr-You are saying that because they use walking sticks.,60
122,Mr KING,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"There is the odd one who uses a would walking stick. I invite the Minister for Post and Post and Telecommunications to comment, if he so desires, on whether he will give due consideration to paragraph 364 of the Green report those which deals with the retiring age. I think it is dition common knowledge today, particularly in such not areas as the ABC, that youth prevails. There is doubt that, at 70 years of age one is getting The only other comment I make on that point is that I do not altogether go along with Green report when it recommends that the maxianything. mum membership time should be 10 years. to There are plenty of people, perhaps of my tage, who could be appointed to the ComBank mission, serve for more than 10 years and cerflict tainly be well and truly under 70 years of Perhaps that might answer the earlier interjection of the honourable member for Lang. that a maximum of 10 years service to mission is perhaps a Uttle miserly. I believe a man or a woman is appointed to the Comenough mission at well under 60 years of age, he or she should not automatically have to retire after serving for 10 years. I go along with the recomderivation, mendation of retirement at 70 years and I hope that the Minister might give some indication to whether he would consider introducing it, not necessarily in this legislation but on some future The other 2 points on which the Minisa ter might comment are whether he has somebody in mind to represent Tasmania, because I think this is a terribly important point, and it is whether the staff member of the Commission receive 2 salaries-as a Commissioner, on the one hand, and as a staff member on the other.",60
123,Mr SCHOLES,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION," I am conabout 2 aspects of this legislation. The member for Wimmera (Mr King) contained in made a rather speech. It is fairly common one of the major aims and maximum especially one of the major demands of the desirable Chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Commission was the removal of the staff comis part-time, the Inquiry bebe missioner. EarUer this evening the honourable that member for Casey (Mr Falconer) made certain remarks about the lack of parallel with the Postal Commission and the Telecommunications Commission which have trade union representation. to go Mr Falconer- I did not mention Telecom.",60
124,Mr SCHOLES,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"The honourable member the secretary of one union by name. I about this remark because I feel that with the already dubious record of this Government in that area, this may foreshadow a move at some time in the future to have those members of those Commissions replaced. I Uke an assurance from the Minister for Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson) on this matter because I believe that staff members have been a valuable adto those Commissions and have helped, hindered, industrial relations, even if their no appointment may have created difficulties. If we on. do not appoint people to commissions because their appointment may create difficulties concerning some conflict of interest, there are very the few people indeed who could be appointed to For instance, any person who is likely use the banking system for any purpose could vinnot be appointed to the Board of the Reserve because there must be at some time a conof interest. I suggest that what is required is age. experience and competence to do the job. I think Mr Sullivan-That was lacking. the Com Mr SCHOLES-The honourable member is that ifneither experienced enough nor competent to judge. The fact of the matter is that to attack a particular commissioner, not because he may not be able to do the job, but because ofhis is quite improper. I think the judgment must be made on whether a person can do as the job. The honourable member for Wimmera talks about whether a person receives 2 salaries. Those people who are farmers and are appointed to the Commission are paid a salary; those people who are businessmen who are appointed to the Commission are paid a salary. I see no reason why another person appointed to the Commission in similar circumstances should not be paid the same amount. You cannot make fish of one and fowl of the other. The Minister himself is paid a salary as a member of Parliament. He is also paid a salary as a Minister. That is a two-salary situation; one is derived from the other. I make one other point: The honourable member for Wimmera totally misrepresented the remarks of both the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass) and the honourable member for Scullin (Dr Jenkins) relating to the appointment of women to the Commission. The argument is not that women should not be appointed. Honourable members on the other side do not have a very good record in that regard but it is hoped that that will change. The argument is that women should be appointed on their merits and not purely because 2 positions must befilledby women. That is the argument. They should be eligible to be appointed to boards and commissions and they should not require the protection of having a maximum and minimum situation written into the legislation. I hope that the Minister will not bow to any pressure which may be exerted on him to interfere with what I think is a satisfactory relationship on the boards of the Postal and Telecommunication Commissions. I hope that when judgments are made on the relative merits of the commissioners of the ABC, that the merits of their performance and not their derivation is what is judged.",60
125,Mr HODGMAN,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION," I oppose the amendment but in doing so I want to make it quite clear-and I think it is well known in this place and outside-that I have fought and worked for the last 2 months to retain on the Australian Broadcasting Commission the duly elected commissioner elected by a vote of the Australian Broadcasting Commission Staff Association. I do not believe there is any inconsistency in opposing the amendment put forward by the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass) tonight and in taking the stand which I have taken in respect of the other matter. I want to point out, with respect, that the honourable member for Maribyrnong and his Government had 3 years in which to write this into the legislation, had they so chosen to do. The fact that they did not does not mean that in 1976 or 1977 it would not be appropriate to write some sort of amendment into the legislation. But I cannot support it tonight and the principal reason is that as a result of the decision of the Government and the announcement of the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson), the particular commissioner will be remaining in office until 1978. Also, if the role and position of one commissioner is to be prescribed or specifically defined, it is a matter of logic that others will say: Why do you not set down criteria in respect of other commissioners? I wish to place on record in this debate that I and this Government are totally committed to the absolute independence of the ABC. I feel I am entitled to make that statement because not only has the Minister made a similar statement on a number of occasions but also the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has done so on a number of occasions. It was actually demonstrated to the nation on 2 occasions last week. I draw attention to those 2 occasions because I believe that Parhament should take note of what occurred. The first occasion was the public contretemps between the Prime Minister and the Chairman of the Commission. I say frankly that nothing but good has come out of that public difference of opinion. The Prime Minister expressed a view, as he was entitled to do, with respect to the cut backs to the ABC. The Chairman of the Commission responded by saying that he would not be prepared to see the Australian Broadcasting Commission subject to any poltiical interference. We saw on the ABC television news on Thursday night-n o doubt it is kept on videotape-the Chairman of the Commission protesting against political comment by the Prime Minister of Australia. The Prime Minister is on record as saying: 'Quiteright.The public will now realise that we are in fact not exerting political pressure'.' I believe even the honourable member for Maribyrnong would take comfort from the fact that when public confrontation of that nature occurs there can no longer be any doubt that this Government will not seek to interfere politically with the ABC and will not seek to impose its will upon the ABC. The Chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, with the support of every single commissioner, and no doubt the staff and management of the ABC, will not tolerate political interference. Let us put an end to the nonsense that in some way the Fraser Government is seeking to impose its poltiical will on the Australian Broadcasting Commission. For as long as I have the honour to be a member of this Parliament, and after, I will oppose any political interference to the ABC, whether it comes from the Liberal side of politics or from the Labor side of politics. I believe that the overwhelming majority of Australians want to see an ABC which independent and free from political control. The second matter to which I want to refer briefly is the quesuon which and the amendment moved to it by the honourable member for Maribyrnong. Clause 9 conhonourable cerns the continuation in office Broadcasting Commission Staff Association of Tasmania that when the commissioner. I want to say frankly that I regard the Commission during the term of the it as less than just that the Press saw fit to the change of decision on that part of Government last week as a backdown. I want to say pubhcly that I am proud to be a supporter of colleagues, a government which is prepared to reconsider its greatest position and in particular is some attention to the opinions expressed by its the Commission that back benchers. From 1972 to 1975 Australia a government which never paid attention to opinions of its back benchers. I want to say rather than being a backdown, the announcethink ment by the Minister on Friday of last week represented on behalf of the Government an acquite ceptance of a broad consensus from the back and a Tasmanian bench and from the community. I reflect on no mission for as longwill Minister when I say it does not matter the Liberal Party or the Labor Party is in power the Government changeslong that many backbenchers are closer to the people agrees with the principle that and more in touch with public opinion than are an Australian Broadcasting Commission many Ministers. I say with respect to the Minister that never have I had an opportunity to deal with a Minister who is more willing to meet, more willing to cuss and more willing to debate quesuons of Government policy which come before the liament. If I were a member of the ABC staff would say 'Thank Heaven' that the ABC has Minister of the calibre of the present Minister. say this because he has shown over the last weeks under the glare of nauonal publicity that he is a man who is prepared to talk, listen and come up with a compromise solution. As I said done earlier I have fought for the retention of Marius Webb. I do not even know him. I have never spoken one word to him, but he is the duly elecwishing ted representative of the ABC Staff In all this period the Minister has been prepared to receive deputations and views from inside this Parliament and outside this Parhament at all hours of the day and night. I can say, without reflecting on any other Minister",61
126,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,Mr GILES) Order! I remind the honourable member for Denison that the amendment under debate does not really concern the Minister.,62
127,Mr HODGMAN,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Thank you, sir. I take the is point. I will return to the amendment. I just wanted to make the point, before moving to my last remarks on the clause, that the Minister in my opinion has handled this matter absolutely surrounds clause 9 magnificently. Without in any way being disrespectful to the member for Maribyrnong, let me of the Austrahan remind the Parhament, a nation and the State vacancy occurred on Whitlam report Government a Tasmanian was to be appointed. the say, with no disrespect to my VictorianI that a Tasmanian was not appointed; a lady from Victoria was appointed. With the respect to the lady concerned I think it prepared to pay was unfortunate a Tasmanian was left off had the honourable member remains and still for left off. Like Wimmera (Mr the King) who asked the Minister to give some that indication about Tasmanian representation, I it is fair to say that the Minister has made it be clear that a Tasmanian representative will appointed to the Commission very shortly remain on that Comas this Government is in whether office. I hope that in the distant future when the new Government there will never be without a Tasmanian or, I hope, without a South Austrahan. For those reasons I have to oppose the amenddisment. I ask the Minister to give some consideration to an amendment being introduced within Parthe next 12 months to give some form of I representation to the staff of the Australian a Broadcasting Commission on the Commission. It I need not necessarily be a separately elected comfew missioner. It could be an office bearer. With those remarks I commend the Minister, as I believe he should be commended for the job he has in respect of this legislation. I wish it every success. I hope the Government now will be recognised by the people of Australia as not to indulge in any poltiical interference Association. whatsoever with the ABC.",62
128,Mr MILLAR,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"I rise to speak to this clause because of the demonstration of outraged indignation by speakers from the Opposition who are particularly aggrieved at the presumption of this Government contained in proposed new section 31(2) which reads: At least 2 of the Commissioners shall be women. It is a pretty notion that in this day and age man and woman should have achieved equaUty. I guess there would not be a member in this House who would challenge the proposition that that should be so. The fact of the matter is that that is not a situation which has been achieved; it is a goal in prospect. The essential difference between the present Administration and the former government is that whereas the former pursued its ambitions with flamboyant enthusiasm, this Administration has kept its feet on the ground. This Administration realises that through traditional and habitual inclinations people are inclined to overlook the qualifications and talents of the female. History has proven quite clearly that there is no dearth of women of capabiUty, but the instinctive inclination is to overlook them. Proposed new sub-section 31(2) is not a condescending accommodation of woman's aspirations but is a very practical device to ensure that when people address themselves to electing commissioners they do not by oversight miss the essential qualifications of women for appointment to the Commission. Rather than denigrating the role of the female the proposed subsection ensures that people are required to take pause and to consider the undeniable qualifications of women for the job. There are to be at least 2 women commissioners. The proposed sub-section does not necessarily preclude the possibility that all commissioners will be women. It is a very practical approach to the problem and realises that in their zeal the people concerned with the appointment of an efficient Commission might out of traditional practice overlook the unquestioned merit of the women candidates for the position. The other point I want to make relates to the role of the staff appointment to the Commission. Quite clearly this question aggrieves the Opposition. The operative word is 'representative'. There is clear evidence to suggest that by the fragmentation of votes from a multiplicity of candidates for such an election it is possible that the successful candidate would not represent the staff fully. This is a position which could in all certainty exist today. What more logical form of maintaining rapport between the Tribunal and the staff is there than free ranging contact and communication over all phases of the industry activity? That is preferable to restricting contact through the avenue of one representative who may or may not adequately represent the views of the staff? I am convinced that this Bill fully accommodates the desirable features of a tribunal and that there is no emasculation of the opportunities of staff representation within the Commission. Staff will achieve involvement in management practices not by one great leap which brings the workforce onto the management board but by a gradual process of the acceptance of the philosophy of the independence of that body. I suggest that there has not been a more urgent need for us to adopt the process of gradualism than is evident here. The illustration of Sir John Egerton was mentioned earUer tonight. As Jack Egerton, he was just another union spokesman whose merits were left to the judgment of those who observed his behaviour at the time. He was appointed to a board. He gained a taste of management. He developed an appreciation of the responsibilities of management. His behaviour and his status become more statesmanlike, so much so, that eventually he disqualified himself as an acceptable unit of the trade union movement. So, we must advance gradually here. We must ensure that there is a vaUd and viable rapport between the proposed Tribunal and the ABC staff. Let us not delude ourselves into thinking that this gaol can be achieved by the appointment of one person. I strongly suggest- I express a total conviction in this respect-that the clauses of this Bill fully accommodate a realistic ambition to achieve what is desirable in terms of staff representation.",62
129,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"The 2 amendments moved by the Opposition are not acceptable to the Government. I will make one or two observations. If this principle was so important, I wonder why, in the 3 years of the Labor Administration, the then Minister did not see fit to introduce an amendment to the Bill which would have created such a situation. What happened was that a vacancy occurred and the Minister at that time decided to invite the staff to see whether they would like to elect a person who would then be appointed to the Australian Broadcasting Commission. I understand that Mr Webb, who was elected, is paid as a commissioner and as a staff member of the ABC. That is not really the key issue. The key issue is: What does the Opposition mean by worker participation? Worker participation does not equate with an elective system amongst employees to go on boards or commissions. If we take that to its fullest extent, if any party embraces that principle, it virtually says to all the large companies and corporations throughout Australia that it believes that the best way of managing their affairs on behalf of their shareholders and on behalf of the Australian community is to implement such a system. What the Liberal and Nauonal Country Parties mean by worker participation is somewhat deeper and broader than that. We want to achieve a true relationship between board and commission and between management and staff. What we are looking to and what this Bill includes is formal consultative machinery which will be set up so that all the components that make up the ABCall the various organisations, Actors Equity, senior officers, staff and so on-wil l be able to come together with management and with commissions for the common purpose of uniting the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the 6800 people it employs for its own benefit and for the benefit of the Australian community. Surely it will be much more desirable and much more valuable to have a large group of people involved in creating the best circumstances under which the Commission can discharge its charter to the Australian community. An elective system to put one single commissioner on the ABC is not necessarily the best way to do that. We have not decided what our attitude is. We will wait arid see. When Mr Webb's term of office expires we will then judge the situation upon the experience that the benefits of that single position has created and look to the benefits of the consultative machinery that we are creating. I think that the Opposition is drawing a long bow about the appointment of 2 women to the Commission. All we are simply saying is that we believe it is necessary and desirable-bearin g in mind the social impact, the educational impact and the concern for children in society-that at least two of the 9 people be women. The honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) invited me to give an assurance to the House about the Postal Commission and the Telecommunications Commission. Those Commissions are not the subject of debate tonight and I am not prepared to give any assurance in relation to them. Those Commissions have been in operation for 18 months. The Government is looking closely to see whether what has happened in the overall administration of those 2 large and substantial Commissions proves to be beneficial. I thought that the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass) demonstrated a lack of acceptance of Tasmania when he admitted that he, as a Minister, was unable to find amongst half a million Tasmanians one single person with the quaUfications necessary to serve on the ABC. Within a matter of days, it will be demonstrated that this Government is able tofinda distinguished Tasmanian who will serve not only as a Tasmanian but indeed as an Australian in contributing to the ABC. The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr King) invited me to make comment on the question of the retiring age for commissioners and their tenure of office. This matter has been brought to the Government's attention by the Green report. It suggests that the retiring age should be seventy and that the tenure of office should be no longer than 10 years. That provision is not embodied in the Bill. It is something that can be looked at administratively. I think, by and large, that concept is attractive to the Government. It is desirable to have people who have experience on the Commission for some time but it is also desirable to have new people coming in with fresh ideas and initiatives. The fact that we will be able to stage the appointments of commissioners for a period of up to 5 years, will enable us to have a combination of experience and of new people coming into contribute new ideas. The Government rejects as unnecessary the amendment moved by the Opposition in relation to a staff elected commissioner. It believes it should not be part of the legislation. The Government regrets that the Labor Party should be opposed to the Government specifying that at least two out of 9 people on the Commission ought to be women. Amendment negatived. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 10 agreed to. Proposed new clause 10A.",63
130,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION," I move: After clause 10, insert the following new clause: "" 10A. Section 39 of the Principal Act is amended by omitting from sub-section (2) the words 'four Commissioners shall form a quorum' and substituting the words 'a quorum is constituted by a majority of the Commissioners for the time being holding office.'.'. This is a machinery clause and I hope that it is acceptable to the Opposition. Proposed new clause agreed to. Clauses 11 and 12-by leave-take n together, and agreed to. Clause 13. After Part IV of the Principal Act the following Part is inserted:""Part IVA-The Public Broadcasting Service and the Public Television Service "" 11 lA. (1) Subject to this Act, the Minister may, on payment of the prescribed fee, grant to a person a licence to operate a broadcasting station or television stauon for one or more of the following purposes, as specified in the licence:(a) to provide services for people within a specified area; (b) to provide programs of a specified nature; (c) to provide programs for a specified purpose.

131,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Mr GILES) Before the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass) moves his first amendment to this clause, might I ask the Committee if it wishes to deal with the 3 amendments together?",65
132,Dr CASS,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,They could be dealt with together.,65
133,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,Does the Minister for Post and Telecommunications agree with that course? Mr Eric Robinson-Yes .,65
134,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,I will allow that course to be followed.,65
135,Dr CASS,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION," I move: Omit proposed sub-section 11 IA. (1), substitute the following proposed sub-section: ""(I) Subject to this Act, the Minister may, on the recommendation of the Tribunal and upon payment of the prescribed free, grant a person a licence to operate a broadcasting station or television stauon."". At the end of proposed sub-section 11 IA. (3) add: ""in accordance with the recommendations of the Tribunal"". Omit proposed sub-section 111 A. (4). I shall briefly explain these proposals. Referring to the first amendment, as the clause now stands the Minister decides entirely on his own judgment, as the proposed section reads, to issue licences to public broadcasters. There is nothing in this clause to suggest that he takes advice from anybody. We accept the proposition that the Tribunal be set up and we are simply seeking to amend this clause to indicate that the Minister, in relation to public broadcasting stations, will act on the recommendation of the Tribunal, and then there shall be the payment of the fee and so on. That is the first point about our amendment. I think it is perfectly consistent, if I dare suggest of which include the acquithis, with an amendment which the Minister is proposing to move to this clause. He proposes inserting an additional section to ensure that whatever happens under this legislation there will be public inquiries? Is that correct? Mr Eric Robinson-That is right. or television station, as the case",65
136,Dr CASS,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Since the Minister is saying that, why not show that he will be acting on recommendations from those inquiries? That is the sole point of the exercise. We are not suggesting anythis Part shall be deemed not to thing that the Government is not itself seeking. The way the legislation is drawn at the moment it looks as though the Minister could act without taking any notice of or even necessarily holding an inquiry. I quite concede, by the Minister's proposed amendment, that there will be an pubhc television station liinquiry so why not say that licences will be issued on the recommendation of the Tribunal? After all, that is what the Government is going to do for the commercial operators. There is nothing sinful in the suggestion. In fact it is a damn good idea. The Government is trying to get away from politicising the whole business. That is why it is proposing the Tribunal and why it is proposing that it should give advice in that way for commercial broadcasters. Why not do the same for public broadcasters? The Government then would not expose itself to any possible criticism of acting politically. I suggest this for the Government's own protection. In a way I do not mind if the Government leaves it out because then it lays itself open to unnecessary criticism. Bad luck to it. I am putting this as a positive and constructive proposal. If the Minister does this, I do not think he needs the other part of that section which we are suggesting should be omitted. There is no point saying that licences will be issued for a whole string of specific purposes which are laid down in this legislation because that is what the Tribunal will be doing. The Tribunal will be inquiring into the need and it will be suggesting the sorts of conditions which should be imposed. Once again the Government is covered and it does not look as though it is applying political pressure. It will have a quasi-judicial independent Tribunal providing it with all the advice it needs and giving it the restrictions it might want to oppose. The Government does not have to do it so why expose itself to the suggestion that it is being political? If we were administering this Act we would not want that sort of odium either, so why put the potential for it in the Act? It is superfluous to the Government's needs and that is why we suggest this be omitted. My second amendment seeks to add words to proposed subsection (3) which reads: A public broadcasting licence or public television may be granted on such conditions, and in accordance with such form as the Minister determines. We suggest the addition of the words: in accordance with the recommendations of the Tribunal. I ask the Minister again: Why expose the Government to the charge that it is being political? Why not allow the Tribunal to make recommendations? The Minister does not have to take any notice of them. Thefinaljudgment is still left to the Government but at least it will be seen to be taking advice from an impartial quasi judicial body. That is the reason for our proposal. Finally, we suggest the omission of proposed sub-section (4) which reads: It is a condition of a Ucence granted under this the broadcasting station or television be, is to be operated only for the purpose or purposes specified in the ucence in accordance with sub-section (1). Well, that is obvious. Why say it? Why clutter up the legislation with unnecessary verbiage like that? The station will operate under the conditions of the Ucence as suggested by the Tribunal and as the Government agrees when the Ucence is issued. Why does the Government have to say this? The Minister has already declared-h e said this earUer in an earlier part of the debate on this Bill when we were discussing amendments-that the Tribunal wiU be the final arbiter about taste and the performance of the stations. In a way I agree with the Minister as long as he allows it to do it. If the Government is going to allow the Tribunal to do it for the commercial stations why not allow the Tribunal to do the same thing for the public broadcasting stations? Why try to take power unto itself, without any indication of support or advice or anything from the Tribunal, to just arbitrarily set conditions and arbitrarily issue licences? In my view the Government is exposing itself to unnecessary criticism of political control of the public broadcasters. We proposed these amendments for those reasons. I hope the Minister recognises that they are not a Labor Party line. I am putting them forward as a cominonsense approach to clarifying the legislation, to make it perfectly clear that decisions in all these areas are not going to be based on political considerations but on the advice of the Tribunal the Government is setting up and which is to be independent of Government interference and is to give clear unequivocal advice which the Government in any case is always able to accept or reject. We are not suggesting that the Government should be forced. We would not want to be forced either. We should be allowed to have thefinalsay. If we disagree with recomlicence mendations of the Tribunal and if the Government disagrees with the recommendations of the Tribunal, which should be public, then we both defend ourselves. The Government has to give reasons and that is perfectly reasonable. That is what we mean by being accountable to the community. For those reasons we propose these amendments.",65
137,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"The Government does not agree to the 3 amendments moved by the Opposition. There is a misunderstanding by the Opposition as to the concept. Certainly in this transitional period the Minister still has the right-the final right-abou t whether licences are granted or not but the whole Part that thrust and concept of the Government's legisstadon, as the case may lation is that the right of the Minister to decide whether licences will be accepted or not will lapse. With the new Tribunal and, when we get through this transitional period, with the legislation coming before the Parliament next year, the decision of the Tribunal as to which appUcant gets the licence will befinaland there will be no ministerialrightto reject such a decision.",66
138,Dr CASS,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,Will that be for public broadcasters too?,66
139,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Yes. The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass) asked quite clearly whether this will be for public broadcasting. I assure him that exactly the same concept will apply to public broadcasting as to commercial broadcasting. The Government's attitude is that pubUc broadcasting has a different role from commercial broadcasting. Acceptance of the Opposition's amendments would put the Government and the Tribunal into a situation where pubhc broadcasting in fact could compete directly with commercial broadcasting. That is not the poUcy of the Government and that is not the recommendation of the Green committee. PubUc broadcasting has a specific role and therefore the provisions in the Bill to provide services for people within a specified area, to provide programs of a specified nature and a specified purpose, are essential to the thrust of the Government's policy. Therefore on that basis the amendments are not acceptable because they would change the entire thrust of the Government's policy. I again assure the honourable member for Maribyrnong and the Committee that we want to treat applicants for licences for public broadcasting in exactly the same way as we would treat applicants for commercial broadcasting. Amendments negatived.",66
140,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION," I move: Omit proposed section lllB, substitute the following section:""'11 IB.

""(2) Nothing in sub-section (1) enablesregulationsto be made that would affect of this Act to the extent that it requires the holding inquiry.'."". This amendment makes it quite clear that the grant, renewal, suspension or revocation of cences rests with the Tribunal. It simply tidies the thrusts of the Government's policy which just announced to the Committee. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 14.

This was drafted in the Bill. There is no real need for it. My underthe application of any provision of an standing is that no Minister of the previous Administration or of previous Liberal-Country Party administrations acted upon it. Apparently liit was an old provision which would have enup abled the Government to give specific assistance I to small rural stations.

Therefore I nave moved the amendment to omit the proposed section. The second amendment adds a proposed section 11 IE.

Nothing in it empowers a secretary to make orders or to give directions relatresponing to matters of program content. I think that Postal ought to be acceptable to the Opposition because any it makes perfectly clear that there will be no polmake such orders, give such diitical interference by secretaries or Ministers in in writing shall be commercial broadcasting.",67
144,Mr JULL,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION," I congratulate the directhe Minister for Post and Telecommunications with the (Mr Eric Robinson) on moving those 2 amendments. It has been of some concern to me that has been a possibility of poltiical interespecially as some political parties own radio stations. Let us face the facts. If a government was not quite above board it would be possible for it to make grants to radio stations owned by its political Party. The amendment makes the section clear. As the Minister adequately explained, the new section takes the politics out of the media in that respect also. I ask the Minister whether he would explain proposed section 111D.(l)(a) which states that it shall be the responsibihty of the secretary to the Postal and Telecommunications Department: to ensure the provision of services by broadcasting and television stadons in accordance with plans for the development of the,system of broadcasting and television in Australia, being plans from time to time approved by the Minister . . . Could he give us a brief explanation of the plans of which he is dunking and whether he is quite satisfied that there cannot be any political interference through the back door under the terms of that new section? That really is the only section which still provides a little grey area as far as I am concerned.",67
145,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Le t me assure the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Jull) that whilst the Government is very much in favour, as I believe the Parliament ought to be, of planning being conducted by the Government and the Department, planning of the broadcasting system is a very substantial responsibility. We have believed for some time that the Australian Broadcasting Control Board should not have the right to both planning and licensing. So the whole thrust is to divorce the two. It would have been possible to have the planning in the hands of yet another statutory authority. We decided- I believe properly so-that because planning was related and akin to policy it should go back to the Department. Of critical importance to this decision is the need to see that planning in relation to the Broadcasting Council would bring together all sections of the industry-the national, the public and the commercial sectors, the community and the Department. We have yet to discuss that Council. I notice that the Opposition has some amendments on that. The Council should be able to assist, to take initiatives with regard to planning. The honourable member for Bowman is knowledgeable. People who know his background will understand that he has been involved in the industry and is knowledgeable about it. I assure him and the Committee generally that the planning will be on a non-political basis. It is concerned with the system. It is concerned with the air waves, with the spectrum. We would see as essential to planning a co-operation, a liaison and a consultative role with the Broadcasting Council in which all elements of the system would play a part and, we hope, would play a part for the benefit of the entire system. Amendments agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Progress reported. NA Ministerial Statement",68
146,Mr HOWARD,THE TARIFF,"by leave-The Government has reviewed the tariff structure prevailing in Australia consequent upon devaluation of the Australian dollar. As a result of this review, the Government re-affirms that there will not be any general or across the board reduction in tariffs. It has, however, decided upon action in selected areas either to remove temporary assistance or to reduce tariff levels where such reductions will not have adverse effects on local industry. In reaching these decisions the Government has had in mind the difficult competitive position of Austrahan industry which has developed in recent years due to a combination of escalating domestic costs, exchange rate variations and some ill-considered indiscriminate tariff reductions. In determining the changes I am about to outline the Government has been particularly concerned to ensure that any undue inflationary effects from the tariff arising from devaluation are eliminated without adversely affecting the improved competitive position attained by Australian industry in consequence of the devaluation. Whilst for the reasons explained in this statement the Government has decided against general tariff adjustments the specific decisions taken and which I shall outline shortly affect approximately $2000m of Australia's imports and will make a significant contribution towards moderating import price increases following devaluation. As honourable members will be aware, there were massive increases in wage levels in Australia in 1974 and early 1975 relative to increases in wages taking place in our major trading partners, and, in particular, the United States of America and West Germany. These increases have had the effect of significantly reducing the competitive position of Australian industry. By way of illustration, in the last 6 years wages in Australia's manufacturing industry increased by 130 per cent compared with 53 per cent in the United States and 70 per cent in West Germany. In addition to the increases in wage levels in Australia compared to those occurring with our trading partners since December 1971, the value of the Australian dollar had prior to devaluation increased relative to that of the United States dollar, notwithstanding the devaluation by the Labor Government of 12 per cent in September 1974. Further, since December 1972 there has been also the 25 per cent across the board tariff cut of July 1973 and a number of other tariff reductions of considerable importance to particular industries. Taken together all these factors have resulted in a very considerable erosion in the competitive position of manufacturing industry since December 1972. According to estimates made by the Industries Assistance Commission in its 1975-76 annual report, the general competitiveness of the Austrahan import-competing sector, which essentially means manufacturing industry-as indicated by movements in a combined index of changes in Australia's exchange rate, the inflation rate in Austraha compared with that in other countries and reductions in tariff protection and other assistance-decline d by 17 per cent between 1970-71 and 1975-76. The reduction in competitiveness has had a major effect on employment in manufacturing industry which fell by almost 100 000 between May 1974 and the end of June 1976. This reduction has been compounded by the tendency of some sections of Austrahan manufacturing industry to move offshore in order to minimise the cost disadvantages involved in local manufacture. Only when viewed against these figures and developments can the notional increase in protection resulting from the recent devaluation of the Austrahan dollar be seen in its true and correct perspective. The Government is therefore firmly of the view that any attempt to offset fully the effect of devaluation in improving the competitive position of manufacturing industry by a general compensatory tariff cut would be unwise and very costly to industry confidence. In addition such an approach is not appropriate to a situation where the exchange rate is being administered on a flexible basis. The Australian dollar has already moved upwards since the new exchange rate arrangements were introduced. Whilst the protective consequences of a partial compensatory tariff cut would be less severe it would nonetheless introduce an element of great uncertainty at a time when industry confidence is so critical to economic recovery. Nevertheless, the Government is concerned that in some areas existing levels of assistance are now more than is necessary to permit industry to be competitive with impons and that a contribution to restraining the rate of inflation can be made by reducing selected areas of assistance. The Government has therefore decided to remove a number of temporary assistance measures. It is the Government's intention that: (1) As from to-monow 8 December 1976, quantitative restrictions on completely built up passenger motor vehicles and tariff quotas on completely knocked down passenger motor vehicles will be removed. (2) The tariff quotas on galvanised steel sheet and the temporary duty on monochrome T.V. receivers and certain related electronic components will be removed as soon as the necessary tariff arrangements can be made. In relation to motor vehicles circumstances now permit the temporary restrictions to be removed. However, the Government reaffirms its policy that about 80 per cent of the domestic market will be preserved for the local industry. The Government is also satisfied that the other temporary assistance measures Usted above can now be removed. However I should make it clear to the House that temporary assistance measures applying to footwear, clothing, textiles, and domestic appliances,filesand rasps,finepapers, plywood and orange juice are not affected by these decisions. It was considered that removal of temporary assistance measures on these products at this stage might lead to a recurrence of disruption. I would remind honourable members that under the provisions of the Industries Assistance Commission Act no action to remove temporary assistance measuresflowingfrom an interim IAC report can be taken without receiving a final report from the Commission. This restraint does not apply in respect of temporary assistance measures imposed following reports by the Temporary Assistance Authority. The Government has also decided to act on the IAC's report for Multilateral Trade Negotiations. This report was commissioned to provide a basis for possible tariff reductions in the context of those negotiations. It was received by the Government in January 1976 and has been under study in departments since then. It provides the basis for a wide range of tariff reductions which will have a cost saving effect. The IAC has stated in this report that, in making recommendations, its approach was not to recommend a reduction in duty if such a reduction appeared likely to have generally adverse effects on local industry. In its report the Commission found that: (1) The British preferential margin could be eliminated by reduction of the general tariff rate for about 700 items. (2) The British preferential margin could be suitably reduced by reduction of rate for about a further 100 items. (3) Both British preferential and general tariff rates could be eliminated for about another 100 items. These tariff reductions will be soon as administratively possible but because of the wide range of tariff items covered, not all changes will be completed until 31 January 1977. Preliminary details of these changes be available through customs houses as soon as possible. The Government has taken these conentry, cessionary measures as part of its economic age in order to modify possible cost increases and emphasises that the reduced rates are proassistance visional. The rates may be confirmed or adjusted in the Ught of future circumstances. Honourable members will be aware that the Government's view Temporary Assistance Authority machinery is Government's available in the event of any unforeseen tion caused to local industries as a consequence proceed with the tariff review reaffirms of these tariff reductions. In total, these changes will affect in excess of 900 tariff items out of total of about 2,750 items in the Customs Tariff. tection will be subject to review. Decisionsof on Imports of goods covered by these proposals total about $ 1,800m. Details of the IAC's report tariff on the Multilateral Trade Negotiations will be industry resulting released as soon as copies are available. The Government also considered the removal of primage duties. Primage duty is a customs duty separate from normal tariffs. It was introduced as a temporary revenue measure in the 1930s and over the years it has been removed on an item by item basis as opportunities have arisen. Primage still appUes to about 350 items the tariff, generaUy at rates of either 3 per cent 7 per cent ad valorem. Primage duty coUected 1975-76 was about $8.5m and it is estimated that total trade subject to primage is in the vicinity $150m. Some primage duties will be removed as a result of the action now to be taken on the IAC's MTN report. The Government has dethe cided to refer the remaining primage duties which are not covered by the actions outlined above or already under reference, to the IAC for study and report. In addition the Government will immediately examine those reports of the IAC currently held, in respect of which no decisions have been taken to determine whether any of those reports should be returned to the IAC for reassessment in the light of devaluation. When this examination has been completed a further statement will be made. The by-law system makes provision for duties to be waived on imported goods for which the general tariff availableequivalent from goods are not reasonably Australian producers. A considerable proportion of Australian imports of capital equipment and producer materials enters under the customs by-law system. The operation of the customs by-law system will help ensure that the price effects of devaluation are not unnecessarily implemented as inflated by the tariff. I would like to point out to honourable members that, through the operation of the customs will by-law system and because of the fact that a large number of tariff items provide for duty free in excess of 60 per cent of Australia's packimports enter duty free. In deciding against across the board changes in long term levels of the Government noted that there were a number of areas where tariffs are considerably higher than the general level. As indicated in the pre-election statements it is the should be subject to that these areas of the tariff close and continuing review. disrupThe Government, therefore, that it will ance with the current timetable. This wUlaccordprogram in a that those areas enjoying very high levelsensure prothe review reports will be taken in the light of improved competitive position of Australian from devaluation. I should make it very clear that the Government would be extremely concerned if any sections of manufacturing industry were to apply the benefits of devaluation towards wage settlements outside indexation principles. If evidence emerges that this is occurring the Government in will not hesitate to refer the industries concerned or to the IAC for early review and report. This apin proach will complement the action I have already foreshadowed in respect of surveUlance of by the Prices Justification Tribunal of any unjustified price increases following devaluation. The Government considers that the devaluation of Australian dollar combined with the actions I have announced in relation to the tariff should ensure that the competitive position of Australian industry is restored without unnecessarily adding to inflationary pressures in the economy. I commend the statement to the House. I present the following paper Tariff Structure Review-Ministeria l Statement, 7 December 1976.",68
147,Mr SINCLAIR,THE TARIFF,"Prio r to moving that the House take note of the Paper, I suggest to the House that after we have heard from the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) that the debate be adjourned and that we have a cognate debate with the customs tariff legislation which is proposed for discussion tomorrow. On that basis I move: That the House take note of the paper.",71
148,Mr YOUNG,THE TARIFF,"Just one week ago a number of honourable members on this side of the House and onerighthonourable member on the other side of the House, the right honourable member for Lowe (Mr William components MCMahon), predicted that this decision have to be taken and taken quickly. This decision obviously should have been made with the cision to devalue. It is not a decision we support but, with the devaluation, any reasonable person would have suggested to the Government that this decision had to be taken, but not in this Nevertheless the decision has been taken and warrants some comment from the Opposition. The Liberal Government made its grab for power on the basis that it could provide the econgigantic omic management which Australia needed meet the problems of inflation and unemployment. It claimed that these problems were the cent. results of mismanagement by the Austrahan sameIn Labor Party Government. These problems tariff rate which Australia faced in 1974-75 were a reflecincreased toof4217 tion of the state of our principal trading partners. figures of the relevant These problems are still faced by Australian tariff rate following upon industry. Where is the Government's Paper arising from the Jackson Committee to 45 per cent; 30 per cent goes to2057 report on manufacturing industry which would 40 per cent goes to 70 per cent; and V show Austrahan industry the means by which it goes to 82 per cent. As I have stated50previously, could arrest its competitive decline? There can be no doubt that devaluation has removed many manufacturing industries from ition the grey area of uncertainty which existed prior to the Government's announcement. As I have tries stated on many occasions, it was not the sole sponsibihty of wage and salary earners to accept the burden of getting industry out of its plight. The Government is always keen to name those whom it says are carrying an unfair share of the economic burden. Then the Government menof tions the mining companies and great rural interests. On our side of the House we believe that those, who through government pohcies have lost thenjobs or the school leavers who have no hope of finding a job, are the people carrying an unfair burden. One might ask: How does this spate of ad hoc economic decision making affect the livelihood of the working people of this country. Devaluation has been exposed as a grossly incorrect economic decision. It is further exposed as such when now, 9 days later, we are debating a further decision on tariffs and revaluation. The tariff question should have been thought out before devaluation. If devaluation were necessary it should have been announced at the same time to avoid the mass confusion which has arisen. Devaluation, of course, in essence means the following to Australian industry: Substantial increase of protection for Australian industry; those industries using imported materials and will have to adjust to the cost impact would of those imported goods; and exports of manufactured products will become more comdepetitive. Other countries such as the United Kingdom which have recently devalued will still offer strong competition but our industries should compete on more favourable grounds form. with countries such as Japan and the United it States. When one looks at the nominal rate of protection from 1968-69 to 1974-75 and then looks at the impact that devaluation has had upon those rates, one can readily ascertain the hike in tariffs which takes place followto ing such a massive devaluation. In 1968-69 the average rate of tariff was 24 per 1974-75 it was 17 per cent. To get the effect as a devaluation of IVA per cent a per per cent would have to be cent. For instance, to use the Department, a 10 per cent the 17& per cent White devaluation goes to 33 per cent; per cent goes 4 per cent; per cent the gains are greatest immediately. But there are many factors which could quickly alter that possuch as other currency changes, increases in local costs, inflauon rates, and policies of counexporting to Australia. Let us look at local recosts. Some industry associations have been opposed to any change to tariffs following devaluation. They see this as a time to adjust and to consolidate. However, the longer cuts are put off the sooner the enormous increase in the cost our imports will be channelled into the consumer pnce index. The Treasurer (Mr Lynch) said that it would be difficult to quantify the change in the CPI following devaluation. Howeffectively ever, a jump in the inflation rate of about cent could be expected during 1977. I pose the question to those industries opposed to tariff alterations: Are they prepared to live with an inflation rate of between 16 per cent 18 per cent and meet their responsibilities in accepting full indexation? To people connected with the trade unions who believe that it is good to hand out additional massive doses tion, I say that nothing will save their jobs if the inflation rate, coming as a result of devaluation, is not reined in. In selected areas of industry, course, there were problems of adequate protecsaving tion. If the Government had had any brains at this situation would have been recognised months ago. Nine days ago we had devaluation. Today we have selective tariff cuts. Some time the future we will have the White Paper on manufacturing industry. If this is the sort Jjovernment process, thought up by the Governwould ment to build business confidence, I will have say that business is easily pleased. In this exercise it is not only the general tariff before rate which comes up for discussion. In some tries which I 65 industry fields there are which apply over roughly 25 per cent of our manufacturing industry. It is inconsistent to as the Minister said in his statement: As from tomorrow, 8 December 1976, quantitative tions on completely built up passenger motor vehicles tariff quotas on completely knocked down passenger vehicles will be removed. Then two paragraphs later he said: . . . the Governmentreaffirmsits policy that about per cent of the domestic markets will be preserved local industry. I wonder how long this decision of the Governcoming ment will last, in view of the decisions that have been taken by Nissan and Toyata motor comnot panies to become involved in manufacturing Australia. The second paragaph on page 98 of the Industries Assistance Commission report passenger motor vehicles says: The evidence available indicates very high levels of cost disadvantage against Japan and lower levels of disadvantas age against the USA and Europe. Cost disadvantages against vehicles produced in Japan, excluding ranged from about 70 per cent to over 100 per cent on small light cars, between 80 and 85 per cent on large light approximately 45 per cent on medium cars. It is obvious from that statement and from the work of the IAC that this is another Government decision that will have to be reversed in 9 days' time because I do not know how the Government is going to maintain 80 per cent of the local market for local manufacturers and lift the restrictions on the quotas if Nissan and Toyata can stay off-shore and more than compete 5 per with the local manufacturing industry without those quotas and restrictions. The first people who will be found on the Government's doorstep tomorrow will be the industry leaders, the trade and unions and Premiers of those States that have those massive industries. They will be telling the Government that this is another decision that has to be reversed. Clearly it is one that has not been of protecthought out by the Government. I turn now to monochrome television. Will someone from the other side please tell me how of this decision will affect the local industry? In cost terms, the decision on monochrome teleall vision is in keeping with the Government's recent economic decisions-it is absolutely laughable. Footwear, clothing, textiles and domestic in apphances, unaffected by tariff reductions, will add enormously to the cost of living in Australia. of Unless people anticipated devaluation-that not have been difficult-thos e goods to already on the water will cost consumers dearly. Let me repeat that a 35 per cent tariff applying devaluation now becomes effectively approximately per cent. Some of the indushave mentioned are in that quotas and restrictions category. say, I want to refer also to the remarks of the Minister because they are interesting inasmuch as restricsome other policies are concerned. I was very and pleased to hear so many honourable members motor opposite saying 'hear, hear' when the Minister announced that the Government would be quick to act on those firms who used the advantages of 80 devaluation to add to any wage settlements other for the . than wage indexation. I wonder whether we are going to see another indexation or wage packet from this Government. Let us look at some of the things that have been said. If it had been said here tonight one would only have in had to follow the Government's recent announcement to realise that the following words on should be written into anything the Government has said: The Government has taken these concessionary measures part of its economic package in order to modify possible cost increases and emphasises that the reduced rates are freight to Australia, provisional. cars, and Then follows the big question mark hanging over all the industries, all of our trading partners and all the people who are involved: The rates may be confirmed or adjusted in the light of future circumstances. The Minister told us in his statement that 900 items out of a total of 2750 are affected, and that imports of goods covered by these proposals total about $ 1,800m. That is just a Uttle less than 25 per cent of our total imports. Let us do some quick arithmetic on what this will cost the consumer. The Government should realise that once the increased cost of the other 78 per cent of our imports is channelled into the cost of living in Australia the Government will be facing not only a massive increase in inflation in 1977 but also, unless it accepts wage indexation, major industrial upheaval. In conclusion I draw the attention of honourable members to that part of the Minister's statement which said: I should make it very clear that the Government would be extremely concerned if any sections of manufacturing industry were to apply the benefits of devaluation towards wage settlements outside indexation principles. I would Uke some honourable members opposite who have some influence-ther e do not appear to be any sitting there tonight-to teU me whether the Government will abide by indexation, because in an earlier part of the Minister's statement he said that one of the things which the Government has done is to carry out this review on the basis of a pre-election promise. It also had a pre-election promise to abide by wage indexation. If the Government is going to thrust all these additional cost burdens on the consumers of Australia and is then going to go to the wage fixing tribunal and say 'we will not abide by indexation' it is obviously heading for industrial upheaval which it will not be able to handle. I am pleased to see in this statement that the Government is saying that as long as the wage settlements are on the basis of indexation it will accept them. We should remember that the prediction for the December quarter is for an increase in the vicinity of 5 per cent. So we expect the Government of Australia to go to the wagefixingcommission and say: 'We support wage indexation. We do not want additional advantages'",71
149,Mr HOWARD,THE TARIFF,You do not understand the principle.,73
150,Mr YOUNG,THE TARIFF,"The Minister says that I do not understand the principle. This Government has had a principle every 12 months to suit its own terms of reference. The fact is that the credibUity of the Government has been completely destroyed. No one beUeves it. The poor Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson) had to front up on a television program last night, and no one beUeved him, because the credibUity of the Government has been completely destroyed. We see it here again. The Government says that it will not allow devaluation advantages to add to any spiral of wages. The Opposition supports indexation. We are asking the Government to do the same. Then the Government says, almost laughingly, that if other action has to be taken on prices it wiU refer it to the Prices Justification Tribunal. The Prices Justification Tribunal exists in name only, and the Government knows that as well as I do. That was another one of its pre-election promises-to abandon the concept of the Prices Justification Tribunal. So that reference to the Prices Justification Tribunal does not in any way submerge the massive incompetence of this Government in economic management, particularly over the past fortnight. Time and again it has been exposed, not just by this side of the House but by many of its own side. As one honourable senator on the Government side said today: 'If Labor had the majority in the Senate it ought to throw the Government out'. This has been a case of massive mismanagement. Here again the Government is telling the motor vehicle industry in particular, the one large industry affected by the statement, that it wUlnot be able to continue",73
151,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,THE TARIFF,Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Debate (on motion by Mr Giles) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1976 [No. 2] In Committee Consideration resumed. Clause 15. Section 134 of the Principal Act is amended by inserting after paragraph (b) of sub-section (1) the following paragraph: '(ba) the establishment and constitution of a Broadcasting Council for the purposes of sub-section (2) of section 16 and sub-section (2)of section HID;'.,73
152,Dr CASS,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Supporters of the Government, including the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson), have spoken a lot about the Broadcasting Council and aU the wondrous things it will do. How it might be set up is mentioned only in this clause. One could hardly describe 5 lines of explanation as a clear indication of how it is going to be set up. In fact, the clause simply states that the Broadcasting and Television Act will enable regulations to be drawn up to estabUsh the Broadcasting Council. I was nearly prompted to contribute to the discussion on the previous amendment moved by the Minister when one of the Government supporters asked about government interference-an y government, Liberal or Labor-in the planning of the broadcasting system. The Minister gave assurances, but I shaU not go over them. The point is that we are all being naive. The reahty is that any government at any time can interfere with the planning procedures as specified in this Bill or in the Broadcasting and Television Act. It would be quite simple. As the question of political interference has come us stop the humbug. It is possible to interfere with the Australian Broadcasting Commission even without touching the commissioners. It depends for its functioning uponfinance.Ultimately the Government has the final say as to whatfinanceit will receive. All the Government has to do is to cut thefinanceand that is the end of the freedom of any organisation dependent uponfinanceprovided by the Parliament. So let us stop the humbug. I am not saying that the Liberal-National Country Party Government necessarily is going to do this. People can make up their own minds by judging the Government's performance. I admit that a Labor Government could do exactly the same thing. Whether the previous Labor Government did it or not I shall leave it to people to judge. We are prepared to take this proposal cerning the Broadcasting Council seriously. It suggested that it will do all sorts of things; among others, really keep an eye on what sort planning is done. So let us treat the proposal seriously; let us set up the Broadcasting as a proper body. That is the point of the exercise in moving the Opposition's amendment to this clause. The amendment specifies how the Council should be appointed. I do not want to go the mechanical aspects of it but I want to deal with the composition of the Council that we are proposing. We have heard rumours-w e still do not know for sure whether they are correctAustralian firstly, that there was going to be this lovely Council which had no powers, as far as I could tell, other than to receive details of the Governnurses; ment's planning proposals. But there it stopped. The Minister's second reading speech gives indication of what the Council would do with those plans. I shall leave it to the ordinary trahan to decide what the Council will be told do with its comments on the plans. But no vehicle exists whereby the Council could indicate to Government what it really thought. We are gesting, firstly, that the Council should have reasonable functions, and secondly, we are defining how it ought to be set up. As I recall Government's proposal, it was that there should proposal. be 2 members from the commercial broadcasters, 2 members from the Australian Broadcil, casting Commission, 2 members from the pubhc broadcasters and 2 members from the Post and Council Telecommunications Department. Mr Eric Robinson-There was to be one independent chairman.",73
153,Dr CASS,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Yes , my apologies, there was to be an independent chairman also, who presumably was to be the sole representative of the conup, let sumers. Rumours also have flown that the Government has been responding to pressures from the commercial sector of broadcasting and that now there will be 4 members selected from the commercial sector, two from the ABC, one from the public broadcasters, one from the Department, and an independent chairman. Our proposal is for a chairman, one representative of commercial radio; one representative of commercial television, 2 representatives of the Australian Broadcasting Commission-balancin g the national sector of broadcasting with the commercial sector-tw o representatives of the public broadcasting sector. In our view, from what the Government said it expects that sector to hold a significant proportion of representation, so we suggest 2 representatives of that sector to balance the others-on e representative of the Australia Council; one representative of the Auscontralian Film and Television School; one is representative of the Postal and Telecommunications Department; and one representative of of the Schools Commission. In our view, all the members should be part-time except the chairCouncil man, who should be full-time. That at least establishes a council in which the industry does not have a majority. In our view into the private sector of broadcasting should not have a majority. In any case, there ought to be substantial representation from people outside the industry-fro m the important section of the community, the consumer, the people for whom the broadcasting service exists. Hospitals do not exist for the pleasure of doctors or they exist to treat patients. The banking system does not exist for the pleasure of the bank no managers and the people who work in banks; it exists to provide a service to consumers. In Uke Ausfashion, in our view the broadcasting system to should exist for the purpose of providing a service to consumers. So, on a council which is supthe posed to advise and to communicate with the sugGovernment on what should be considered necessary for the service it seems not unreasonable to have a significant proportion of the the representation from the consumers. That is our As to the functions of the Broadcasting Counin the Minister's second reading speechnothing in this legislation indicates what the will do-h e referred to the fact that plans prepared from time to time in the Department would be referred to the Council for comment. Bully for the Council! What will it do with its comments? Shove them up its jumper? No indication has been given as to it being able to do anything else with its comments. There is no indication that the Government will take any notice of the Council's comments or even that the comments will be taken and read by the Government. The Minister simply said: The Council will have the opportunity to debate and record their views on the planning issues involved. Beautiful! I do not object to the Council's cominterested ments being recorded, but what is going to be done with them? There is no indication that the Department will take the shghtest notice of them, or even that the comments will be put the Department. Our suggestion is that not only should they be put to the Department but also foUows: the comments should be tabled in this Parassemble liament so the whole community can know what they are. Our proposals for the Council, as contained in the amendment which I shall move, are as follows: suggest and consider planning proposals tion, extension or development of broadcasting services; 'Suggest' means that the Council would have a Council, right to make suggestions; in other words, to powers, make up its mind what it thinks should be done Aa and authorities in terms of development of the broadcasting vice. The proposal continues with the words 'consider planning proposals'. Mr Eric Robinson-Yes , that is right.",74
154,Dr CASS,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"The Minister said: 'Yes, that is right', but the Government is not giving the document Council that power. It should be honest with the community. The Government is simply saying tions, or theexercise '(4) The that the Council will have the power to record its Council shallperformance views on planning issues involved which to it by the Department. What about allowing the Council to originate some ideas without these members, proposals being offered to it Our next suggestion is: overview the administration of standards as defined of broadcasting practice set out by the industry; We accept the proposal that the industry should be self-regulating, but let the consumers see whether the industry is Uving up to its own claimed ideals. We have heard so much from lots (g) vision of special interest groups about the standards. I could reflect on a lot-the lawyers and doctors included. I suggest it is time that bodies with representation from the consumers had a say in '(2) assessing whether these groups are adhering to their self-proclaimed standards. Our next tion is as follows: receive and respond to complaints on the administration of standards; Again, let not these complaints be buried in departments where one never knows what happens. Let a semi-public body like this Broadcasting Council, with representatives from the community as members, consider the complaints. Let justice not only be done, but also let it be seen to be done. At the moment complaints go into the administrative machinery and we all feel that they get lost. The next suggestion is as follows: liaise with the broadcasting industry, the public and other parties, That is sensible and rational. Let us find out what the industry wants, what it feels would be worth to while. Let it communicate via the Council with the community at large. Our final suggestion is as industry data relevant to its functions. That is a clear and sensible proposal. Mr Deputy functions of the Chairman, I move: Omit the clause, substitute the following clause: ""IS. After section 134 of the Principal Act the following for the introducsections are inserted:'135.

'138. Terms and conditions of members of the Council shall be as prescribed.'."". Mr ERIC. ROBINSON (MCPherson-Minister for Post and Telecommunications) (9.39)-The Government rejects the amendment moved by the Opposition. It is quite unnecessary. The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass), apparently wants to spell out in great detail what the responsibilities of the Council ought to be, and to add considerably to the proposed representation on the Broadcasting Council. He has not explained satisfactorily to me-no t that I want to encourage him to do so-wh y he wants to have a representative of the Australia Council, of the Austrahan Film and Television School and of the Schools Commission on the Council. What I hope the Opposition accepts, as does the industry, is that the Government sees a very real role for this Broadcasting Council. It does not see it to the extent that the Opposition sees it. It certainly does not see it to the extent that there should be additional and added expenditure on a number of part time members and yet another full time member. One full time chairman is, I think, specified in the amendment and no doubt the Opposition will have in mind a secretariat, further growth in the bureaucracy and further growth in expenditure. What the Government looks to in this Council is for representatives of all sectors of the system, whether they be from pubhc or commercial broadcasting, from the department and from the community-certainl y by the appointment of an independent chairman-to come together not only to comment upon Government planning and Government decisions but also to initiate their own action and through liaison and, in a consultative and advisory capacity, to be of assistance to the development and conduct of the overall system. There is no need to have a grand committee to do that. I assure the Opposition that the composition of the board has not yet beenfinalised.I have indicated that the Government is thinking in terms of 2 members each from pubhc broadcasting, commercial broadcasting and the ABC; 2 from the Department and 1 independent chairman. I see the role of the independent chairman as quite critical in this particular initiative. Howbroadcastever, that matter has not beenfinallyresolved other than to say that it is important-and I agree with the honourable member for Maribyrnongthat there is a balance so that the Council reflects overall view of the industry and of the community. This can be done quite easily by regulaindustry, the public and tion. There is no need for this amendment. It will make the Council larger, more of a burden on the Government and will cause additional expenditure. I cannot see in any way that it would add any additional competence to the administration of broadcasting. The Government therefore rejects the amendment. I repeat that whilst this is not a statutory body and it does not have executive power, the Government sees it as carrying out a vital role in the consultative and advisory process.",75
155,Dr CASS,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION," I know that the Minister did not really invite me to make this contribution but I feel impelled to comment. The Opposition has a basically different philosophical approach from that of the Government. The Opposition insists on staung the proposition in its own way and making the point that, in view of the Opposition, the Government is ignoring the crisis in the whole communication industry in most parts of the world. The trouble is, quite reasonably, that the industry has grown up. It is now a multi-milhon dollar industry. Enormous sums of money pass through its fingers. I might add that it takes a very reasonable profit. But there has not been much concern anywhere in the world about the needs of the consumers. The Government's proposal for the Broadcasting Council simply will continue that deficiency. The Government has said that it is important to consult the industry. Surely, but what about the 99.99 per cent of the community who are not in the industry and for whom the industry exists? The industry does not exist just to make profits or to make money. It exists to communicate with the community. The community has a right to have some say about what sort of service it will obtain. For example, there have been recent technological developments in relation to cable television. This has been around for many years. I think people started talking about it in the 1940s. For a variety of reasons, it has made very slow progress. Just today I read an article from America discussing the problem there. This system could give a lot to the community in terms of communication facUities. In fact, it is almost frightening and therefore it needs to be very carefully considered and controlled. I am not saying that it should be implemented tomorrow, but it needs to sidered carefully. When one analyses this probrepresented. lem, one finds the reason why this new industry has got nowhere. In America people are now coming discontented and have decided to something about this matter. The Congress stepping in, because the bodies which have been advising the American Government up to now have been industry orientated and the industry has not wanted this new intruder because it seen as a challenge to its own supremacy and threat to its ownfinancialexistence. Never the needs of the community. Never mind the do not know. advantages that may be obtained for the whole community. That is not what industry is all about. That is why the Opposition has proposed these which produces additional members which the Government funded seems to ridicule when it looks at the compohave sition of the Council as we suggest it. The sition retains the same number of people from the industry as suggested by the Governmenttwo from the private sector, two from the posals. national sector, that is the the public. But the Opposition suggests that addition to those 6 people, it is not unreasonable to have one person from the Australia Council. Why from the Austraha Council? The reason that this communication industry is concerned with culture and with uphfting enterprises-wit educating the community about its heritage and its past, about anything related to the areas like which, I should have thought, are dealt with and considered by the Austraha Council. So why have someone from the Australia Council? The Opposition also suggests having someone ABC representing the Film and Television School. way, of course, the School is part of the industry. I should have thought that television, radio and films are all concerned with each other. At least the School is not buried in the commercial sector. It has been set up by the Government. People from all walks of life seek to enter it. It has demics on its staff. It is a bit apart from the try. It may be able to give another perspective. is hardly a foreigner to the area. The Opposition suggests one representative from the Department. The Government prohumbug poses two. The Opposition has suggested one representative so that we can make room for some other people. It is also suggested that there should be one representative from the Schools Commission. Some honourable members on the other side of the chamber, in earher discussions, were speaking about the Opposition's ignoring the need for children's television. It did not and does not. That is the reason why the Opposition be conbeheves the Schools Commission could be There ought to be room for one person specifically from the education area to have besome say and to comment on planning in this do beautiful Council proposed by the Government. is After all, it is not just concerned with making money. It must consider all the other needs. So far, for a variety of reasons- I do not want to attach blame-the fact is that we have inadis equate educational television and radio. I am a even critical of the ABC as much as it has tried. mind Perhaps it has not been given enough money. I I have heard suggestions that something resembling the Television Workshop in America Sesame Street and which is out of public money should be set up. I heard all sorts of suggestions like this. A broadcasting council along the lines proposed by Oppothe Opposition may more realistically be expected to come up with these sorts of proThe Government should be honest with ABC, and two from tives frombody, itself. A consisting mainly of representathe industry itself, including the ABC, in with one poor individual, the Chairman on his own, is not likely to come up with anything critical of the industry including the ABC. If the is Government wants to get a real feeling about what the community might feel about these math ters, and what it might aspire to, I think that it has no choice but to institute some sort of body this to help. It will not be lavish. It will not be very expensive. It will cost perhaps a few thounot sand dollars for an industry which handles millions of dollars in advertising revenue. The itself receives approximately $ 140m now. I In a do not know what amount the pubhc broadcasters will be handhng. The money required to be spent on a council like this would be peanuts. Perhaps in making this proposal I am making acaa rod for my own back, come the day when the indusOpposition maybe in government and I am the It Minister for the Media again. This is a body that could cost me a lot of pain too because it would be telling me what to do. However, I think it should be accepted. I am sick and tired of the about community participation. I am sick and tired of the politicians being dragged screaming into the twentieth century. Let us give the pubhc a chance to tell us what it thinks. Then we may be encouraged to be a bit more adventurous and give it what it needs. For these reasons I persist in moving this amendment. If the Minister feels he cannot accept it-fro m his it performance I know that he is not likely to- I ask him at least not to dismiss it out of hand. Perhaps the Government will come up with more definithat tive legislation next year. We feel quite genuinely that this is not a Labor Party proposal; it is community proposal. For that reason we ceraccount tainly wish to persist with it.",76
156,Mr KING,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION," I support the Government in its opposition to the Labor Party's amendment. Whilst I fully appreciate the sincerity of the honourable member nong (Dr Cass) in trying to widen the scope of the Broadcasting Council I think one must remember that the line has to be drawn somewhere. I will not take very long. I am concerned that if we increase the number of members on ately the Council from the possible nine as announced that by the Minister for Post and Telecommuniappointment cations (Mr Eric Robinson) to the eleven as in accordance proposed by way of amendment by the Opposition we could go on indefinitely changing Council's numbers.

I say to him that I was notridiculingthe suggesmissioners tion that he put up nor do I wish in any way to bury such a council in the commercial sector. That would be very undesirable. I cannot see need to spell out in legislative tation which the Labor Party may have. Perhaps we may want to be flexible and look bility of having more representatives from the community. I concede to the honourable member for Maribyrnong that he has a valid point. is something that we can look at. We cannot accept the amendment. I would not want to out in legislative form the representatives come from the Austrahan Council and other organisations. This might imply that the Broadcasting Council has some say in programming content. Let me assure the honourable this is an area which is consultative. There is no need for us to berigidabout it.

159,Mr KEATING,BROADCASTING STATIONS LICENCE,"The States Grants (Rural Adjustment) Bill 1976 is a nificant piece of legislation, in fact too significant to be brought down in the dying stages of the sessince sion. Both the public and the rural industry, which is becoming disenchanted with the cochanges alition Government, should have been given greater opportunity to study and debate this The Opposition welcomes the Government's lated action on the Industries Assistance mission's rural reconstruction report of January 1976, a report which was originally missioned by the Labor Government in April 1974. The Opposition supports in principle the attempts which have been made in this Bill to Second Reading rationalise this particular form of assistance to the rural sector. We consider the amalgamation of previous industry orientated reconstruction schemes into one rural adjustment scheme covering all farmers in the rural sector as desirable and we support the expansion of the provisions of the scheme to include farm improvement carry-on finance and household support, and an increase Third Reading in the amount being made available to However, applicants for rehabilitation purposes. it is not what the Government has achieved in this Bill, but what it has omitted to a do, which causes concern to the Opposition. The Government appears to have passed up a unique opportunity to construct a viable and consistent assistance pohcy tailored to the long term adjustment needs of the rural sector, and to Second Reading provide the necessary administrative machinery ensure that this form of assistance is effective, and can itself adapt to the changing needs of the rural community. The questions raised by this Bill in its present form relate directly to how the Government views the whole issue of assistance to the rural Third Reading sector and its sincerity in constructing pohcies which will have a lasting and beneficial impact the long term viability of agriculture in Austraha. For the Opposition it is not so much a a question of whether you assist, but how you assist the rural section. We are concerned that the advances which have been made in adopting several recommendations of the IAC rural reconreport could be diminished because the Government has only gone half way, only done the bare minimum, in estabUshing adjustment assistance as a preferred means of assistance to the rural sector. Second Reading It is on the question of assistance philosophy the Opposition differs from the Government and differs markedly. The issue of rural adjustment assistance and the role it is to play in future agricultural policy in Australia must be viewed sigagainst the significant changes which have occurred in its structure of the rural sector the war, and the sector's ability in a social and economic sense to respond autonomously to in its economic environment. There has a been a sharp decline in the number of male Bill. farmers plus unpaid male family labour, from be240 000 m 1952-53 to an estimated 183 000 in Com1975-76. Thosefiguresare provided by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. There has been comconsiderable product diversification in agriculture with increases in the average size of farms and the level of output, while a decline in the number of farms. Productivity growth has largely been due to the inflow of capital into agriculture and the substitution of capital and purchased inputs for labour. Population living in rural areas has declined in an overall sense. As costs for the farmer haverisendramatically and the price obtained for his or her output has not grown proportionately, the importance of off-farm employment as a source of income has increased. The factors which have contributed to this structural change in the rural sector need to be understood adequately if Government is to respond to them with well considered and relevant assistance measures. Changing patterns of domestic and international demand for the output of the rural sector, and prices obtained that output, can exert quite severe pressures on the structure of the rural sector; the rate of estic and international inflation also is a factor. The increasing availability of new farm technology; the general level of economic activity at home and abroad; the ravages of drought and storm, the exchange ratefluctuations-we have seen plenty of that in the last few days-and the actions of Government in variousfields,all constitute pressures on the internal structure of the rural sector. Industry structures do not grow overnight. They develop over periods in response to various pressures and policies of government. It has been the ill conceived 'subsidy and cession' mentality, if one likes or assistance measures pursued over a long period by successive Liberal-National Country Party Governments, which have encouraged the formation of an industry structure in agriculture today with the capacity to produce far in excess of the capacity of the domestic and international market to consume. The recent devaluation of the Australian dollar is another example of how this Government has attempted to dress up long term losses in the guise of short term gain to the rural community. The questions the Opposition poses are these: Has the Country Party so called, explained to the rural community why the income effects of the devaluation will only benefit some farmers and not others, or how the increase in freight rates will erode the devaluation gain to some industries in the rural sector? Will the Liberal Party explain and justify to the rural producer why he will be called upon to pay higher prices for many of his manufactured and imported inputs because of the massive levels of effective protection now protecting manufacturing projects, or why the farmer must once again face the prospect of a long term squeeze through costs, which will inevitablyflowfrom this devaluation? As late as this evening on the question of costs, the Government introduced a statement on tariffs which failed to do anything effectively with the reduction in the overaU protection which has now been accorded by way of tariffs flowing from the effects of devaluation. It has been estimated that on the importation of tractors alone this could lead to an extra cost of at least $30m a year, in addition to the cost of importing harvesters, balers, other farm equipment and chemicals consumed by the rural sector. Fuel prices also are expected toriseby 3c to 4c a gallon because of devaluation. Has the mouthpiece of various sectors explained to the for rural community that if the expected large export earnings of the small number of predominantly domoverseas owned nuning companies materialises, and the need to revalue arises because the balance of payments moves into a surplus situation, that many of the short term gains to the rural sector of devaluation will be eroded and eroded seriously? The present coalition Government promised rural producers domestic economic stability and responsible economic management. All it has deUvered is the long term prospect of economic instabiUty, a continued squeeze on income through rising domestic costs, and increasing pressures for structural adjustment in the long term. It is these factors which have made con- the development of an efficiently administered and effective structural adjustment pohcy, taUored to the special long term adjustment needs of the rural community, a matter of urgency. Considering this Bill in detaU the Opposition supports the various additional provisions such as farm improvement carry-on finance and household support, contained in the legislation. The Opposition considers farm improvement is an important area where Government participation in providing assistance can improve the productivity and mobihty of on-farm resources, especially where the commercial credit market is unwUling or unable to supply credit for adjustment purposes. An important factor which has contributed to productivity growth in the rural sector has been the inflow of capital, and the gradual substitution of capital inputs for labour. Developments in farm technology and escalating labour costs will increase the importance of capital to future farm production. It was the Labor Party in government which first recognised the value and the need for this type of assistance when it allocated moneys under its Dairy Adjustment Program to assist viable dairy farmersfinancetechnological improvements such as conversion to bulk milk vats.",79

166,Mr KEATING,BROADCASTING STATIONS LICENCE,"The provision for carry-on finance in the new scheme is also a welcome addition. There are factors which, from time time, lead tofinancialdifficulties for a farmer, which are completely outside his control, the actions of foreign governments in operating restrictive quotas on beef as has occuned Japan and the United States of America. In these critical periods the fanner often raising carry-on finance from existing commerHouse cial sources at interest rates which do not prejudice his long term viability. Carry-on finance may be desirable in these circumstances to avoid the long term economic costs of unnecessary resource movements out of the industry where the need exists to hold resources in that industry in the shon term. The welfare measures announced under the household suppon provision also receive the suppon of the Opposition. Having seen more than 2000 farmers on the dole in its time of ure or office, the Government is duty bound to provide suitable welfare proposals to maintain the income of farmers who are judged to be viable, up to the level of unemployment benefit prevailing in the community at large. We do a question however, whether the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) has given consideration to instructing that the recipients of household suppon be referred to the Depanment of Employment and Industrial Relations and the Depanment of Social Security, to alert such recipients to alternative opportunities available outside the rural sector. The Opposition supports the increase in the rehabilitation loan from d by the same kind $3,000 to $5,000. Our criticism of the Government's current approach to rural adjustment as contained in this Bill, as I said earher, relates not to what has been but to what has not been achieved by the legislation in its present form. The Opposition its criticism in four main areas: The of a concrete commitment to adin the Bill. The Opposition intends to move an amendment to the motion for the second reading and to move amendments in the Committee stage. you Those amendments, if carried, would overcome much of our objection to the deficiency of the Secondly, the Bill makes only fleeting reference to special assistance to selected indusand total ignorance of the needs for area measures. Thirdly, no indication is by the Government that it intends expandservices provided by State the Opposition seeks clarification from the Government that the commercial emphasis of rural adjustment assistance to has in fact been strengthened through the interest rate on which these funds will be made such as available to individual applicants. I referred earher to the second reading amendin ment which we proposed to move. It states: has difficulty in . . is. concerned while not opposing the provisions of the Bill the that the proposed agreement is restricted to land based primary industries. In other words matters likefisheriesare not mentioned in the legislation yet there are 16 000 fishermen in Australia with a combined income of about $100m. This is a significant part of primary industry which is not mentioned in the legislation. In the Committee stages we will be moving an amendment to the Schedule of the Bill, to add a new Part 8 headed 'National Rural Adjustment Board'. This amendment will provide for the establishment of a national rural tenadjustment board. The composition of the board will be an executive chairman, 2 part-time members drawn from rural industry, and 2 members nondrawn from the States' rural reconstruction authorities and selected on a rotational basis for term of no more than 2 years. This, of course, is referred to in the Industries Assistance Commission report. The IAC rural reconstruction report was quite specific in its comments on the need for some form of administrative machinery at the national level to co-ordinate, evaluate and plan rural adjustment assistance. In making such a proto posal the Commission has left no doubt about the importance it feels this form of assistance should play in future agricultural policy. There a need to provide a more effective monitor evaluate the progress of reconstruction clients, research the effects of the scheme so it can adapted to changing adjustment needs, and monitor the administration of the scheme at State level in the interest of equitable and sistent treatment for all farmers. Frequent reviews are also necessary to assist the factors first mentioned. The IAC report states that out precluding special meetings between the loans Australian Government and the States, there be under are at least two official meetings a year in all State positionPart authorities. The Opposition regards reviews as essential to maintain reasonable through the present scheme. The flexibility and effectiveness of the scheme. The second area where the Opposition conhas siders the Bill is deficient is its ignorance of proper need for area oriented adjustment measures. A severe market downturn may occur in a rural industry on which the economic perity of a particular region may depend, thus creating problems of adjustment which go far beyond the farm gate. This occurs especially where long term prospects in that industry are not encouraging. The existence of an administrative machinery at the national level could prove useful in tifying the need for specific adjustment provisions measures, and in formulating special areas assistably ance policy in close consultation with the State authorities concerned. No indication has been given by the Minister on how the Government proposes to approach this important aspect of adjustment policy. The IAC report stated the need for adequate counselling services for both viable and nonthis viable producers-bu t it is not Bill. The Commission also considered that existing State extension services and appropriate Commonwealth departments be expanded to cater for the counselhng needs of farm families. There appears to be no provision made by Government to advise rural producers of the new provisions of the scheme, to extend the - cilities of State extension services to assist advise applicants in filing applications, or to provide follow-up advice on management to farmers remaining in the industry. For those assessed as non-viable a need exists to ensure that those people are adequately counselled on alternatives outside of farm production give them some future other than in agriculture. The Bureau of Agricultural Economics found that inadequate counselling was a major is factor in the scant use of the rehabilitation proto visions under the old rural reconstruction to scheme. What is the point of having these be schemes if people are not adequately counselled to about them. The Labor Party in government the placed particular emphasis on this aspect of conadjustment assistance, with special purpose allocations to broaden the scope of State extension services to include farm management advice. withWith regard to the rates of interest on which made available to rural producers A provisions of the scheme, the Opregular being built intoconcerned is still the that concessions are notion of farm viability Labor Party acknowledges that in setting target percentages for the various Part A provisions the Government moved to ensure that a more consistent apthe proach will be taken by the States in allocating moneys, thereby reducing inequities and inconsistencies in the treatment of farmers between prosStates. However, the IAC was most exphcit in recommendation S of its report when it stated that 'the long term bond rate be the basic rate of interest for loans made for rural adjustment'. For the sceptics, the reference for this is page 79 of the report. The Opposition notes that the Government idenhas made loans to the States under the relevant of the scheme at 7 per cent, considerbelow the long term bond rate at the moment and, of course, nothing like what it will be below the bond rate when interest rates blow their brains out following the Government's devaluation decision. We seek clarification from the Minister as to the rate of interest likely to be charged reconstruction applicants by the State authorities for adjustmentfinance,and whether rate is likely to be substantially below the mentioned in the long term bond rate. The Opposition is also concerned that too much flexibility in the administration of the scheme at the State level may lead to inequitable the treatment of farmers between the States. It should be noted that considerable discretion is fagiven each State authority in fixing the rate of and loan repayment and in adrninistering particular loans so that flexibility should permit relevant authority to suspend reduce them in the first years of the applicant's That adjustment. In summary, the Opposition's attitude to the issue of structural adjustment assistance is clear. is The Labor Party acknowledges the capacity of the rural sector to adjust autonomously to changes in its economic environment. it is apparent that there are factors which have inhibited the adjustment process, considerable economic and social cost to the individuals affected and to the community as a whole. These factors, of course, include the morather bility of some rural capital, the limited availfor Blaxland ability of jobs in rural areas off the farm, and a should not have natural reluctance and, in some cases, inability to of relocate. The Labor Party takes the view where the costs associated with structural adjustwould hardly benefit the rural industry. ment are excessive, the Government has the sponsibihty to use its resources to facilitate the process of structural change. We prefer this type sition, of assistance to the myriad of and concessions which have typified the policy of ation of rural adjustmentindustry our opponents. I particularly mention the good ate schemes-the rural reconstruction old National Country Party which, over a period the of time, has encouraged people to move into various sectors of agricultural activity and has fostered over-production. With a change in the introduces world market and the domestic market such support people have found themselves on uneconomic Agreement farms-farm s which were not viable. Finally we found that they had a welfare problem on their hands. This is what comes of a shabby approach farmers to farm policy simply in support of electoral aims and endeavours or, to put it in its crudest pohcies for votes. Rural industry is confronting Government policy makers with difficult choices. However, the alternatives available are clear. At the national level we can continue to pursue protecport? tionist policies which only aggravate the probin lems we intend to solve in the sectors or we can adopt the constructive approach of the Labor party which is to formulate long term restructurin ing policies which will eventually reduce this tor's dependence on protective forms of assisttion. ance. The Labor Party's goal is to pursue which will improve the productivity and mobility Farm of rural resources, and to secure long term strategies growth and efficiency in the rural sector. In our opinion, the Government has given instandards. adequate consideration to developing adjustThe ment assistance as an important tool of agriculoption-ofF-farm tural policy. It continues to pursue policies are not in the long term interest of the sector, for its neglect in this important area of policy the stands well and truly condemned. Mr Deputy repayments or Speaker, I move: all words after 'that' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'while not opposing the provisions of the Bill the House concerned that the proposed agreement is restricted to land-based primary industries.' As I indicated earlier, we will move a substantial However, amendment in the Committee stage.",81

However, the Bill a new concept, and that is household assistance. Part 7 of the Schedule to the purpose of contained in the Bill states that the household support is: To provide assistance for up to one year to non-viable having insufficient resources to meet living expenses and who are in need of assistance to alleviate conditions of personal and family hardship while the farmer considers form, whether to adjust out of farming. It is upon this form of assistance that I wish to concentrate my remarks. Why should the Parhament of the Commonwealth of Australia introduce this new concept of household supOn a number of occasions I have referred this House to the depressed state of the dairy and beef sectors of rural industry in Australia, in 8 articular in the MCMUlan electorate of Victoria, 13 January 1976 the Industries Assistance secCommission issued a report on rural reconstrucPart of that report was devoted to housepolicies hold support. The IAC stated: families can adopt a number of different adjustment in order to stay on the farm under the pressure of declining net farm income. These include off-farm work, drawing on savings, or accepting lower incomes and living IAC then gave an example of the first work. In quoting statistics prewhich pared by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics and in a report on a survey of rejected debt reconit struction applicants in 1975 it was shown that 42 per cent of Tasmanians who had been rejected for debt reconstruction were working off the farm. A more recent survey this year, to which have previously referred in this House, that the Presbyterian Church of Australia in Victoria in a survey of farmers in central Gippsland, showed that 65 per cent of farm familiesfindit necessary to seek work away from the farm least one member of the family. This social effectannum on the family is best demonstrated by quoting number of examples which are contained in that report. These are separate individual examples from each family whichfiguredin the survey. One said: The worse feature of the moment is fact that milking and my wife is working, who looks after the children until the wife gets home? Another said: My wife is almost full-time farm worker. This employed 3 men SO hours per week. Present employee down to 40 hours. The children have to help quite a lot. I quote a third example: Our son has been working on the farm for 4 years the economic problem he has had to find work away means that his work has to still at school. Also I have had to find work to support fanuiy over these winter months. Before this we were run our farm as a paying concern but not now with prices. A fourth quotation is: Without my wife's wages I could not afford to work farm. Again I quote: My son has for the last 2 years been running the farm shares but owing to the price and the season we cannot make particular, it pay and are both out working at the moment; needless to dairy say our farm is being neglected. Another quote is: My father should not be doing suffered a heart attack, but ploy anyone he is forced to do too much. These are quotations from farmers, the people who are the basis of statistics which we so often quote in this House. I give another example: I have 6 children, I have been unable to work my because of a disability for 8 years. Wages paid have my finances. My son was working for other employment. I have 3 children under 14 years. Our position is desperate and causing a rundown in my wife's health. Thefinalexample which I quote is this: I am working away from farm, coming home only at raisers, weekends as there are few jobs available which I have seeking for 3 months. My wife and family are milking, etc., as our income is at least $3,500 down and with student children, 18,16 and 10 years, find it hard to make ends meet on a farm of 150 acres milking 85 cows with low butterfat prices. It may be of benefit in this debate to state why it is necessary even to consider the introduction a household support system. I refer further to Bureau of Agricultural Economics statistics. On a I per-farm basis, estimated income as at June 1976 of for the 1976-77 year was $7,750 in money terms and $3,611 in real terms. The Bureau released furtherfiguresshowing the net farm income as a return for capital invested, management and for atlabour, in 1974-75 at $9,672 net income per and $9,194 net income in 1975-76. Those a figures drop to $6,545 projected net income for the currentfinancialyear. The decline in farm income has been grossly affected by lack of marketing opportunities overseas. Equally significant were the rapidly rising farm costs. The worse year while I'm out in the past 3 years was 1974-75, when farm 3 youngwages rose by 37 per cent, fertiliser prices by 130.8 per cent and interest rates by 62.7 per cent. The dairy farmer's economic position in the farm past 12 months has been savagely hit. The prois portion of all dairy farmers without income- I emphasise 'without income '-ha s been estimated by the BAE to have increased from 15 per cent to but with 44 per cent between 1973-74 and 1975-76.1 preand it dict that the percentage would have increased be done by the younger children my again this year if one took actual farm income as able to the base, without reference to off-farm income such received by the farmer or a member of his family. The IAC September 1976 report on dairy industry marketing arrangements summarises on the the current position of the dairy farmer in the following terms: Dairy farmers, in common with all other members of the on community,dairy have been adversely affected by inflation. In farmers supplying manufacturing milk have been severely affected because the returns for processed products exported have declined in real terms. Recently, farm costs have risen rapidly as a result of inflation and have been a major factor in causing the substantial deheavy work as he recently cline past 2 in average net farm income which has occurred over the years. because we cannot afford to emThefinancialstatus of the beef farmer is no better. In fact, the beef farmer has been in crisis for not less than 2 years.

And even if beef prices doubled, more than 12 000 beef or 43 per cent of those earning more than half of their been farm incomes from beef, would remain non-viable. Debate interrupted. NA Department of Social Security: Migrant Community Services of Branch-Education-Nuclear Waste-Canberr a Community Involvement Programs-East Timor-Question s Upon Notice",83
169,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Lucock)Order! It being 10.30 p.m., in accordance with the Order of the House of 18 February 1976 I propose the quesuon: That the House do now adjourn.",85
170,Mr INNES,ADJOURNMENT," I rise in this adjournment debate to draw to the attention of the House the proposed demise of the Migrant Community Services Branch of the Department of Social Security. The Department of Social Security has recently conducted a staff utilisation review of its social welfare division. That division has been decimated by the Government's abandonment of the Australian assistance plan and the remnants of the Social Welfare Commission, and further changes are mooted. By far the largest element of the division is the Migrant Community Services Branch, which contains over 40 officers working in the specialised area of post-arrival services for migrants. Mr Deputy Speaker, it is not possible to overrate the importance which the Migrant Community Services Branch has in fact, and in the eyes of migrant people. The Migrant Community Services Branch is the real'ethnic affairs' branch of the Pubhc Service. By contrast with this 40strong branch in the Department of Social Security, the 'ethnic affairs' unit of the so-called Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs consists of a letterhead and about three or four officers rushing around getting in each other's way. This is a farce. All the rubbish that was contained in the Liberal and National Country Parties' propaganda leading up to the election of 1975 led people up the garden path. I repeat that what we got was a letterhead and three or four officers. The future of the Migrant Community Services Branch is a matter of some importance. Yet, incredibly, the staff utilisation review of the Social Welfare Division of the Department of Social Security is in the process of recommending that the branch be disbanded and absorbed into a new structure not recognising a specifically migrant oriented branch. It is my opinion that this would be a most retrograde step, and I am very pleased to see that at least one Minister agrees with me, although there seems to be some difference of opinion. As tomorrow's Hansard will show, Senator Guilfoyle, in answer to a question from Senator Mulvihill in another place, today expressed her unqualified opinion that an identifiable migrant-oriented welfare service needs to be maintained. Let us now hope that she acts on that behef, and that the Migrant Community Services Branch will be allowed to remain, and to remain at its current strength. This is, after all, the only identifiable branch of the Commonwealth Pubhc Seivice which is currently able to develop specific programs for the migrant community. I would like to know why this change has been proposed in the first place. I can think of no reason for it, unless migrant welfare is deemed a less important consideration than minor administrative convenience. If this is the reason, we are faced with a classic instance of self-justifying bureaucracy-bureaucrac y moving under its own impetus and acting in accordance with its own internalised priorities. We well know the zeal with which this Government is wont to do battle with what it deems to be rampant bureaucracy. One hopes it will tackle this instance with the same enthusiasm. Or perhaps the matter is more subtle. Senator Guilfoyle disclaimed any knowledge in the Senate today of the review into the Migrant Commumty Services Branch. Is this really a ploy to take migrant welfare out of that Department without the Minister's knowledge, so that the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, with its four orfiverelevant officers, can establish a monopoly over ethnic affairs? If so, who is behind this Uttle exercise in empirebuilding-the Minister, or over-zealous officers in his Department? If the recommendations of the staff utilisation review are followed, migrants will lose their most valuable channel to the PubUc Service. Such a course of action would serve further to confuse migrants and the PubUc Service as to just who is responsible for ethnic affairs in this countrySocial Security or Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. Perhaps the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Mackellar), who represents the Minister for Social Security in this place, could enlighten us one of these days instead of leading migrants up the garden path and placing them in a situation where they have to rely on a letterhead and four orfiveofficers to look after their needs in this country.",85
171,Mr MARTYR,ADJOURNMENT, I would like to continue on from where I left off last week on the subject of Uteracy and numeracy in schools. This is a matter about which the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Sainsbury) and I are taking some sort of interest. Mr Groom-You are concerned?,85
172,Mr MARTYR,ADJOURNMENT,"Yes , we are continuing to take an interest because we are concerned. This week's Bulletin contains a letter, part of which states: Any observer of the educational scene in Australia, any parent with a number of children who the State educational system very well that literacy and numeracy have been progressively de-emphasised and diluted by the inclusion of numerous laudable-sounding but vague and often meaningless 'aims'. That letter was written by a gentleman or perhaps a lady from the University of Sydney. On the other side of the continent-in my local electorate, in fact-Ann e Matheson writing Swan Express stated: I am damned if I know what to make of the primary school teachersrightnow. They work less hours people in the workforce, get many more weeks off on than the average worker but stiil they are still the standards are not as good as they should be. I would also like to read a small quotation from Sir Mark Oliphant with whom I have not had much agreement about many things in recent cepted years. He said: In the case of education you just cannot educate who hasn't got the basic principles of the three thoroughly drilled into them. And if they don't want it's got to be pushed into them. That leads me to what is the fundamental probhave lem. It seems to me that one of the root causes these problems is the lack of discipline in the classroom and, unfortunately, in the home. There are too many young teachers graduating who have neither the ability nor, apparently, will to instil discipline in pupils. Too much phasis is placed on the irresponsible rights of the individual. The idea that each individual responsibility to society and to those in room with him does not rate highly in the list of priorities in teacher training. Nor does it to be in the list of virtues instilled into children many teachers, or by many parents at home. Everyone who has any contact with am schooling- I do not call it education, which is lifelong process, but schooling-ca n cite shattertry ing instances of illiteracy and total inability press oneself amongst young people who are gaining what should be the benefits of an exattempt tended, expensive schooling. I recently school essays that displayed an incoherence and lack of spelling ability that shocked me, for the children concerned were destined for high school next year. One of my constituents, a visiting teacher in a state school, gave me this telling perience. From essays about a recent visit the class had made, she noted that two salient points among many others had been remembered by the whole class. On inquiring why the first had been remembered, she was told by the class, almost to the child: 'Because you wrote it on board and made us learn it'. On the second, the answer was even more enlightening: 'When you indeed told us this, everyone had to be quiet and we passed through heard you, so we remembered'. within the last 10 years, knows With classrooms where quiet attentiveness while a teacher teaches is a rarity, what hope have children of having fundamentals like good spelling, basic numeracy, and simply reading ability instilled into their young minds? Earlier this year, Mr John Penrose left his job as a lecin the turer at Adelaide College of Advanced Education because he believed Australia was being ruined by this lack of discipline, and that it was than most our schools and educational establishments full pay where that disrespect for authority begins. It is not satisfied and not hard to agree with him. It istimethis country began to realise that certain moral and ethical standards must be acand insisted upon in our schools if schooling is to have a positive influence for good or anybody even to be reasonably successful. Today I Rs honestly wonder whether we are getting anyto learn, thing like our money's worth out of what we spend on schooling. If honourable members ever Ustened-as I have often have-to chilof dren discussing their teachers respect are those who will not stand for any rubbish, who insist on attentiveness in class and on a standard of disciplined behaviour. The teachers the children the laugh at andridiculeare the ones who demand emno respect from their pupils. They do not get it. has a Mr Groom-What did the honourable memthe classber for Holt say the other night? appear Mr MARTYR- I am not interested in what by the honourable member said as I do not have much time left. This lack of discipline extends, I afraid, into too many homes as well as well a into the school. Many good teachers who really to maintain discipline in the classroom find to exthemselves thwarted by parents who simply do not care or by others who consciously resent any by the teacher to shape their child in saw some some civUised measure.",85
173,Mr UREN,ADJOURNMENT," I refertothe recent revelations about the dumping of nuclear waste material at Maralinga in South Australia. I exargue that the facts, as they have been reported, indicate that some very serious questions need to be answered. Therefore, I call upon the Government to appoint a royal commission to inquire into 2 matters: Firstly, any possible infringement of Australia's sovereignty which occurred as a the result of the alleged actions of the British Government and, secondly, the health and vironmental questions raised by these alCurtin legations. There has been a great deal of fusion about these matters. The then Minister Supply chose to infer in his answers to questions on 13 and 14 September 1972 that the nuclear wastes in quesuon were radio active debris associated with British atomic weapons testing the 1950s. But recent allegations provide a dimension to this question. Mr Avon Hudson who worked at Maralinga serious. during the 1960s has claimed that, in the early 1960s, the British Government was secretly the Maralinga atomic test site as a burial ground sovereignty. for waste from nuclear power stations. Mr level Hudson stated during an Australian Broadcastcommission ing Commission interview on 3 December that he was engaged in digging holes and them containers of radio active waste after the holes were filled with sand. Mr Hudson expired. stated that on one of these containers he read the words 'ex-Calder HaU'. Calder Hall was thefirstcommercial nuclear power reactors come on tap in Britain. It was commissioned 1956. There is evidence to suggest that Hudson's story is true. For instance, the waste, it were dumped then, could not have been fromnot the debris resulting from the atomic test program in the 1950s. The last test at Maralinga was ried out on 9 October 1957. Yet these reports suggest that radio active waste was buried least 3 years after the last atomic tests. This cates that the waste cannot have been debris. It should also be emphasised ment of these wastes as described by Mr Hudson indicates that they were high level wastes. further evidence that nuclear power station waste was involved. This is because in misstating atomospheric nuclear tests high level wastes not be recovered. So, these wastes must have concerned. been from spent nuclear fuel. But this is not all. Mr Hudson also claims that Bristol Britannia craft came from England and that the waste buried near the airstrip. This is a further indicaorder. tion that Mr Hudson's story is true and that its implications for Australian sovereignty is serious. During this period the Royal Air Force strategic transport group flew Bristol Britannia aircraft. These aircraft had sufficient range to fly direct Maralinga from Singapore, thus evading any curity. That the wastes were buried hastily and night indicates that this action was not underwell taken with the approval of the Australian Government. I am aware of certain other information conwishes cerning these matters. It appears that further work was done scraping up soil and putting it eninto concrete after the honourable member for (Mr Garland) gave his answers in 1972. conAlso, we have been informed that a bomb or for material from a bomb which failed to detonate has been buried at Maralinga. I have been told also that the Australian Ionising Radiation Advisory Council has been prevented, by a lack in of funds, from studying the existing and future new radiation hazards caused in the area by the improper storage of these wastes. These claims and the evidence supporting them are extremely They imply that previous conservative using governments have not safeguarded Australia's Also, the extreme danger of high nuclear wastes to our environment means that these aUegations and claims require a royal or, at least, a judicial inquiry. placing in Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Lucock)whichOrder! The honourable member's time has one of Mr HASLEM (Canberra) (10.46)-I was to very pleased to hear the Deputy Leader of the in Opposition (Mr Uren) bring to the attention of  if concerning the disposal of nuclear waste.

174,Mr HASLEM,ADJOURNMENT,"This evening I shall talk about the community involvement program which was launched by the National Capital Development Commission on 3 December. The NCDC has to announced moves to involve the Canberra comsemunity in decision making processes on 4 major at issues. The Commission, as honourable members know, is an independent body with very wide ranging powers in relation to the planning of the national capital. The 4 issues which it to raise with the community include: The potential use of undeveloped land in inner Canberra; possible options to change the policies on redevelopment; amendments to the Commission's design and siting policy; and public comment on changes to the present front fence policy. The Commission is asking the community to discuss these matters and to bring its views to the Commission. The Commission has given the community until March of next year to do so. I find that these proposals raise important questions in relation to the future planning of the Australian Capital Territory and particularly in relation to Canberra which is the national capital. The NCDC, having such wide powers is in a position if it likes to use those powers, of being able to do as it likes without asking the community for its comments. The NCDC will have to take a position in the Canberra community as we move towards more responsibility for the Legislative Assembly. I think it is important at this stage to canvass, in relation to the sorts of policies which the NCDC has, just what might happen if local government in Canberra is given greater authority. I suggest that there are 2 major problems in the planning of Canberra. The first problem relates to general issues such as the development of undeveloped land in inner Canberra. This is an issue which settles upon all people of Canberra. The second issue which the NCDC raises within its program relates to design and siting policies which could involve adding a second storey onto a house, adding a flat onto a house and that sort of activity. Such matters affect people who live adjacent to houses or areas where those planning proposals are to take place. I suggest that it is most important that the NCDC has determined and clarified its powers in relation to what it can do. I suggest that it is most important not only that the NCDC should feel that it can discuss such matters with the Canberra community but also that the law should require such discussions. It should give every zen in Canberra therightto appeal against decisions of the NCDC. I suggest that proper planning appeals tribunals be established in the Australian Capital Territory so that the general community, when faced with a wide ranging planning change, can appeal. I refer to such a planning change as the development of the slopes of Mount Ainslie. Also I think that the people of Canberra should have the right to appeal in relation to developments adjacent to their properties to a tribunal which would be completely impartial and which would be expert. These things should be looked at carefully before the Australian Capital Territory receives a wider measure of local government. The NCDC should continue to be independent. It has done a wonderful job for Canberra. Most people would agree that it has built a national capital which is second to none. But it is important that it has some",87

176,Mr FRY,ADJOURNMENT," I remind the House that today is the anniversary of the brutal invasion of East Timor by the forces of Indonesia. It is now 12 months since that almost invasion. At least 60 000 innocent Timorese people have been killed. This information comes from Indonesian sources. The latest information we have from church sources in Indonesia is that thefiguremay be as high as 100 000 casualties. Recently a report was tabled in this House concerning casualties in Lebanon. They were described as horrific. I tell the House that the number of casualties in Timor is at leastfiveor sixtimesas great as the number in Lebanon. So how can we describe the Timorese situation? Let us look at the present position in East Timor, 12 months after the invasion. Our latest information, again from Indonesian sources, is that the Indonesians control only 20 per cent of the area of East Timor. They have established a legacy of hatred between the people of Timor and the Indonesian people. The people of Timor continue to suffer great hardships and privation. They have always had a high infant mortality rate, of around 50 per cent. Now that people are isolated in the hinterland the rate would be much greater. They have extremely poor health and nutrition. They receive no humanitarian aid from any source. Twelve months after the expedition of aggression which set out to create stability in East citiTimor, we find an area of instability which is Ukely to continue indefinitely. What has been the role of the Australian Government and the Australian people? I suggest that it has been one of continuing appeasement of the Indonesian aggression. The situation has now been reached where Indonesia is dictating the policy of the Australian Government. I support that statement with 3 examples-the recent refusal of a visa to enter Austraha for Mr Lobato, the cutting off of Telecom messages from Timor and the abstention from the vote criticising Indonesia's action. Fretilin heroism and the heroism of the Timorese people, their courage and the fine example of their leaders in defying 30 000 Indonesian regular soldiers has won the admiration of liberation movements throughout the world. The dedication of the Fretilin leaders side Timor has also ensured that the issue has been kept alive in the United Nations and in other world forums, despite the efforts of Indonesia to keep the truth from the world. Those efforts included the brutal murder of tralian journalists. The Indonesian Government stands condemned for its brutal aggression against a small and virtually unarmed neighwould bour. It stands condemned for gard for the UN resolution to withdraw and to allow the Timorese people the fundamental of self-determination. It stands condemned for its failure to allow the independent International Red Cross access to that country. We, as Austions tralians, stand condemned for deserting our wartime comrades in their hour of need, for our abject appeasement of Indonesian attacks and for our failure to stand up for the right of Timorese people to an act of self-determination. So today, in remembering the brutal invasion Timor by Indonesia, we should also remember it as a day of national shame when the Austrahan Government sold out its friends in Timor and turned its back on one of the most brutal acts of aggression in modern history.",88

(2) How was this information gained and disseminated to the farmers of Australia. (3) What is his attitude to the criticism of many rural organisation leaders that Australia has been badly served in this matter when compared with the service provided by New Zealand, Canada and the United States of America.",89
183,Mr SINCLAIR,ADJOURNMENT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) to (3) Yes. The European drought has been taken into account as one of the many factors bearing on market prospects in the work of the Department of Primary Industiy and the Bureau of Agricultural Economics andreportedin the normal way, for example through Bureau publications and material made available by the Department. Because it ranks as a single factor in a total and very complex set of conditions related to market opportunities, no specific papers on the drought have been issued and I would not have expected this. It may be of interest to the Honourable Member that no criticism of the kindreferredto in the question has been expressed to me or to my Department by any rural organisation leader. Auditor-General's Report 1975-76 Mr Garrick asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: (1) Is the extensive number of examples of wastage and discrepancy, brought to light in the Repon of the Auditor General for 197S-76, a result of Public Service mismanagement, or, as has been suggested, illegal management.

184,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ADJOURNMENT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The examples of wastage and discrepancy referred to in the Auditor-General's Repon were due to variety of factors.

I have already indicated what happens at the operating level. Where there is a more serious departure or a failure to correct a minor deviation within a reasonabletime,the Auditor-General's Office writes formally to the depanment concerned and the depanment is bound to advise the Auditor-General's Office that the matter has been rectified or what progress is being made to do so. Thefinalstep is inclusion of the matter in the Auditor-General's Repon. The elimination of waste and inefficiency in the Commonwealth Public Service is a constant aim. To this end, the Treasury has followed its normal practice and initiated follow-up action in relation to various criticisms and significant observations made in the Auditor-General's Repon. Quite apan from the role of the Auditor-General, the Treasurer has responsibility for ensuring that Treasury Regulations and Directions provide for sound accounting procedures. Where it is established that these are defective, appropriate action is taken to amend them. The Public Service Board has a continuing responsibility under the Publice Service Act for the efficiency ana economy of the Public Service and, in accordance with its statutory responsibilities, takes such action as is necessary as aresultof the Auditor-General's Repon or as a result of its own observations.

Children normally attend for 3-5 half day sessions each week. Children attending pre-school are cared for by the pre-school during thetimethey are in attendance, and in this way pre-schools may contribute to child care needs of families. Some pre-schools include provision for children to attend on an extended sessional basis, while a small but growing number of pre-schools operate a full day care service in association with the sessional pre-school service. Similarly, some pre-schools are used for outside school hours care, including holiday care programs. Australian Sports Institute Study Group (Question No. 1355)",92

Rationalisation of National Railways Services Mr Wallis asked the Minister for Transport, a view upon notice: (1) What will be the effect on Australian National Railways employees as a result of the rationalisation of passenAurora ger train services on lines operated by the Railways. (2) In particular, what will be the effect dining car crews stationed at Port Pirie. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable Railways. member's question is as follows: Australian National Railways have advised that at a meeting of the Commissioners of agreed to rationalise the East/West passenger services in order to reduce the very high costs applicable to these services. Daily passenger services will continue to operate between Port Pirie and Perth. These will comprise four single consist 'Indian Pacific' and three single consist 'Trans-Australian' services per week. In previous years some passenger services have operated at comparatively low occupancy rates resulting in poor stall usage. The proposed rationalisation of services made possible by decreased passenger demand that is, dining and sleeping car crews stationed at Port Pirie. The effect on these employees will be that overtime will be reduced, and in some cases will disappear. No employees will be retrenched. Captain Cook's Landing Place at Kurnell",94

(2) Was it approved by 89 to IS, with 10 abstentions. (3) Which countries were in each category. (4) Did Australia explain its vote; if so what was the explanation. Mr Newman-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Declaration of Principles Vancouver Declaration on Human Settlements, 1976 Habitat: United Nations Conference on Human Settlements Aware that the Conference was convened following recommendation of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment and subsequent resolutions of the General Assembly, particularly resolution 3128 (XXVIlI) by which the nations of the world expressed their concern over the extremely serious condition of human settlements, particularly that which prevails in developing countries. Recognising that international co-operation, based on principles of the United Nations Charter, has to be developed and strengthened in order to provide solutions world problems and to create an international community based on equity, justice and solidarity, Recalling the decisions of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, as well as the recommendaqualitative tions of the World Population Conference, the United a Nations World Food Conference, the Second General Conpractical ference of the United Nations Industrial Organisation, the World Conference of the International Women's Year; the Declaration and program of Action adopted by the sixth special session of the General Assembly of the United Nations and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States that establish the basis of the New national Economic Order, Noting that the condition of human settlements largely determines the quality of life, prerequisite for the full satisfaction of basic needs, such as employment, housing, health services, education and recreation, Recognising that the problems of human settlements are not isolated from the social and economic development of countries and that they cannot be set apart from existing unjust international economic relations, Being deeply concerned with the increasing difficulties facing the world in satisfying the basic needs and aspirations of the peoples consistent with principles ofhuman dignity, Recognising that the circumstances of life for vast staff numbers of people in human settlements are unacceptable, particularly in developing countries, and that, unless positive and concrete action is taken at national and international levels to find and implement solutions, these conditions are and likely to be further aggravated, as a result of: given Priority A in the DepartInequitable economic growth, reflected in the wide dispanties in wealth which now exist between countries and between human beings and which condemn millions of people to a life of poverty, without satisfying the basic requirements for food, education, health services, shelter, environmental hygiene, water and energy; Settlements Social, economic, ecological and environmental deterioration which are exemplified at the national and in(Question No. 1607) ternational levels by inequalities in living conditions, social segregation, racial discrimination, acute unemployment, illiteracy, disease and poverty, the breakdown of social relationships and traditional cultural values and the increasing degradation of life-supporting resources of air, water and land; World population growth trends which indicate that numbers of mankind in the next 25 years would double, thereby more than doubling the need for food, shelter and all other requirements for life and human dignity which are at the present inadequately met; Uncontrolled urbanisation and consequent conditions of overcrowding, pollution, deterioration and psychological tensions in metropolitan regions; Rural backwardness which compels a large majority of mankind to live at the lowest standards of living and contribute to uncontrolled urban growth; Rural dispersion exemplified by small scattered settlements and isolated homesteads which inhibit the provision of infrastructure and services, particularly thoserelatingto water, health and education; Involuntary migration, politically, racially, and economically motivated, relocation and expulsion of people from their national homeland, Recognising also that the establishment of a just and equitable world economic order through necessary changes in the areas of international trade, monetary systems, industrialisation, transfer of resources, transfer of technology, and the the consumption of world resources, is essential for socio-economic development and improvement of human settlefor ment, particularly in developing countries, Recognising funher that these problems pose a formidable challenge to human understanding, imagination, ingenuity andresolve,and that new priorities to promote the dimensions to economic development, as well as new political commitment to find solutions resulting in the implementation of the New International EconDevelopment omic Order, become imperative: I. Opportunities and Solutions 1. Mankind must not be daunted by the scale of the task ahead. There is need for awareness of andresponsibilityfor Interincreased activity of the national Governments and international community, aimed at mobilisation of economic resources, institutional changes and international solidarity the improvement of which is a by: (a) Adopting bold, meaningful and effective human settlement policies and spatial planning strategies realistically adapted to local conditions; (b) Creating more livable, attractive and efficient settlements which recognise human scale, the heritage and culture of people and the special needs of disadvantaged groups especially children, women and the infirm m order to ensure the provision of health, services, education, food and employment within a framework of social justice; (c) Creating possibilities for effective people in the planning, building and management of their human settlements; (d) Developing innovative approaches in formulating and implementing settlement programs through more appropriate use of science and technology and adequate national and international financing; (e) Utilising the most effective means of communications for the exchange of knowledge and experience in the field ofhuman settlements; (0 Strengthening bonds of international co-operation bothregionallyand globally; (g) Creating economic opportunities conducive to full employment where, under healthy, safe conditions, women and men will be fairly compensated for their labour in monetary, health and other personal benefits. 2. In meeting this chaUenge, human settlements must be seen as an instrument and object of development. The goals of setdement poUcies are inseparable from the goals of every sector of social and economic life. The solutions to the lems ofhuman setdements must therefore be conceived as an integral part of the development process of individual nations and the world community. 3. With these opportunities and considerations in mind, and being agreed on the necessity offindingcommon principles that will guide Governments and the world comand munity in solving the problems of human setdements, the Conference proclaims the following general principles and guideUnes for action. II. General Principles 1. The improvement of the quaUty of Ufe is thefirstand most important objective of every human settlement policy. These policies must facilitate the rapid continuous improvement in the quaUty of Ufe of all people, beginning with the satisfaction of the basic needs of food, shelter, clean water, employment, health, education, trainunder ing, social security without any discrimination as to race, colour, sex, language,reUgion,ideology, national or social origin or other cause, in a frame of freedom, dignity social justice. 2. In striving to achieve this objective, priority must given to the needs of the most disadvantaged people. 3. Economic development should ofhuman needs and is a necessary means towards achieving a better quality of Ufe, provided that it contributes to a equitable distribution of its benefits among people and nations. In this context particular attention should be paid the accelerated transition in developing countries from mary development to secondary development activities, and particularly to industrial development. 4. Human dignity and the exercise of free choice consistent with over-all pubUc welfare are basicrightswhich must be assured in every society. It is therefore the duty of aU people and Governments to join the struggle against any form of by colonialism, foreign aggression and occupation, domination, apartheid and all forms of racism and racial discrimination referred to in the resolutions as adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations. 5. The estabUshment of settlements in territories occupied by force is Ulegal. It is condemned by the international community. However, action still remains to be taken against the establishment of such settlements. 6. Therightof free movement and the right of each individual to choose the place of settlement within the domain of his own country should berecognisedand participation by all safeguarded. 7. Every State has the sovereign and inaUenablerightto choose its economic system, as well as its political, social and cultural systems, in accordance with the will of its people, without interference, coercion or external threat of any kind. 8. Every State has therightto exercise fuU and permanent sovereignty over its wealth, natural resources and economic activities, adopting the necessary measures for the planning and management of its resources, providing for the protection, preservation and enhancement of the environment. 9. Every country should have therightto be a sovereign inheritor of its own cultural values created throughout its history, and has the duty to preserve them as an integral part of the cultural heritage of mankind. 10. Land is one of the fundamental elements in human settlements. Every State has therightto take the necessaiy steps to maintain under pubUc control the use, possession, disposal andreservationof land. Every State has the right to plan andregulateuse of land, which is one of its most importantresources,in such a way that the growth of population probcentres both urban and rural are based on a comprehensive land use plan. Such measures must assure the attainment of basic goals of social and economicreformfor every country, in conformity with its national and land tenure system and legislation. 11. The nations must avoid the pollution of the biosphere the oceans and should join in the effort to end irrational exploitation of all environmentalresources,whether nonrenewable orrenewablein the long term. The environment is the common heritage of mankind and its protection is the responsibility of the whole international community. All acts by nations and people should therefore be inspired by a deep respect for the protection of the environmental resources ofhuman beings upon which Ufe itself depends. and 12. The waste and misuse of resources in war and armaments should be prevented. All countries should make a firm commitment to promote general and complete disarmament strict and effective international control, in particular in thefieldof nuclear disarmament Part of the resources thus released should be utilised so as to achieve a better qualand ity of Ufe for humanity and particularly the peoples of developing countries. 13. AU persons have therightand the duty to participate, be individually and collectively in the elaboration and implementation of policies and programmes of their human lead to the satisfaction settlements. 14. To achieve universal progress in the quaUty of life, a more fair and balanced structure of the economic relations between States has to be promoted. It is therefore essential to to implement urgently the New International Economic Order, pribased on the Declaration and Programme of Action approved by the General Assembly in its sixth special session, and on the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States. 15. The highest priority should be placed on the rehabUitation of expelled and homeless people who have been displaced by natural or man-made catastrophes, and especially the act of foreign aggression. In the latter case, all countries have the duty to fully co-operate in order to guarantee that the parties involved allow thereturnof displaced persons to their homes and to give them the right to possess and enjoy their properties and belongings without interference. 16. Historical settlements, monuments and other items national heritage, including reUgious heritage, safeguarded against any acts of aggression or abuse by the occupying Power. 17. Every State has the sovereign right to rule and exercise effective control over foreign investments, including the transnational corporations-withi n its national jurisdiction, which affect directly or indirectly the human settlements programs. 18. All countries, particularly developing countries, must create conditions which make possible women and youth in poltiical, economic and social activities, particularly m the planning and implementation of human settlement proposals and in all the associated activities, on individual the basis of equalrights,in order to achieve an efficient and should be to full utilisation of available human resources, that women constitute half of the world population. 19. International co-operation is an objective and a common duty of all States, and necessary efforts must therefore be made to accelerate the social and economic development of developing countries, within the framework of favourable external conditions, which are compatible with their needs and aspirations and which contains the due respect for the sovereign equaUty of aU States. III. Guidelines for Action 1. It is recommended that Governments organisations should make every as set out in the following guideUnes: 2. It is theresponsibiUtyof Governments to prepare spatial strategy plans and adopt human settlement policies to guide the socio-economic development efforts. Such policies must be an essential component of an over-all development stratskilled egy, Unking and harmonising them with policies on industeed. trialisation, agriculture, social welfare, and environmental and cultural preservation so that each supports the progressive improvement in well-being of all mankind. 3. A human settlement poUcy must seek harmonious and integration or co-ordination of a wide including, for example, population growth and distribution, employment, shelter, land use, infrastructure and services. Governments must create mechanisms and institutions to develop and implement such a policy. 4. It is of paramount importance that national and interply national efforts give priority to improving the rural habitat. In this context, efforts should be made towards the reduction of disparities between rural and urban areas, as needed tweenregionsand within urban areas themselves, for a harof monious development ofhuman settlements. 5. The demographic, natural and economic characteristics of many countries, require poUcies on growth and distriment bution of population, land tenure and localisation of prowhole. ductive activities to ensure orderly processes of urbanisation and arrange for rational occupation of rural space. 6. Human settlement poUcies and programmes should define and strive for progressive minimum standards for an disparities acceptable quality of Ufe. These standards will vary within ous and between countries, as well as over periods of time, and tion therefore must be subject to change in accordance with conregions ditions and possibilities. Some standards are most appropriadopt ately defined in quantitative terms, thus providing precisely tween defined targets at the local and national levels. Others must urban be quaUtative, with their achievement subject to felt need. At supplemented the sametime,social justice and a fair sharing of resources demand the discouragement of excessive consumption. 7. Attention must also be drawn to the detrimental effects of transposing standards and criteria that can only be adopted by minorities and could heighten inequaUties, the of misuse of resources and the social, cultural and ecological should be deterioration of the developing countries. 8. Adequate shelter and services are a basic human right which place an obUgation on Governments to ensure their attainment by aU people, beginning with direct assistance to the least advantaged through guided programs of self-help and community action. Governments should endeavour to remove all impediments hindering attainments of these goals. Of special importance is the eUmination of social and racial segregation, inter alia, through the creation of better balanced communities, which blend different social groups, the full integration of occupation, housing and amenities. 9. Health is an essential element in the development of the and one of the goals ofhuman settlement poUcies improve environmental health conditions and bearing in mind basic health services. 10. Basic human dignity is therightof people, individually and collectively, to participate directly in shaping the poUcies and programs affecting their Uves. The process of choosing and carrying out a given course of action for human settlement improvement should be designed expressly to fulfil thatright.Effective human settlement policies require a continuous co-operative relationship between a Government and its people at all levels. It is recommended that national Governments promote programs that will encourage and assist local authorities to participate to a greater extent in and international national development. effort to take urgent action 11. Since a genuine human settlement pohcy requires the effective participation of the entire population, recourse must therefore be made at aU times to technical arrangements permitting the use of aU humanresources,both skilled and unThe equal participation of women must be guaranThese goals must be associated with a global training program to faciutate the introduction and use the techother in a nologies that maximise productive employment 12. International and national institutions should promote institute education programs and courses in the subject variety of components, ofhuman settlements'. 13. Land is an essential element in development of both urban and rural settlements. The use and tenure of land should be subject to public control because of its limited supthrough appropriate measures and legislation including agrarianreformpoUcies-as an essential basis for integrated rural development-that will facilitate the transfer of econbeomicresourcesto the agricultural sector and the promotion the agro-industrial effort, so as to improve the integration and organisation of human settlements, in accordance with national development plans and programs. The increase in the value of land as a result of public decision and investshould berecapturedfor the benefit of society as a Governments should also ensure that prime agricultural land is destined to its most vital use. 14. Human settlements are characterised by significant in Uving standards and opportunities. Harmonidevelopment of human settlements requires the reducof disparities between rural and urban areas, between and within regions themselves. Governments should policies which aim at decreasing the differences beUving standards and opportunities in urban and nonareas. Such poUcies at the national level should be by poUcies designed toreducedisparities between countries within the framework of the New International Economic Order. 15. In achieving the socio-economic and environmental objectives of the development of human settlements, high priority should be given to the actual design and physical planning processes which have as their main tasks the synthesis of various planning approaches and the transformation of broad and general goals into specific design solutions. The sensitive and comprehensive design methodologies related to the particular circumstances of time and space, and based on consideration of the human scale should be pursued and encouraged. 16. The design of human settlements should aim at proelimination viding a living environment in which identities of individuals, families and societies are preserved and adequate means for maintaining privacy, the possibility face-to-face interactions and public participation in the decision-making process are provided. 17. A human settlement is more than a grouping of people, shelter and work places. Diversity in the characteristics human settlements reflecting cultural and aesthetic values must be respected and encouraged and areas of historical, religious or archaelogical importance and nature areas special interest preserved for posterity. Places especially in areas of expanding human settlements, should be provided and recognised and religious needs of different groups in accordance with freedom of religious expression. 18. Governments and the international community should facilitate the transfer of relevent technology and experience and should encourage and assist the creation of endogenous technology better suited to the socio-cultural characteristics and pattern of population by means of bilateral or multilateral agreements havingregardto the sovereignity and interst of the participating States. The knowledge and experience accumulated on the subject of human settlements should be available to all countries. Reasearch and academic institutions should contribute more fully to this effort by giving greater attention to human settlements problems. 19. Access should be granted, on more favourable terms, to modern technology, which should be adapted, as necessary, to the specific economic, social and ecological conditions and the the different stages of development of the developing countries. Efforts must be made to ensure that the commercial practices governing the transfer of technology are adapted to the needs of the developing countries and to ensure that buyers' rights are not abused. 20. International, technical andfinancialco-operation by the developed countries with the developing countries must be conducted on the basis ofrespectfor national sovereignty and national development plans and programs and designed to solve problemsrelatingto projects, under human settlement programs, aimed at enhancing the quality of life of the inhabitants. 21. Due attention should be given to implementation conservation and recycling technologies. 22. In the planning and management of human settlelong ments, Governments should take into consideration all perother tinent recommendations on human settlements planning scribe. which have emerged from earlier conferences dealing with the quality of life and development problems which affect it, starting with the high global priority represented by the transformation of the economic order at the national and international levels (sixth and seventh special sessions), the environmental impact ofhuman settlements (Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment), the housing and sanitary ramifications of population growth (World Popusus. lation Conference, Bucharest), rural development and need to increase food supply (World Rome) and the effect on women of housing and urban development (International Women's Conference, Mexico with City). 23. While planning new human settlements or restructuring existing ones, a high priority should be given to the promotion of optimal and creative conditions ofhuman coexistence. This implies the creation of a well-structured urban space on a human scale, the close interconnexion of the different urban functions, the relief of urban man from intolerable psychological tensions due to overcrowding and chaos, the creation of chances ofhuman encounters and the of urban concepts leading to human isolation. 24. Guided by the foregoing principles, the international of community must exercise its responsibility to support national efforts to meet the human settlements challenges facing them.

(4) Yes; the text of the explanation was as follows: Mr Chairman, like others the Australian Delegation of regrets very much the circumstances which compelled us to vote against the Declaration.

Like others our principal concern was over Art. 4 Part II its apparent effort to maintain the link between racism and Zionism and the endorsing of the definition of racism contained in UNGA Resolution 3379. Australia's position against racism and racialism is well known; so, Mr Chairman, is our position on Resolution 3379. Mr Chairman there were other points on which we hoped negotiation would ease our problems-bu t these would not have caused us to vote against the Declaration as a whole. At the same time. I feel bound to say that the very amount of time obUged to be spent served to diffuse and divert time which, in our opinion, should more properly have been spent on the specialist matters before this Conference. We support fully the intent of these technical paragraphs, but would respectfully say that had our energies been more directed to them, the whole document would have been brought to a greater degree of precision, clarity, credibUity and consequent world wide acceptabiUty.

Mr Killen-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (2) and (3) Monthly strength variations of-43, - 1, -66 and +27 since June 1976 are too small to be meaningful. As recruiting is seasonal it is expected that strengths will decline in periods of lowrecruiting-such as the latter part of the year. Theresultsofrecruitingefforts during 1976 have been quite satisfactory. Total enlistments in the Permanent Defence Force for the six months ending October 1976 numbered 3927, an increase of 236, or 6.4 per cent, on enlistments for the same period in 1975. Similarly re-engagement rates are continuing at satisfactory levels.

TU . „„„..,„ , „ Malcolm Fraser-The answer to the M M m Mr honourable member s question is as follows: (1) to (5) I am advised that the answer to this question would involve an expression of legal opinion. Questions have arisen over the years regarding the respective roles of Minister and Permanent Head of a Department. It can reasonably be expected that questions of this kind will be satisfactorily resolved by the Minister concerned with his Permanent Head. The recommendations of the Royal Commission on Government Administration have some relevance for this general subject and in that connection the Government will be considering whether any amendment of the Public Service Act is desirable. (6) and (7) These questions appear to refer to the opinion given by the Solicitor-General on 20 June 1975 in connection with proposed overseas loan raisings by the previous Government. That opinion was tabled in the House on 9 July 1975 (Hansard, page 3582). Price of Beer in Victoria Mr E. G. Whitlam asked the Attorney General, upon notice: Before he answered my question without notice on 22 September 1976 (Hansard, page 1284) had he considered the extent to which existing Federal legislation would prevail over any Victorian legislative or administrative action which purported tofixa minimum price for beer. Mr Ellicott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Prior to answering the honourable member's question of 22 September I had seen Press reports about possible Victorian legislation tofixa minimum price for beer and I had given preliminary consideration to whether Federal legislation would be inconsistent with and invalidate legislation of this character. I had not however seen a copy of any proposed legislation. The honourable member's question of 22 September was of course directed to State legislative or administradve acts purporting to fix a minimum price for commodities which for the purposes of considering inconsistency is materially different from State legislative acts purporting tofixa minimum price for beer. Qantas Boeing 747 Aircraft Mr Morris asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice: (1) On how many occasions have Qantas Boeing 747 aircraft suffered engine failure since their purchase. (2) What were the dates of those failures, and what were the causes. (3) How many cycles had the engines operated since new and since overhaul in each case. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Qantas Boeing 747 aircraft have suffered 47 engine failures since their purchase up to the end of June 1976. The criterion for assessment as an engine failure is one also used overseas and is an in-flight shut-down which on subsequent investigation was considered to be attributable to the failure or damage of a component pan of the basic engine. (2) The dates of those failures, the total engine hours and the attributable cause in each case are as follows: 4.10.71 - 266 hours - Pressure sense line cracked. 22.7.72 - 1 132 hours - Turbine blade failure. 26.12.72 - 2 352 hours - Turbine blade failure. 13.1.73 - 1410 hours - Fuel pump changed. 30.4.73 - 2 596 hours - Foreign object damage bird ingestion. 7.9.73 - 2 690 hours - Lay shaft housing cracked. 13.10.73 - 3 865 hours - Fuel control unit changed. 15.10.73 - 4 299 hours - Turbine blade faUure. 6.12.73 - 3 872 hours - Constant Speed Drive carbon seal chipped causing excessive oU loss. 7.2.74 - 5 764 hours - Pressure ratio bleed control andflowdivider changed. 15.2.74 - 6 200 hours - Turbine disk cooling duct nozzle failed. 24.2.74 - 5 934 hours - Turbine'vanes cracked. 2.3.74 - 5 096 hours - HydrauUc pump carbon seal defective. 14.4.74 - 5 739 hours - 15th stage duct clamp adrift. 22.4.74 - 5 451 hours - No. 3 bearing faUure.

(3) Engine hours are listed in pan (2). Cycles are not readUy avaUable for these failures but may be estimated using an approximate relation of 3.6 hours per cycle. Cycles since overhaul are not appUcable because the engine is not overhauled in the normal sense but rather each module of the engine is subject to specified maintenance at particular periods. Canberra Day Care Centres Mr Fry asked the Minister for the Capital Territory, upon notice: (1) Does his Department staff at the Civic and Manuka occasional day care centres by 50 percent.

One proposal being examined wouldreorganisethe staffing of the centres to provide improved management and operauon. This would require the substitution of an administrative position at each centre for the Teacher-in-Charge position which is very largely concerned with adnunistrative duties. (2) Any changes made in the staffing at occasional care centres will be based primarily on the interests of ACT. children and their parents.
