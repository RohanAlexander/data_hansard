Debate resumed from the 8th November (vide page 2039), on motion by Mr . LYONSThat the bill be now read a second time. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committeeClause 1 agreed to. Clause 2(l.) The operation of the Committee of Public Accounts Act 1913-1920 is hereby suspended.",11
27,Mr NAIRN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Perth) [ 3 . 1 7 ] - I m o v e That after the word "" suspended "" the words ""until the end of the financial year 1932-33"" be inserted. The suspension proposed under this clause is for an unlimited time, which is tantamount to abolishing the committee altogether. That, I consider, would be a doubtful step and quite an .exceptional procedure. Nearly all legislatures have committees of this character. The British Parliament has several, larger than the Public Accounts Committee of this Parliament, which exercise important functions in investigating and advising the Government on financial matters. It seems to be agreed by honourable members who have occupied seats in this chamber for some time that the Public Accounts honCommittee has in the past done valuable work. I believe also that there is great scope for useful work to be done by such a Committee, provided that it is properly selected.and that its numbers are not too great. It should be able to in vestigate any matters referred to it by the Government, and to undertake other important inquiries on its own in ative. This is a drastic bill, because it proposes to suspend the committee for an unlimited time unless a resolution is passed by both Houses of the Parliament restoring it . I understand that the only object of this legislation is to make some saving. Of course every saving, however trifling, is of importance at the present time; but I maintain that the Public Accounts - Committee should not be permanently suspended.",11
28,Mr LYONS,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Wilmot-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [3.20] - I am not much concerned whether the amendment is carried or not, because provision is made in the bill for the restoration of the committee, not by act of the parliament, but by resolution of both Houses. The act itself readsAs soon as conveniently practicable after the commencement of the act and thereafter at the commencement of the first session of every parliament, a joint committee of nine members of the parliament to be called the Joint Committee of Public Accounts (in this act referred to as the committee) shall be appointed according to the practice of the ment withreference to the appointment of members to serve on joint select committees of both Houses of the Parliament. The act provides that at the commencement of every Parliament the committee shall be appointed. B y not making this appointment we are thus flouting the act unless we suspend its operations. That is the justification for this legislation. W it hout this amending legislation, at the beginning of the next Parliament, the Parliament, unless it is prepared to flout the act again, must immediately appoint a public accounts committee. I suggest that we pass this clause as' it stands and if , at the beginning of the next session, there is a feeling on the part of any substantial section of honourable members that the committee should be restored, I undertake to give them an opportunity to discuss the matter. That would obviate the automatic appointment of the committee whether or not that was desired by honourable members.  under this amending bill, to appoint the committee by resolution of both Houses, say, next month?",12
29,Mr LYONS,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Yes . Suppose that the Parliament reassembled, as one honourable it i - member has suggested, on the 1st February next, the committee could be restored by resolution of both Houses of Parliament. But that would not be possible if the amendment were accepted, because it provides for the suspension of the committee u n t i l the end of the financial year.",12
30,Mr GREGORY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Swan) [ 3 . 2 3 ] - I support the amendment of the honourable member for Perth (Mr N a i r n ) . The objection to the proposal of the Prime Minister is that any honourable member who suggests that a resolution of both Houses should be passed in favour of the restoration of the committee is likely to be charged with trying to obtain a job on the committee. It would be far better if , at the end of a certain period, the matter should again come before Parliament. That is the object of the amendment. The greatest objection to these committees is the enormous number of members that have been appointed to them-te n on the Public Accounts Committee, and nine on the Public Works Committee, and all receiving travelling parlia- expenses. If the membership of each committee were limited to five, I think that better work could be done, although there is no doubt that the committees have done good work in the past. At the present moment, the Government is wise in seeking to suspend the operations of the Public Accounts Committee. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Title agreed to.

SECOND READING .  ter for the Interior) [ 3 . 2 8 ] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. The amendments proposed in this bill are purely formal and merely provide for the alteration of the words "" No r t h Australia "" and "" Central Australia "" wherever they occur in the principal act, to "" Northern Territory."" When the p r in cipal act was passed by Parliament in 1927, this Commonwealth territory was divided into separate territories under names of "" North Australia "" and "" tral Australia."" These territories since been amalgamated, and the whole tralia "". of this area is now known as the "" Northern Territory."" The act was inhave troduced for the purpose of assisting settlers in the various States and Northern Territory by way of advances in the purchase of wire and wire-netting for the erection of rabbit-proof and supial-proof fences, and the advances been made to settlers at an interest rate of 5 per cent, repayable over a period 25 years. Recently, the rate of interest was reduced to 4^ per cent. So far a3 the States are concerned, power was giveu in the act for prescribed conditions with regard to the advances, to be laid in agreements between the Commonwealth and State Governments. Negotiations were accordingly entered into with the States, but only two States-Queensland and ""Western Australia-accepted the terms of the agreement. In the case land of the Northern Territory, the machinery for making advances is provided in regulations promulgated by the Commonbeyond wealth. The act has been in operation nearly five aud a half years, and during that period, the total amount advanced to settlers in the States of Queensland tration of the act. and Western Australia and in the Northat thern Territory was £542,166, of slightly less than £700 was paid to settlers in the Northern Territory. No provision was made in the act or the agreements tered into between the States and the Commonwealth for the payment of advances over a specified period. The understanding between the Comno monwealth and the States was that by the department. the advances would be made available for a period of six years. [3.34] Recently, the Government decided that stitute ""Northern advances should be continued during financial year 1932-1933 to an amount exceeding the sum of £146,934, which the amount standing to the credit of trust funds relating to repayments on account of advances made, not only to settlers in all States under the Advances to Settlers Act of 1923, but also to settlers in Queensland, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory under the pf the fullest discussion.

In reply to a question, the Minister informed me marthe other day that a condition of any have advance made by the Commonwealth to the States for the supply of wire or wire of netting, is that the materials shall be of Australian manufacture. There may be no objection to that condition as long as the price and the quality of the materials arc satisfactory. Since a statement made down recently by the managing director of the Australian company which manufactures wire and wire-netting, may have all caused honourable members to conclude that the Australian-made article is much cheaper than that imported from Eng-- Mr SPEAKER (Hon. G. H. Mackay). - Order ! The honourable member is going the scope of the bill.",13

There appears to be two nothing contentious about the measure, and I hope, therefore, that it is not the intention of the Minister to treat it as an urgent measure, or to apply the "" gag."" A measure which deals with the development of the Northern Territory is worthy The bill is another instance of the desire to change legislation already on the statute-book. A previous government appointed a mission to control North Australia, but in .selecting its personnel, men possessing local knowledge of conditions in the territer tory wereoverlooked. The result was that, although the commission cost the country about £150,000, it accomplished nothing. As an outcome of that failure, it is now proposed to revert to the value original form of control.",13

Many of these settlers are situated 600 miles from the nearest railreferred comhead, and they demand some separate form of control. I hope that in the administration of this legislation the Miniswill see that settlers who require wire netting to protect their holdings will not have to wait years for it, as has unfortunately been the case on too many occasions in the past.

49,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [3.52] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. I venture to say that this bill will not occasion any acute controversy. The object of the measure is to extend the operations of the Commonwealth Designs Act to the territories of the Commonwealth, including the territories governed by the Commonwealth under mandate. Legislative action has already been taken to extend the Patents Act and the Trades Marks Act of the Commonwealth to the territories of the Commonwealth. In the case of designs, ordinances are in operation which purport to extend the operations of the Designs Act to the territories of the Commonwealth in an omnibus provision', but no provision exists in the territories for the administration of the act. It is, therefore, proposed under this bill that the legislation of the Commonwealth with respect to designs, shall be extended to the territories in which it is not already in force. The Northern Territory, and the Federal Capital Territory being parts of the Commonwealth, the Designs Act is in force in those territories, but it is proposed to extend the protection given to registered designs to the territories of the Commonwealth, including the territories governed under mandate. That is the whole object and effect of the bill.",15

54,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [3.55] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. The object of the measure is to amend the existing Jury Exemption Act. I 1905, the Commonwealth Parliament passed an act exempting certain persons from service as jurors. These exempin tions include the Governor General, the members of the Federal Executive Countories. cil, justices of the High Court courts established by this Parliament, senators and members of the House of Representatives, members of the Interarising state Commission, which body was operating at that time, the officers of Commonwealth Public Service, and memJuries bers of the Commonwealth Permanent Naval and Military Forces. In 1922, Commonwealth railway servants were exempted. It is the law generally out Australia that officers of the Public Service are exempt from jury service, and, of course, as a general rule, there is no difficulty in obtaining a jury without calling upon officers of the Public Service and thereby conceivably seriously interfering with public administration. But in the Northern Territory, and particularly in the Federal Capital Territory where public servants form a very large proportion of the population, difficulties have arisen through the exemption to of Commonwealth public servants. This the Government considers unlimits the number of persons available in these territories for jury service. The bill, therefore, proposes to limit the exemptions in order that it may be possible for officers of the Commonwealth Public Service in the Federal Capital in Territory and in the Northern Territory to serve as jurors. The bill has been to make it possible to specify the which will still be continued. example, no officer of the Crown Law Department should be called upon to serve a jury because he is so often concerned with the administration of justice. All officers of the Crown Law Department should, in all cases, be exempt from",16
55,Mr ROSEVEAR,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Is there a property qualification for jurors ?,16
56,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I do not think that there is as far as Commonwealth law is concerned; but I should like to look up - the point. It depends on State laws: In the past, there has been little occasion for the Commonwealth to consider this matter because of the fact that it is only occasionally that jury n cases arise under Commonwealth jurisdiction. The administration of criminal law is under the control of State courts except regard to cases that occur in the terriI t is largely in the territories and other that the question arises. - Mr BAKER - The New South Wales Juries Act would apply to the cases in the Federal Capital Territory.",16
57,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"In the Federal Territhe tory that is so. The New South Wales Act does not apply to service as a juror in Commonwealth courts generally, but. it applies to trials for offences in also New South Wales courts of offenders throughagainst Commonwealth laws.",16
58,Mr BAKER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Unde r the. Seat of Government Acceptance Act, New South .Wales laws are made applicable to the Federal Capital Territory except where they are specifically declared not to apply.",16
59,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"That is so. There are certain public officials, such as heads of departments and others, who ought not to be called to serve on juries. If this legislation is approved, it is proposed that a proclamation shall be made specifying the exemptions to obtain in the territories. The original act exempts certain persons from service on juries, whether summoned to serve under a law of the State or of the Commonwealth. It is plain, for example, that a justice of the High Court ought not to be summoned as a juror under either State or Commonwealth law. The original act provides for general exemptions, and it is proposed in this amending bill that these exemptions shall be limited in the case of public servants. I propose in committee to make the position clear by substituting in clause 2 for the words "" a person "" the words "" an officer of the Public Service of the Commonwealth"". The other exemptions will remain as they are, but in the territories, pipblic servants will not exempt as a matter of course from obligation to serve as .jurors.",17
60,Mr SCTJLLHT,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Yarra) [4.5] - I do not like the way in which the Government proposes to make exemptions. It was in my mind to move the amendment which the Attorney-General (Mr. Latham) has foreshadowed, because it would be impracticable to exempt from service in the Federal Capital Territory public servants who form so large a proportion of the population. I believe, however, that the exemptions which the Government proposes to make should be set forth clearly in the bill. It would be just as easy to put them in the bill as to make them the subject of a proclamation. It is wrong to frame legislation in such a way as to permit a government to issue a proclamation exempting any class of citizens from serving on a jury empanelled in connection with a specific case. I do not suggest for a moment that the Government has drawn up this.bill with any ulterior motive, but we should so frame our legislation as to place it, as far as possible, beyond the power of any future government to abuse it in the course of administration.",17
61,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,The Government has no intention of leaving the way open for the form of abuse to which the right honourable member has referred.,17
62,Mr SCULLIN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I am sure of that, but the Attorney-General must see that the danger exists. If this bill is passed in its present form, it would be possible, when a case. affecting, say, a public servant, was to come before the court, for the government by proclamation to exempt all public servants from serving on the jury; or if the case affected a grazier, a proclamation might be issued exempting all other graziers from serving on the jury",17
63,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,That would be a wrong thing to do.,17
64,Mr SCULLIN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"It would. It is equally wrong to leave an opening for such wrong-doing. I am not certain that the present list of exemptions contained in the act would not be sufficient after the amendment suggested by the Attorney General has been incorporated. The list includes the Governor General, members of the Federal Executive Council, justices be of the High Court and other courts, members of interstate commissions, members of the Permanent Naval, and Military Foixes and employees of the Commonwealth Railways.

The impanelling juries should be free from the suggestion the jury. of government interference. Although the Government's intentions may be perfectly innocent, the fact that the Executive have power to exempt certain perjudgment sons from service merely by makposition. ing a proclamation may be interfluenced preted as meaning that the Gonot vernment, is trying to rig the jury list. In no State, so far as I know, has the Government power to vary the jury list by proclamation from time to time, the Commonwealth Government should not possess that power either.",18
74,Mr BEASLEY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"West Sydney) [4.12]. - The Leader of the Opposition- (Mr. Scullin) objected to the provision in bill empowering the Executive by prowould clamation to excuse certain persons from service on juries, stating that if a public servant were charged before a court with an offence, the Executive might exempt public servants from service on the jury. The principle might be extended to include posal ? political persons charged with offences. The Government might issue a proclamation stating that no member of the politijurors cal organization to which the accused limited. belonged would be eligible to serve on the jury, and we must not forget that this would apply, not only to Canberra, but to the Northern Territory as qualification well. The Attorney-General has not the jury list. stated what qualifications will be required to make citizens eligible to serve [80] jury. The jury system is, perhaps, more and important now than ever it was. Conditions are changing rapidly, and legislation passed years ago is not always applicable present-day conditions. In the Sydney the Morning Herald it was stated recently that the Deputy Premier of New South Wales declared at a party conference that to he was prepared to break any law if , in his opinion, it was necessary to achieve It is evident, therefore, that political parties which are opposed to labour are, in certain circumstances, prepared to break the law if it suits their purpose. In the territories a case may be before the be court affecting some one connected with transport department. It may be quite right to exempt the head of the department, but that does not remove the danger of the case being prejudiced against the accused if another officer of of that department is allowed to serve on I take the view that any officer employed in that department would be, to some extent, prejudiced as regards will that particular case or would have his in some way influenced by his We are all, to some extent, inby our environment, and I do pretend that a man can remain entirely unaffected by conditions pertaining to his employment, and I think that such a person should be ineligible to serve and on a jury. The Attorney-General has said that officers of the Crown Law Department will be excused from serving on juries. We would naturally expect such officers to be exempted because most the of the cases heard before the courts be launched from that department. But if the cases in which exemptions were desired are so few-it would be possible, I suppose, to count them on thefingersof all one hand-wh y should members of the Public Service be included in this pro",18

80,Mr BEASLEY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I was unaware of that provision in the Queensland law, and I see no objection to its adoption by the Commonwealth. It is, I think, advisable to widen the scope of jurors so as to ensure a panel of"" disinterested persons available for these special duties. The jury system is a very important one.",19
81,Mr ROSEVEAR,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,It is more important than the law itself.,19
82,Mr BEASLEY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Because of the economic pressure on the various sections of society, possibly the jury system is more important today than ever before in the history of the Commonwealth. It is therefore undesirable to limit the selection in any way. The generally accepted practice in British communities is to place no obstacles in the way of accused persons having a fair trial and of proving their innocence. For this reason the list of jurors should be as wide as possible so as to safeguard the best traditions that are associated with the laws of this country, and establish a greater measure of respect and, if I may say so, ensure the acceptance of the law.",19
83,Mr THORBY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Calare) [4.19] - I gather from the remarks of the Attorney General (Mr Latham) that the intention of the Government is to widen the scope of the authorities in selecting juries to serve on trials in the various territories under the administration of the Commonwealth, and I understood him to say that the number of eligible persons in the territory is so limited that it is difficult to secure a panel of suitable persons. I appreciate the difficulties that confront the administration of the - law in such circumstances, but suggest that while the Government may be quite sincere in its desire to increase the number of persons eligible to serve on juries, this amending provision would enable any other government to restrict, possibly to a dangerous degree, the list of available jurors. It would, I believe, be a dangerous weapon in the hands of an unscrupulous ministry. No one can say what government may be in power in the Commonwealth during the next five, ten, or twenty years, and because of that uncertainty, it is inadvisable to place such a far-reaching power in the hands of any administration. In certain small communities, it is not unusual for the views of its members to be generally known, and under this amending provision such persons could be excluded from serving on juries. In New South Wales there is a special list from which the panel of jurors is drawn for trials involving technical details.",19
84,Mr NELSON,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,There is a similar provision in all State laws.,19
85,Mr THORBY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I cannot speak for the practice in States other than New South Wales. I happened to be in the Parliament of that State when the act was amended, and provision was made for the compilation of a special list of jurors. I appeal to the Attorney-General to givfl the House some assurance that it will not be possible for any future government to use this proposed amendment of the law in the way I have suggested.",19
86,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"After having heard the views of honourable members, I am willing - to provide that exemptions shall be made by regulations, which either House of the Parliament may disallow if it disapproves of them.",19
87,Mr SCULLIN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,If Parliament is not sitting it will have no control over the regulations.,19
88,Mr THORBY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,The Minister's assurance will go a long way to remove the objection which I have to the bill.,19
89,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Unde r the New South Wales aet of 1912, members of the Public Service are exempted, and there is a provision that other persons may be exempted by the Governor in Council.",19
90,Mr THORBY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Because of the danger that this amendment might be abused by a future government, it is desirable that the position should be safeguarded in every possible way.",19
91,Mr NELSON,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Wort horn Territory) [4.25] -- I am definitely of the opinio* that the exemptions should be specified, .otherwise this amendment of the law might be used for party purposes. I am not sure that the alternative suggested by the Attorney-General (Mr Latham), .namely, that the exemptions shall be made by regulation, will entirely meet the objections that have been raised to the bill, because a government with majorities in both chambers could amend the jury list by regulation, and the regulation would not be disallowed by either House. If the exemptions were specified there would not be the same probability of the intrusion of party politics. Although it is a fundamental principle of British justice that a man is entitled to be tried by his peers, trial by jury in territories administered by the Commonwealth is, in actual practice, limited to capital offences. Naturally, small communities become parochial in their outlook. For this reason, possibly, the jury system is operated with some difficulty. In the Northern Territory, the citizens may be divided into three sections - the pastoralists, the workers, and the public servants. If this amending bill is passed in the present form, and if a case affecting a public servant were listed for trial, it would be competent for the Minister, if he desired to sheet home the charge to the person concerned, to exempt public servants from serving on the jury. A similar procedure could be followed in cases affecting the pastoralists or the workers.",19
92,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,This amendment deals only with public servants.,20
93,Mr NELSON,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"It appears to me to be much wider than that. The bill should specifically mention the class of persons proposed to be exempted. If this is not done, a future government may use this measure for party political purposes. The Attorney-General would be well advised to accept the suggestion made by the Leader of the Opposition, and specify the persons proposed to be exempted.",20
94,Mr BAKER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Oxley) ' [4.29] - In all States it has been found advisable to exempt certain sections of the community from serving on juries. Prior to federation, the State laws exempted certain classes of people. The inauguration of the Commonwea.lth led to a riumher nf new appointments, such as, for example, the Governor General, members of the Federal Executive, justices of the High Court of Australia, members of the Commonwealth Parliament, members of the Commonwealth Public Service, and others. AH those persons, under the State laws as they existed then, were eligible to serve on juries. For that purpose the Jury Exemption Act of 1905 was brought into being. The Seat of Government Acceptance Act of 1909, provided that all New South Wales laws should be applicable to this Territory. The Seat of Government Administration Act of 1910 contained a similar provision, but declared that certain New South Wales Acts were non-applicable to the Territory. The Jury Act of New South Wales was not one of these, and it is at present applicable to the Federal Capital Territory. It provides exemption from serving as jurors to professional men such as pharmaceutical chemists, barristers and other sections, while The Jury Exemption Act provides additional exemptions. The Government has advanced good reasons for its desire to alter the principal act. The members of the Opposition have no objection to the principle involved, but it disagrees with the manner in which the Government proposes to implement its desires. Originally it was intended that the Jury Exemption Act of 1905-1922 should be null and void in this Territory, except that a proclamation might be made by the Governor General as to which of the persons mentioned therein should be exempt from serving as jurors. That meant that the Governor General was to be given the power to decide whether the Governor General himself, federal ministers, High Court justices, honourable senators, members of the House of Representatives, members of the Interstate Commission, members of the Commonwealth Public Service, members of the permanent Naval and Military Forces of the Commonwealth, and permanent Commonwealth railway employees should be exempt from serving as jurorp in the Territory. If , through an Oversight, the Governor General did not proclaim that justices of the High Court, or honourable senators or members of the House of Representatives . should be exempt, tliey would all be liable to summoned to serve on a jury in Canberra. The Attorney-General (Mr Latham) now intimated that the power given to Governor General shall not be nearly wide; that only members of the Public Service shall be liable to be called to serve as jurors in this Territory, that, instead of the exemptions being claimed, they shall be made by regulatherefore, tion. That is an improvement, it would still make it possible Governor General, who acts upon the vice of his Ministers, to determine which section of the Public Service shall be exempt. Por example it might be posal thought that officers of the Parliament, officers concerned with the administrabers tion of justice in the Territory, departthat mental heads and others should be exempted. It should, however be an easy matter to provide for those exemptions in black and white in this measure itself. If , as the honourable gentleman has intimated, the Government has not yet considered the question, should be possible to postpone the , debate until after the dinner adjournfere ment, and embody the exemptions in the measure. Then there would be no - crimina possibility of this or any other Governhonorable ment being invested with the power to determine whether a large or a tion small section of the community in the Federal Capital Territory shall be citizen. entitled to sit upon a jiiry to hear the trial of another resident here. I believe that before long, it will advisable for the Government to consider the whole method of administering the Territory, particularly in regard to legal administration.",20
95,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,I can inform the honorto stand aside. able member that that is being done. I hope to pla.ee the Government's proposals before the House shortly.,21
96,Mr BARER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"If . it were not for the - fact that the Jury Exemption Act was necessary to exempt the persons named in it in other parts of Australia as well in the Territory, these exemptions could have been provided by ordinance which would merely mean that the matter would be decided by the Governor General. The method of governing this Territory by ever, ordinance, which has existed since 1910, has resulted, in the promulgation of be :Volume of ordinances, comparable only with the volume of amending legislation has that has been found necessary in New the South Wales since that time, for only so the New South Wales Acts up to 1910 applied to the Territory. No amendments upon to New South Wales law passed subseand quent to that date could have force in prothe Federal Capital Territory. It would, be wise for the Government to but reconsider the whole position. for the Mr LATHAM (Kooyong-Attorney adGeneral) [4.36] - Honourable members have said, accurately, that this is an important subject. I am glad that the prohas provoked discussion, but I am inclined to think that honourable memhave exaggerated the possible dangers may arise from the bill, even if it be not amended as I have just suggested. It has been said that if power is left to the Government to determine who shall be exempt, either by reference to specified individuals or by the prescription of classes of individuals, it will be possible it for the Government to exclude persons from serving on a jury and thus to interwith the administration of justice. There are two classes of cases concerned, l and civil. I should imagine that members who have spoken on the subject had in mind the administraof the criminal law, and were thinking particularly of the protection of the",21
97,Mr SCOLLIN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Not necessarily.,21
98,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"At least some honorbe able members had that aspect in mind. I remind honourable members that the Government already possesses the necessary power to exclude any class of persons from serving as jurors in a criminal trial, because the Crown can order any juror",21
99,Mr GANDER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,It s right of challenge is not unlimited.,21
100,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,It has unlimited power in that respect ,21
101,Mr GANDER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"So that, in the Northern as Territory, the Government could bar the whole of the members of the Australian Workers Union from serving as jurors.",21
102,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I cannot conceive such a disastrous thing happening. Howthat has nothing to do with this bill. Under the law in Australia, in a criminal a trial the Crown Prosecutor has an unlimited right to order any persons to stand aside. The defence, on the other hand, is limited in relation to its right of challenge. The position as a rule is that a certain number of challenges is allowed without cause assigned. After that, speaking generally, there must be an assignment of cause. ""With few exceptions all criminal prosecutions before a jury are conducted by or on behalf of the Government. So that, actually, the Government is in control of the prosecution, and if it desires to exclude an individual or class of individuals from serving as jurors, it possesses the necessary power. That power is not and cannot be affected by anything that this bill will accomplish if passed. It is not suggested that that power is abused. As to the civil side, it is difficult to believe that any government would take special action to secure a particular jury by excluding any one from that jury.",21
103,Mr SCULLIK,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Is there any other legislation similar to this?,22
104,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"There is. The law of New South Wales applies in many respects to the territory. Section 5 of the New South Wales Jury Act of 1912 provides exemptions for a number of persons who are specified. The amending act provides 22 classes of exemptions, and the Victorian act 32 classes of exemptions. Dealing with the Public Service, the New South Wales act exempts persons holding offices in the departments of the Colonial Secretary, Surveyor-General, and the Treasury, and in the Audit Office. Paragraph o readsSuch other persons holding office or being in the Public Service tis the Government exempts from service on juries, either generally or for a limited period, of which exemption notice shall be given to the sheriff. So that precise precedent has been in force since 1912. At the same time. I do not think that we should be bound by precedent in a matter like this; we should legislate to provide what we think is best. I do not refer to that precedent for the purpose of asking the House to confer similar power on the Governor General in connection with this measure; but I suggest that, instead of providing that the Governor General may make these exemptions by notice in the Government Gazette, the matter should be done by regulation. It would then of necessity be reported to Parliament and it would be open to any honourable member in either House to move for a disallowance of the regulation. I am aware that when Parliament is not sitting the regulation would be in force for the period of the recess, without an opportunity to have it disallowed-that consideration has a certain amount of weight - bu t from a practical point of view the position would be sufficiently safeguarded. It would be rather inconvenient to determine once and for all those persons in the Public Service who are to be exempt from serving as jurors.",22
105,Mr MAXWELL,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Would these exemptions ever be likely to be a matter of urgency ?,22
106,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I cannot conceive that any government would make an exemption in relation to a particular proceeding. That would be quite wrong. If this bill is passed, I undertake that the required regulation will be prepared immediately and tabled before the House rises.",22
107,Mr BEASLEY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Coul d it not be provided in the bill that no such regulations shall be issued except when the House is in session?,22
108,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"It is a matter of administrative convenience, and I ask the House to entrust the Government at least with this limited power. I assume that every honourable member will agree that heads of departments ought to be exempt. Take, too, the case of the head of a subdepartment, for instance the pensions branch of the Treasury or that of an important officer of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. I admit that it is desirable to give honourable members an opportunity to consider the matter in relation to the various departments of the Public Service. The suggestion that I make would enable that to be done. I have already pointed out that the administration of criminal justice cannot really be affected. So far there is no substance in the suggestion that a government might wrongfully use its powers. That reduces the question to the case of civil trials, and the bare possibility of a government making a wrongful regulation while the House is not sitting. I suggest that any government would hesitate a long while before laying itself open to the charge of maladministration of its powers in such a way. W it h the incorporation of the amendments that I suggest, I ask the House to accept the bill. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee: Clause 1 agreed to.

I am pleased that the Attorney-General (Mr . Latham) has so reasonably met the points that have been raised, because big prin ciples are involved. The right of the Parliament to review is a very important one, and it will be preserved by the provision relating to the making of regulations. It is true that, should the House not be sitting, some little period will elapse; but such contingencies have to be faced in dealing with practical propositions. The principal point is, that the amendment relating to officers of the Public Service limits the power of regulation to such officers, and that this amendment compels the making of regulations, in stead of the matter being dealt with by proclamation.",23

Between the sittings of the Parliament, restrictions could be imposed without check. Mr LATH '.M - As soon as the Parliament met, any regulations made would have to be tabled.",23

But the conditions may be righted-w e hope that they will be-and we may again experience lengthy recesses. Although the position could be reviewed when the Parliament met, such action would be belated, because a man who had been convicted would be serving a sentence, or one found guilty of a capital offence would have been hanged. In such a case, no good purpose would be served by disallowing a regulation. The circumstances are dissimilar from those that prevail in any of the States. The calls that are likely to be made upon persons liable to serve should be well known.",23

115,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [4.56] - I undertake to see that a regulation is in form awaiting the passage of the measure by another place, so that it may be issued immediately, and thus furnish honourable members with an opportunity for the discussion of any proposed exemption. I admit that I am reluctant to accede to the suggestion of the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) to introduce the practice of making regulations only while the Parliament is in session. The pressure upon parliaments is so great at the present time, and the necessity for dealing with details by immediate action is often so pressing, that, despite the criticism recently directed against government by regulation and the like, I am afraid that no parliament will be able to avoid conferring in some cases the power to make regulations. Of course, matters of principle should, as far as possible, be dealt with in the body of a measure; that has always been my belief. In view of the assurance that I have given, honourable members might accept the amendment. Amendment agreed to.

121,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [5.3] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. Recently, the attention of the Government has been directed by the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear), and by other honourable members, to the case of a person who was convicted of an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, and who then appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal of the State of New South Wales, which held that it had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. The convicted person then appealed to the High Court of Australia against that decision, but the judgment of the New South Wales court was upheld. The High Court has no general right to entertain a criminal appeal; but, in special circumstances, leave may be given to appeal in a criminal case. Section 68 of the Judiciary Act is the provision which deals with the general subject of the applicability of the laws of the various States in proceedings in relation to Commonwealth laws and persons charged with offences under federal laws, Sub-sections 1 and 2 of this section provide1. The laws of each State respecting the arrest and custody of offenders or persons charged with offences, and the procedure for(a) their summary conviction; ami (i>) their examination and commitment for trial on indictment; and (c) tlieir t r i a l and conviction on ment: and for holding accused persons to bail, shall apply and be applied so far as they are applicable to persons who are charged with offences against the laws of the Commonwealth committed within that State, or whose trial for offences committed elsewhere may lawfully be held therein. 2. The several courts of a State exercising jurisdiction with respect to(a) the summary conviction; or (6) the examination and commitment for trial on indictment: or (o) the t r i a l and conviction on indictment: of offenders or persons charged with offences against the laws of the State shall have the like jurisdiction with respect to persons who are charjred with offences against the law's of the Commonwealth committed within the State, or who may lawfully be tried within the State for offences committed elsewhere. The effect of those sub-sections is that when a person is charged with an offence against a federal law. for which he may be tried within a State, the law of the State applies with respect to summary proceedings, examination, and commitment for trial, and to trial and conviction on indictment ; but there is no provision in the Commonwealth law that the law of the States giving the right of appeal in criminal matters shall apply in the case of a conviction for an offence Mr Latham. against a federal statute. When the Judiciary Act was passed in 1903, there were no Courts of Criminal Appeal. There were in the various State statutes provisions for reserving points of law and the like, and provisions for hearing what are called Crown cases reserved, and under section 72 of the Judiciary Act, it is provided that questions of law may be reserved by the court before which a person is tried for the consideration of a full court of the High Court, or of a full court of the Supreme Court of a State. The present position is that in the case of persons charged with an offence against a federal law, who are tried before the Supreme Court of a State in the ordinary course, there may v be a reservation of a point of law; but there cannot be an appeal in the ordinary sense. All the States have instituted Courts of Criminal Appeal. The first, I think, was established in New South Wales in 1912. It appears only just that a person convicted under a federal law should have the same right of appeal as a person convicted under a State law. A indictlong time elapsed before the principle of appeal in criminal case's was recognized at all. Provision in this regard was made in Great Britain in 1907, and since then, beginning in 1912, provision has been made in all the States for that purpose. This bill is very simple in its terms. It provides that there shall be added to section 68 of the principal act the provision that the laws of each State, and the procedure thereunder, shall apply in relation to the hearing and determination of appeals arising out of a trial or conviction under federal law or out of any proceedings connected therewith, and the State courts are given jurisdiction in accordance with the provisions of the laws of the respective States. This bill simply confers on a person convicted under federal law the same right of appeal as he would have if he were convicted under State law. I submit that it is proper and just that this amendment of the principal act should be made.",24
122,Mr ROSEVEAR,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Dalley) [5.12] - All honourable members, I presume, will welcome this innovation in regard to the right of appeal. It seems remarkable that since 1912 the States have had Courts of Criminal Appeal, and yet persons convicted under a Commonwealth law have not had a similar right of appeal to that of persons convicted under a State law. I am interested in a couple of cases under federal law, and one in particular, in which appeals were lodged in both the State Court and the High Court, and were rejected on the ground that there was no jurisdiction to deal with them. I wish to know if these persons have exhausted their right of appeal by reason of' the fact that their applications have already been rejected.",25
123,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I should say, almost certainly, that the time available to them for appeal having expired, they would not now be able to appeal. It would be rather difficult to deal with such a case because this Parliament is unable directly to amend State law and procedure. If there are special provisions in the State law which allow consideration of exceptional circumstances, it may be possible to take advantage of them, after the passage of this bill.",26
124,Mr ROSEVEAR,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"There is, of course, that possibility; but I suggest to the Attorney-General, who probably knows more about the law than does anybody else in the House, that while this bill is under discussion, consideration might be directed to providing for the cases to which I have called attention. I have no desire to canvass the rights or wrongs of one particular case that I have in mind; but the convicted perron has taken proceedings aud has appealed to both the State Courts and the High Court, and, like most litigants, he is firmly convinced of his ability to establish his innocence. He has been in gaol for six months of the period of two years for which he was convicted, and his appeal has been defeated by reason of the fact that the High Court has no jurisdiction to hear it. It seems unfortunate that on that account this man has been, and will be, denied a right to which he is clearly entitled, not because he had not intended to appeal 'or that his appeal was an afterthought, but merely because he had been prosecuted under a Commonwealth statute, and was, therefore, deprived of the right of I strongly urge the Attorney-General to agree to the insertion in this bill of a retrospective provision covering such a case as that to which I have referred. Various Commonwealth acts dealing with crimes have contained retrospective provisions, and ' I can see no reason why we should not insert a retrospective provision dealing with appeals. I do not ask for an unlimited provision of this kind. I realise that it might be absolutely necessary to fix a time limit for appeals in certain cases; but seeing that this bill provides the right of appeal, I think it not unreasonable to ask that a man convicted of an offence under the Commonwealth law who has appealed against his conviction and had his appeal rejected on the ground that the court had no jurisdiction to hear it, but is still serving his sentence, should be granted the right of appeal. It could not be argued, if this were done, that persons would appeal simply because there was a right of appeal, nor could it be said that they had appealed previously in the knowledge that this bill was to be introduced. Now that we are accepting the principle of the right of appeal we should not deny an appeal to certain persons who appealed thinking that they had the right to do so, - and had their appeals rejected on the ground of lack of jurisdiction. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee: The bill.",26
125,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [5.20] - I shall consider the request of the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear), but I think he will recognize' that there is a difficulty in this Parliament doing anything which purports to amend State law. ""Where, unfortunately, a peison has failed in an appeal on legal grounds and is out of time for prosecuting further proceedings there are very real obstacles to doing what he desires. However, I undertake to see, before the bill is passed through the Senate, whether there is a possibility of conferring appellate jurisdiction on a State court, in a limited class of cases, such, for example, as that of a person actually serving sentence who has, in appeal. effect, given notice of appeal.

126,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [5.22] - I move'.That the bill be now read a second time. This bill relates to the general Crimes - Act of the Commonwealth which deals T/ith many offences against Common""w.ealth law including those relating to the ^administration of justice, ' coinage, forgery, offences by and against public officers, breaches of official secrecy, the like. I find that there is a general misunderstanding, which is sedulously to act? fostered in some quarters, that the Crimes Act consists entirely of certain conwith, troversial provisions inserted in it by Parliament about six years ago. Those provisions are not the only ones it tains. Part HA.., which has a character quite its own and is distinct from other portions of the measure, is headed ""Protection of the Constitution and Public and other Services."" It contains the provisions relating to unlawful assothe ciations and to certain interferences with interstate trade and commerce and the performance of duty by certain servants of the public. In particular circumstances there is the possibility, undo: this part act. of the act, of the deportation of convicted offenders. There is a great deal of difference of opinion as to meritorious nature of the provisions Part HA . iSpeaking generally, an offence under the act can be prosecuted by any person, but there is room doubt as to whether it is or is not to a member of the public to institute ceedings in respect of offences relating the Constitution, the Public Service, interstate trade and commerce, and thrii'l, like; and it is highly desirable, in the opinion of the Government, that this doubt should be removed and that Attorney-General only should be given power to prosecute under these particular provisions. Section 13 of the act provides thatUnless the contrary intention appears in act or regulation creating the offence, person may(a.) institute proceedings for the ment for trial of any person spect of any indictable offence against the law of the Commonshould wealth (6) institute proceedings for the summary conviction of any person in respect of any offence against the law of the Commonwealth punishable on summary conviction. The object of this bill is to provide that offences under Part IIA . shall not be prosecuted either summarily or upon indictment without the authority of the Attorney-General or some person authorized by him.",27
127,Mr ROSEVEAR,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Would the Government agree to a provision that the and Attorneys-General of the States as well as of the Commonwealth should be able,27
128,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"No ; we are dealing federal law. There is also a special this provision in this part of lh-.< act which gives probative effect to averments conmade on behalf of the prosecutor. 11 was never intended that this provision should the be available to a private prosecutor. Having regard, therefore, not only to the of nature of the offence, but also to the possible consequences of deportation of person in the case of some offences, the Government considers that it should be placed beyond all doubt that only the Attorney-General shall have power to institute proceedings under this part ci i;ue ",27
129,Mr MAXWELL,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"If the government of the the day had sympathy with curtain of offenders to such an extent that its Attorney-General would not prosecute, would prosecution by any other person for for such an offence be impossible? oporv Mr LATHAM - Yes . So long as the proaverment provision remains in the act, to with the possible consequf ntial deportation of a convicted person, which, after is at the will of the Attorney-General of the day, the Government considers that it is proper that nil such prosecutions ihe should brinstituted by the Attorneythe General. As the offences are, in the most general sense, against law and order, and as the act has been drafted to avoid anything which is merely in the nature of a repression of opinion, and is directed to the wards special aotion in the case of activiany ties which are directed towards the overthrow of orderly government, I suggest committhat the Government of the day, which is in rein charge of the affairs of the country, accept the sole responsibility of ""enforcing that portion of the law; and that it should not he open to a member of the public to institute such proceedings. I hope that the bill will be agreed to.",27
130,Mr BAKER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Oxley) [5.29] - The object of this bill is to amend what is really the criminal code of the Commonwealth. Part HA . of the Crimes Act, which was inserted in 1926, is particularly obnoxious to the members of the Labour party. A number of amendments were made to this part of the act only a - few mouths ago. An appeal is at present in process in our courts by a man named Devanney in which it is being contended that three sections of Part HA . are ultra vires the Constitution. In these circumstances, I suggest ..that the Govern' ment would have been wise had it withheld this bill until that case has beeti determined - The debate on this bill will be of",28
131,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Nothin g in this bill can affect that case.,28
132,Mr BAKER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"That is not my point, Seeing that we are being asked to amend the Crimes Act and that there is a possibility that other sections of it may need amendment in consequence of the proceedings at present before the High Court, the Government could well have withheld this bill for a few days and thereby, perhaps, have avoided the necessity for introducing at an early date another bill to amend the act still further. As Part HA . of the act contains dangerous provisions to which members of my party are opposed, we are certainly in favour of the modification which the Attorney General has proposed. We should welcome any amendment to make this law , less objectionable to the community and less inimical to political freedom, particularly having regard to the fact that under section 30R it is merely necessary for an informant to make an averment whereupon the onus of disproof is placed on the defendant. We have always contended that that is opposed to a fundamental principle of British jurisprudence. Section 69 of the Judiciary Act providesIndictable offences against the laws Commonwealth shall be prosecuted by indictment in the name of the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth or of such other person as the Governor General appoints in that behalf. Therefore, I cannot see the need for this provision that prosecutions under Part HA . of the Crimes Act shall be only upon indictment by the Attorney-General or by some person acting for him. In 1919, the honourable member for Darling Downs (Sir Littleton Groom), as Acting Attorney-General, filed a prosecution under the War Precautions Act. Counsel for the accused took exception to the indictment on the ground that it was not in the name of the Attorney-General. I u the case R. v. Judd, 26 C.L.R., 168, the High Court held that a Minister, acting on behalf of the Attorney-General, could prosecute. Clearly, the Attorney-General has the right to delegate his power to prosecute. The members of the Opposition will support the bill, but will await an opportunity to repeal the whole of Part IIA .",28

At one stage the New Guard intended, according to information in possession of the police, to cut off the electric light at its source, and adopt other measures to stampede the people into overthrowing the then Labour government in New South Wales. By the proposed amendment of the Crimes Act, a Labour government will not be able to initiate proceedings against that organization for such an offence.",28
134,Mr GREGORY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Coul d it not take action under State legislation?,28
135,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Yes .,28
136,Mr BEASLEY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"But it could not initiate any prosecution under Part IIA . of the Crimes Act. This bill will concentrate all power of prosecution and indictment in the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth. I accept that proposal knowing that with a change of government the task of removing this objectionable law will be made easier. Governments change, and each. Attorney-General will have the opportunity to administer the law according to his understanding of of the the needs and rights of an enlightened democracy. Like the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Baker) I hope that the time is not far distant when a Labour Attorney-General will take action to remove from the statute-book, legislation which a gentleman, who is not a supporter of the Labour party, has declared to be more appropriate to the period of Henry V III . I understood the Attorney-General (Mr Latham) to say that many people were using the averment provisions in a manner that was not in the best interests of the people. This admission strengthens the legal and moral position of those who have fought and will continue to fight against the objectionable Crimes Act. I hope that soon this legislation will be entirely removed from the statute-book, and that democracy will be allowed free scope to work out its own salvation.",28
137,Mr LANE,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Barton) [5.37] - I desire to be clear regarding the effect of this If the Lang planners or communists should, on street corners advocate open rebellion, in the absence of an officer of the law, will a private individual or any organization, such as the New Guard, which desires to uphold law and order, be prevented from initiating a prosecution without the consent of the Attorney General? Ave private individuals and organizations to be deprived of the right to set the law in motion against extremists who advocate the overthrow of the present system of government?",29
138,Mr GANDER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"The New Guard, for instance.",29
139,Mr LANE,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"The New Guard is the most law-abiding organization I have ever known. Revolutionary proposals are reserved for the Lang planners and Communists. I remember years ago a young fellow openly advocating revolutionary action at the instigation of older members of the Industrial Workers of the World. He should have been prosecuted but no officers of the law were present. In such circumstances it should be possible for any person who desires that law and order be maintained to set the law in operation, of course taking the consequences of a wrongful indictment. If the bill deprives citizens of that right, I hope that it will not be supported by the ministerial party.",29
140,Mr HOLMAN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Martin) [5.41] - I urge the Attorney-General (Mr Latham) to consider the objection which has been taken by the honourable member for Barton (Mr Lane). A very real difficulty may arise under this amendment. Under Part IIA . of the Crimes Act all offences which may be regarded as aiming at the overthrow of the Government are brought together and are subject to the averment section. As a safeguard against abuse, the Attorney-Gensral now proposes to confine the use of that section to himself or his successor, so that prosecution by indictment for offences under Part IIA . , which are the most serious offences dealt with in the Crimes Act, shall be initiated only by the Attorney-General or by some person acting for him. Of course, if we were assured that the office of Attorney General would always be held by the honourable member for Kooyong, or by other men who had given satisfactory bill. proof of their attachment to the Constitution, no objection could be taken to this proposal; but,, in seeking to minimize some of the dangers incidental to the averment section, the Government is risking even more serious consequences, in that, with a change of ministry, there might be no prosecutions under Part IIA . of the act. After the proposed amendment has been made, if tha Attorney-General will not act against an offender no one else will be able to do so. I have had so much proof of the care with which the present Attorney-General drafts his bills that I am loath to criticize any measure sponsored by him, but there is a great deal of weight in the objection taken by the honourable member for Barton; and if any alteration is to be made in this portion of the act it should be by an amendment of the averment section rather than by the insertion of a provision which may render Part IIA . of the act nugatory for a period of years.",29
141,Mr WHITE,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Balaclava) [5.42] - I shall be pleased if the Attorney-General (Mr Latham) will explain more fully the scope of the bill. During the police strike in Melbourne a few years ago, many citizens were sworn in as special constables to assist in maintaining law and order.",29
142,Mr ROSEVEAR,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,And they stole goods from the shops they were supposed to protect.,29
143,Mr WHITE,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I was one of the special police. If the honourable member is proud to be associated with men who were gaoled, many of whom belonged to the underworld, he is welcome to such company. In the event of similar civil commotion occurring, would nobody but the Attorney-General have power to initiate a prosecution or could special police or other organizations formed to restore order set the law in motion?",29
144,Mr ROSEVEAR,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Dalley) [5.45] - I have the strongest opposition to the whole of Part IIA . of the Crimes Act. This was originally inserted in the act the purpose of dealing with industrial situations which the Government did have immediate power to deal with i the manner it desired. Since then, the has been amended from time to time make it more and more restrictive. These restrictions have been levelled at persons and organizations not usually associated politically with this Government, but not necessarily of bad repute. The of remarkable argument put forward by the honourable members for Martin (Mr to office. Holman) and Barton (Mr Lane) seems to iniply that they are prepared to dize the liberty of a person merely on evidence of some individual who happens to be at a meeting and hears that person express opinions of which he does approve. The honourable member for Barton considers that if some individual, perhaps with political prejudices against the speaker, at a meeting which is attended by a responsible officer of the law, gives an exaggerated account of what is said, the law should be made so ment section-sectio n 30n. elastic as to jeopardize the speaker's liberty. Actually, the accuser may in every sense be more irresponsible than the accused.' If we are to deal with political offences at all, there should at least some serious attempt made to ascertain whether the charges made have sufficient ground.",30
145,Mr TIIORBY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,The act relates not to political but to criminal offences.,30
146,Mr ROSEVEAR,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"What appears to Government the honourable member to be a criminal offence may to me be a political offence. We object to the principle of Part IIA . the act. The only merit that we can recognize in it is the amendment proposed the by the Attorney-General. That, at least, does what the honourable member for Barplaced ton does not want the act to do. I places upon the Attorney-General the reing sponsibility for any prosecution. He has ever, to be satisfied that the information which he acts upon under this particularly bad law is sufficient to warrant a decision against the accused.",30

148,Mr ROSEVEAR,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"If I have transgressed the rules of the House, I have part done so in ignorance of the standing for order. Our only solace in supporting the amendment is the fact that the not Attorney-General has to be satisfied n that there is ground for a prosecution. act That will save many people from the to embarrassment of being dragged before the court merely on information laid by some irresponsible person. We therefore regard this amendment as the first step towards the cntire.abolititon of Part HA . the act, which will, at all events, take place when the Labour party is returned",30
149,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Kooyong-Attorney jeoparGeneral) [5.50] - The considerations the which have been raised by the honourable member for Barton (Mr Lane), and the honourable member for Martin (Mr Holnot man) were not ignored by the Government when it prepared this measure. At the same time, I admit that there is something to be said for the arguments which unthey have adduced. The main object of the bill I conceded and frankly stated was to prevent the mis-use of the averThe view of the Government strongly held is that the position should be made clear, and that there should be no possibility of the provision being abused by any private be person. Of course, it would be possible to provide in section 30a that in any prosecution for an offence instituted by or with the authority of the Attorney General, the averment should be evidence, and by that limitation of the section, attain the object in view. But the also took the view that, having regard to the general nature of of this legislation, it was probably wise to limit the power of taking proceedings to Attorney-General. There are, in this legislation, provisions which might, if in irresponsible hands, be utilized t as a means of embarrassing and harassindividuals. As a matter of fact, howno one but the Attorney-General has ever instituted proceedings under Part IIA . In fact, I am the only Attorney-General who has instituted proceedings under it. This part of the law was not actively utilized during the tenure of the office of the Late Government-thos e ""who supported that Government had strenuously opposed the passage of this legislationand although at that time it was open to any member of the public to take proceedings, no member of a the public thought fit to do so. As in the case of many other serious offences, the administration of the law is .left in the hands of the Government. I suggest that on the whole, having regard to the nature of the legislation, it is probably wise to adopt the provision which has been suggested. The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) raised a question as to the state of circumstances which existed in Melbourne during a police strike. The relation of the Commonwealth to the preservation of law and order is difficult to define. I again and again found difficulty in the administration of the law because of the fact that, speaking generally, the preservation of law and order is left in the hands of the various States. There is an express provision under which the Commonwealth may protect a State against domestic violence upon application by the Government of a State, but, speaking generally, the preservation of law and order, and the protection of life and property against riot or any other form of interference or violence, are matters which are left in the hands of a 'State. If , for example, there is a orderly meeting, it is almost inevitably a breach of the Police Offences Act of the State concerned. It would be undesirable for the Commonwealth, particularly in the absence of a police force, to undertake any general legislation dealing with disorderly behaviour and so forth. If the Commonwealth were to enter into that sphere it is quite possible that difficulties would arise as between the executive agents of the Commonwealth and those of the States. Honourable members who have followed the recent history of the United States of America, since the introduction of prohibition, must have been impressed with the difficulties that have arisen in the administration of the law, because of two sets of police operating within the same territory. Congress passed a law which affected many details of every day life. It was a law which was objected to by many of the States. Some of them Mr Latham. refused to enforce it ; they refused to allow their police to be used to carry out its provisions.",30
150,Mr LANE,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Onl y three out of fortyeight States took that attitude.,31
151,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Othe r States cooperated with the federal authorities in a half-hearted manner. As a matter of fact, the Central Executive provided a large number of special agents, practically a federal police force, for the purpose of enforcing that federal law. Of course what I am saying has to do, not with prohibition one way or the other, but with the risks and difficulties which arise from the establishment of two police forces operating within the same area. In any legislation for which I have been responsible in drafting or in an. advisory capacity, I have always tried to avoid the necessity for instituting a federal police force to enforce Commonwealth legislation throughout the whole of Australia. The point raised by the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr. White) as to disorderly behaviour of one kind or another within Australia is a matter which I suggest it is wise indeed to leave entirely in the hands of the States. If we assume responsibility in relation to it, there will be a tendency to weaken the responsibility of the States, and it is not practicable for the Commonwealth to exercise such responsibility dis- effectively, Accordingly, I have, always thought it wise for the Commonwealth to stand out of such a matter. In Part IIA . of the Crimes Act, with which this amendment deals, there is a set of provisions directed towards the protection of the Constitution generally and of government as such. Ordinary proceedings for disorderly behaviour and the like ought not to be instituted under cover of a section of this part of the Crimes Act. Those are matters which ought to be left to the States, and it is largely in consequence of that view that this amendment to confine the powers of prosecution to the Attorney General of the Commonwealth is proposed.",31
152,Mr LANE,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Is it not a fact that immediately the financial emergency legislation was put into operation the Lang Government issued instructions to the police not to report seditions utterances?,31

Motion (by Mr LATHAM)-by leaveproposedThat the bill be now read a third time.",32
154,Mr LAKE,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Barton) [6.0] - Havin g heard the explanation of the Attorney General (Mr Latham), I am opposed to this bill being passed through its third reading today. Some months ago, when difficulties arose between the Governments of the Commonwealth and New South Wales, the State police authorities ceased to make their customary reports. Prior to the crisis in New South Wales, reports by the State police authorities were forwarded to the Commonwealth, which took any necessary action.",32
155,Mr THORBY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,That crisis has passed.,32
156,Mr LANE,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Yes ; but similar crises may occur in the future. What we are doing today may make it impossible for action to be taken against any body of men that seeks to overthrow constitutional government. This bill prevents either private individuals or corporate bodies from instituting proceedings in the court against any section of the community which seeks to overthrow law and order and set up its own form of government. Even an organization which preaches sedition may escape punishment because of our action in passing this measure. On a previous occasion, I asked the Attorney General whether he was prepared to take proceedings against certain individuals in New South Wales who were making seditious statements, and he replied that if the facts were as I had stated, suitable action would be taken. If that was a proper answer to my question then, it should be a proper answer today, because I know of no alteration of circumstances to justify any change of attitude in this respect. So far as I am aware, there has been no demand for this amendment. On the contrary, the Government should tighten the provisions of the existing legislation. In every country there are people who are prepared to use force to gain unlawful ends if they think that they can succeed. The Lang Government in New South Wales sought to overthrow law and order, and to place on the statute-book, legislation which was contrary to the wishes of the majority of the citizens of that State. This measure has been sprung on the House without there having been any demand for it. I shall tell the electors that the present Government has betrayed the people of Australia.",32
157,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Order ! The honourable member must withdraw the word ""betrayed.""",32
158,Mr LANE,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I withdraw it. The Government has not lived up to its pledge to maintain law and order. Instead, it has brought forward this amending bill without having even consulted the members of its own party. The Government has no right to spring measures of this kind upon the House. I regret having to oppose the bill: .but I do so in the interests of both private citizens and corporate bodies who may wish to resist other sections of the community which are inclined towards lawlessness. I am reminded of the time when the taxation offices in Sydney were barricaded by the State Government, which also issued a pamphlet defying the federal law. Should history repeat itself, and another State government prove itself unworthy of the trust reposed in it by the people, what would be the position if the Commonwealth Attorney-General refused to take action? In that case, the people of the State would be unable to institute proceedings against the State Government in the courts of the land.",32
159,Mr THORBY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,The people would deal with them under the Electoral Act.,32
160,Mr LANE,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,The honourable member for Calare (Mr Thorby) sees everything from the point of view of the Country party. This is a matter which affects the whole of the people of New South Wales.,32

162,Mr LANE,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,No . Had it not been for the New Guard,32

164,Mr LANE,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I admit that certain bodies in New South Wales took the law into their own hands; but circumstances rendered their action necessary. While I do not stand for such things, I must admit that what they did was a good thing for New South Wales.",33
165,Mr BEASLEY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Does the honourable member stand for that policy?,33
166,Mr LANE,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I can only say that the action taken by the New Guard was in best interests of New South Wale3. The Government of New South Wales which sought to overthrow law and order and to act contrary to the wishes of the of the people was confronted by a band of young men determined to retain their privileges. Why should we take from people their right to prosecute in court3 those who would injure the munity? I enter my emphatic protest against this Government, which all along has claimed to stand for the preservation of law and order, and the right of citizens to institute proceedings in the courts the land, bringing forward this amending measure. One honourable member asked why any man should be embarrassed by being prosecuted. Every person who is charged with having committed an offence is embarrassed; but he must accept the consequences of his action. Should the prosecution be found to be of a malicious nature, he has his remedy. But the quesSitting tion before us is not one of any embarrassment caused to a person who does wrong. Any individual or body of men should entitled to institute proceedings in courts of the land against a wrong-doer. These things should not be solely in the hands of any Attorney-General. I hope that the Government will reconsider position, and, even now, withdraw the bill.",33
167,Mr WHITE,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Balaclava) [6.12] Although this is a small bill, an impornew tant principle is at stake. Interesting as his explanation was, the Attorneyoffences General (Mr Latham) did not give satisfactory answer to the point I raised.

169,Mr WHITE,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"In my opinion, that is a dangerous provision. The honourable member for Barton (Mr Lane) spoke of certain organizations which took definite action along certain lines. The body to which I referred previously was legally formed during a time of civil commotion. On that occasion, householders were in the vited to act as special constables.",33
170,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Par t HA . of the Crimes Act does not interfere with special conmajority stables appointed in that way.,33

173,Mr WHITE,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"That point had not been made clear previously. When the Attorof ney-General was in England, and the excellent legislation for which ha was responsible was operating so successfully, there was a time when civil trouble was feared, and it was thought that it might be necessary to appoint special constables, as was done in Victoria.

174,Mr HOLMAN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Martin) [8.0] - I be think that honourable members feel that the the proposed new section which was agreed to this afternoon in committee is not entirely satisfactory in its present form, and I therefore make no apology its for detaining the House at this stage while I point out to the Attorney-General and his colleagues what I believe to be lacking in the law f»s it now stands. Part IIA . , which is governed by the proposed section, sets out a number of offences which may be said to be in the nature of seditious utterances and of an analogous character, a concerning which, I . think, it may be freely admitted that it is desirable o^ that a prosecution should be initiated in - only by some responsible person. As one who has had some experience of adminisI recognize that there is, perhaps, danger in permitting an excitable private citizen, whose judgment has not been trained in initiating prosecutions, to base a prosecution upon utterances which for many reasons might have been misunderstood. The speaker might have been quite innocent, or even if guilty during an excitable oration of going further than was quite proper, he might not have been guilty of language other than such as a tactful government would ignore, to prevent a position which was already bad from becoming worse because of a futil e prosecution. Therefore, the initiation of a prosecution for such an offence might well be retained in the hands of the Attorney-General, as is now proposed. But Part IIA . covers also other offences, and it is unwise to group them all together. These are offences of a more tangible character than those offences which I have just mentioned, and I suggest that it is not wise or safe to withdraw in regard to them the power of initiating prosecutions by private action.",33
175,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,What are the particular offences to which the honourable member refers ?,34
176,Mr HOLMAN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"The proposed new section readsAn offence against this Part shall not be prosecuted summarily without the consent in writing of the Attorney-General. Another portion of the proposed new subsection readsAn offence against this Part shall not be prosecuted upon indictment except in the name of the. Attorney-General or of such other person as the Governor General appoints in that behalf. Therefore the responsibility for initiating prosecutions for all offences covered by Part IIA . rests with the Attorney General. The first group of offences are those connected with the membership of an unlawful association. say quite frankly that I recognize that there is .much to be said for reserving to the Attorney-General or some other responsible person, the right to prosecute in such cases. Section 30D reads(1.) Any person who(o) gives or contributes money or goods to an unlawful association or; (6) receives or solicits subscriptions or contributions of money or goods for an unlawful association shall be guilty of an offence. An offence of that kind might well, I think, come within the restriction which the Attorney-General proposes. Then we have the offences contained in section 3 0 j , which provides that(1.) If at any time the Governor General is of the opinion that there exists in Australia a serious industrial disturbance prejudicing or threatening trade or commerce with other countries or among the States, lie may make a proclamation to that effect. A fte r the proclamation has been issued, the section provides that(2.) Any person who, during the operation of such proclamation takes part in or continues, or incites to, urges, aids or encourages the taking part in, or continuance of, a lock-out or strike . . . shall be guilty of an offence. In that case, I think, that the advantage in retaining the power of initiation in the hands of a government official, and, particularly, the Attorney-General, is less apparent. Without wishing to cause offence I say that I can readily imagine circumstances in which the control of the prosecution under that section by the Attorney-General might render the section entirely nugatory. I suggest, therefore, that this portion of the act should be redrafted, and that the section to which I have drawn attention should not be subject to the restriction imposed by the proposed new section. Then section 3 0 K readsWhoever, by violence to the person or property of another person, or by spoken or written threat or intimidation or any kind to whomsoever directed, or, without reasonable cause or excuse by boycott or threat of boycott of person or property(a) obstructs or hinders the provision of any public service by the Commonwealth or by any department or public authority under the Commonwealth ; (6) compels or induces any person employed in or in connection with the provision of any public service by I the Commonwealth or by any department or public authority under the Conimonwealtb to surrender or depart from his employment; (o) prevents any person from offering or accepting employment in or in connection with the provision of any public service by the Commonwealth (or by any department or public authority under the Commonwealth; (<J) obstructs or hinders the transport of goods or the conveyance of passengers in trade or commerce with other countries or among the States: (e) compels or induces any person employed in or in connection with the transport of goods or the conveyance of passengers in trade or merce with other countries or among the States to surrender or depart from his employment; or (/) prevents any person from offering or accepting employment in or in connection with the transport of goods or the conveyance of passengers in trade or commerce with other countries or among the States shall bo guilty of an offence. These offences are also included in Part I IA and are therefore brought under the V restriction of the proposed new section. Prosecutions for these offences will, if the measure is passed in its present form, only be possible on the direct authority of the Attorney-General.",34
177,Mr SCULLIN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Can the honourable member cite a case in which a private person has prosecuted under the Commonwealth law?,35
178,Mr HOLMAN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I cannot; and I do not think that there has been such a case. But there are many precautionary measures which have never been brought into force, and yet are too valuable to be dispensed with. It is to safeguard the right to initiate prosecutions that what I suggest should be done. Pew ordinary private citizens are so patriotic or so well informed that they are able to initiate prosecutions with advantage when the right is there; but that the right exists is a guarantee that those responsible for the exercise of the power will perform their duty should the occasion arise. I make these observations without the slightest reference to the present Attorney-General personally. We are now legislating for the future, and although our friends comprising the fourth party in this chamber say that if they are returned to power, they will repeal this legislation, until then, we must legislate in the way we think necessary. I have referred to the two main groups of offences-thos e arising out of industrial disputes and those which, without any pretence of accuracy, I would term as attacks upon Commonwealth services. I refer more particularly to direct inter-! ferences with the efficiency of such services by bribes, inducement, or coercion to cause persons to abandon their duty. There are, as I have said, certain offences with respect to which the rights of private prosecution might well be withdrawn, but I do not think that that observation apcom- plies to all offences. The restrictions we are now considering apply to both quasipolitical offences and seditious utterances in which it is difficult to draw a precise line between excited patriotism, on the one hand, and deliberate revolution on the other. It is, however, I think, easy to discriminate between such offences and those which arise under the two sections to which I have just directed attention. I do not propose to adopt an obstructive attitude; but the Attorney-General, if he thinks well of my suggestion, might, perhaps, arrange to have the part which I have been discussing divided into, say, Part HA . and Part IIB . The proposed new section which we considered this afternoon, and which is contained in clause 2 of the bill, might then apply to Part IIA . in which these more dubious offences could be grouped, but the others could, I submit, be left as they stand today, so that in the event of there being in power an Attorney-General who was oblivious of his duties, or who for any reason failed to put the law into motion against obvious offenders, and to protect important interests committed to his charge, a private citizen could take the necessary steps without being frustrated by.that portion of the legislation which we have been discussing today.",35
179,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [8.13] - This short bill has given rise to quite an interesting discussion which affects some fundamental principles of the administration of the law. The honourable member for Barton (Mr Lane) said that the measure had been sprung on the House, and that there had been no opportunity afforded to honourable members to make representations to the Government with respect to its provisions. The bill v/as brought in on the 15th November, and as this is now the 22nd November, honourable members should have known its contents for over a week, and there has been ample opportunity for any one to make any suggestions that might be thought desirable. I was asked whether there had been from any organization or any person, a demand for this legislation which confines to the Attorney-General the right to take cerCrimes Bill [22 tain proceedings. There has been no such demand. This legislation, I have to confess, was originated by the Attorney General himself, as a matter of principle, and I surmise that honourable members will agree that if there is a question of principle affecting the administration of the law, it is proper for the Attorney General to raise it for the consideration of the Government of his own accord, and. without solicitation. This legislation is, as honourable members on both sides of the House will agree, difficult in its nature and character. The honourable member for Barton (Mr Lane) referred to organizations which, he suggested, desired to take action under provisions of the act. Actually, no organization or person has ever attempted to institute proceedings under this part of the act, and all the proceedings which have been taken have been instituted under the .authority of the Attorney General of the Commonwealth. I have been often asked to institute proceedings, and I have then considered, first whether if the facts were established, the case would be a proper one in which to take proceedings, and, secondly, whether the facts could be established. Many persons have approached me with statements regarding what have been said to be seditious utterances and the like, as to which there was no legal evidence. Whatever the criticism of this portion of the act may be, it must be conceded by anyone who examines the statute, that special care has been taken to preserve the rights of citizens, by preserving them from arbitrary ministerial action, and requiring that proceedings be taken before a court. In most of the cases brought under my notice, there has not been legal evidence upon which proceedings could be instituted. But under this legislation, even when there is evidence, let us say of a violent speech having been made, the question arises whether proceedings of a serious nature ought to be instituted. I have always held that legislation should not aim at the repression of opinion, and that it should not aim at the repression of expression of opinion, however hostile that may be to any government; but that the line is passed when speech and action adopt the form of opposition to governNOVEMBER, 1932.] (No. 2) 1932. 2619 ment as such, and when they threaten the foundations of our society. I have tried to draw a distinction between utterances that are excited, violent, and from many points of view, reprehensible, and proceedings which really challenge in a definitely dangerous manner the foundations of government, and the system of ordered rule upon which the welfare of all the v/orthy sections of the community ultimately depend. It is a difficult thing sometimes to draw that line. I have always, in administering this law, tried to err on the right side, and have instituted proceedings only when there appeared to be something in the nature of a very definite revolutionary threat, or act of violence, in incitement, persuasion or action. Up to the present time every proceeding so instituted has succeeded, though, of course, we cannot hope that that record can be maintained. One of the difficulties that arises in administering legislation of this kind is, as I have said, in determining in what circumstances proceedings shall be instituted. I have adopted the rule that ordinary disturbances of law and order ought to be handled by the State authority, even though they may be associal ed with activities which might be regarded as revolutionary in character. It is unwise and injudicious, for many reasons, for the Commonwealth to assume, responsibility in regard to ordinary breaches of the peace, although sometimes inaction on the part of the Commonwealth may result in no proceedings being taken at all. It must be recognized that the machinery at the disposal of the Commonwealth is not well adapted for action in such cases. The honourable member for Martin referred to the particular offences created by this part of the statute, and suggested that a distinction might be drawn between them. He has conceded that offences relating to unlawful association ought to be prosecuted at the instigation of the Attorney-General. He then proceeded to discuss sections 30j and 30K of the act, and suggested that a private person should have the right to institute proceedings under those sections. There appears to me to be little ground for the contentions of the honourable member, so far as they apply to section 30j. This section comes into operation only when the Governor General has made a proclamation declaring that a serious industrial disturbance of a certain description exists. That is, the section operates only when the Government of the day has determined that it is wise to put the section into operation. Obviously it must then be the intention that the Attorney General shall act in pursuance of the section ; there could be no other reason for making the proclamation. I regard section 30J as an emergency section, designed for the purpose of dealing with a national emergency, and one not to be utilized in ordinary circumstances. Only when a very serious state of affairs prevails would any government accept the responsibility of making a proclamation to bring this section into operation. The section, when it applies, is far-reaching. It makes it an offence to incite to or to urge, or to encourage to take part in a strike or lockout, and prescribes a penalty of one year's imprisonment upon conviction, with the liability of persons not born in Australia to deportation. We have removed from the Arbitration Act penalties on strikes and lockouts. In section 30J of the Crimes Act, there remains a penalty of a very serious nature on strikes and lockouts in certain circumstances. The safeguard is that the Government of the day must accept the responsibility cf making a proclamation for bringing these admittedly drastic sections of the act into administration. Seeing, therefore, that the section is to be brought into operation only in times of national crisis or emergency, it is proper that the Attorney General alone should have power to institute proceedings, and should accept responsibility for so doing. The same consideration applies, perhaps not so strongly, to section 30K, which prescribes serious penalties against persons who obstruct or hinder the performances of certain services. It must be remembered, however, that the ordinary law of the State provides for the protection of persons and property, and that, in ordinary circumstances, those provisions are sufficient to deal with anythink likely to arise. Section 30K would apply only if there were a hold-up, such as action preventing the delivery of Mr Latham. mails, or an interference with the performance by the Public Service of its proper functions, or with interstate or overseas trade. Therefore, this section also is designed to meet an emergency. I believe that in ordinary cases of violence and interference with persons or property, it is wiser to leave the matter in the hands of the State authorities. This legislation should not be regarded as something to be invoked from day to day at the will or determination of private persons; it should be put into operation only when the Government, is prepared to take the responsibility of prosecuting in accordance with its terms. Some of the matters to which section 30K relates might, perhaps, safely be left for a private prosecutor to deal with, but it is difficult to draw distinctions. Take, for instance, a widespread disturbance interfering with the distribution of mails. Surely it is the responsibility of the government of the day to take action in such a case. I find it difficult to believe that any private person would be prevented from doing anything which it would be in the interests of the community to be done. There is a particular responsibility involved in putting this legislation into operation, and for that reason the measure was introduced without any invitation, pressure, or solicitation from outside, or even within the Parliament.

I have no doubt that his decision was made earlier in the day, and had he acquainted honourable members then, they would have had an opportunity of examining the Nauru Island Agreement Bill, and of looking up the debates which took place in the Senate when the measure was before that chamber.

The honourable member must be aware that the ratification of the agreement made between the Governments of the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth, and lowing provisions:New Zealand is long overdue; it has been on the business paper since 1925.",38
182,Mr BEASLEY,NAURU ISLAND,Then it is of ticular importance.,38
183,Mr MARR,NAURU ISLAND,"As the honourable memsuch ber was, at one time, administering territories which are now under my is appointed. authority, I have no doubt that he is aware of the agreement that awaits ratitions fication by this Parjiament. In 1919, the Governments of the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth of tralia, and the Dominion of New Zealand, entered into an arrangement providing for the exercise of the mandate granted by the League of Nations for the adminisvernment tration of the Island of Nauru, which, as every honourable member knows, conKingdom tains huge deposits of phosphate of great value. This arrangement received the approval of the Parliament of the monwealth in the Nauru Island Agreeappear ment Act 1919. That statute provided that the Administrator should be apgreater pointed by the Commonwealth Governlegislative ment for a period of five years, and subsequent appointments to that office should be made by the three governments concerned. Authority was granted to the of phosphates. Administrator to make such ordinances as were necessary for the good government of the island, subject to, and in accordance with, the provisions of the mandate agreement. In 1921, discussions place in Great Britain between the retary of State for the Colonies, and Prime Ministers of Australia and New Zealand, as a result of which is was deemed advisable that more explicit provision should be made for the exercise of the Administrator's power. Eventually, after further discussion and correspondence, a supplementary agreement was for West completed in May, 1923. The bill providing for the parliamentary approval of this further agreement: was passed by the Senate in 1924, and read a first time in this House on Sth May of the same year, but not having been dealt with prior to the prorogation of Parliament in 1925, it lapsed, and evidently the necessity of again submitting the measure to Parliament was The purpose of the present bill is to make good that omission. The supplementary agreement makes the fol1. All ordinances made by the Administrator are declared to be subject to confirmation or disallowance by the Gono parvernment which appointed him. 2.

It will be seen that the agreement proComvides certain safeguards which do not in the original agreement, and gives to the Government responsible control of the Administrator in and administrative matters. thai The supplementary agreement does not affect those parts of the 1919 agreement relating to the working of the deposits",38
184,Mr MAXWELL,NAURU ISLAND,Has the agreement been in operation all this time?,38
185,Mr MARR,NAURU ISLAND,"Yes . If honourable members will study the agreement, they will took see that the alterations made are to the Secadvantage of the inhabitants of Nauru. the The phosphate deposits are being worked by the Pacific Phosphates Commission, the directors of which are appointed by the Governments of the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth, and New Zealand. In 1900 the native population of the island was approximately 1,500^ but, as the result of various epidemics, it gradually diminished, and in 1921, when mandatory control commenced, it was 1,084. Since then it has increased steadily, and is now about 1,500 again. The health of the Nauruans is the first consideration of the Commonwealth. The excellent manner in which the mandate is being administered has been favourably commented upon during the present sitting of the Mandates Commission, following a report submitted by Sir Donald Cameron on behalf of the Commonwealth Government. The royalty in respect of the working of the phosphate deposits is paid into a trust fund, which is administered by a council of fourteen chiefs, who speak the English language fluently and are really well educated men. The amount to the credit of the trust fund is now approximately £20,000. Recently the Nauruans completed the erection of a public hall, the official opening of - which will take place on the 32th December. Early in the present month the Anam celebrations were held to mark the increase of population to the number recorded in 1900. On that occasion the Prime Minister, on behalf of the Commonwealth, sent the native chiefs a cable of congratulation on the advancement that had been made since the mandate was accepted, and within the last 24 hours he received the following reply :Aiuini commemoration celebrations place 8th November. In connection therewith the Council of Chiefs on behalf of the whole of the Nauruan community desire me to convey to the Australian Government expression of sincere gratitude for the tinued and devoted care of the native inhabitants since the introduction of mandatory control, without which care the restoration of the native population could not have been accomplished. This message I submit is a welldelay deserved tribute from the native chiefs to the Commonwealth of Australia for the great care which it has exercised in safement, guarding the interests of the natives. Mr Marr. Mr MARRS"" (South Australia) [8.42]. - The confession just made by the Minister (Mr Marr) discloses a remarkable oversight on the part of this and preceding Governments. It is extraordinary that the ratification of the agreement made between the Governments of the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth, and New Zealand in relation to the Island of Nauru should have been so long delayed. I am also surprised that the League of Nations has not asked for an explanation of the reasons for the delay in ratifying the agreement. In the schedule to the bill, which is really the agreement, I can find no provision to which exception can be taken, but I should like to know which Government will hold the Administrator responsible for ordinances to be made, and also whether such ordinances will be laid on the table of the respective Houses of Parliament so that the Parliaments concerned may have an opportunity to review the administration. As this Parliament is responsible to the League of Nations for the good government and welfare of the Nauruans, I should like information on the point which I have raised. On behalf of the Opposition in this House, I express the earnest hope that the Nauruans will continue to enjoy to the fullest extent all the privileges which can be extended to them under this agreement, and that happiness and contentment will be their portion under the mandate.  I offer no. opposition to the bill, but I must say that it is rather a shock to our sense of importance as legislators to realise that everything has gone along, apparently quite took well, for about thirteen years without the ratification of this agreement. It is gratifying to learn that not only the Mandates Commission, but the natives conthemselves, give us credit for having administered our mandate in a proper way.",38
186,Mr BEASLEY,NAURU ISLAND,"West Sydney) [8.46]. - I think that the Minister has not given us all the facts which account for the long in ratifying this agreement. The honourable gentleman implied that this delay was the fault of the last Governand its predecessor. It is diflicult for me to remember in detail every matter coming under my notice since I became a member, or even everything that happened while I was a Minister, but I recall that there was some dispute in connection with the payment of commission or royalty on phosphates. A controversy arose over the matter, and I think the right honourable member for Yarra (Mr. Scullin), when hevisited Great Britain as Prime Minister, was asked to adjudicate upon it. It was an involved business, but the Government of which I was a member was inclined to the belief that important interests on the other side of the world were not pla\ :.ng the game, and were asking for more than was due to them.",39
187,Mr MAFTX,NAURU ISLAND,Does that concern this agreement ?,40
188,Mr BEASLEY,NAURU ISLAND,"It was a cause of the dflay in the ratification of the agreement. Ac laxity can be attributed to the Government of which I was a member. Mr Scullin,-There was a drawn-out dispute. The representatives of Now Zealand and Australia took J very different view from that of the representatives of Great Britain as to the amount of commission that should be paid to the representatives of the British companies.",40
189,Mr BEASLEY,NAURU ISLAND,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for refreshing my memory. I know that the Australian Government was called upon to pay a substantial sum in excess of what was really due. As to the natives, it is all very well to talk about the very careful way in which our mandate has been exercised, and to a degree what has been said is true. But my experience does not bear out exactly what the Minister has endeavoured to convey to the House. While I was Minister, I had occasion to handle a rather awkward situation that arose among the natives. As the Minister said, the Nauruans are relatively well educated and competent. That being so, they have the right to select their own chiefs, but such a view was not held by the present Administrator. Newman, the Administrator, had his own ideas on the subject, and, against the wish of others, sought to impose one Detudamo as head of the council of chiefs. Consequently, a serious situation arose. The Administrator, adopting a well-known practice, indicated that unrest had arisen among the natives because of European influence- a common method of trying to hide incompetency and throwing responsibility on somebody else. Because they would not fall into line with him, Newman desired to depose all the other chiefs. Though without full knowledge of the circumstances at that stage, I felt that that was not the proper action to bake, and, for the purpose of making ful l inquiries, I arranged that Newman should go on leave for a few months, his place being taken by an acting administrator. The result of that inquiry was such that, had I remained a member of the Scullin Government, Newman would not have returned to the island as administrator. Consequent upon this change, I obtained sufficient information to know that the island would be under better administration if Newman were not long there. However, circumstances altered, and he returned to his old position. That is why I believe that the case as presented by the Ministeris lacking in detail. I admit that it is difficult f^r the honourable gentleman to obtain a comprehensrre knowledge of the condition;;, for Newman is in a position to allow only such information as he desires to reach Australia. He would be able to detect any person who was endeavouring to send a statement of the facts to this country, and, of course, would victimize such an individual. The community is so small that he is master of the situation. Since that time, I have never been satisfied that the position at Nauru is satisfactory. ' In order to facilitate the supply of phosphates to Australia, and to prevent vessels from being detained by adverse weather conditions, a large gantry was installed at Nauru. I would like to know whether the innovation has proved successful, and whether the island is now able to supply the whole of Australia's phosphatic requirements. Prior to this agreement being made, no change in administration could be made without considerable delay, because of the need to obtain the endorsement of the New Zealand and British authorities. Will the process of circumlocution which previously existed now be obviated? I know that, although no objection was raised to the person whom the Scullin Government nominated as acting Administrator, a couple of months elapsed before the necessary endorsement was obtained from the other parties to the mandate. As the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) has said, the provisions contained in the agreement set out in the schedule are purely of a formal description, such as are customary in these matters.",40
190,Mr MARR,NAURU ISLAND,"Parkes-Minister for Health) [S.55] - This agreement was prepared and signed on behalf of the governments concerned on the 30th day of May, 1923. It has not since been altered. Any difference of opinion as to the commission on phosphates is not-relevant for the agreement gives the Administrator power to make ordinances on behalf of the three governments. Those ordinances must be presented to the Parliaments concerned, and, as promulgated, they have been tabled in this chamber. Although honourable members have had the right to discuss them, not one has been questioned. As other matters have been raised, I shall take the opportunity to reply to them. Regarding the training of natives, the Nauruans arc certainly more advanced than are the natives of New Guinea and Papua. So much so, that there are three Nauruans at present completing their medical courses at the Melbourne University. Educational progress is slower in New Guinea and Papua because the natives there are more backward, but the Government has under consideration a scheme to place selected natives from those territories under intensive instructional courses. I was not a member of the Government of that day, so am unable to speak authoritatively on the subject raised by the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) regarding the trouble which he related in connection with the appointment of a chief, but I do not doubt the honourable member when he says that the situation was serious. As I have intimated, such matters are outside the scope of this agreement, which merely concerns administration-:-:fo the peace, order, and good government of Nauru. The phosphate deposits of the island are exploited by the Phosphate Commission, on which there are three directors, one representing Great Britain, one Australia, and one New Zealand. They sanction all contracts. The Administrator merely sees that any contracts made are fair. to the Naurua.n3 themselves. The Nauruans have expressed pleasure at the fairness of the treatment that they have received in the working of the phosphate deposits. The honourable member for West Sydney referred to the gantrys that were installed. The cost of their installation was borne, not by Australia but by the British Phosphate Commission. These have been of untold value, because, previously, vessels could not draw alongside either Nauru or Ocean Island when the weather was bad, whereas now they may load in practically all kinds of weather. Recently the three governments affected were obliged to agree to a slight alteration being made in the cost of the phosphates purchased by each of them. The British Government wished to have an allowance made for exchange, so that it could obtain its requirements at a cheaper rate. It may interest honourable members to learn that the purchase price of these deposits had to be found by the Australian Government to the extent of 42 per cent., by the British Government to the extent of 42 per cent., and by the New Zealand Government to the extent of 16 per cent., and that they have been entitled to share in the output in those proportions, but each year Australia has had between 70 per cent, and 80 per cent, of the quantity produced.",41
191,Mr SCULLIN,NAURU ISLAND,The other contracting parties have not wanted it.,41
192,Mr MARR,NAURU ISLAND,"Ne w Zealand has taken a little more than its share, but Great Britain has not exercised its right because the British farmer is able to purchase phosphates elsewhere at a much cheaper rate than is charged for the Nauru and Ocean Island product. The term of the present Administrator expires on the 31st December next, and a new appointment must be made, after consultation, by the three governments concerned. Both the British and the New secure Zealand Governments, however, have cabled an acceptance of the proposal of this Government to appoint an Australian administrator for a further five years, but have recommended that the appointee be of a certain type and not above the age of 45 years, so that there may be greater continuity i u administration a set plan. The Commonwealth Government is considering the appointment of the Administrator who will commence following duty on the 1st January next. A selection has not yet been made because, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr . says, the matter needs the most careful ofconsideration. It is necessary to have a man of the utmost tact and ability, and one who will properly advance the interests of the natives. 1 commend the bill to honourable members.

In committee (Consideration of according to Senate's amendment): Clause 4After section eleven of the Principal Act the headings and sections are inserted:19 - (1.) There shall be a Legislative Scullin) Council for the Territory. (2.) The Legislative Council shall consist (o) seven non-official members who shall be nominated by the Administrator and appointed by the Governor General. (3.) Three of the non-official members of the Legislative Council shall be nominated as representing the interests of the planting industry, two as representing the interests of the mining industry, and two as representing commercial interests. Senate's amendment - Leave out sub-section as (3.) of proposed section 19.",42
197,Mr MARR,NAURU ISLAND,"Parkes-Minister for Health) [9.9] - I m o v e That the amendment be agreed to. The object is to leave the Administrator and the Governor General with a wider choice in the selection of the non-official members of the legislative council. This proposal was advanced in this chamber by the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr E . J. Harrison), but at the moment the Government could not see its way to accept it . Subsequently, however, and havupon further consideration, the Government agreed to the deletion of the subsection in the Senate. It now seeks the approval of honourable members in this",42
198,Mr MAKIN,NAURU ISLAND,"Hindmarsh) [9.10] When non-official persons are asked to o r - assist in the government or the adminisof the territory, even though it be only in an advisory capacity, it is undesirable that those whose acts are likely to be reviewed should make the selection. Eurthermore, there is no guarantee that price the Administrator and the Government will be prepared to ascertain from the in the , territory the identity of those persons I recognize, of course,' the difficulty of obtaining, in the absence of an elective system, anything like unanimity as to who should represent the different interests. Still, I gravely doubt the wisdom of giving to the Administrator the power to recommend, not only the official but also the non-official members of the legislative council. He will have the unfettered selection of the body that is to exercise an oversight of his administration. I cannot see that any satisfaction will be given to non-official interests in the Mandated Territory, because they will have little or no voice in the selection of their representatives. Unless the Minister can assure the committee that the planting interests, the mining interests, the commercial interests, the working community, the. missions, and all others associated with the civil life of the Mandated Territory, will be effectively consulted in regard to representation, the situation cannot be regarded as at all satisfactory. A farcical procedure is being adopted, and I await with interest any explanation that the Minister may have to offer concerning this all important aspect. Mr E. J. HARRISON (Wentworth) [9.13] - I am particularly pleased that this amendment has been made. Under the bill as it left this chamber, the Administrator had the power to appoint persons as representatives of different interests. That is entirely different from the selection of such representatives by the interests themselves. I agree with the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr. Makin), that until there can be thorough representation of all interests the Administrator should not have the power indiscriminately to appoint the representatives of any particular group. I feel that wider scope should be allowed the Administrator than was given in the original measure. He will probably be able to exercise greater authority in the direction of securing the representation of interests that could not have been consulted under the measure as originally drafted, aud thus ensure a more representative legislative council.",42
199,Mr BEASLEY,NAURU ISLAND,"West Sydney) [9.14]. - I cannot see that, under the bill amended, the Administrator will have wider scope. There certainly will restrictive. be less restriction on his power to appoint whom he likes. Frankly, I consider this bill the greatest joke that has ever been perpetrated .in the Commonwealth Parliament. Some of my honourable friends opposite will blush with shame if , when discussing before their constituents the cost of government in Australia, they are asked to justify the time spent upon it by such a costly institution as this Parliament. Mr E. J. HARBISON - Does not the honourable member consider that the appointment of representatives of specific interests would make the representation more narrow than would be the case if the representation were general?",43
200,Mr BEASLEY,NAURU ISLAND,"It depends on the Administrator, who will have the deciding voice in everything. Even if subsection 3 of the proposed new section 19 were retained, he could select the non-official members from his own office. We, on this side, consider that provision should have been made for the direct representation of the workers. A considerable number of men are employed in the territory on public works and in mining operations.  ment would make their representation possible.",43
201,Mr BEASLEY,NAURU ISLAND,"There is no guarantee in that direction. The inference one must draw from the bill as it left this chamber is that the Government never intended to have the workers represented on the legislative council. After all, the Administrator, probably, was consulted in regard to the framing of the bill, and desired that a certain course should be followed in regard to the representation to be granted.' The Government, no doubt, had no intention of adopting the course which the honourable member for Gippsland  taken. The choice of representatives will be more restricted under the Senate's amendment, for the Administrator will not be obliged to consider any of the interests specifically mentioned in subsection 3.  as thing he could do previously, and more besides. Therefore, the clause is less",43
202,Mr BEASLEY,NAURU ISLAND,"It is difficult to decide that matter, seeing that the Administrator will have the deciding voice in everything. He will practically set up the legislative council, and he will decide what business shall be placed before it. When this body has made a decision he can exercise his power of veto. If honourable members view the matter calmly, they must realise that this measure is a complete farce. I do not know whether it is intended to give the League of Nations the impression - that the Government has become extraordinarily democratic in carrying out its mandate. As the members of my party have already said, it would lave been far better to leave matters as they were before this bill was introduced, than to pretend to give a measure of self-government to the residents of the Mandated Territory.",44
203,Mr MARR,NAURU ISLAND,"Parkes-Minister for Health) [9.18] - - In reply to the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr. Makin) and the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley), I fail to see that the scope for representation of the various interests in the territory has not been widened under the Senate's amendment. The bill, as originally submitted, provided for the nomination of tbroe non-official members of the legislative council to represent the planting industry, two to represent the interests of the mining industry, and two to represent commercial interests. There are other interests in the territory, and the Government came to the conclusion that, in the event of new industries springing up, these would have claim to representation. It is provided under the bill that special non-official members may be appointed to the legislative council when it is considered desirable to hear their views on matters under the consideration of the council, and the Government is of the opinion that the Senate's amendment will enable the Government to give effect to the wishes expressed by honourable members during the debate on the bill in this chamber.",44
204,Mr BEASLEY,NAURU ISLAND,But the Minister refused to grant our requests.,44
205,Mr MARR,NAURU ISLAND,"I have already stated that at the time when the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr E. J. Harrison) submitted a certain,amendment, the Government did not feel disposed to accept it ; but, on further consideration, it saw the wisdom of the honourable member's proposal. Despite what the honourable member for West Sydney has said about the bill placing the Administrator in the position of a Mussolini, the honourable member must realise that the Administrator does not make the laws that apply to the Mandated Territory. The honourable member stated that the Administrator could appoint not only the official but also the non-official members of the legislative council. But I remind honourable members that the bill provides that the non-official members shall be "" nominated by the Administrator and appointed by the Governor General.""",44
206,Mr MAICIN,NAURU ISLAND,But the Administrator makes recommendations in regard to appointments.,44
207,Mr MARR,NAURU ISLAND,"Of course. It has been claimed that every organization in the territory should be consulted with regard to appointments, and I can promise the committee that no selection will be made until the Government has considered the claims of all interests in the territory. The honourable member for West Sydney remarked that this bill was a farce; but I remind him that for two years he was Minister for the Mandated Territory, and did not bring down a bill to provide for proper representation of the various interests on the advisory council.",44
208,Mr BEASLEY,NAURU ISLAND,The Government with which I was associated preferred to leave matters as they were.,44
209,Mr MARR,NAURU ISLAND,"I was a member of this chamber in .1928, when a bill providing for the appointment of an advisory council for the Mandated Territory was brought down. The planting interests made representations to the present Government, and asked for the appointment of a council in which they w-ould have the rif;ht to discuss matters affecting the welfare of the territory. Under the Senate's amendment, the Government will have wider scope than under the original provision in the selection of the non-official members of the legislative body.",44
210,Mr BEASLEY,NAURU ISLAND,"We shall watch the Government's action in this matter. - Mr MARR - The Government is prepared to consult all interests in the territory, including organizations of workers, with a view to seeing if representation can be granted to them. The Government's sole desire is that all interests shall be fairly represented.",44
211,Mr ROSEVEAR,NAURU ISLAND,"Dalley) [9.24] - I fail to see that the Senate's amendment will improve the bill. The root objection that the members of my party have to it is that, as the Minister practically admits, the Administrator will be a dictator. The fact that the Government n'ow considers it necessary to provide legislative machinery for the territory seems to indicate that the one-man system of government has failed.",45
212,The CHAIRMAN,NAURU ISLAND,The honourable member must not travel beyond the scope of the amendment.,45
213,Mr ROSEVEAR,NAURU ISLAND,"In the first place, the Administrator is given power to nominate eight of the nine members of the executive council, and the legislative council is to include seven non-official members nominated by him. The fact that the Administrator was to be given the right to nominate the seven non-official members as representing specific interests did not guarantee that, in fact, those interests would be represented, or that they would be represented by persons approved by them. Consequently the justification for the bill depended, in the first place, largely on the promise of the Minister that the Government, before endorsing the nominations of the Administrator, would see that the various interests were adequately represented. It was pointed out to the Government that it would be possible to consult the mining, planting, and commercial interests, and to allow them to nominate their own representatives. The Minister then said that it would be impossible to get those interests together; but I understand that there are associations in the territory representing practically the whole of the planting interests, and the other commercial interests. If it were necessary to take a ballot to enable the various interests to nominate their representatives, that could be done by post. The committee previously appeared to be satisfied with the Minister's assurance that the Government would take care that the persons nominated did, in fact, represent the interests mentioned. But if the Senate's amendment is agreed to, there will be no provision left in the bill to guarantee that those or any other interests will be represented. The Administrator will have much wider power under the amendment than under the measure as it left this chamber. The Minister will be guided by the Administrator, who, if he is to be empowered to select a pack of his own friends as non-official members of the council, may as well be set up as a dictator forthwith. Why not sweep aside this farce? The Administrator will have power to nominate the members of both the executive council and the legislative council. He will be able to veto their decisions and dismiss them at will. From my point of view, the amendment of the Senate makes the powers of the Administrator more objectionable than before, because there is no restriction whatever upon him. If the Administrator nominates seven non-official members of the legislative council, and they are objected to, by whom will the Minister be guided? He will have to 'accept the advice of the Administrator, who is hundreds of miles from the Seat of Government. The Minister will ultimately have to accept the word of some persons as to the adequacy of the representation of various interests in New Guinea. If a difference of opinion arises, on whose word, in the last analysis, is he likely to rely-that of the Administrator or that of some, disgruntled individuals who feel that the interests for which they stand are not being represented properly ? In one respect honourable members were misled when this measure was previously under consideration, for they were told that it would not be possible to consult the various interests. But I put it to the Minister that communications could be sent by post to all the residents of the Mandated Territory, inviting them to express their views in a postal ballot. If this amendment is agreed to, even the assurance that we previously had that at least certain interests would be represented will be taken from us, and the Administrator will have practically a free hand in selecting the members of both the executive council and the legislative council. That being so, I suggest that we should sweep the whole bill aside. Of what use is it to create a machine and then give the Administrator complete power to control it and to"" destroy any work that it does ? We might just as well allow the dictatorship of recent - years to continue.  I cannot understand the reasoning of some of the honourable members who have opposed the acceptance of this amendment. Some of them have complained that certain interests will not be represented; yet when, a move is made to delete a provision which restricts representation to mining, commercial, and planting interests, and so make it possible for other interests to be represented, they oppose it. The bill will be less objectionable to me with this provision deleted than with it retained. If the provision be deleted half a dozen interests may be represented, whereas if it is retained only mining, commercial and planting interests can be represented.",45
214,Mr MAKIN,NAURU ISLAND,"Hindmarsh) [9.36] The confusion of mind to which the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr. Paterson) has confessed shows that he has not properly appreciated the point we have been making. It is possible that even if this clause is deleted the representation will be even more restricted than with the clause in.  the deletion of the clause could restrict the representation, but it is also easy to how it could expand it.",46
215,Mr MAKIN,NAURU ISLAND,The honourable member for Gippsland has made it unnecessary for me to say any more on the subject. His interjection has entirely justified the opposition of honourable members of this party to the deletion of the clause. Motion agreed to. Resolution reported; report adopted. SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT.,46
216,Mr LYONS,NAURU ISLAND,"Wilmot-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [9.37] - I move That the House at its rising adjourn until tomorrow at 3 p.m. When the House meets tomorrow, the Government desires to introduce the bill to provide the financial relief which I forecast in my statement a few days ago, and we should like to proceed immediately with the discussion of it. Every effort is being made to place the bill in the hands of honourable.members as early as possible in the morning, so that they may acquaint themselves with its provisions before the House meets. We hope that this will make unnecessary an adjournment after the introductory second reading speech has been delivered. This will prevent loss of time. If it is discovered while the debate is in progress than an adjournment is necessary, the Government will be agreeable to it. Honourable members have made such good progress with the business that the only subjects remaining for discussion, apart from the tariff, are disarmament and reparations, and it is not proposed at this stage to ask that these be dealt with.",46
217,Mr BEASLEY,NAURU ISLAND,West Sydney) [9.40]. - The Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) should have given honourable members more information about its financial relief proposals. Erom statements which have appeared in the press-whic h is the only information I have- I gather that the proposals of the Government to grant relief to farmers and to correct anomalies in our pensions legislation will be embodied in one comprehensive bill.,46
218,Mr LYONS,NAURU ISLAND,Tba t is so.,46
219,Mr BEASLEY,NAURU ISLAND,"In that event, it must be apparent that the bill will be bo'th important and far-reaching. In order properly to discuss it, we shall need to refer to the Financial Emergency Acts see of both last year and this year, and also to our Old-age and Invalid Pensions Acts. On the one subject of invalid and old-age pensions, there is ample scope for a considerable debate. We do not even yet know what anomalies the Government proposes to rectify. It is necessary, therefore, that we should have time to consider them. Unless proper time is given to the consideration of this bill, errors which have occurred recently through the action of the Government in compelling us hastily to pass legislation of this kind may be repeated. If we had had sufficient time to consider the Financial Emergency Bill that was introduced a few weeks ago, many of the anomalies which have caused considerable mental anguish and actual physical suffering to our old-age and invalid pensioners could have been avoided. It cannot be denied that that bill broke new ground, and introduced an entirely new method of procedure in our pensions practice. I do not think it is fair of the Government, in these circumstances, to ask us to proceed with the discussion of the bill to be introduced tomorrow immediately after the second-reading speech has , been made. I appeal to the Prime Minister to give us an opportunity to consider the measure carefully and without haste so that we may express an intelligent opinion upon it. It might, be possible to discuss the proposal for the relief of farmers, for that is a fairly straight-forward subject, but there are many difficulties associated with any amendment of our pensions law.",46
220,Mr LYONS,NAURU ISLAND,"Wilmot-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [9.44] - When honourable members see the bill to be introduced tomorrow, they will realise that it is essentially a measure for consideration in committee, and I think that they will agree that there will be very little difficulty in proceeding with the second reading debate on it. The bill will provide for relief along the lines mentioned by me in my statement of a few days ago, and is thus very suitable for detailed consideration in committee.",47
221,Mr SCULLIN,NAURU ISLAND,But does the Prime Minister propose to apply the guillotine to the discussion ?,47
222,Mr LYONS,NAURU ISLAND,"I guarantee that that will not be done,. The Government is asking honourable members to proceed with the second-reading debate tomorrow, because it believes that it will meet their convenience to do so. We shall offer no objection to an adjournment of the second reading debate if that seems to be necessary. Honourable members may rest assured that there will be no curtailment of time in considering this bill at the committee stage. Every opportunity will be afforded for the fullest consideraMinister tion of all aspects of the measure. Question resolved in the affirmative. ADJOURNMENT. RETIREMENT OF TELEGRAPHISTS-HENLE Y BEACH POST OFFICE-EIJ I BANANAS. Motion (by Mr LYONS) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",47
223,Mr MAKIN,NAURU ISLAND,"Hindmarsh) [9.45] - I At  hill) to investigate an apparent injustice that is being done to telegraphists in South Australia who' have given long and faithful service to the State and the Commonwealth. I understand that telegraphists employed in the General Post Office, Adelaide, and possibly in other parts of South Australia, are being prematurely retiredUusually when permanent officers of the Postal Department become redundant, an effort is made to place them in other branches in which their services can be utilized. The one exception to this rule is the telegraph operating room. Men who were in the Service prior to federation are. being retired at the ages of 60, 62, and 63 years. Formerly they had every right to expect that they would remain in the Service until they reached 65 years of age, and they are contributing to the superannuation fund on that basis. They have also taken out insurance policies to mature at that age. Their compulsory premature retirement will impose serious disabilities upon them, because their superannuation benefit will be reduced, and they may lose their insurance policies through inability to continue payment of the premiums from their diminished incomes. If these men were redundant and no other work could be found for them, the department might have been able to justify its action, but I am informed that the service in the telegraph operating room at the Adelaide General Post Office is not efficient, and that the Senior Assistant Superintendent of Telegraphs is doing dual duty as supervisor and telegraphist. It is not fair that this man should be employed on two distinct duties, thus depriving at least one man of a job. I am told also that the time actually worked by this officer is different from that recorded in the time book, and I ask the to investigate that charge. I bring these complaints before the Minister only because they come to me from a responsible source. Here are some specific facts which I ask him to investigate :-On the 29th August, from 4 p.m. to 4.45 p.m., a messenger was on operating duty although five operating positions were vacant. At 4.50 p.m., the supervisor was working the Quorn circuit. 5.15 p.m., eight positions were vacant. the 30th August, ten positions were vacant; from 4.10 to 6.10 p.m., a messenger was on operating duty; at 4.20 p.m., six positions were vacant, and one lad from circulation was operating. At 4.30 p.m., eight positions were vacant, and at 5.20 p.m., there were no men on the Port Pirie, Quorn, Port Adelaide, Yorketown, Murat Bay, and Bordertown circuits. At 5.50 p.m. there were still eight vacant positions. On the 1st September, the office was in a similar state of disorganization, and the assistant superintendent and four lads from circulation were on operating duty. At 6.30 p.m., the operator had to vacate the Perth circuit, which then became unattended, to clear traffic on the Port Adelaide and Port Darwin circuits. While one man is doing double duty, and messengers are doing operating work, men with experience and accrued rights are being dismissed from the Service. I shall let the Minister hard a detailed statement of these complaints, in the hope that he will thoroughly investigate them. senior official, through overzeal, has declared men redundant who are not really so, their service should be continued in order to restore efficiency in the department, and at the same time, preserve to them their rights. I remind the Postmaster-General again that the officers concerned have served long and well both the State and the Commonwealth, and they might well be retained to supplement an apparently inadequate staff that is called upon to undertake responsible and highly skilled work. Henley Beach is one of the principal seaside resorts in South Australia and the surrounding district is well populated. The suburb has a full-time post office, but during the luncheon hour, when many residents would like to make use of postal and telegraphic facilities, the office graph :- is closed. I doubt if such an absurd state of affairs could be found in any other seaside resort of equal importance. The centals discontinuance of the service in the middle of the day has caused great dissatisfaction among the residents. I have represented to the Deputy Director of Posts and Telethe graphs in South Australia the desirability of keeping the office open during the as luncheon hour, but he has not seen fit to accede to my request. I , therefore, ask This the Postmaster-General to call for a report on the matter and, if possible, to arrange for the office to be open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.",47
224,Mr BAKER,NAURU ISLAND,"Oxley) [9.55] - I take this opportunity to make another endeavour to obtain a statement from the Government regarding its intentions towards the banana industry. I asked several questions on the subject within the last week, but so far Ministers have shown remarkable ingenuity in withholding the information I seek. My questions had their origin in a statement made in Queensland by the Assistant Minister for Defence (Mr Francis), and I have persisted in my inquiries, not with a desire to embarrass the honourable gentleman, but solely in order to get definite information on a matter of Government policy. In the Brisbane Courier of the 10th November, this item of news appearedSTIMULAT E MARKETS FOR BANANAS. TARII?F PROCEEDS TO AIDTHE GROWERS. If a Canberra, Oth November. A tentative decision has been made by the Federal Government to devote to the Australian banana industry the entire proceeds of the revenue from the Fijian banana tariff. An official estimate is that from this source not less than £5,000 will be received annually. It is the intention of the Cabinet to use this money each year in helping the banana-growers of Queensland and New South Wales to obtain better marketing conditions in Australia. Particular regard will be given to the task of helping to sell more Australian bananas in Western Australia which now imports a considerable quantity from other countries. The Government realizes that the comparatively small sum of £5,000 will not enable very extensive assistance to the banana industry, but it feels that the money should be used in this manner, because it' was through the concessions granted by the banana industry that important concessions were conceded by Britain when the Ottawa agreement was in the making. On the following day, the Brisbane the Courier published the following paraFIJI BANANAS. No FLOODING or MARKET. That there was no question of the 40,000 of F i j i bananas to be admitted to Australia annually under the Ottawa agreement being increased so that the market would be flooded, was stated by Mr Josiah Francis, at Queensland Preference League's exhibition, last night. Mr Francis said that Mr Bruce had been communicated with in London, and, a result, the Governor of F i j i had given his assurance that the quota would not be exceeded. placed the matter beyond doubt. Mr Francis confirmed the statement, published in the Courier of yesterday, that the Federal Government had made a tentative cision to use the whole of the revenue from ment was made by a duties on Fiji bananas to help the Australian banana industry. The same journal of the 14th November F contained a long statement occupying nearly two columns, under the heading "" Mr Francis explains his stand deals with a speech made by the Assistant Minister for Defence to a gathering banana-growers at Burleigh on the 12th November. It reports the Assistant M in ister as follows:Ho had secured the whole of the duty Fijian bananas to help the He bad called this meeting in order to discuss the bust means of spending the £5,000 a year in their interests. Later, in answer to questions put of to him, the honourable said that he would ascertain if a part tals of the £5,000 annually could be used to secure better trucking facilities, access to These roads and railways, and lower railway freights, and also if some F i j i a n bananas could be diverted to New Zealand. reading those statements, and assuming them to be correct, it occurred to me there might be some difficulty caused by the Constitution, and for that reason, asked on the 16th November, the followof ing question:1. Is the statement correct that the Commonwealth Government has decided to use the proceeds from the Fijian banana tariff, estimated at £5,000, to assist banana-growers of Queensland and New South Wales to obtain better marketing conditions in Australia? 2. If so, has the Government obtained legal advise as to whether the proposal is constitutional? The.Attorney-General avoided that question, and repliedAny proposal of this nature would require legislation, and before any such legislation is introduced the advice of the Crown Law authorities would be obtained. Following upon that, I asked the right honourable the Prime Minister this question1. Has the Commonwealth Government considered using the proceeds from the Fijian banana tariff, estimated at £5,000, to assist banana-growers of Queensland and New South Wales to obtain better marketing conditions in Australia? 2. If so, what decision has been arrived at? To-day I received the following reply:It is contrary to practice to moke statements in relation to matters of policy in reply to questions. Wf. Baker. deThe position is that a definite stateresponsible Minister that the Government had decided to use . the proceeds from the i j i a n banana tariff to assist the banana growers. Incidentally, I have heard unofficially, but on good authority, that and it the Government authorized the Assistant Minister for Defence to make that state of ment, and that after he returned to Canberra it refused to accept responsibility - for it . In yesterday's issue of the Melbourne Age under the heading of on "" Queensland Notes "", the following parabanana growers. graph appears:Mr J.

I based my questions on the assumption that that the Government had decided to use the proceeds from the tariff on F i j i I bananas in assisting the banana-growers Australia, and in an endeavour to ascertain whether that would be an in fringement of the Constitution. The Government has avoided those questions, and I now ask whether it intends to contradict the three statements published by the Brisbane Courier and another statement which appeared in the Melbourne Age, or whether it will give a definite statement in regard to the whole matter ?",48
225,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,NAURU ISLAND,"Warringah-Postmaster-General ) [10.5] The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin ) has referred to certain postal matters. He mentioned what is of course a serious position in regard to the employment of a section of postal workers in Adelaide. I assure hi m that there is no rule in the department regarding the retirement of employees at 60 years of age. Retirement is governed by the necessities of the service, the amount of work to be done, and the efficiency of the staff. The position at the Adelaide Post Office is much as the honourable member has described it . 1 cannot, at the moment, vouch for the accuracy of the details which he has supplied, but the question of employment at that post office was reviewed by the Public Service Board, which recommended certain reductions of the staff. The Director-General paid a special visit to Adelaide to ascertain whether the proposals of the board could be modified or postponed. The matter has already been investigated on two or three occasions, but no real alternative has, up to the present, been found. Every effort is being made to prevent any undue hardship from being placed upon the employees concerned. In a service like the post office, which employs a tremendous number of men, much time is naturally taken up in providing adequate and efficient staffing arrangements. I assure the House that I am prepared to make every endeavour to retain as many men in the service as practicable. Where possible, redundant officers in one department will be absorbed in other departments. Unfortunately, during the present prevailing conditions, there are in almost every department of the Public Service redundant officers waiting to be absorbed into active employment. I assure the honourable member for Hindmarsh that I shall further investigate this matter, and make every effort to obviate the imposition of any hardship. The Henley Beach post office is probably an allowance post office.",49
226,Mr MAKIN,NAURU ISLAND,It is not.,50
227,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,NAURU ISLAND," There may be, at that post office, some special conditions of employment which make it necessary for it to be closed for a couple of hours a day for postal business, although, of course, the telephonic and telegraphic services continue in operation. Nevertheless, I shall have inquiries made into that matter.",50
228,Mr LYONS,NAURU ISLAND,"Wilmot-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [10.10] - The honourable member for Oxley (Mr Baker) has devoted both time aud energy to directing what he regards as embarrassing questions to the Government.

The honourable member has obmade tained all the advertisement that he is satisfied. [87] likely to get to-night. He thinks that he has submitted difficult questions, but now that they are about to be answered, he does not want to hear the answers. But he will get them. Since the time when the first communication came from Ottawa, notifying what had been done there, until now, the Assistant Minister for Defence has fought the case of the banana-growers; but, because he was not in the position to come into the House and get an advertisement by asking a series of questions, his work did not receive - any publicity. He was content to work on behalf of the banana growers, and he is deserving of their gratitude. There is really nothing embarrassing in the honourable member's questions.",50
229,Mr BAKER,NAURU ISLAND,Then answer them.,50
230,Mr LYONS,NAURU ISLAND,"If the honourable member will exercise a little patience, he will get his answers; but they will not be the answers he desires. The representations of the banana-growers were considered by the Government which, in turn, made representations overseas in order to ascertain whether the Ottawa agreement could be amended without losing it altogether. When it was found that that 4 could not be done, the Government decided that it would assist the industry in some other way; The banana-growers comprise the one section of the primary producers of Australia which; under the Ottawa agreement, is called upon to make a direct sacrifice in order that the primary producers generally may benefit, and, in the circumstances, I feel confident that those engaged in primary industries will agree that they are entitled to some consideration. The Government is prepared to give them some assistance, either directly from the revenue, or in some other way. As to the constitutionality of the Government's proposed action, I replied to the honourable member that the matter would probably nee,d legislation, and that, therefore, the Crown Law authorities would be consulted. There was no need for him to ask the same questions day after day.",50

235,Mr LYONS,NAURU ISLAND,"There is no doubt of the Government's power to grant assistance to the banana-growers.

The railway fares are being paid by the State Government. The'militar y personnel receive no extra pay and there is no additional cost to the Commonwealth Government, i 2. The settlers on the fringe of the wheat belt interviewed the Minister for Defence and pointed out that, owing to the dry spell inland, thousands of emus were damaging rabbitproof fences and devastating crops by rolling on them. The settlers stated that ordinary firearms were useless to stop the inroad of emus and requested that machine guns be loaned to them to destroy the birds. The Minister for Defence would not agree to allow the settlors the use of the machine guns but intimated his willingness to make available military personnel accustomed to operating the guns. The gun crews comprise one officer and two other ranks and two guns. 3. No. The reports (furnished show that some hundreds of emus are being destroyed and any expenses are being borne by the State Government and the settlers. 4.

241,Mr A GREEN,NAURU ISLAND,"the Minister for the Interior, upon notice I. Is it a fact that, on beer manufactured in Melbourne, the freight rate charged on the Commonwealth railways ' to Kalgoorlie is £7 10s. por ton, approximately equal to I d . per ton per mile, whilst the freight paid by the Kalgoorlie Brewery, for its constituent requirements for the processing of its product, is £10 10s. per ton for 375 miles of railage? 2. Is it a fact that the local brewers bare soveral other incidental charges on manufacture, due to their comparative remoteness from the seaboard, which is not borne by the breweries of Melbourne, who are ulso able lo pursue manufacture on mass-production methods ? 3. If the fucts are as stated, in view of the unfair competition to which this Western Australian industry is subjected by the "" cut"" rate concession granted over the Commonwealth railways to the Melbourne interests indicated, and in view of the comparative nonexistence of manufacturing industries in Western Australia, due to Hie keen competition of mass-production methods of big concerns in the east, will he see that these concessional rates oil the Commonwealth railways are withdrawn in order to remove the unfair competition to one of the few secondary industries of Western Australia?  honourable member's questions arc as follow:1. The freight from Melbourne to Kalgoorlie charged by the Victorian, Smith Australian and Commonwealth railways, totals £7 10s. per ton, equal to l.OOS pence per ton mile. Tho rate from Perth to Kalgoorlie (375 miles) for malt is £2 lis. per ton and for hops £8 3s. per ton. 2. I have no knowledge on this point. 3. It is not proposed to interfere 'with the existing arrangement. NA  the honourable member for Hunter (Mr . James) asked the following questions, upon notice:1.

Approximately two-thirds of the programme provides for the employment of unskilled labour. PRICE OF BUTTER .",51
242,Mr STEWART,UNEMPLOYME NT RELIEFWORKIN,"On the 8th November, the honourable member for Boothby (Mr. Price) asked the following questions, upon notice:1. Is the Paterson butter scheme operating in all the States of the Commonwealth? 2. Is it considered a compulsory scheme, although not a statutory measure? 3. Is it a fact that the best Australiau butter in London is at present 98s. to 100s. per cwt., or London price lOJd. per lb., plus producers' levy bounty of 3d. per lb., plus exchange of 2Jd. per lb., a total of Is. 4d. per lb., which represents world parity price? 4. It is a fact that the best wholesale price for butter in South Australia on which producers are paid is Is. l^d. per lb., less a levy of 1 }d. per lb., or a total of 11 Jdper lb. ? 5. What is the price per lb. paid by the Australian consumers for butter? (i. Is it a fact that it is estimated that the Paterson butter scheme is operating to the detriment of the consumers and the producers to the approximate amount of £8,000,000 per annum ? 7. Will the Minister explain how the Paterson butter scheme benefits Australia and her people: I am now able to furnish the following replies:1. The Paterson Butter Scheme operates in all States of the Commonwealth, except Western Australia. A somewhat similar CANJJEKUA. scheme is, however, in operation in that State. 2. It is not considered to be a compulsory scheme. 3. The wholesale price of best Australian butter (Kangaroo brand) in London today is 893. per cwt. or 9jd. per Ib., to this should lie added the bounty of 3d. per Ib. and exchange, making a total of approximately Is. 2Jd. per lb. After deducting freight, insurance, and handling charges, the return is Is. 02d. per Ib. If the levy of l j d . per Ib. be deducted the net return to the Australian exporter is approximately Ud. per lb. 4. In South Australia the wholesale price for bulk butter is 114s. 4(1. per cwt. or Is. 0}(l. pur Ib. Deduct the levy of I id. per lb. and the net return is approximately 10j(l. per lb. 5. The price paid for butter varies in the several capital citie?. The wholesale price ranges from Is. Old. per Ib. in Adelaide to Is. 3id. per lb in Brisbane. Retail prices are generally not less than 3d., and are up to 4d. per lb. above wholesale prices. 0. The Paterson plan is in operation primarily for the benefit of the Australian dairy farmer. Tho cost of the scheme is borne in the first instance by the consumers in Australia in the increased price which they pay for the product over the price which is 4>aid for butter sold on the London market. 't is not possible to estimate the total amount of the increased price. 7. The effect of the scheme is that the payment of a bonus on export raises the price of butter consumed within Australia, and increases the return to the producer.",52
