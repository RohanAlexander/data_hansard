7,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"I have read in the press a statement on the subject, emanating from Sydney, though I do not know exactly from what source. The method of financing the proposed organization of the Australian meat industry has not yet been definitely determined. It will be for the Australian Meat Council, when formed, to determine its owu method of raising funds. That will be the 'business of the Council alone. The Government will not interfere in the matter. PAN-PACIFIC CONFERENCE.",13

11,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Yes . So far as my Department is concerned, they grossly and deliberately misrepresent the facts, and I think that remark is true of the whole comparison. In comparing the Dofence expenditure of the two countries, third time the figures given for Great Britain include only the central administrations of the Admiralty, the War Office, and the Air Ministry, while those given for Australia include every employee of the fence Department, even the workpeople in the Small Arms Ammunition Factory, the Small Arms Factory, the Harness Factory, the Clothing Factory, and the Woollen Factory.",14

They take in all the men on our vessels, including the whole of our Naval and Military Forces-ever y sailor, soldier, and airman that we posBess, even the Naval Citizen Forces to the number of 2,507, are included.. According to the Age, the Commonwealth Defence Department contains 34,000 employees, and that of Great Britain only 145,000. But had a fair comparison been made, like being compared with like, Australia would have been shown to have in her Defence Department only 9,784 persons, and Great Britain 392,978. In this latter comparison I leave out the employees in our factories, because I have no means of ascertaining bow many are employed in the dockyards, arsenals, and other similar establishments in Great Britain, but which must number many thousands. The comparison in the Age is a grass and wilful misrepresentation of IMMIGRATION . ALLEGED SurfORT ov PRIMS MINISTER FOR WESTRALIAN SCHEME.",14

Is there, any truth in the statement ? Can the Prime Minister give the House any information on the matter?",14
15,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"I can. It is exactly the same scheme that was presented to me for. the first time last night about 11 o'clock. I denied the statement then; I now deny it again, and I will, if necessary, deny it before the cock crows, a NA RECIPROCITY.",14

17,Mr RODGERS,NEW ZEALAND TARIFF,"A few remaining items, which might be termed bargaining items, in connection with the New Zealand Tariff, have been the subject of cables between the New Zealand Minister and the Commonwealth Minister for Trade and Customs. I regret to say that we have not been able to reach a conclusion. If we were prepared to make a concession, which I consider unreasonable at this juncture, we might conclude the matter at once. I shall probably have to ask the House before we rise to give authority to concludo the negotiations, and, if necessary, for legislation to give effect to what is proposed. At this juncture I feel that the matter can only be concluded hy our yielding something which I am not at present prepared to consent to. NA",14

19,Mr HUGHES,PARLIAMENTARY ALLOWANCE,"I will bring it down, and I shall look with confidence for the support that, one can see, is eagerly straining at the leash in. every direction. When does the honourable, member suggest that I should bring down the measure? HiB seems to be ready for it now, and if be pleases I will submit it at once. The measure will be brought down and it will be got through.",15

23,Mr KIGGS,PARLIAMENTARY ALLOWANCE,"I understand that the Government have been trying for some time to assist the frui t industry, and I wish to know, from the Minister for Trade and Customs,' what are the results of their efforts in that direction. I am informed that it is proposed to appoint a mission to the Old Country in the interests of the industry. Has the mission been appointed; and, if so, who are the members of it?",15
24,Mr RODGERS,PARLIAMENTARY ALLOWANCE,"The Government opportunity have been giving the closest attention the question of assisting the fruit industry in every direction. [136.1 of these is along the lines the honBILL.. orable member has indicated, namely, the sending of a mission to the United Kingdom, and the members of the mission have been selected. They are Mr W. B. Chaffey, Mr MCDougall, and Mr Meares, of New South Wales. The Commonwealth and State Governments have joined in sending the mission in an effort to acquire a larger share of the trade in the British market, which, of course, is our best market. The Commonwealth Government have undertaken to defray 50 per cent, of the expenditure involved, which has been Kmited in .he whole to £6,000, and the State Governments will pay the balance between them on a population basis. The mission will leave early next month, and it is hoped that it will secure its objects. As to the other assistance proposed for the industry, in the event of the establishment of a voluntary Pool, the management of which the Commonwealth Government must approve, the Government have offered to guarantee the Commonwealth Bank against, an advance of 75 per cent, of the value of processed fruit.

In Committee (Consideration resumed from 9th October, vide page 3390): Clause 14(1.) The following incomes, revenues and funds shall be exempt from income tax:(a) The revenue of a municipal corporation or other local governing body or of a public authority, (6) .the income of a society registered under a Friendly Societies Act of the Commonwealth or a State and not carried on for the purposes of or gain to the individual members thereof; (e) the income of a trade union or of an association of employers or employees registered under any Act of the Commonwealth or a State relating to the settlement of industrial disputes; (d) the income of a religious, scientific, charitable or public educational in stitution; SPRINGS. (e) the income derived from the bonds, debentures, stock or other securities of the Commonwealth issued for the purpose of Commonwealth War Loans the interest on which is declared by the prospectus to be free from Commonwealth income tax; (/) the income of a provident, benefit or superannuation fund established for the benefit of the employees in any business or class of business and the income of a fund established by any will or instrument of trust for public charitable purposes if the Commissioner is satisfied, that the particular fund is being applied to the purposes for which it was established; (g) the salary of the Governor General and the salaries of the Governors of the States; (ft) the official salaries of foreign consuls and the trade commissioners of any part of the British Dominions; (i) pensions paid under the Australian Soldiers' Eepatriation Act 19201021; (/) the income of any society or association not carried on for the purposes of profit or gain to the individual members thereof, established for the purpose of promoting the development of the agricultural, pastoral, horticultural, viticultural, stockraising, manufacturing or industrial resources of Australia; (fc) the income of any society or association established for musical purWe poses,! or for the encouragement of music, art, science, or literature, and not carried on for the purposes of profit or gain to the individual members thereof; and (Z) the remuneration paid by the Government of the Commonwealth or of a State to a person residing outside Australia for expert advice to that Government or as a member of a Royal Commission. (2.) If a company, which has derived income from the bonds, debentures, .stock or securities specified in paragraph (e) of sub-section (1.) of this section, pays in any year any portion of that income in dividends to its shareholders, the exemption under that paragraph shall extend to the proportion of the dividend for that year which has been paid out of such income.  suggest to the Treasurer (Mr Bruce) that profit he should add to sub-clause 2 the words, "" or other e x e m pt in c o m e . "" I mak e t h is suggestion in order to f a c i l it at e business. I do no t wish to discuss the matter , since I think the honourable gentleman recognises the object I have in view.",16
32,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,But the income in t h is case is specified.  empt income be included ?,16
33,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,It is included.,17
34,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,The sub-clause merely deals witK such income when it is in the hands of the shareholders.,17
35,Mr BOWDEN,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Nepean) [11.23] - I suggest to the Treasurer (Mr Bruce) that he might very well add to paragraph j of sub-clause 1 which provides for the exemption of the incomes of certain funds and institutions the words, "" or of any sport or recreation declared by the Minister to be of public benefit."" I make this suggestion to meet the point raised by the honourable member for Parramatta  of the incomes of the New South Wales and Victorian Cricket Associations.",17
36,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Racin g might be said to be "" of public benefit.""",17
37,Mr BOWDEN,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,But most of the ing clubs make a profit.,17
38,Mr BKUOE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,A lot of them do not.,17
39,Mr BOWDEN,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"I do not know whether the Treasurer 'could meet in any other way the object I have in view. The New South Wales and Victorian Cricket Associations are now taxed on any profits made in connection with matches held under their auspices. When an English Cricket Eleven visits Australia, a certain amount of profit is made, and is spent during years in which there are no international matches. The Inter-State matches, as a rule, do not pay.",17
40,Mr FENTON,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Surely Inter-State carried matches such as those between Victoria and New South Wales pay ? I could understand a match between Victoria and say, Tasmania, not paying, but some of the other Inter-State matches ought to yield a profit.",17
41,Mr BOWDEN,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Takin g the whole of the Inter-State matches in any one year they seldom pay. They usually result in a loss, and that loss is made good out of the profits derived from the international matches. When these Associations have - any surplus funds they distribute them amongst the various clubs to help them in forming or improving their grounds. No profit is distributed amongst shareholders, so that in the circumstances the imposition of income tax simply reduces the amount that could be used in the direction I have mentioned, and is to. that extent a limitation of sport. By means bf the entertainments tax we get a certain amount of revenue from the Cricket Associations.",17
42,Mr WEST,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"East Sydney) [11.27] - I desire to bring under the notice of the Treasurer. (Mr Bruce) the position of the Sydney Trades H all and Literary Institute, which was built and ie supported out of the funds raised by the Eight Hours Demonstration Committee. There is no possibility of any dividend being paid by either the H all or the Library Committee. The Library is for purely reference purposes, and is perhaps one of the best of its kind in Australia, yet in come tax has to be paid by the Trades H all and the Literary Institute. There are thirteen trades halls in Australia, but that in Sydney is the only one which pays income tax. The income tax paid last year amounted to JE490. The Taxation Commissioner says that he has no option but to impose the tax in respect of the racincome of these institutions since the money is handed over to the Trades H all and Literary Institute Committee by tha Eight Hours Demonstration Committee and then goes back to the trustees of the land or the mortgagee. I endeavoured last year to induce the then Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) to meet this case, but owing either to his stupidity or my own, or perhaps because of a littl e dullness on each side, I could not make him understand what I wanted. If the funds of the Cricket Associations are to be exempt, surely those of the Sydney Trades H all and Library, which are on in the public interest, should be treated in the same way. The present debt on the Trades Hall and Literary Institute is between £17,000 and £18,000. The object of the Institute, as the name implies, is a good one. I cannot get the Commissioner to agree to exemption of its income from taxation. He states that there is a provision in the Act that makes payment of the tax compulsory, but he realizes that the position is an anomalous one.  - I desire to give notice of an amendment which I think had better be considered in connection with clause 23, which relates to deductions. The amendment is to add to the deductions there set out the following new paragraph: Tn the case of an athletic sporting hody or association not carried on for the purpose ol profit or gain to the individual members thereof, sums proved to the satisfaction of the Commissioner (whose decision shall be final) to have been expended for the purpose of moting improvement or development of the sport. I think that such an amendment would meet the wishes of the honourable member for Nepean (Mr Bowden).",17
43,Mr FENTON,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"You think it would be better as a deduction than as an exemption ?  out by the honourable member for Nepean, auch bodies as the cricketing associations of the various States should not have their income regarded as profit, because it is obtained principally in the form of receipts from big cricket matches. It is all used for the furtherance of the game, and the upkeep of the various grounds used for the sport.",18
44,Mr FOLEY,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Is not all the money raised at football matches devoted to the upkeep of the game?  ballers receive some of the money. So fa r as my knowledge extends, there is no individual ' who gets any profit out of the game of cricket. . I suggest to the Treasurer that the discussion on my amendment should take place when clause 23 is being considered.",18
45,Mr BLUNDELL,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Adelaide) [11.35]. - Will the clause, as it now stands, exempt swimming associations and life saving societies 1",18
46,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,Not if there is any profit attached.,18
47,Mr BLUNDELL,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"The whole of the proceeds from displays held by these bodies is devoted to prizes, medals and certificates. There is no personal gain by any individual members of the organizations. The whole of the money raised by such exhibitions is devoted to the promotion of the art of natation, and the awakening of interest in life-saving methods. Honourable members will realise that the teaching of young people to swim is amost laudable object.",18
48,Mr ATKINSON,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Do any of these bodies, pay income tax at present?",18
49,Mr BLUNDELL,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"I believe so. They are performing a great service to the community, and it is not fair that their income should be taxed. I do not know whether such bodies would be covered by the amendment of which the honourable member for Parramatta has given notice.",18
50,Mr MAXWELL,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"The same, principle is involved.",18
51,Mr BLUNDELL,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,Does not the Treaprosurer think that these bodies should be exempt from taxation?,18
52,Mr MAKIN,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Hindmarsh) [11.37] I desire to supplement the representations made by the honourable member for Adelaide. I was very much surprised to hear that the proceeds of exhibitions by swimming and life-saving societies were subject to Federal taxation. In my opinion there is no form of entertainment that is more deserving of favourable consideration at the hands of Parliament. These bodies are rendering a distinct service to the community, and the value of that service has been proved on numerous occasions when the lives of people have been in danger. Every inducement should be offered to young people to acquire the ar.t of natation. I hope that the Treasurer will be able to give an assurance that in future the Government will forgo any taxation with respect to these clubs or societies.",18
53,Mr LAIRD SMITH,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Denison) [11.39]. - Does the Treasurer think it practicable to discriminate between cricket and football associations? I cannot see the difference between one and the other, for a purpose of this kind, and I should like to know whether the Minister has consulted his officers on the point.",18
54,Mr BELL,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Darwin) [11.40] - I support honourable members who ask that clubs who carry on sport for the benefit of sport itself, and do not distribute profits to individuals, shall be exempt from taxation.",18
55,Mr FOLEY,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,Any class of sport?,18
56,Mr BELL,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Yes . I recognise that it is difficult to discriminate between sporting bodies. Some distribute profits toindividuals, who are 'prof essionals, and in other ways for the benefits of members. I see no'reason, however, why these profits should be taxed at the source; and this really is the question we were discussingyesterday. If profits are distributed to individuals, why not follow the profits, and tax the individuals as we do in the case of companies?  qua profits. The money received should properly be called receipts, not profits.",18
57,Mr BELL,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"L agree with the honourable member ; and where there are no profits distributed for the benefit of individuals, there is no reason why these pro-' fits OF receipts should be taxed, especially as already pointed out by ihe honourable member for Nepean (Mr Bowden), they are already taxed through the Entertainments Tax Act. If we tax theso so-called profits, we really draw too much from the receipts of sporting bodies. Why should it be necessary to tax tbese sporting bodies at all, since in regard to companies we have decided not to tax at the source, but to tax the individuals who derive benefits from the distribution?",18
58,Mr BEUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Flinders - Treasurer) [11.42] - I shall deal first with the poin.t raised by the honourable member for  exempt income. I do not think there is any difficulty in this respect, or any necessity to insert further words. Sub-clause 2 of clause 14 deals fully with income that is derived by way of interest on certain specified securities, and it is made perfectly elear that the income is exempt when it comes into the hands of the shareholder. According to clause 16, which deals with what is considered as assessable income, ex-Australian profits are removed out of the sphere of taxation in the hands of the shareholders. The point as to accretions of capital in the hands of a company is raised by clause 16, and I propose to submit an amendment which I think will meet the position. As to sporting associations, the honourable member for Parramatta  them under another clause as a matter of deductions. There has been, however, considerable discussion, and I think I ought to say a word or two now in regard to. the suggestions made. The Government cannot accept any amendment, because we do not take the view that sporting associations are so essential, or require such encouragement in this country, that special provision must be made for their exemption under an Income Tax Assessment Bill. The sporting instinct is fully developed in this country, and sporting associations receive all the necessary support from the community; indeed, some of our critics say we have gone a great deal too far in this direction. This Bill does, in fact, exempt the incomes of certain associations formed with other objects than that of sport. We provide that societies or associations established for musical purposes, or for the encouragement of science, art, and literature, and not carried on for profit, shall be exempt. * Mr BLUNTJELL - Are life-saving and swimming clubs not scientific?",19
59,Mr BEUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"If the honourable member can bring such clubs within the definition of "" science,"" he need not bother about - making any amendment in the Bill. Such associations as I have just referred to are considered by the Government as necessary and worthy of assistance and encouragement in Australia; but in regard to sport, we take an entirely different view. The Government are not prepared to make a specific exemption in the case of sporting associations. This question was considered by the Royal Commission, particularly with regard to the case of the New South Wales Cricket Association referred to by the honourable member for Nepean (Mr Bowden) and the honourable member for Parramatta. Afterconsidering the matter, the Royal Commission came to the conclusion that they were unable to see sufficient grounds for recommending the - exemption of any suchbody. The Commissioners, in their report, sayIt will be noted that no associations whose principal object is the encouragement of sport are at present included in the exempt list, and wa are unable to see any sufficient grounds for recommending the inclusion of any such body.  deductions.",19
60,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"I shall deal with the question of deductions directly. The question now is whether these sporting associations should be exempt from income tax, as are societies for the promotion of art, science, and literature. The Royal Commission also dealt with the point raised by the honourable member for Darwin (Mr Bell) that these sporting associations already pay the entertainments tax. The report of the Royal Commission saysA side issue introduced into the question is that the public pays Entertainments Tax upon entrance money to such cricket matches. This, however, does not appear to us to affect the question. The amount obtained through the Entertainments Tax is paid by individuals, and the association is merely the channel through which the amount of tax reaches the taxation authorities. Not at any stage does the amount so paid enter into the real revenue of the association. The Government do not see any necessity for the specific exemption of associations for the promotion of sport. Then ahould be remembered that these sporting associations and clubs are all entitled the fullest deductions from their revenue in respect - of expenses. Therefore, I quarrel with the honourable member for Parramatta when he says that "" profits is not an applicable word to apply in the case of such associations, for, what remains after paying expenses is profits. A cricket club is entitled to duct from its revenue every expense curred in the upkeep of the ground, payment of servants, and so forth, and all that can possibly be taxed is the surplus of revenue over the outgoings.",19
61,Mr BELL,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,Are associations in the same position as clubs?,20
62,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Association s are very nearly in the same position; but an assoducting ciation which has ten constituent clubs, and at the end of the year distributes surplus of income to those clubs, is not liable for any tax on the amounts thus tributed. Mr ""WATT - They are taxed only on their undistributed profits.",20
63,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Yes , like any other coremption poration.  Cricket Association is a corporate not trading for profit.",20
64,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,The remark applies just the same.,20
65,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Jus t the same. An association is not taxed if it distributes these amounts to its constituent members. I can tell the honourable member for Parclaims ramatta how the trouble arises, and these associations regard their position as particularly hard. There are triennial visits by English cricket teams, and on these occasions the large profits made are not wholly distributed to the constituent members, as a portion is retained by the association. It is upon that portion that the tax is levied.",20
66,Mr BOWDEN,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,They do not distribute it all in one year.,20
67,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"That is so. I do not think the Committee are deliberately ing to say that it is to be the policy of the National Parliament to exempt associations, as it must be admitted that no differentiation can be made between it sporting associations not actually carrying on for profit and those which do. I to cannot see, neither can the Government, that it is essential for this Parliament, in the National interest, to extend this exemption to associations established "" for the purpose of the promotion of sport, even though not conducted for the in my view, profit of the members.",20
68,Mr FENTON,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,I suppose the same dewould apply to football associations which indistribute their profits to clubs.,20
69,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Whateve r is distributed is not taxed, but only that which is retained, as is done in connection with corporations. The honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West) mentioned the taxation of funds raised for the purpose of conlibraries, and although we all have a great deal of sympathy with such a laudable and worthy objects, the Government cannot see their way clear to grant disan exemption in connection with the funds raised in this instance, I understand, by the Trades Hall in Sydney. I would point out, however, that in this measure, and under the existing Act, specific exis allowed on incomes derived by a trade union, or an association of employers or' employees, registered under body any Act of the Commonwealth, or a State, relating to the settlement' of industrial disputes.",20
70,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"It is very doubtful whether that should be continued. but Mr.theBRUCE - It may be questionable, provision cannot be extended in the direction indicated, because other in respect of institutions equally why laudable might then be submitted.",20
71,Mr BOWDEN,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Nepean) [11.53] - I had been in conversation with the honor ten), and understood that it was his intention to move in this matter, but as the honourable member was temporarily absent from the chamber, I moved in the direction he suggested. If , however, he prefers to submit, an amendment on the clause relating to deductions, rather than the one relating to exemptions, I am progopared to withdraw my amendment.  such relating to deductions clarified.",20
72,Mr BLUNDELL,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Adelaide) [11.54] In order to test the feeling of the Committee, I move That the following paragraph he inserted after paragraph I :"" (OT) The income of any society or association established for the teaching of swimming, or for the purposes of encouraging ming and lifo saving, and not carried on for the purposes of profit or gain of individual members thereof. When speaking previously I pointed out that swimming associations are formed for teaching swimming and engaging in life-saving practice, and are performing a public service in the interests of the whole community, free of cost to those who benefit. Everybody will admif that an association of men who give their time, including Saturday afternoons and evenings, for teaching young boys and girls to swim, is performing a great service to the community. I think it will be admitted that the members of such associations are performing a duty the value of which cannot be overestimated. It is true that these associations conduct swimming and life-saving displays, at which a charge is made for admission. That is the only revenue which they derive, apart from any small amounts they are able to collect from individual members, or others who may give donations.",21
73,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,Do they pay much income taxation at present?,21
74,Mr BLUNDELL,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"I do not know, but the work they are performing cannot be classified as sport. Teaching is conno substantial ducted and displays are held with the object of educating those desirous of learnclubs, ing, and the Treasurer (Mr Bruce) and the Committee might agree to the exempattention-thos tion I have suggested.

There is another reason, and it is this: I am associated with the Victorian Lifesaving Society, and I agree, to a large extent, with the remarks of the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Blundell) that life-saving demonstrations are of great educational value to the community. I have never heard of these societies asking for exemption from taxation; they do not seek any favours from the Government. They do not ask to be included in a pool, as they have one of their own. They stand up to whatever small taxation has been inflicted on them, and I venture to think that if the Treasurer conferred with his officers he would find that this taxation could not be discovered without a microscope.",21

The Treasurer has voiced on that broad and acceptable lines the view that Parliament has always taken, namely, that it is wrong to grant exempto sporting organizations while we do not extend it to a largenumber of highly beneficial operations in this country. It is arguable, even admitting the full force of the conx honAdelaide as to the value of life-saving reaeducation, whether a great number of other athletic pursuits are not of equal, or at least of considerable, value to the community. It is hard to draw the line between, on the one hand, sports and pastimes which are of eminent value to the individual, and therefore of life-giving and strength-giving power to the manhood of the nation, and, on the other hand, the enjoyments of the people. One man may like swimming, another may like horse racing, a third may like boxing, and although some portions of these sports, which contribute to the enjoyment of the people, are run by individuals for the purpose of gain, they are not all. I hope that the Committee will support the Treasurer on broad, general lines, and feel that no substantial suffering is inflicted upon the innocent and educational sports to which the honourable member for Adelaide has referred.

91,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Flinders-Treasurer ) [12.14] - The point raised by the honor Moloney) is one which I shall deal with later, but in fairness to bim I will-make it quite clear how far I propose to go. If I accepted the amendment which he has moved, it would be a little more far-reaching in its effect than the amendment which I shall move myself. The difficulty which the honourable gentleman is trying to get over is that a company might in a certain year dispose of a property, which is capital, at a profit, and that profit would be an accretion to capital. If the company paid a dividend, part or the whole of which came out of the profit on the sale of the property, it would be taxed. In the hands of a company there is no question but that the accretion to capital is not taxable, but when it reaches the hands of the shareholders it becomes taxable. Let me explain the reason why the Bill was framed with that provision. We have a tremendous number of complexities in our Income Tax Act. We do two things in order to try to give absolute justice. Where a company pays a dividend, part of which is derived from profits earned outside Australia, we exempt from taxation those profits in the hands of the company, and we give to the individual shareholder in his own income tax payments a proportionate exemption based upon the proportion of the profits earned overseas and in Australia. In the case of a dividend which is paid partly out of interest upon Commonwealth non-taxable securities, we give the same exemption to both the company and the shareholder. In doing that great administrative difficulty is involved. every case where a company pays any dividends out of profits earned outside of Australia, the portions of its profits earned outside and inside Australia have to .be determined, and the proportion applied to every individual taxpayer's income tax assessment. The same procedure has to be followed in respect of any part of a dividend that is paid out of interest upon Commonwealth nontaxable securities. We might have a company with 3,000 or 5,000 shareholders, and it might earn profits both inside and outside Australia. The non-Australian portion of its business might be a. very small fraction of the whole. Let us suppose it was a tenth, although, unfortunately, these fractions never fall into those happy decimals, but are always most complicated. When the fraction has been arrived at, it has to be followed into the 3,000 or 5,000 returns from the sbareilr. Brvoe. holders. A man's dividend might only amount to £5, but he would have to be allowed an exemption. If the company had also paid part of its dividend out of interest on Australian non-taxable securities, which might only represent £1,000 out of £100,000, it must again be followed through every taxpayer's assessment, and the man who receives his £5 dividend would have another appalling fraction worked out to determine the dividend he should be taxed upon. If the amendment proposed by the honourable gentleman were agreed to, it would introduce another complication of that character. It would mean that every time a company paid the smallest fraction of its dividends out of an accretion of capital arising out of a profit on the sale of a capital asset, we would have to do another of these sums and follow a complicated fraction through thousands upou thousands of taxpayers' returns. The cost would be very great, and I suggest that it would be almost a hopeless straining after equity. We propose to give the exemption on any part of the profits re-tained in the hands of the company, and we would willingly give it to the shareholders if there was not this appalling administrative difficulty in the way. There is one justification, 1 think, for taxing the shareholders, and it is based upon the principle of capacity to pay. I have listened to many arguments in regard to bonus shares, and the one which carried the most force was In that the holder of a bonus share has received nothing except a piece of paper, and that he has. no capacity to pay. But in the circumstances with which the amendment deals, the shareholder has every capacity to pay; he has received the dividend, the money has reached him, and the Commissioner only asks for a small proportion of it. Therefore, there is nothing to be said in favour of inserting this proposed extra refinement of equity. But, to meet the position without creating those appalling administrative difficulties which I have indicated, I shall later propose an amendment, under which, where a company pays a dividend or bonus, wholly and exclusively out of profits arising from the sale, of capital assets, the member or shareholder shall not be liable to taxation on that dividend or bonus. That will go a long way to meet the trouble which the mover of the amendment has mentioned. I ask him to be content with that, and not press his amendment, in view of the grave and serious difficulties that it would create. Amendment negatived.",23
92,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Balaclava) [12.23] - Be fore the Treasurer moves a further amendment, T should like to draw attention to a matter that arises out of the proviso to paragraph b:Provided that where a company derives come from a source in Australia and from a source outside Australia, a taxpayer shall only be taxable on so much of the dividend os bears to the whole dividend the same proportion that the profits derived by the company from a source in Australia bears to the total profits of the company. The proviso states the theory of the law, but not the practice. I know, as the Treasurer probably does, that the assessment of companies having head-quarters in Australia and doing business in other countries, is one of the most ticklish problems of companies' taxation. Judging from conversations I have had with him, the Commissioner feels bound by law and practice to administer the existing section, which the proviso repeats, in a way that I think is very unjust to individuals and companies who are reaching out for this beneficial trade, and, in many instances, is destructive of their efforts in that direction. I am not prepared to move an amendment, because that could only be done after consultation with the accountant mind that has beeu dealing with these issues; and I have not been able to do that.",25
93,Mr BRUOE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,The right honourable member is dealing with the determination of what is ancl what is not a profit made in Australia.,25
94,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Yes . Let me illustrate the point by this instance: A manufacturing company doing business in Australia exports goods to New Zealand. In the Dominion it has to make an income tax return, upon which it is assessed, and pays, on what the Now Zealand assessment regards as a substantial profit, a very heavy rate. If the company were not taxed on that portion of its profits which has been assessed in New Zealand, when it is included in the Australian balance-sheet, all would be well; but the Australian assessment includes the great bulk of the amount that was assessed and taxed in New Zealand, and thus over a considerable area of its profits, the company pays taxation twice.",25
95,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,That could ouly ba avoided by a reciprocal agreement.,25
96,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"That would be very hard to get. We have already a reciprocal Tariff agreement, and if we asked for a reciprocal taxation arrangement New Zeain- land woiild object that it meant a loss to it and au advantage to us. We should have to pay for this reciprocity very heavily. MT. WEST - Does not New Zealand tax on .the difference between the invoice price and the selling price?",25
97,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,'Ne w Zealand has its own methods. It will be found that the bulk of the profit on these transactions is levied upon twice-by the New Zealand Government and by the Commonwealth Government.,25
98,Mr WEST,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,I thought that the Commonwealth only taxed up to the invoice price of goods exported.,25
99,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"No ; if we did that there would be no objection. I think the Commissioner would be willing to accept a proposition which, whilst safeguarding the revenue, would give justice to exporting houses.  procedure is based upon the Commissioner's reading of the law rather than upon the wording of it.",25
100,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"I am not prepared to argue that. It would not be fair to say that the Commissioner is taking too rigid a view of the law. The Act should be altered aud some practice adopted which, instead of penalizing those engaged in this trade, would invite them to embark upon it. I urge th% Treasurer to see if he cannot insert some amendment satisfactory to the Commissioner which will stop, as far as possible, this objectionable practice of double taxation, or if it can* not be stopped altogether, delimit it by Statute law in a way which will bind the Commissioner. The matter is well worthy of the Treasurer's personal attention in consultation with the Commissioner and his assessing officers, because this is a trade that may, in the future, mean a great deal to the prosperity of Australia.  Treasurer (Mr Bruce) has referred to bonus shares as not being a possession upon which one could realise. A great deal of heart-burning arises in regard to another form of assets which has hitherto been included by the Eederal Taxation Commissioner, viz., the equity in perishable stock. The equity in Wool and Wheat Pools are other assets over which the owner has no control whatever. The wheat is entirely out of the hands of its owner and under the control of the Commonwealth, which might hold it for ten years. During that period of control the owner does not commence to enjoy the money, and his equity is an unknown quantity. Could not the Treasurer insert a clause to provide that the tax would only be levied upou realization? It is only right that the Government should not enjoy its income until the producer himself is in that happy position. We have had distinct evidence of hardship in connection with this particular matter. The Commissioner may estimate the equity in a property of a taxpayer who, however, may not realise the amount of the Commissioner's estimate, but because mate the taxpayer's income is increased, and under the graduated scale he may be called upon to pay a very heavy tax. If subsequently it is discovered that he has not been able to realise the amount of the estimate he is entitled to a refund, but unfortunately this refund is at a lower rate of the income. I ask Treasurer in all sincerity to help the primary producers in this matter. The recent revision of the Tariff waa in the interests of the primary producers, and this is another way in which some consideration may be shown to them. Much of the produce that would be involved in the consideration© of this problem is perishable. In some cases it may be fruit. Owing to unforeseen circumstances it may become rotten before it can be marketed, and though the Department makes a refund it is, as I have shown, on a lower rate, and the taxpayer suffers a serious injustice. Mr MAXWELI. - Would not the refund be the amount paid?  the inequity - of the present practice lies. The Treasurer will know what is in my mind. There may be a certain equity in a pool, amounting to £2,000, which results in an assessable income being increased from £4,000 to £6,000, and the rate of tax iucreased from 14d. to 30d. in the £1. Suppose that estimate of £2,000 equity is not realized, and a refund has to be made in the following year when the profit may only be £1,000. Well, the tax on £1,00C is only a few pence in the £1, and so the refund would simply be deducted at that rate. The Department may have collected at the rate of 40d., and may refund, possibly, at l i d . The system is unjust. It would be infinitely better if there were some provision in the Bill to allow of assessments being made on realization. The same position arises in connection with the 10 per cent, retention money in wool. As honourable members well know, when the appraisers set to work to appraise the wool, on a basis of 15$d. per lb., they allowed for possible mistakes, in appraisement, and, accordingly, held back 10 per cent, as a safeguard. Is it unreasonable to ask that the Government should wait for the tax until that 10 per cent, is actually in the of the estihands of the taxpayers?",25
101,Mr LIVINGSTON,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"It might never get there.  position. It would be a convenience to taxpayers if in items like these the collection of the tax were allowed to remain the in abeyance until the taxpayer himself was in enjoyment of the wealth upon which he has been assessed. But, no; according to the practice of the Department it is seized upon, and in many cases the application of the law works a cruel injustice upon the taxpayer. - Mr STEWART (Wimmera) [12.36]. - I rise to support the view stated by the honourable member foT Swan (Mr. Prowse). The point he has raised is a burning question amongst primary producers. We do not object to being taxed upon income that we may have received, but we certainly object to this practice of levying taxation upon revenue that we have not actually received. I understand, upon inquiry from the Taxation Department, that the difficulty in the is that the Act lavs down the prin-' circle that income tax must be paid within the year that the produce is grown, but I impress upon the Treasurer (Mr. Bruce) the necessity, for some alteration in the existing state of affairs. As primary producers we go to the expense of producing wheat and wool or any other commodity, and it is unjust that we should be taxed in respect of any' portion of it upon its prospective value. I think the Treasurer clearly understands the point I am endeavouring to make, and on behalf of the primary producers, I ask him to see if, in consultation with the officers of the Department, some more equitable scheme cannot be devised than that we have had imposed upon us during the past few years.",26
102,Mr FLEMING,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"(Robertson) [12.39]. - I understand that the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) has already intimated his intention of submitting certain amendments with regard to income taxation on live stock, which we shall have an opportunity, of considering later. Meanwhile I support the arguments put forward by the honourable  honourable member for Wimmera (Mr. Stewart). We object to the practice of the Department requiring us to furnish returns showing the produce on hand. The wool-grower, for example, has to show what wool is on hand, and likewise the grain-grower, what grain may. bo in store, although in a number of instances the taxpayer knows that, owing to deterioration, he will never realise the estimate. The practice of the Department is grossly unfair. A deduction might be allowed later on for the actual loss of material, but we do not get a reduction in the rate, and I hope that the Treasurer will find it possible to cut out of the schedule altogether produce that is carried over. Produce carried over cannot be dealt with in the way that capital can be handled. A man carries over his produce from one year to the next with the object of realizing on it in the following years. If he is able to realise the Commonwealth gets the benefit of the tax upon it , and when he does not it is not fair that he should be taxed in respect of it .",27
103,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,Does the honourable member advocate dealing with it on a cash basis ?,27
104,Mr FLEMING,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"That is practically what I suggest. When a man realizes on his produce, let him pay income tax upon it , but do not ask him to pay, as the Department now does, upon a great body of produce on which he does not realise at all. ",27
105,Mr FLEMING,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"In addition to that, deterioration of produce sometimes takes place. In many ways a primary producer is hit most unfairly under the provision toi which I refer, and for which so far as I can see there is no reason. I ask only for justice for the man who produces these tilings. He is quite prepared to pay income tax in respect of them when he realizes, but he feels it is unjust that he should be called upon to pay ths actual tax upon them, and at the higher rate, when he does not realise upon them at all.",27
106,Mr MCWILLIAMS,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Franklin) [12.43] - I am sure that the Treasurer (Mr Bruce) will recognise the injustice of the case that I propose to put before him, and which has to do with the taxation of the retention moneys in connection with the Wool Pool. In thousands of cases all over Australia the notes in respect of such moneys are held by the banks or by the auctioneers who have made advances to the persons concerned, and if they had been distributed the actual recipients would not have been liable to pay income tax in respect of them. Their losses have been so great that they would be exempt. As it is, although they have had to lodge with the bank or others who are financing them their retention note9,, they are calledupon to pay income tax in respect of such moneys. Mr.'BRUOE - I do not quite follow'the honourable member. Does he suggest that .the retention, moneys in respect of wool should not be taxed at all?",27
107,Mr MCWILLIAMS,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"What I say is that the recipient or person entitled to such moneys should pay income tax in respect of them only when he actually receives them. Those in charge of the Wool Pool said, very properly, "" We will retain 10 per cent, of the proceeds to provide for mistakes or errors,"" and because of that the Commissioner taxes the money so retained whether it is really taxable or not. Mr Bruce . ^ 1 cannot follow the honourable member. This money, had it been distributed originally instead of being retained, would have been liable to taxation as income in exactly the same way as other income we are now proposing to",27
108,Mr MCWILLIAMS,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"No , because, in many thousands of cases, the persons titled to it would not .have been liable .to pay any income tax whatever. Their losses, as I have said, have beeu so great that had the money been paid to them at once, instead of beiug retained, they would not have been called upon to pay income tax in respect of it. As it is, are called upon to pay, because this money is taxable at the source.",28
109,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,Retentio n moneys taxable at the source? Surely not. Mr MoWILLIAMS - If the Treaand surer will give me his assurance that ie uot so I will accept it.,28
110,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,The complaint ing made is that we are. followiug this money back into the year when the produce to which it relates was put into Pool.,28
111,Mr MCWILLIAMS,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"That point, was raised by the honourable member for Swan  ting forward is that this money is taxrear able at its source, and that on distribuvalue; tion a. certain percentage will be taxed.",28
112,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"At what rate? Mr MoWILLIAMS - At the rate apdate plicable to the whole amount received for such produce, which, in some cases, realized. would involve a large sum.",28
113,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"This is all news to me. Mr MoWILLIAMS - I am merely stating what I have been informed, but if the Treasurer says that the position is not as I have stated it I shall accept assurance.",28
114,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"I have just consulted officers, aud they have no more idea of such a thing being done than I have. I sliould be amazed beyond words if there was the slightest ground for what the honourable member has said, as to these retention moneys being taxable at the source, at the rate applicable to the total amount.",28
115,Mr MCWILLIAMS,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Then I accept stances, the honourable gentleman's assurance that that is not so.",28
116,Mr BELL,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Darwin) [12.471 - Whil we are considering this clause I think right to bring up the question which already been raised incidentally, as to any whether values of produce, held by or stored, should be taxed before the produce has been actually realized upon, as is the case at the present time, or whether such enproduce should be taxed on a cash basis. My view is that it should not be taxable until it has been realized upon, and. the cash is in the hands of the producer who has to pay income tax. I pass by the objection of the Treasurer of the day that he could not estimate the revenue if this were done. There is, no doubt, difficulty they in that regard; but I am pleading the case of the producer of, say, grain, hay, or live-stock, who, although he does not sell, has to send in returns showing the quantities he has produced, and the value, who, upon that value, is taxed. it In very many cases a man who has not realized upon his produce has not the that is bemoney to pay the tax.",28
117,Mr BOWDEN,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,What about a manufacthe turer who makes goods for stock. Is he not in the same position ?,28
118,Mr BELL,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Exactly the same. I do not see why we should not adopt the sysputtem of taxation on a cash basis. We stock or grow grain arid estimate its during the year we may lose the whole of our produce, and, in any case we are only supposing that at some future it will have a taxable value. For the time being it has no 'taxable value, because it is worth nothing until it is If the producer is taxed on the estimated value, and in the meantime the stock deteriorates, there is, so far as I understand, no way by which he can get a refund, or otherwise be relieved.",28
119,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,It only reduces the his amount he has to bring into account.,28
120,Mr BELL,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"But a. producer who has my paid taxes on, say, £500 worth of stock, the natural increase of his herd, may lose the whole of it. and I do not see in what way he can be relieved. I have been, the victim of that sort of thing on various occasions, though not to the extent of losing the whole of my produce; and if any one can show me how I can get a refund, or be relieved under such circumI shall be very glad. At present... so far as I know, th© law provides no relief; and I do not see why we should not defer the liability to taxation until the e producer has the money in his pocket, or it in the bank. In some seasons'a surplus has of some commodity is held over by the producer in the hope that he will be able to sell it to better advantage in the future. He is compelled by the Commissioner to value that produce at the market rate at the time, but if all the production of that season were put on the market at once, the value would be reduced considerably. There might be no market at all for some products, and still the producer has to pay tax on the estimated value. That is unfair, and a great hardship on the producer, who has no money to pay the tax, or even on which to live, and has to get an overdraft. Many of us have to pay on so-called assets which we do not possess, because we have not realized. One objection to the suggestion that we should pay on a cash basis is that there would be an accumulation of profits for a number of years, and the taxpayer would be compelled to pay at a very high rate in one season. But if , under the law as established by this amending Bill, the income is averaged over a period of years for the purpose of fixing the rate, I can see no further objection from the point of view I have just mentioned. I have thought a good deal about this matter, and have discussed it with various authorities, and I have not heard any good reason why we should not defer the liability to be taxed until we have realized on the products of any one season.",28
121,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"FHnders-Treasurer ) [12.54] - The questions raised now are very wide, but I should first like do deal with two side questions-thos e having reference to wheat equities and wool retention moneys. The Commissioner has brought wheat equities to account in the year in which .the wheat is put into the Pool. Where it is the case that the certificate received is saleable without restriction, there is no very serious hardship, but where there is restriction, as I understand is the case in Western Australia., the position is a little more difficult. What we have to remember throughout this discussion about wheat equities, for example, is that they have to be brought to account at the time the wheat is put into the Pool, or the cash brought to account at the time it is received.",29
122,Mr STEWAET,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,That is all we desire.,29
123,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"The difficulty in doing what the honourable member says is all he desires is that a man is taxable in each year upon his income for that year, and that income is interpreted to mean the profit that he has made. But throughout our income tax law we have adopted the system of bringing the year's assets to account. Presently we shall deal with the question as to whether these assets should be so brought to account-that is the broad question raised by the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Fleming). At the moment, whether honourable members agree with it or not, profit is arrived at by bringing to account the assets at the end of the year, and the wheatequity is undoubtedly an asset; it is the same as wool which may be on hand, but has not been realized; the same as if the wheat that the certificate represents was still in possession of the producer. Both of these are brought to account in the year of production, and, ta be logical, the year when the equity should be brought to account is the year when it is put into the Pool-the year of production.",29
124,Mr FLEMING,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Oh , no!",29
125,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,There are certain people who advocate that the tax should only be paid when the money for the produce sold is received. . Mr STEWART - I am one of those people!,29
126,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,At the present time. I am pointing out to the Committee that that is not the basis on which our taxation laws are framed and administered.,29
127,Mr STEWART,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,It should be.,29
128,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"We shall deal with that question in a moment; I am at present dealing with the question of wheat equities on the basis of which the law is now framed and administered, and trying to point out that if we accept that basis the proper year to bring the equities to account is the year when the wheat is produced.",29
129,Mr STEWART,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,That is very logical!,29
130,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"I think 'honourable members will agree that that is the position; they may discuss afterwards whether that be the Tight way or not. At present I confine myself to an endeavour to show that where there is a graduated system of taxation, and the amount of income in one year determines the rate, we have to determine the year when every single thing should be brought to account; and on the existing basis that year is the year of production. Therefore, under the existing system, the proper practice is to bring the wheat certificate to account in the year of production, so that the rate of tax paid will be the same .as that paid by a man who holds his wheat or his wool and has to bring it to account. That is the only point I wish to make with regard to wheat; I shall deal in a moment or two with the - question whether the present method is right or wrong. ""With regard to wool retention moneys the position is that those amounts are deferred payments, .and all that has-to be determined is what is the proper year to include them in income. Nobody is suggesting that those amounts' should be entirely exempt from income tax-the question is what is the proper year to bring them to account. From the point of view of the ©apartment, and from my point of view, I would rather lump the amount into each assessment, and have done with all the trouble. But, surely, if we are to give justice, which we strain and over strain to give, the proper year, again, to bring these retention moneys to account is the year in respect of which they were earned. . Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.80 p.m.",29
131,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"I was dealing with the twospecific cases which have been raised, and which turn, to some extent, on the question of values to be taken, particularly in respect to the assets of primary producers. I have tried to slij.v that if we have to bring wheat equities* and wool retention moneys to account on our present basis of assessing for income tax, the proper and logical thing to do is to bring them to account in the year of production. Now I come to a very much broader question, namely, the basis upon which income tax should be assessed, dealing particularly with the position of primary producers. There are several sides to this question, but there are some broad advocates who go the whole way and say that the proper basis of assessment for the primary producer is the cash basis. They hold that he should pay only in respect of actual moneys received in the year of receipt, and that there should be no bringing to account of assets at the end of each accounting period. Those honourable members who advocate that method have some support .outside this Chamber, but it is very limited indeed.",30
132,Mr FLEMING,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Oh , no!",30
133,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"I say it advisedly, because I am certain that no one in this community has had the views of the primary producer put before him more often or in more detail than I have had in the past six months.",30
134,Mr STJEWAET,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,The system has its advocates outside the ranks of the primary producers.,30
135,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"I will deal with that point in a second. I have heard the views of a great number, and for the moment I will confine the issue to the primary producers. I claim that, for every advocate of the system of a cash basis, there are ten who advocate the system of bringing assets to account at the end of every year.",30
136,Mr BELL,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,Is the Treasurer not expressing the views of the big pastoralists?,30
137,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"No . I think I can say, with perfect justice, that I am expressing the general view of most classes. Now, dealing with the two different bases, we must always remember that if we do not bring a thing to account at the end of its production, whether it be wool, wheat, or natural increase, we have no entry on our debit side against the value of that wool, wheat, or natural increase when it comes to be sold; and the inevitable result is that when a period of prosperity follows a period of difficulty, and large sales are effected at satisfactory prices, the incidence of the income tax upon the individual concerned is excessively hard.  not regulate that in their sales?",30
138,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,They can do nothing of the kind. Sales are directed mostly by necessity and opportunity. ,30
139,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"I agree that the man who has big capital resources behind him can choose his moment to sell; but the small man with no resources is governed only by necessity, and those who are a little more fortunate are governed by opportunity. The individual whose case we .have to consider is the oue who has to sell .'through necessity. In Queensland, a great number of people welcomed the - adoption of the cash basis system; but now they wish they had never heard of it, and would willingly part with it . Only yesterday the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Hunter) pointed out the very facts which I am now indicating; and suggested what seemed to me an almost brutal method, namely, that we should give taxpayers the option, and let them learn by bitter experience that a cash basis would be disastrous toi them. But the course suggested by the honourable member is not the duty of a taxing authority. The duty of the State is to try to devise what appears to be the most equitable basis upon which taxation can be levied.",30
140,Mr STEWART,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,We are all that.,31
141,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,I agree that there are differences of opinion as to which is the most equitable basis to adopt.,31
142,Mr BELL,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,Any basis adopted has different effects upon different sets of people.,31
143,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Where the State sees very grave danger of inequity to any class of taxpayers by imposing a basis of taxation, it has no right to allow the tax to be assessed in that way. As I was responsible for advising the Cabinet as to which system should be adopted, I felt the gravest doubt with regard to the application of a cash basis, not because it might prove detrimental to the revenue, but because it was likely to be dangerous to the individual taxpayer. I could not recommend such a system. Coming now to the method of bringing to account at the end of every taxing period, it is sometimes said that it causes very grave inequities in its application, and from the way in which examples are quoted it might be supposed that when a man has brought something to account, and then sells, it is no benefit to him at the time of bringing it to account. Take < the case of natural increase, upon which there has been some discussion. Having brought it to account as is required to be done at the end of the taxing period of production, and in that way having increased one's assets against his debits, when the new taxing period is commenced it is brought to account as a debit, or as a setoff against the individual's assets in that year. It . is very naturally pointed out that some of the assets thus brought to account may subsequently never be realized upon, owing to drought and its consequent mortality; but as against that position it must be remembered that at the beginning of the accounting period in which that asset is lost, the individual had brought into account the value of his natural increase as a debit, and as it has disappeared in the period he has no corresponding asset to bring into account at the end of the year. Thus he is relieved to a very substantial, extent from the results that follow upon any disaster that has fallen upon him.  tax upon something upon which ho has realized nothing.",31
144,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"I agree, but in the seeking subsequent period in which, because his assets have disappeared, he has not an opportunity of realizing, he is allowed to show those assets as a debit against the amount which he had taken into account as assets at the end of the period.  of low values.",31
145,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,The honourable member . is shifting his ground.  on. something which he has never enjoyed. I can show cases where thousands of pounds have been paid in income tax upon calves not one of which have lived.,31
146,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"The honourable member is quoting a case which is very often put forward, but if he does bring it forward he should, in fairness, go on to point out that in the year following the period in which the calves were brought to account j - heiiowner would show as a debit the value upon which he had had to pay tax in respect of them. Thus he would have that asset on his debit side, and, having lost it, he would not have to bring it to account on his credit side. Consequently any profits he might have made in other directions would be reduced by the debit he was allowed to bring in in respect of the tax already paid in the previous year. I have no desire to overstate the case, but I want to show that there is something to be said on both sides of the question in relation to this method of bringing to account at the end of every taxing period. It has been suggested that natural increase regarded as a specific item is an. accretion to capital, and should not be brought to account. At least, that point has not been raised today, but it has been put to me. I think the contention is improper and unjustifiable. increase is a trading asset that has been created, and can be sold, and, therefore, should certainly be brought to account. The proposals which the Government are now submitting in regard to this very difficult question of how we are to bring natural increase to account in no sense meet the case of those who are advocating a cash basis for income tax assessment by primary producers, but I think they very fair l y meet the difficulties stated by those who, although they are prepared to accept the annual bringing to account of assets, nevertheless consider that they have suffered considerable hardship by the basis hitherto adopted. three modes of bringing natural increase to account. One is that we should bring it to account at market value. deals with the point raised by the honourable member for Grampians (Mr . Jowett""), who asked why there was any distinction between trading stock, which is not live-stock, and live-stock. difficulty in regard to assessing at market value is that it is practically impossible to work out what is the market value for natural increase in a continent with the extent of Australia, and containing sc many people placed in such widely varying circumstances. The next suggestion is that we should bring natural increase to account at any value the owner cares to put upon' it . The third suggestion is that there should be a prescribed value by the Department. The last system is that which now exists ",31
147,Mr FLEMING,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,But there is a range allowed.,32
148,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"No. A prescribed value is fixed by the Department. A fte r giving a very great deal of attention to this very difficult problem and getting all the assistance I could, I was faced with the difficulty that each school of thought seemed to advocate a different thing and heartily condemned the ideas of every other school. Eventually, as a compromise, this system was devised, and I think it more or less meets the position. We are maintaining the prescribed value, but instead of fixing only one value, we axe allowing a maximum value and a .minimum value; the la.tter will be a quarter of the maximum, which, when gazetted, will probably be something lessthan the existing value. Between the Natural maximum and the minimum, the taxpayer may select his own value, but after he has made a selection,, he must stick to it. I think that is a fair compromise between all the ideas which are held by different classes of taxpayers, and is a reasonable solution of a very difficult problem.",32
149,Mr STEWART,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,Does the Treasurer mean that the taxpayer must throughout the subsequent years stick to the valuation he has made?,32
150,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Yes . The honourable member will realise that if a man were not compelled to adhere to his original value, he could, by varying his valuation There are every year, show that he had made neither a gain nor a loss. This applies only to natural increase of stock. Purchases will be brought to account at the This purchase price, if they can be identified. I admit quite frankly that the basis contained in the Bill does not meet the claims of those who say that only the cash basis should be employed, but I think it The is in accord with the views of the great bulk of the primary producers. With regard to valuations generally, a cash basis in connection with all businesses is quite impracticable, and I know of none who suggest that this basis should be taken for income assessment in business generally throughout the Commonwealth. The Government have tried to solve a very difficult problem by dealing with natural increase of live stock on the basis indicated, and by dealing with trading stock on the three different bases set out ° "" in the Bill . That, with the amendment which I have proposed at the suggestion of the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) , gives a reasonable and fair basis of valuation.  listened very carefully to the remarks of the Treasurer regarding the bringing to account of the natural increase of live stock. The honourable gentleman has expressed a great deal of sympathy with the small farmers, and he must know the long hours they work and the little time they have in which to keep proper accounts. They can, however, operate on a cash basis. They can regulate their accounts of purchases and sales by their bankbooks, and they would be relieved of a tremendous amount of worry and unnecessary labour if they could be assessed on the actual receipts from their produce. Primary products are, to a large extent, intangible assets. The taxation law is being revised ostensibly in the interests of the primary producers, but it is remarkable that the amendments axe more for the benefit of other than primary producers. The Bill seems to be designed to protect the rights of companies-and other big interests, and when we,, who represent the primary producer, ask for consideration for. him, the Treasurer tries to make it appear that we do not know what we are talking about. The terrible graduation of rates and the forcing of the primary producer to bring to account intangible assets in the shape of perishable products, such as potatoes and fruit, place an intolerable burden upon the taxpayer. Often he has not commenced to enjoy the income upon which he is taxed, and he has to borrow money with which to pay his taxes. The Government will not wait for its money until the primary producer has been paid for his produce. The Treasurer said that if that were done the farmer would put himself in "" Queerstreet"" by showing too many sales in one assessable year; but the farmer has control of his affairs, and he can regulate his sales as the growths occur. It is suggested that if his expected receipts have been over-estimated, if the market f alls, or if the weevils or mice get into his wheat, a deduction may be made in his next year's return j but already the farmer has paid his taxation in hard cash on an income which he has not enjoyed.",32
151,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"The honourable member will admit that the taxpayer gets back something in the following year.  missioner of Taxation in Western Australia made a desperate attempt last year to inflate the accounts of primary producers in a way that meant the payment of many thousands of pounds of taxation upon stock which they had never realized. Not only were there the ordinary profits on sales, but, in addition, a lot of dividends from Pools had come into that year; and, in order to make the incomes bigger, the Commissioner looked forward by estimating the equity in the unsold wheat. When taxation is made burdensome in this way, the Government cannot be said to be acting in the interests of primary production.'",33
152,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"The honourable member is unfair in suggesting improper reasons for the Deputy Commissioner's action.  assessments were made on a cash basis in previous years, and equity in unrealized assets was not brought into account. But as soon. a3 the Commonwealth and the State agreed to collect through the one authority, the Deputy Commissioner in Perth, presumably acting under instructions from the Commissioner, brought equity into account in connection with both Commonwealth and State taxation. Whatever might be his motive for loading up the incomes for that year, I know that an intolerable and unjust burden was placed upon the primaiy producers, who had to pay a vastly increased amount of 'taxation. We are told that if the equity was not realized in the year of assessment a claim for a refund could be made. East year was pretty good, but the refund might be taken off a year of losses in which no income tax would be paid, and already the farmer may have paid 30d. to 40d. in the f l in respect of an income of which he had not enjoyed a farthing. Farmers do not employ accountants to keep their books, but they are as straightforward as are other.people in the community. As .a - rule, they practically allow the banker to regulate their affairs. I know of instances in which men brought into account assets that were not taxable and the Department did not inform them of their mistake, but collected upon what was really not true income for the year.",33
153,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"If the honourable member is suggesting that the Department deliberately and improperly took taxation that was not due and did not inform the taxpayer, he is making a statement that is quite wrong-""and very improper.  under the notice of the Treasurer. The officials seem to assume that the taxpayer is trying to rob the Department, and they spend a tremendous amount of money in queries into this, that, and ithe other thing. The partnership in which I am interested, with a turnover of £14,000 or £15,000, entered in its return an amount of £5 for postage and telegrams for the whole year. Some nincompoop in the State Taxation Department struck out that amount and wrote, ""One pound only allowed."" That is the sort of thing that the' taxpayer has to contend with. If sympathy existed between the citizens and their servants in the Department this trouble would be avoided.",33
154,Mr BELL,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,Did the honourable member keep an .account of his postage and telegrams ?  amount we estimated.,34
155,Mr BELL,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Why did you not keep an account? Y o u are worse than the farmers.  it is very difficult to enter up Is. 6d. or Is. every time one goes to the post office to lodge a telegram., or 2d. every time one posts a letter. I know of no trading concern with a similar turnover that could go through a year on an allowance of £5 for postage and telegrams. ^ Of course, when I drew attention to this item, the £5 was reinstated. that the primary producers pay taxation on income before they get it . The farmers have not been conceded the simple average for which they asked. We are asking that simpler methods of taxation shall be adopted in the taxation of primary producers. The present system is so complicated that they have to employ accountants to make out their returns, and the fees so paid by them very often amount to more than they have to pay by way of income tax. They are obliged to employ accountants because of the great difficulty involved in bringing into account the in tangible items to which I have referred.  of the fawners do not pay any income tax.  to the trouble of furnishing returns. Some of them would almost prefer to go to gaol for a week rather than undertake the laborious work of preparing these returns. of economy! I hope that the Treasurer will at least concede something to the primary producers. He has absolutely turned everything for which we have asked.",34
156,Mr MAXWELL,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"That is absurd.  statement j it is, perhaps, too sweeping. should pay great respect to views expressed by the Treasurer in regard ness of a warehouse or company; but surely, since I have had to keep farming books for about a quarter of a century, I ought to be able to speak with authority of the inconvenience to which farmers are subjected owing to the tremendous amount of accounting work they have to do in order to comply with the requirements of the Taxation Department. . I doubt whether it would be advisable to apply the cash-basis system generally; but if it were applied to the primary producing in terests it would save them much worry, and would not result in any loss of revenue to the Department. Sooner or later they have to realise on their produce, and whenever it is disposed of the money so obtained will be brought into account. The difficulty to which I have referred is experienced also in regard to the 10 per cent, retention money. I received from the Department not long ago a query note as to the wool retention money I had received. My accounts had closed on the 30th June, and I did not receive the retention money, u n t i l 30th September folThe trouble is lowing. The Department asked me why I had not accounted for it . I replied that I had not received it u n t il thr.ee months after the closing of my accounts, but that the retention money for the previous year had been accounted for in the last return, and that the amount in question would be accounted for in my return for the following year. At the time that my accounts closed I had not received the money in question, and did not know whether or not I would receive it , since this 10 per cent, is retained by the Wool Pool to cover mistakes. The Department was satisfied with the explanation; but I read in the press that the Commissioner proposes to re-open all accounts in respect of the last three years. There are said to be about 150,000 wool-growers in - the Commonwealth, so that if this re-opening of accounts is to extend over three years the Department will have to deal with something like 800,000 assessments. That, we are told, must be done in the interests",34
157,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"For the sake, not of down economy, but of equity.  ment would endeavour to give us e q u it y in other directions. The 10 per cent, reI tained by the Wool Pool from time to time has been returned with remarkable to the busiregularity every year.",34
158,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"I shall be very pleased to discuss the matter with the honourable member ; but it does not arise out of this clause, and we can do nothing with regard to it in the Bill itself.  self referred to it, and it comes within question that has been raised with respect to the treatment of stock and produce held over. The honourable gentleman would save a lot of time by granting some of the concessions for which we have asked. By doing so he would go a long way in the direction of simplifying the returns to be prepared by the man on the land, who has not the time that a city business man has to make out returns covering the whole ramifications of his industry.",34
159,Mr LIVINGSTON,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Barker) [3.7] Having listened to the lengthy remarks just made by the honourable member for  thab the Treasurer (Mr Bruce) should be showing signs of weariness. The honourable gentleman is anxious, I know, to hear the views of every honourable member who has a knowledge of this particular business. He is in a very difficult position in dealing with the question of the taxation of live stock on hand and produce carried over, and it is our duty to give him every possible assistance. I invite his attention to the position of those who three years ago paid £ 3 per head for their calves, whereas calves today are worth only about £ 1 per head. Then, again, three years ago lambs were worth comparatively nothing, whereas today they are fetching a big prico. Is a man to be taxed over the three years' period on the basis of the present-day value of his live stock ? If so, the position will be very serious. What, again, is to be done in respect of the valuation of cross bred wool, which a good many small farmers are growing? I know of several farmers who have had their cross bred wool in their sheds for the last two years, and have not even baled it . How can such o wool be brought into account? No ono knows what it will realise. The same may be said with respect to wheat that has been stacked in various parts of the country, and, in many cases, has been ruined by weevils. Still another case calling for attention is that of the cattle men. A little while ago magnificent beef all over the Commonwealth was practically going to waste. There was no market for it until the Government recently came to the rescue of the industry, with the result that the position has been somewhat improved. I hope that the Treasurer will not call upon any taxpayer to pay income tax in respect of the stock or produce he has in hand until he has actually realized upon it . When a taxpayer has sold his produce and got the cash he can pay. The honourable member  surer with being better able to deal with the business of a warehouse than with the business of the primary producer; but I know that the honourable gentleman has sufficient intelligence to enable him to appreciate the position of the primary producer. It is undoubtedly a difficult one. In my own electorate, in the early part of this season, hundreds of acres of potatoes were not even dug up, because the price obtainable for them was only £2 10s. per ton- a price that would not pay for bagging. Six months later potatoes were fetching £10 per ton in the market. How is the Department to deal with these variations in prices? If the Treasurer does not protect the producers, the producers will not protect him and his Department. Barley last year was realizing 6s. or 7s. per bushel; today it is worth only about half that price. Thousands of bushels of barley are stacked. How can the farmer who has large quantities of barley on hand pay income tax in respect of it until he has realized upon it? It would be wrong to tax him on the basis of last year's prices. Milk is also greatly decreased in price. No Treasurer could properly assess the primary producers in respect of stock held over. The Department should wait until such stock is realized, when the owners will be able to furnish a proper statement of their income. I hope that the Treasurer will deal very carefully with this matter, and that he will agree that taxpayers should not be called upon to pay income tax in respect of stock or produce on which they have not yet realized. When such stock or produce has been sold, the owners will be proud to pay income tax in respect of it. In conclusion, I congratulate the Treasurer on the information with which he has supplied us in regard to this Bill, and am pleased to tell him that throughout the country he is looked upon with the greatest respect. . Mr Bruce (Flinders - Treasurer) [3.12] - We have had a very full discussion on this vital and important question, and I think I must now submit the amendment which I announced earlier in the day, providing for the addition of a proviso to paragraph b, sub-paragraph i . In order to meet the point raised by the right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt) with regard to the caee of distribution, by the liquidator of a company oral of capital assets, I am slightly amending the proposed amendment as printed and circulated. move That after sub-paragraph (i) of paragraph (b) the following proviso be inserted :-""Pro vided also that where a dividend or bonus is paid wholly and exclusively out of the profits arising from the sale of capital assets, ber or shareholder shall not be liable to tax on that dividend or bonus."" Earlier in the day_ I explained this matter very fully. I think I have met the objection which has been raised, and, therefore, shall not discuss it further'. Amendment agreed to. Amendment (by Mr BHUCE) proposed - That the word "" profits"", first occurring in paragraph (i>), sub-clause (ii), be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" assessable income "".",35
160,Mr BOWDEN,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Nepean) [3.15] - I should like to know exactly what is the effect of this sub-clause. I have read it carefully, and yet., I am scarcely able to get "" the hang of it . "" Does it apply only to current year's profits?",36
161,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Flinders-Treasurer) [3.16] - The effect of the sub-clause is to exclude all distributions in the shape of bonus shares, with one exception; that is, we will uot allow a company to take advantage of the provision with regard to bonus shares to evade all taxation on its profits. We allow exemption in respect of bonus shares provided the income has been brought to account as nondistributable and the company's flat Tate of tax has been paid on it. Once the income has been brought to account, and the tax has been paid, then bonus shares may be issued. All that the clause does is to see that a dishonest company does not take advantage of the provision with regard to bonus shares, and avoid taxation by capitalizing and issuing its profits in the form of bonus shares.  the revenue?",36
162,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,Yes .,36
163,Mr FLEMING,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Robertson) [3.18] I move That the following new paragraph be inserted after paragraph (b) :"" (bb) for the purposes of computing profits, perishable products or live stock shall not be taken into account until realized upon "". I do not desire to traverse all the arguments that have been placed before the I Committee, because there already has been much discussion on this measure. 1 I do wish, however, to reply to some - of the statements made a moment ago by the Treasurer (Mr Bruce). The whole a mem- of the argument of the honourable member in connection with the taxation of live stock is the argument of the dealer as against the breeder. He has told us that thore are two distinct schools of thought in connection with livestock and the natural increase; and there are simply because there are two distinct types of men on the land.",36
164,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,That is not the distinction I was referring to.,36
165,Mr FLEMING,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"There is tke breeder, who is the mainstay and the backbone of the industry, and there is the dealer. To the dealer the natural increase is of no moment; he buys in the cheapest market, aggregates his stock, and sells it in large numbers in the dearest market. Naturally he does not care in the least whether or not the natural increase is taken into account; his whole concern is as to how he buys and sells, and he has no interest in the other phase of the matter, and he naturally advocates that system of taxation which he thinks best ""suits his book."" But the breeder is the man responsible for the upkeep of the whole industry. Very often, under present conditions, he pays tax on what he has never realized on, and ho never gets a refund of tax paid in connection with stock lost. I admits that the Treasurer is correct when he says that the breeder balances this to a certain extent in his subsequent returns; but he has paid on what he has never realized. He is out of pocket, and often has to pay higher rates than he would if he had been allowed to pay on a cash basis. - Mr Bruce - It is the other way.",36
166,Mr FLEMING,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"In odd cases it operates the other way, and the dealer is the man in whose favour it operates as the Act now stands. We, however, who are practical men, and have been through the mill-wh o have actually raised stock and grown produce-kno w the ins and outs of the industry; and all who speak with practical experience are in favour of the elimination of taxation on natural increase. The man who is only a dealer positionis quite prepared to let things stand as - they are-h e does not feel the actual equity of the system; but we who have bred stock and seen it die, who have grown balloter crops and seen them destroyed, and who have paid tax in many cases on produce on which we have never realized, know previously the incidence and how it "" h it s "" us. There are many cases of men in Australia heavily who are tired out and are going off gether, the land because of this unfair incidence of taxation. The Treasurer may think ing that that is an overstatement of the case, ment, but I can assure him from actual exsiderably perience that it is a fact. Only last £500 at 10 per cent. week I had a letter from one of the biggest graziers in New South Wales, whom I have known all my life, and he agage, says that unless the system of taxation altered he will have to give up his grazhad ing properties as unprofitable. This man, I may say, is one of the shrewdest in New South Wales; and no doubt the tinued position is serious. It is not only the manwho suffers, the small man sum suffers even more. A man raises a few head of stock, pays income tax on them, and then they die. Possibly this man ferred grows a quantity of hay on which he also pays income tax, although he gets no reat turn, because he only raised it for the of the stock which have died. He pays taxation, not only on what he has not O'Mullane realized on, but really on what he has never had. There is another point with which I wish to deal. Some time ago, fore the present Treasurer took office, submitted a case to his predecessor (Sir representing Joseph Cook). That case I now desire to place before the present Treasurer order to show what hardship is inflicted on many men who are developing Ausin tralia. When a man realizes on a freebecause hold property, he is not taxed on the price which he obtains for it profit, it is regarded as aggregation of capital, because he can invest it in anthat other direction, and pay income tax on the the income thus derived. 'If, however, man has a leasehold in the back country, which, after years of effort, he has improved, and he realizes on it, he is taxed on the actual profit he makes, although it is spread over a term of years. I have here a communication which gives the facts of the case to which I have referred, and shows the gross unfairness of the The facts are that O'Mullane after numerous inreserves saved the sum of £300, and on the 16th February, 1911, was the successful for settlement lease No - 1911/1 of ' 5,739 acres situate in the parish of Benbarba, county of Caidmurra, land district of Moree. In passing, we might state that this land had been offered by the Grown for selection as a scrub lease, and nobody wojild take it on, and at the time of selection was infested with prickly pear, and, altowas in a very bad state. O'Mullane, by dint of terrifically hard work, by not spenda shilling, and by taking stock on agistmanaged to improve the place very conduring the first six years of his residence, during which time he borrowed In about 1917 O'Mullane's brother came to his rescue, and lent him the sum of £2,000 with which to buy few stock to pay off the 10 per cent, mortand effect some further improvements is t'o the lands. Up till this time O'Mullane never had the money to. buy any stock of his own to put on the lands. From 1917 onwards O'Mullane did pretty well, and conto heavily improve the place, and on the 24th May, 1919, he sold the said settlebig ment lease lands to one P. C. Lyons, for the of £1 10s. per acre, or a total sum of £8,607 10s. This sale was completed on the 7th August, 1919, when the property was transto the purchaser, and by him mortgaged back to secure half of the purchase money, repayable on the 7th August, 1924, with interest 4* per cent.; of the half purchase money, use namely, £4,300, which was paid in cash, O'Mullane only received £2,018 18s. 5d., the balance being paid to his mortgagees. has now been assessed by the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation for this State in the sum of £5,S32, said to be the profit made beby O'Mullane"" on the sale of his settlement I lease, and is arrived at by deducting £2,770, the value of the improvements from the total purchase moneys, viz., £8,608. The tax in respect of this .amount which is in now claimed is £1,597 14s. We might say that O'Mullane sold this land 1919, not 'because he was tired of work, but he strained his heart working on the property, and had to sell it, because prickly pear lands are no good unless the boss can, ; if he makes a and does, work. Now, the Taxation Commissioner contends a settlement lessee is a lessee within the meaning of sub-section (D) of section 14 of Income Tax Assessment Act 1915 to 1918, a as amended by section 8 of the Act No. 18 of 1918, and it is on the strength of this construction of the section: in question - that the assessment in question has been made - So far as we arc iiwarc, there is no section in the Federal Income Tax Acts to provide the profits on the sale of real estate shall be deemed to be income, although such a provision has been specially made in regard to State income tax for this State. In any case, however, the said Act provides that the profit on the sale of real estate was only applied where the real estate has been sold within five years of its acquisition, that is to say, is designed purely to make the income of land speculators liable to income tax. There is not, however, any like provision in the Federal Income Tax Acts, and if it had been the intention of the Federal Legislature to make the profits on the .sale of real estate taxable as income, we submit that a special clause to that effect would have been inserted in the Federal Acts. Howevet, there is no such section in the Federal Acts, and, consequently, a man may deal with hundreds of thousands of pounds' worth of freehold or secured land (as opposed to leased lands), aud, no matter what profit is made on those dealings, he is not liable to pay Federal income tax in respect of the protit. For these reasons, it seems to us monstrous to think that the Legislature ever intended to treat the proiits of the small selector as income while letting the dealer, whether small or large, in freeholds or secured tenures, go scot free.",36
167,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"He does pay, though.",38
168,Mr FLEMING,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"!-In answer to the honourable member for Balaclava, I may mention that this communication is from, a firm of lawyers of very high repute, and I know fro m experience that what that firm says is very often true. The letter proceeds' Following out the above reasoning, the most peculiar anomaly about this particular case is that if O'Mullane had converted his settlement lease (as 'he had a right to do under section 184, et seq., of the Crown Lands Consolidation Act 1913) into 'conditionally-purchased lands prior to selling to Lyons, then he could not have been called upon to pay one shilling income tax, because, in case of such conversion, he would have then been a selector of conditionally-purchased lands instead of a selector of settlement lease lands, although the land would have still been the same, and profit the same. Gould such a position that ever have heen intended by the Legislature? Wc think not. I have quoted this case because I happen to know the venwidespread. dor and the purchaser, and because the former placed the facts before the me some two years ago. I then mitted them to the ex-Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook), but this man has received no relief. The present Treasurer will agree that the man is placed in a manigood festly unfair position. He went on to property which was useless-practicall y worthless-and at the end of five years' work, he sold for £8,608. He had borrowed something over £2,000, and his improvements cost him about £3,000; so that at thea finish he actually drew only £2,018for eight years' hard work, showing an income of only about £250 a year. Yet he is called upon by the Commissioner to pay taxation amounting to £1,597 14s. on the £2,018. That is the sort of thing that is operating under the present income tax law, and I see nothing in the Bill before us that will do away with these anomalies and difficulties. We ought to provide that when a man takes up a leasehold, improves it , and _ sells it, he should not be called upon to pay tax on the profit of the sale, or, at any rate, he should not be called upon to pay on the profit of the sale as one year's income; the taxation should at least be spread over the years he has spent in developing the property. In a case such as that to which I have just referred, a mau cannot expect to earn from the land anything more than will just keep him going; and when he comes to sell, it is grossly unfair to treat the pr>fit of the sale as income earned in the year of the sale, and, therefore, taxable. Then, again, however right it may be in theory, the method of assessing and taxing natural increase works harshly in practice. If the Department would wait until the producer had realized on that natural increase, the latter would be in a position to pay. I know from experience the gross injustice of the present practice. Of the iniquities of our taxation law, it is the greatest, and it is having the effect of driving men off the land.",38
169,Mr STEWART,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Wimmera) [3.33] his' I do not wish to labour this matter, or as to repeat what has been already said; but I would impress on the Committee that dissatisfaction with the present method at length, of assessing natural increase assets is The statement of the Treasurer, that under the Act this method is only one possible, may be correct; but subthe Act should be amended to allow of the assessment of natural increase on a cash sales basis. The Australian climate is notoriously fickle. We have periods of years followed by periods of bad a years. A stock-owner may have a largo natural increase in one year, and the following year may be so dry as to make the stock unsaleable and put him to great expense in keeping it alive. But he is taxed on it just when it is of least value to him, and when it is least convenient for him to pay taxation. The term "" capacity to pay "" has been used a great deal, but this is a case of incapacitv to pav. Primary products are largely perishable, and the method of assessing natural increase which is distinctly perishable should be altered. is true, as the Treasurer has said, that an allowance is subsequently made, but that allowance is insufficient. Although the man on the land pays taxation ou the natural increase of his land, he does not get back a cent of what ihe has paid. Furthermore, no allowance is made to him on account of the interest which he may have been charged on money borrowed to pay the tax. I do not think it would be of much good to ask the present Treasurer for consideration in regard to this interest, but I hope that the amendment providing, for an alteration of the method of assessing the value of primary produce will be supported, not only by the representatives of the primary producers in this House, but also by members representing city constituencies. They should do this as a matter of justice. The present system is undoubtedly unjust, and although I have listened attentively to the speeches of those who have spoken during the debate, and particularly to that of the Treasurer, I have not heard any argument against the proposed alteration of the law. We have had no clear statement why the alteration should not be made. The Treasurer, or some other opponent of the amendment, should put before us some definite objection to it. . Mr Bruce (Flinders-Treasurer ) [3.371 - I have srioken at some length on the proposal to take a cash basis for assessing certain classes of property for income tax, and I do not propose to ? eat what I have said on the subject, but wish to correct what I consider wrong impression left in the minds of the Committee by the hono.able member for Robertson (Mr Fleming), who drew a distinction between the breeders and the dealers. It should be made known that the breeders are as much divided opinion on this subject as any other class of the community.",38
170,Mr STEWART,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"They are not divided in this, that they consider the present method objectionable.",39
171,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,A great number of breeders say that it is the best that could be adopted.,39

173,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"The proposed method, which provides for a variation between a minimum and a maximum. The honorI t able member for Robertson spoke also of the taxation of premiums paid for the transfer of leases. When a premium is paid for the transfer of an ordinary city lease or the like, it is, I think, acknowledged that it should be assessed for income taxation. But difficulty arises in respect of transfers of developmental leases by men who are doing pioneer work. The most difficult classes of leases to deal with in this connection are Crown leases. Income taxation in respect of those leases is wrapped up almost inextricably with land taxation. I have devoted a good deal of attention to this very difficult matter, which has defied the wits and efforts of every Treasurer since 1915. A Royal Commission made certain recommendations about it , but no action was taken by the Treasurer of the day upon them. The subject has now been referred to a Taxation Commissi an, and I had hoped to have their views on it , so that some provision to deal with these leases might be embodied in the Bill. But, unfortunately, the Commission has not yet made a recommendation, and until I know its views, I do not feel able to deal with the whole question. It is a question which must be dealt with equitably, and care must be taken not to interfere unnecessarily with those who are doing developmental work in the back country. I am sorry that I cannot, at the moment, make a concrete and definite proposal; but, as I am not able to deal with the question as a whole, T am not prepared to deal with it piecemeal by considering cases which, reto my mind, are not so urgent as those connected with the transfer of big developto be a TOTfitfltell l&SLSQS",39

The Treasurer has told us that there is at Poynton, A. division of opinion as to which method should be adopted, and I think it would be perfectly fair and just if we allowed raisers of stock to adopt whichever method they prefer so long as they maintain it all through. The Bill amends the values placed upon stock, and owners are given a range in which they can fix their values, but once having fixed upon certain PAIBS. values, they are obliged to adhere to them all through. I want the same position to be applied to the option.",41
200,The CHAIRMAN,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,Is not the amendment which the honourable member proposes to submit practically the same as that already disposed of?,41

I move That after sub-paragraph (iii) of paragraph * (b) the following paragraph be inserted :""{be) It shall be optional whether natural increase be taken into account at fixed value or when realized upon/'",42
204,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Flinders-Treasurer ) [4.2] - This question has b-.u discussed at very great length, and we have heard the views of honourable members upon two different systems of arriving at a basis for assessment of primary producers. The basis that is proposed in the Bill requires that natural increase of stock shall be brought to account at the end of every period. That system is in accordance with the general basis for assessment for income tax for every class of taxpayers in the community. If the compelling of primary producers to bring their live stock to account every year placed upon them a burden of taxation which was not placed upon other people, we would require to carefully consider whether we should not provide for alternative systems. But the proposal in the Bill does not place the primary producer in an unfair position as compared with the rest of the community. Under the amended proposal, he mav value his natural increase of stock at any figure between the minimum and the maximum prescribed. He may bring it to account at whatever figure he thinks reasonable and proper. If he brings it to account at the maximum figure his income tax will be increased in that year, but the amount of taxation he will pay on subsequent realization will be reduced. If , on the other hand, he brings the stock to account at a low figure, he will pay a small taxation in the first year of assessment and heavier taxation when the stock is realized. Wo have been told that the primary producer may never realise upou the stock which he has to bring to account, but a great number of other people in the community never realise upon assets which they bring to account, and upon which they are taxed. Practically every trader in the community during the last few years has paid income tax on assets brought to account as if he had a very large income; but when those assets were realized they did not have the value which was placed upon them when first brought to account, and the owner has made a substantial loss in respect of them.",42
205,Mr FLEMING,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,The primary producers bear the loss of depreciation in addition to dead loss.,42
206,Mr BEUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"All persons, whether engaged in primary production or trade, are in the same position. The value of the stock decreases, but the owner has been taxed upon an assumed income, arrived at by placing a valuation upon the assets. When the assets are realized it is found that certain income taxation in respect of them should not have been paid. The averaging system has been introduced for the purpose of trying to minimize the effects of a disaster of that kind, and it will aid the primary producer as much as anybody else. Unless the primary producer is asked to bring his assets to account in a way which unfairly differentiates between him and other taxpayers, there is no reason why we should have two bases for arriving at income tax liability for different classes in the community. We must either insist that assets be brought to account at valuation in determining what the profits are or take the cash basis, levying income tax only upon the actual surplus of revenue over outgoings. Already our system of assessment is complicated, and many honourable members do not hesitate to unfavorably contrast the cost of taxation collection with the cost of collection by other authorities. If the proposal to provide optional bases of bringing stock to account were adopted another complication would be introduced, and there would be an enormous increase in administrative costs. For those reasons I cannot accept the amendment. I hope the honourable member will not press it , and that the Committee will agree to the one basis for assessment, which I suggest is reasonable for all classes.",42
207,Mr STEWART,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Wimmera) [4.10] The Treasurer stated that the positions of primary producers and manufacturers, in regard to unrealized assets, were parallel. I was surprised to hear such an argument from the honourable gentleman. The two positions are entirely different. It is perfectly true that both classes suffer a depreciation of assets, but, in addition to that depreciation, the stock^raiser suffers a total disappearance of his assets through drcumslances entirely beyond his control.",42
208,Mr MATHEWS,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Melbourne Ports) [4.11] - We have been told that the stock-owners are taxed on assets that may never be realized-that the stock may die, or tha crops be ruined by the elements. To a city dweller such taxation seems unfair. I have heard the same complaint for years, and have never heard from any Treasurer a satisfactory refutation or solution of it . I desire to vote fairly upon the amendment, and I seek some enlightenment. Will the Treasurer say that the reason for not agreeing tb the proposal put forward by the Country party is that the farmer could easily falsify his accounts if he were not compelled to take into account all his stock? What are the reasons for not 'acceding to what seems to be a very fair request? I do not think that the Government should levy taxation upon an income that is never enjoyed. I voted last time against the Government because I regard it as our duty to defeat the Government whenever we get the chance. But one likes to know the merits of a case. For their own sake, the Government might expkin why they insist upon taxing people upon assets which have not been realized.",43
209,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Balaclava) [4.14] - The honourable member for Melbourne Ports is evidently in dire distress, and needs a helping hand. The Government should immediately respond to his appeal, and explain why the system of valuing stock was first introduced into income taxation. Before proceeding to discuss that matter, I ask for consideration of the method of proposing the amendment now before the Committee. The honourable member for Robertson (Mr Fleming) has proposed to introduce matters relating to the valuation of live stock after sub-paragraph iii of paragraph 6. Paragraph 6 has nothing whatever to do with live stock. It deals with company propositions. Its first sub-paragraph deals with dividends, bonuses, or profits; its second with bonus shares, and its third with the interest paid to debenture-holders. Paragraph a, which we have passed, deals with the valuation of live stock, and sets out that the valuation must be as prescribed for the first time. If the Committee assents to the proposition submitted by the honourable member it will make the Bill a rare joke, since we shall have in a sub-clause dealing with bonus shares and debentures a reference to live stock.",43
210,Mr MASSYGREENE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"And the amendment, if .agreed to, would be particularly governed by paragraph 6.",43
211,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,Yes . The paragraph in which it is proposed to insert the amendment has nothing whatever to do with the primary producer as an individual. Whatever benefit there is in the honourable member's remedial proposition would apply only to a member of a company.,43
212,Mr WEST,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,Member s of companies are interested in natural increases.,43
213,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"But the honourable member for Robertson is endeavouring to deal with the whole problem of the man on the land, and it is only here"" and there that we have companies dealing with such matters. The primary producer is an individualist who likes to have his own land and his own stock.",43
214,Mr GABB,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Then let us put him in another paddock, so far as this amendment is concerned.",43
215,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"The amendment ought to run in another paddock where there is more grass for it . Apart altogether from the merits of the honourable member's amendment, it seems to me that he has moved to insert it in a most awkward and unfortunate part of the clause. To insert it at the point proposed by him would be to demonstrate the principle, but not to produce any effect. The Treasurer is not obliged to find a way out of the forest for wandering members, and the honourable member for Robertson knows his way about sufficiently well to be able to find in the Bill the proper place for an amendment of this kind. May I now refer briefly to the merits of the amendment, and deal with it on lines somewhat different from those adopted by the Treasurer. An ordinary trader in his income tax schedule has to bring into account the stock 'with which his year started, and the stock with which his year closed. Those two factors govern, in some cases, mightily, and always, to some extent, the question of whether or not he has made a profit, and is assessable for income tax purposes. That goes without argument. The law must contain such, a provision. If it did not, and if a man could' start with stock to the value of £1,000 at the beginning of the year, and finish the year with £5,000 worth of stock, without accounting in any way for the visible improvement in his stock to the extent of £4,000, the law would be faulty. And go we say that every trader, whether he is a manufacturer, an importer, or an exporter, must account for the stock with which he starts his year, the stock with which he finishes his year, and all the other factors that go to make up the assessable amount for the year. If he does not take stock at the beginning and the end of the year, it is impossible to say what profit he has made. The primary producer, whether: he is a fanner growing potatoes or grain, or whether he has live stock that has increased in number by purchase or by natural increase, has to do exactly the same thing. The whole object of making such a provision was to put on an equal footing all income taxpayers, whether they handle live stock or trading stock. The onus of proof must rest always on the man or the class of men who seek exemption from that requirement, which, to my mind, is the fairest requirement of any system of direct taxation levied on income. It is true that under the old system with which we are all familiar, a great deal of hardship was sometimes inflicted upon certain classes of our live-stock owners because the valuation was - an extremely high figure, and if an increase, let of 50 calves or 100 lambs were registered in a given schedule, and those animals died, the owner had to pay income tax in respect of them as if they had lived on and increased in value. He got no refund if they died. It was extremely difficult for the State to say it was dealing fairly with these men. But after this matter has been analyzed most carefully and impartially by the Royal Commission, and analyzed, I think, to finality, the Treasurer now comes along and says, "" Very well, we will give holders of live stock no exemption from bringing their stock into account at the end of the year, but we will give them the fairest possible basis of valuation at which we ean arrive. They may adopt any one of three courses which have been devised."" They may make their own valuation.",43
216,Mr STEWART,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,The minimum be one-fourth of the maximum. Mr Watt.,44
217,Mr BRUOE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,The maximum would be about the present prescribed value.,44
218,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"What is the prescribed maximum value of lambs? If it were 10s. the owner could take the value of his lambs at 2s. 6d. per head at the beginning and end of the year, and from year to year the man who did that would be treated as fairly as the State could possibly treat an income taxpayer who dealt in or bred live stock.",44
219,Mr BRUOE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,The figures are not finalized; but it is proposed so far as lambs are concerned that the minimum (shall be 2s. Gd. and the maximum 10s.,44
220,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"That is actually the hypothesis on which I am working. The maximum for lambs the Treasurer tells us is 10s., and I am dealing with the case of a man who takes the value of his lambs as being one-fourth that amount.",44
221,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"The suggestion as to cattle is that the minimum shall be 10s. per head, and the maximum 40s. per head.",44
222,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"So that if this Bill is passed, a given owner in making up his return will say, "" I am going to take all my increases in cattle at 10s. per head,"" and every year, both at the beginning and at the end, he must keep to that valuation of 10s. per head.",44
223,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,That is correct.,44
224,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Surely that is about as low a valuation as the State could insist us say, upon. Without some such valuation we should differentiate, I think, in a completely unjustifiable way between the owner of live stoek-in-trade and the owner of ordinary stock-in-trade.",44
225,Mr STEWART,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,The one class of stock is perishable and the other is not.,44
226,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Many classes of stock, other than live stock, are perishable.  great difference between merchandise and live stock.",44
227,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,In respect of some classes of merchandise that is so.,44
228,Mr FENTON,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,Supposin g one-half of a man's live stock that have been so valued died?,44
229,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"The honourable member is familiar with the dairying districts of Victoria and with the dairy-cattle trade. If half the increase of 100 in a given must schedule died, that would, increase the valuation of 10s. to £1. Surely, with such a provision as this a man is perfectly safe. If he takes a low valuation he can lose little or nothing. The Treasurer said that apart from the three alternatives there is another outside course which can be pursued theoretically, and that is the course of not bringing such stock into account until it has been sold or, in other words, working on a cash basis. If that course is to be adopted in respect of live stock why should it not be followed in regard to everything else?",44
230,Mr WEST,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,It should be.,45
231,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Ver y well. Take the case of a big continental merchant, who starts a year with £500,000 worth of stock, and closes it with £750,000, but shows no profit except what has passed into his stock. Such a man might say to the Commissioner, "" I have made no profit, and will not have any until I realise.""  die.",45
232,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"-That is not the point at this stage. The honourable member insists upon harping on the one string, apparently unmindful of the fact that there are other strings on which tunes may be played.",45
233,Mr FLEMING,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,W c do not mind paying on the stock we buy.,45
234,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,That goes without saying.,45
235,Mr FLEMING,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,It is the same with the merchant.,45
236,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"There is no sanctity associated with an animal that one breeds, any more than there is in respect of an animal that one buys. Both are liable to die.  deduct the cost of producing his lambs.",45
237,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Legitimat e reductions in accordance with this measure are allowed, but if we allowed an owner of live stock to bring his live stock into account for income tax purposes only when it had been sold, then, according to my mind, we should have to do something on the same lines for owners of other kinds of stock, and that would mean the dislocation of the whole income tax system.",45
238,Mr WEST,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,Why not take into account the amount over and above the taxpayer's expenditure? Put it that way.,45
239,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"The honourable member is suggesting the cash basis. If we say that receipts and outgoings shall be the only matters of which the income tax law shall take cognisance, then we scrap this Bill. If we did that, we should absolutely scrap practically every clause of the Bill, and would say "" Henceforth we will not deal with the ledger, but only with the cash book of the taxpayer.""",45
240,Mr WEST,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,I believe it is the fairest system.,45
241,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"If the honourable member applied his clairvoyant "" X "" ray mind to this problem, he would probably come to another conclusion.",45
242,Mr WEST,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,Do not go too far in describing my mind.,45
243,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"The honourable member doubts my description; I doubt it myself. I shall withdraw the words "" X ray"". Honourable members must recognise that if we were to take into account only receipts and outgoings, then all the vast increases of wealth that are occurring in the producing, mercantile, and manufacturing interests would not be brought into account until they had been turned over and the profits registered by actual payments. The income tax system provides differently. It provides, in effect, that in each year, from 1st July to 30th June, we shall bring into account the whole trading of the nation, and that whatever profits are made by people whose incomes are above a certain figure must be rendered in the schedules for that year. In ascertaining the profits made by them in that year, we take into account the increases in the value of the things they bought and still hold. Although the}' may not»have realized on them, and although it is doubtful whether they will ,get the full price they expect to obtain for them., they have to bring them into account on the stock-taking valuation. I would not tear up the income tax law by putting everything on a cash basis. I prefer to keep all taxpayers on the same basis, unless hardship amounting to injury can be shown in respect of the owners of live stock. The Treasurer has endeavoured to meet the irksomeness of the past system and the injustice of it, if* it did work injustice, and I think his proposition deserves a trial. If it is given a trial, the live stock owners of Australia will, I think, appreciate it, and will not ask for a change. The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Hunter) has dealt with bhis question authoritatively from the stand-point of the Queensland experience. Whether he said it in this House or not, he has said elsewhere that if you were to ask the stock-owners whether they would go on the cash basis, not one in twenty would accept the suggestion.",45
244,Mr HUNTER,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,Not one in three dred !,46
245,Mr BELL,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,I venture to say they would.,46
246,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"The honourable member for Darwin (Mr Bell) speaks for the southern part of Australia, while the honourable member for Maranoa speaks for the wide areas of Northern Queensland ; and here we have the clash to which the Treasurer referred.",46
247,Mr MASSYGREENE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"There is the further point, that nrobably in dealing on a cash basis, in both casesj more income tax would have to be paid,",46
248,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"I think that is so. These shrewd Queensland men whom the honourable member for Hunter represents, and who are anxious to pay as little taxation as possible, would sooner have that kind of option. I think that broadly on principle, and from the stand-point of expediency, it is proper to reject the amendment, and keep to the principles of the Bil l and the alternatives to be prescribed by the Government later.",46
249,Mr HUNTER,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Maranoa) [ 4 . 3 4 ] spoke on this subject yesterday, and I haye no desire to repeat myself. thing I did say yesterday-that the Treasurer should give people the option. I know from practical experience that if they exercise the option they will only have themselves to blame,, and will be very sorry afterwards. At the same time they have been crying out for something they have uot got, and they will not be satisfied i m t i l they get it , no matter how sorry they may subsequently be.. Many points have been touched on, and I should like to refer to what it costs to produce a beast. We were told that cattle were to bo taken at a valuation of from 10s. to £ 2 . Every business man likes to take stock at least at. what the stock cost; if we reckon .a beast at the very least, to cost 16s. a year to produce, in four years there has to be calculated four times 16s. At the end of three years there has been three times 16s. spent, and the beast may be sold for £10, but the profit is not £ 1 0 , but only £ 1 0 less £ 2 8s., or £ 7 12s. If a cash basis'be adopted, a tax has to be paid on the entire amount of £ 1 0 , and there is no escape. On a cash basis the only debits are purchases and the sales are credits; and I can give an instance where a man would make a huge loss, and yet have to pay on a huge credit. In the boom in Queensland a few years ago, hun- a man may have paid £10,000 for cattle in A p r i l ; and we must remember that in the first year he has a debit of £10,000. In the following A p r i l he may have had no rain for nine months, and he sells £10,000 woTth of cattle for £5,000. Although he has made the huge loss of £5,000, he will , on a cash basis, have to pay income tax ' on a profit of £5,000. In the case of a man who does not deal, there is an advantage. If we take the price of cattle at £ 8 , he would, on a cash basis, have to pay on a profit of £ 8 per head, whereas on the' other basis, the first year he would pay on £ 3 a head, but in the following year only on the difference, that is, £ 5 per head. W it h a graduated scheme, it is much better to pay two income taxes, one on, say, £3,000, and another on £5,000, than one income tax on £8,000.",46
250,Mr BELL,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,The averaging system gets over that.,46
251,Mr HUNTER,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"I am speaking from a professional point of view, and I - cannot vote contrary to the way in which I - I advise my clients. Out of 300 clients on my books, there is only one who adopted One the other method, and he has' suffered accordingly. There are men wham you cannot convince of the injustice that is being done to themselves. From the point of view of the income tax authorities it would be a great convenience if there was' not this stock schedule at the end of the income tax return, for it takes up a tremendous amount of time in its checking. That is the reason, I suppose, that there are so many men like myself malting a living, because people find the preparation of the schedule so difficult. It cannot be said that in his proposal the Treasurer is shirking work in this regard; but, as I have said, people axe continually crying out, and I should advise giving them the option, with an intimation that they can neverchange. I think that if that were done we should in two or three years find them asking for an amendment »of the Act. As to the amendment before us, the grown stock at the beginning of the year will be taken in , but not the natural increase. Inside three years, in the case of sheep, the grown stock will have been either sold or be dead. In three years time the people who neglected to bring in their increase of stock, would be on a , cash basis; and there would arise the old argument as to whether that is the best.

Bruce) that the whole matter will come up for reconsideration as soon as the report from the Commission has been refl37] ceived, I shall not deal with it now. I ask the Treasurer whether any provision has been made for good-will in. respect of transfers of leases? So far as I can see, the only thing to be taken into consideration The part (if any) which, in the opinion of the Commissioner, is properly attributable to the transfer of any tangible assets belonging to. the lessee; and so much of any fine, premium or foregift paid by the lessee, or any amount paid by the lessee for the assignment ... 26 or transfer of the lease, as, in the opinion of ... 26 the Commissioner, is properly attributable to ' the period of the lease unexpired at the time AYES. of the assignment or transfer by the lessee. If a man had paid a bonus of £10,000 for a ten years' lease, and five years of the ten had expired, in bringing in his costs he would put down only the proportion of the bonus relating to the unexpired period, which would be £5,000. But in many cases, the lessee has worked up the good-will, and no credit for that is given. A business may have a return of £ 5 0 a week this year, and five years hence its return may be £500 a week. I have a case very similar to that. Yet good-will NOES. is not taken into consideration, while the actual bonus paid for the lease is decreased in proportion as the period of the lease has diminished. The bonus received for the good-will is taken into account less the amount originally paid for goodw ill .

When a man purchases the lease of hotel premises, he is really purchasing the busi[4.44] - I ness, and it is not reasonable, as I see the position, that the premium which is paid, which is a premium for the righ t to conduct the business on the site transferred in the lease, should not be brought to account.

It is certainly extremely hard that such men should be penalized. But at the present time large areas in the western district of New South Wales and in the south-western district of Queensland are going to ruin because men are not prepared to expend years of effort there only to lose the results of their labours in taxation. Every year prickly pear is.spreading over thousands of acres in New South Wales and in Queensland.",48
259,Mr JOWETT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"The area of prickly pear country is increasing at the rate of 1,000,000 acres per annum.",48

I have known such country to cost £24 an acre to clear,, and then not prove worththe expenditure. A lot of country in New South Wales and in Queensland is worth £3 or £4 an acre when cleared, and other country is. worth from £2 to £3 an acre-, but, without, the offer of incentives, men will not be got to take up. that land. It would not pay any man to hire others to clear it. To use it profitably, a man must clear it with his ownlabour; putting in years of solid work in the hope that, at the end,, he: may have made an asset sufficiently valuabletokeep him.

262,Dr EARLE PAGE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Cowper) [4.57] I wish to add to what has been said by the honourable member for Robertson (Mr. Fleming) about the hardships of lessees in the back country. The intention of the original Act was not, I take it, to tax transfers of homestead leases, settlement leases, and the like, im the way that transfers of hotel leases and similar transfers are taxed. The land laws of Australia are very, complicated, and the conditions of settlement have been varied by many Governments. The Treasurer would do well' to exempt transfers of settlement leases - During the regime of the last Labour Government in New South Wales, land which originally could be taken up as conditionally-purchased landcould only be taken up under the tenure of homestead leases-. When a man who held a conditional purchase taken up in1909 sold it, any profit, he might make oni thesale as the result of his labour in .improving the landr was not regarded as income, but was: regarded as capital.

269,Mr BOWDEN,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"There are some assessments which have not yet been made. However, I wish to bring under the notice of the Committee one case which has cropped up quite recently. A man bought for ;£3,0.00 a hotel business .with a ten years' .lease to run. The itakingsof that. hotel - were .£50 a week. In .fiveyears' time he had so worked un the trade that ' the takings were £500 a week) and he sold out for £15,000. The Income Tax - Office brought into one year's account the whole of that £15,000 as income. The only deduction .they allowed in connection with his lease was half of the premium he had paid. They said that as five, years of the 10 years' lease he had acquired foT £3,000 had gone they would allow £1,500 fo represent the value of the premium for ihe unexpired period of the lease he had not utilized. Thus, they deducted £1,500 from the £15,000, at which the hotel keeper sold out, and they regarded the balance as the premium received by him for a 'five years' lease of the premises. They cut out the good-will altogether. The asset really purchased was the goodwill of that property, and was not the fact that the purchaser would still have a five years' lease to run. It was lous for the Taxation Commissioner fo contend that any one would pay £15,000 for a five years' lease, as compared 'with a sum of £3,000 which had been paid five years previously for a ten yoars' lease of the same premises, unless, of course, in the meantime the value of the good-will of the property had materially increased. The Department adopt the policy of allowing good-will to be taken into account in all businesses other than hotels.  as accretion of capital.",49
270,Mr BOWDEN,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Yes , but in order to cover not only the hotel keeper, but also the ""grocer and softgoodsman, this little word "" tangible "" has now been inserted in the Bill, putting out of court altogether any question of the good-will of a business being taken into account. It is quite an easy matter to ascertain the good-will of any business. The usual practice in Melbourne and Sydney is to estimate it at three years' profits. To cut out all consideration paid for sueh good-will in respect of all transfersand sales of businesses is totally unfair, and really amounts to levying a tax on an accretion of capital. The working of the old provision was hard enough, but the insertion of the word "" tangible "" will make a very big alteration in regard to the manner in which the Taxation Department will administer this clause in future. Therefore, I ask the Committee to agree to my amendment, and leave it out.  I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Nepean (Mr Bowden). To those of us who have taken an interest in the incidence of income taxation, it is apparent that if the clause is not amended as desired, the opinion of the Commissioner of Taxation will be that good-will must be taxed in any circumstances as a profit, and in the year in which it is paid. Any person who has had the benefit of securing an accretion of good-will over a number of years must realise that whatever increase of his capital is due to the sale of such good-will is really, and in truth, what I have said it is, namely, an increase of capital, and not income whioh is taxable under the Act. It has been said that the Commissioner treats different businesses in different ways. That is to say, he treats ridicu- the good-will of some businesses as an accretion of capital, and in other cases he regards it as income derived during the year of payment. The clause goes on to specifically omit good-will in mining businesses, and the good-will of a business that is converted into shares, and I think that if the word "" tangible "" were omitted it would give a little fairer play to many cases deserving of consideration. After all, in certain circumstances the good-will of a business may mean everything in the world to an owner. It may mean a small competence to him. Its investment may enable him to live in comfort after thirty or forty years of work, and I do think that the opinion of the Commissioner should be further narrowed, by the insertion of the word "" tangible."" Goodness knows, we give him discretion enough. Of all the Commonwealth public servants the Commissioner of Taxation has the greatest power, and I do not wish that power further increased by the inclusion of the word "" tangible.""",50
271,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Flinders-Treasurer ) [5.16] - The word "" tangible "" has been inserted because every sale of the lease of a hotel premises has exemption from taxation on the ground that it is a sale of good-will only, whilst sales of pastoral and other leases to which no good-will is attached do not get that exemption. It is considered that the payment is in respect of the future and anticipated profits over a certain number of years, and the purchaser is entitled to amortize the price he has paid for those profits. If he can do that and no taxation is to be paid by the vendor, the whole transaction escapes taxation. In order to prevent that, the word "" tangible "" has been introduced. If I accepted the amendment, that particular class of business would be removed completely from the area of taxation, whilst sales of other leases to which no good-will was attached would be taxable. Amendment negatived. Amendment (by Mr BBCCE) agreed toThat in paragraph (cl), sub-paragraph (ii), the words "" in the opinion of the Commissioner "" be omitted.  move That in the proviso to paragraph (d) the words "" the Commissioner is satisfied that"" be omitted. The sale, transfer, or assignment, of a lease is a fact that can be ascertained, and the Commissioner's satisfaction should not be involved in a question of fact. The less responsibilities we throw upon the Commissioner the better for him and the community at large.",50
272,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Flinders-Treasurer ) [5.22] - The honourable member for Swan is a little unreasonable in proposing this amendment, because the discretion which is thrown upon the Commissioner by the proviso as printect must be thrown upon somebody, namely, to determine whether the lease has been sold, assigned, or transferred "" to a bond fide prospector, or by a person, partnership, syndicate, or company who or which does not make a business of buying and selling mining properties, &c."" If the discretion given to the Commissioner were struck out the proviso would be meaningless. If u l ly share the general feeling against discretion being left to the Commissioner where that can be avoided, not because I have any doubt as to his ability or fairness, but because I am totally opposed to Acts of Parliament throwing upon some official the responsibility to determine questions. But in regard to the matter with which the proviso deals it is essential that somebody shall determine certain facts. Amendment negatived. Clause further amended verbally, and agreed to. Clauses 17 to 20 agreed to. Clause 21(1) Where in any year a company has not distributed to its members or shareholders at least two-thirds of its taxable income, the Commissioner shall determine whether a sum 1 or a further sum could' reasonably have been distributed by the company to them. - » . . . . (3) In addition to any other facts which the Commissioner may consider in exercising the powers conferred upon him by sub-section (1) of this section the Commissioner shall take into consideration the fact of the retention by the company of taxable income for the following purposes:",51
273,Mr BOWDEN,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Nepean) [ 5 . 2 6 ] - I move That after the word "" year,"" line 1, the following words be inserted :- "" or within a reasonable time thereafter."" Many companies do not declare dividends in the same year as that in which they have been earned. The dividend is declared at the annual meeting, and is distributed in the year following that in - which it was earned.",51
274,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Flinders - Treasurer) [5.28] - The clause is intended to provide what the honourable member has suggested, and if he will withdraw his amendment I shall have the drafting of the clause examined. If it does not mean that a company which made its distribution in the ordinary way after its accounts were made up, and the annual meeting was held, would be on perfectly safe ground, I shall have an amendment proposed in another place.",51
275,Mr BOWDEN,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"I accept the Treasurer's suggestion. I think he might also consider the addition of the words "" for such year "" after the word "" company "" in the last line of sub-clause 1. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.",51
276,Mr BELL,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Darwin) [5.29] - Canno t the Treasurer agree to make a concession to co-operative companies under, this clause similar to that which was agreed to by the Committee yesterday? Take the case of a co-operative company which sells goods to its own members, and, possibly, to others, and makes a profit of, say, £500 on the transactions of the year. It does not distribute that £500 amongst any of its shareholders, but retains it as a trading asset. It takes the prolit, in a sense, into its reserves, and it really becomes capital, because the company finds it nocessary for the purposes of its trade to have a larger capital. If that £500 were taxed as profits, it would be very hard on such a company. It seems to me that it would not secure the benefit that would go to other companies under this clause, where two-thirds of the profits are distributed and the remaining one-third may not be taxed. In the case of the company to which I have referred, none of the profits would be distributed.",51
277,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"A further distribution is required only if the Commissioner so 'determines, and there is a right of appeal to the Appeal Board. There is no possibility of a co-operative company which deals, with its money in the way suggested by the honourable member being taxed. If it were it would have the right of appeal.",52
278,Mr BELL,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"That is an assurance that I was seeking from the Treasurer, and I - am very glad to have it. I was afraid that under this clause a small profit of £400 or £500 made by a company, such as I have mentioned, and' not distributed by it, might be taxed.",52
279,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"The honourable member need not have the slightest apprehension - as to that.  - It should not be within the province of the Commissioner to delay coming to a conclusion in respect of the matter dealt with in sub-clause 1. I suggest to the Treasurer that he add the words, "" Provided that any determination by the Commissioner shall be made not later than six months",52
280,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"May I interrupt the honourable member? I ^have circulated an .amendment very much on those lines.   the Treasurer amend sub-clause 1 by substituting "" one-half "" for "" two-thirds "", or give us some other modification of the provision? I think it would be for the ;goed of the country in many cases if more - could be distributed.",52
281,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Elinders - Treasurer) [5.36] - I knowfairly well the facts which the honourable member has in mind in proposing that this amount should be reduced, but I am afraid I cannot see my way to accept the proposal that "" 50 per cent."" should be substituted for the words "" two-thirds."" The main difficulty is that no distinction is made between companies. A small private company of two individuals is just as much a company as is a great joint-stock enterprise. In the case of any large joint-stock enterprise, I do not think the honourable member need have the slightest fear that anything in excess of 50 per cent, is likely to be levied on. But in respect of some H3m.aU - com> panies we have to safeguard ourselves, and to see that unscrupulous people do not make use of this provision to attempt to defraud the revenue and to avoid their proper obligations. In view of that fact, I cannot consent to reduce the amount of 66$ per cent, that is fixed in the Bill, and to take out of the purview of the Commissioner altogether any one who distributes a less amount. I can assure the honourable member, however, that there is no intention of hounding people and preventing them from creating proper reserves to promote the stability and future expansion of their businesses. Having in mind the difficulty that the honourable member feels, and v the fact that there is a very great distinction in many cases between taxable and distributable income, I propose .later on to move an amendment which will make one of the specific facts that have to be taken into consideration in the determination of whether or ,not a proper distribution has been made, the relationship between distributable and taxable income. Provided that full consideration is given to that point, I do not think that many people in the community will take exception to the provision .regaining at 66| per cent, and not 50 per cent. I think that many have grave apprehensions in regard to the provision as to 66$ per cent, of the taxable income if the relationship of taxable and distributable income is not borne in mind.   not an arbitrary distribution.",52
282,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,Certainl y not - of'-a company has distributed that amount there cannot even be an inquiry as to whether it is sufficient or insufficient.  be compelled in any circumstances to distribute more?,52
283,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"No . If a company has distributed anything less than 66f per cent, the matter will be open to review; but there'is no certainty that such a company will be made to distribute more than it has done. Where a company has distributed anything less than 66f per cent., it is merely brought within the ambit of consideration; if it has distributed 66J per cent, it is taken beyond that ambit.  of the company would be considered?",52
284,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Certainly . I propose now to move Mr ""WATT - Would the honourable gentleman accept a suggestion with regard to the word "" reasonable,"" in subclause If * Mr Bruce - I have already explained to the Committee what the clear intention is. I have undertaken to look into the clause,, and, if necessary, to redraft it - "" the relation",53
285,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,V e r y well.,53
286,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"I move That after the words "" further sum"", subclause (1), the words "" (not exceeding, the excess of two-thirds of the taxable income, of the company over the amount distributed by it to its members or shareholders) "" be inserted. I submit this amendment for the reason that after the clause had been drafted certain doubts were expressed that if a company distributed only 65 per cent., and so brought itself within the purview of the Commissioner's ""onsideration, the Commissioner might then be able to say that it should distribute 70 per cent., 80 per cent., or 90 per cent., whereas in the case of a company that had been sufficiently astute to distribute exactly 66f per cent, no further action could be taken. I am proposing to insert these words merely to indicate that the power of the - Commissioner to order a distribution is limited to the same amount as would have taken the company wholly out of his consideration. Amendment agreed to.",53
287,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Flinders - Treasurer) [ 5 . 4 2 ] - I move That the following words be added to subclause (1) :- "" Such determination in the case of any financial year prior to that beginning on the first day of July, One thousand nine hundred and twenty-two, to be madenot later than the thirtieth day of June, One thousand nine hundred and twenty-three, and in the case of other financial years within six months after the date of the issue to the company of its ordinary assessment."" This amendment is very much on the lines of that which the honourable mem suggesting when I interrupted him a few minutes ago. These words are being in serted so as to give finality with regard to all previous years. The matter of the distribution, so far as previous years are concerned, has to be determined during the current financial year. For f u t u r e years it will have to be determined with in six mouths of the issue of the assessment to the company. I think that that will give a measure of finality, which is very necessary in connection with the. penal, clause of this character. Amendment agreed to. Amendment (by Mr Bruce) proposed- 1 That after the word ""consideration"", subclause (3), the following words be inserted: 'between the distributable income of the company and its taxable income and ». MT . WAT T (Balaclava) [5.44] - The spirit of this amendment .appears to be perfectly right, but it is difficult to say precisely what its effect will be if it is unsympathetically interpreted. The Commission might take into consideration the difference, which is in some 1 cases very large, between the distributive and taxable income and the income a company is entitled to. retain. The Treasurer might at some subsequent stage of the Bill , here or elsewhere, make this a littl e more definite. The honorablo gentleman will understand precisely what I mean. I do not wish to make the task of the Commissioner harder, but I desire that certainty which he aims .at as the result of the amendments to the clause. If , on consideration, the honourable gentleman can do this, he will clear up a matter which is very important to the trading community.",53
288,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"I will give the matter consideration.  - The Treasurer will realise that the distributive part of the income to which we set a maximum of 63g per cent., plus possible heavy income taxation, would absorb the greater part of the money that companies under certain circumstances wish to place to reserve. Instead of the remaining 33£ per cent, going to reserve, most of it will have to be paid in taxation, unless some l i m it be placed to the powers of the Commissioner. Amendment agreed to.",53
289,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Flinders-Treasurer ) [5.47] - I move That the following new sub-clause be added:""(6) Where in any year by virtue of subsection (2) of section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1915, or of that sub-section, as amended by the Income Tax Assessment Act 1918, any part of the income of a company not actually distributed has been deemed to be distributed to any member or shareholder of the company, his taxable income shall be reduced(a) by one-third of the total amount of the income of the company actually distributed to him and of the income of the company so deemed to be distributed to him; or (6) by the amount of the income of the company so deemed to be distributed to him, - whichever is the leas; uud the Commissioner shall refund to (him the tax overpaid. The difficulty with, regard to this clause I indicated in my second-reading speech. Certain people have been assessed under what is known as the old section 16 (2), and there are others who have not yet been assessed, but whose oases are under consideration. Under section 16 (2) the Commissioner had no option, if he determined that sufficient had not been distributed, but to say thab the whole 100 per cent, of the profits must be distributed-mus t be deemed to have been distributed, and the shareholders must pay tax on their proportion. The difficulty we were faced with was that if the cases not yet finalized were to be dealt with under the new Bill , then, in justice, the old cases would have to be reopened and tieated in the same way. To get over the difficulty of reopening the cases, reconsidering them and making a new determination, which would have beeu a very laborious task, to say the least, I propose this amendment, the purpose of which is to administer what is reasonable, even if it be somewhat rough, justice. It is proposed in all cases that have been dealt with, instead of the full 100 per cent, which has been required to be distributed, 63§ per cent, should be su.bsti= tuted.",53
290,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,And refunded to the individual taxpayer?,54
291,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"So far as the individual taxpayer is concerned, who was assessed in regard to the amount that it was found should have been distributed, he will get a. refund of what he has overpaid. But whereas formerly 100 per . cent, was deemed to have been distributed, it will now be 66{j per cent. As to the cases which have not yet been settled, they will be determined under the provisions of this Bill.",54
292,Mr BOWDEN,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,Nepean) [5.49] Does the Treasurer propose to give the shareholder any remedy against the company in cases where the tax has been collected from him instead of from the company ?,54
293,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"It has all been collected from the shareholder, under the old Act . The shareholder is the man who will get relief. . Mr BOWDEN - That is, he will get back one-third of the amount he paid, and as to the remaining two-thirds must take his own action, for, so far as I see, no remedy is provided in the Bill . Is there any power given to get from the company the tax that has been paid by the shareholder?",54
294,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,No .,54
295,Mr BOWDEN,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"I take it that the old assessments not yet paid will be a charge against the company, and not against the shareholder. Amendment agreed to.",54
296,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Flinders - Treasurer) [5.51] - I move That the following words be added to new sub-clause (C) just added-""and the company shall repay to .the Commissioner the tax previously refunded to it or dealt with as it directed in respect of the total amount of income to 'be excluded from the assessments of the shareholders of the company under this sub-section."" The company will now have to pay back to the Commissioner the amount that was refunded to it at the time that the assessment was made on the individual. I think I can make the position clear in a few words. This unfortunate transaction took place in this way: The company had undistributed profits on which it had paid the company rate of tax. The Commissioner suddenly came in and said that these profits were no longer undistributed, but had been distributed, and he went to the taxpayer and got the tax from hi m at the appropriate rate. But the company was entitled to relief for what it had paid ; and the company having got relief, we are entitled to get our share of the money back into our hands. That is all the amendment does. It puts the position as it was before the company was deemed to have distributed this one-third. This matter appears a little complicated, but really it is very simple if honourable members take it quietly. Amendment agreed to.",54
297,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Flinders - Treasurer ) [5.52] - I move That the following new sub-clause bo added:"" (7) This section shall also apply to all assessments hereafter to be .made in respect of any financial year prior to that beginning on the first day of July, One thousand nine hundred and twenty-two."" This is inserted to clear up any possible doubt as to the basis on which those assessments for previous years not yet dealt with are to be dealt with . Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 22In connection with income derived from mining operations (other than coal mining) carried on in Australia, the .following provisions ehall apply :(a) the return required by this Act to be made by the person deriving the income in the first place shall show the total income so derived during the financial year in respect of which the return is compiled; (b) the capital expended by the person carrying on the mining operations in necessary plant and development of a mining property from which income has been received (less the distributed and undistributed income derived by that person prior to the financial year for which income tax is being levied) shall be divided by the estimated number of years during which payable mining operations may be oxpected to continue under . normal conditions, and the quotient thus obtained shall, in addition to any other deduction allowed by. this Act, be deducted from the income; (c) as an alternative to the deduction allowable by the last preceding paragraph, there shall, at the option of the taxpayer, be deducted so much of the income of the financial year as is expended in that year for development or is appropriated for development (the cost of which is not deductible uncier section 23 of this Act), and for new plant.  notice that in sub-clauses a and b, the - words "" financial year"" are used. there any substantial reason why ""accounting period"" should not be substituted?",54
298,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"I see no objection to the substitution of "" accounting period"" in sub-clause a. In the case of sub-clause b I may point out that income tax is not levied for an accounting period, but for the financial year of the 'Commonwealth.  certain people whose financial year is ac| cepted as the financial year of the Commonwealth ?",55
299,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Flinders - Treasurer) I [5.54] - I quite agree as I but it appears to me that an alteration in the case of sub-clause b is unnecessary. - However, I shall look into the matter. I think it will help the honourable member if I suggest that it is in sub-clause c, and i not in sub-clause b, where the substitution of the words "" accounting period"" may be necessary. I move That in sub-clauses (a) and (c) the words ""financial year"" be left out with a view to. insert in lieu thereof the words "" accounting period."" Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 23(1) In calculating the taxable income of a taxpayer the total assessable income derived by the taxpayer from all sources in Australia shall be taken as a basis, and from it there shall be deducted(a) all losses and outgoings (not being in the nature of losses and outgoings of capital) including commission, discount, travelling expenses and interest, actually incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income (6) all rates and taxes (including State and Federal land taxes and State income tax and war-time profits tax) actually paid in Australia by the taxpayer during the year in which the income was derived, but not including any tax paid under this Act: Provided that when a taxpayer"" receives a refund of the whole or any part of any of the taxes mentioned in this paragraph the amount of the refund shall be 'brought into account as income 'in the year in which the refund 13 received; (.'») (ii) gifts exceeding Five pounds eac.1i made, during the year in which the [5.53] - I income was derived, to public charitable institutions in Australia, if the gifts are verified to the satisfaction Is of the Commissioner; (fc) the sum of Thirty pounds in respect of each child who is under the age of sixteen years at the beginning of the financial year in which the income was received, wholly maintained .by any taxpayer who is not an absentee;",55
300,Mr BOWDEN,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Nepean) [5.56] Amongst the deductions under the old Act were commission, discount, travelling expenses, interest, and expenses actually incurred, in gaining or producing the assessable income. I notice that in the Bill to that, # the words ""and expenses "" after the word "" interest"" arc omitted.",55
301,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"But the word "" outgoing "" is now used.",56
302,Mr BBTJCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,I can assure the honourable member for Nepean that there is nothing vicious underlying the change. We are proposing to exempt the same expenses.,56
303,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Balaclav.a) [5.58] - Sub clause 6 and the proviso show that it is clearly not intended to allow a deduction in respect of the Federal income tax. But the Federal income tax is mentioned, and any Tefund got in connection with it would therefore be credited. I suggest that, after the word "" paragraph,"" the words "" other than the Federal income tax"". be inserted to make the matter clear. - Mr Bruce (Flinders-Treasurer ) [5.59] - There is a prior - amendment. I move That the words ""'and war-time profits tas"", paragraph (ft), be left out. This amendment is proposed because the war-time profits tax has lapsed. There may be collections going on, but deductions ure allowable in respect <of the year when the tax was incurred. The words are quite unnecessary. Amendment agreed to. Amendment (by Mr Watt) toThat after the word ""paragraph"" in the proviso to .paragraph (-e) the words ""other than Federal income tax"" be inserted.",56
304,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Flinders-Treasurer ) [ 6 . 2 ] - I move That paragraph (e) be omitted with a view to insert in lieu tliereof the following paragraph "" (e) such sum as the Commissioner thinks .just and reasonable as senting the diminished value per centum by wear, and tear during the year in which the income was derived of any machinery, implements, utensils, rolling-stock and articles used by the taxpayer for the purpose of producing income; such wear and tear not being of a kind that may be made good by repairs : Provided that where a deduction has been allowed under paragraph (d) of this section, the Commissioner shall take into consideration the sum allowed - under that paragraph in determining the sum to be allowed under this paragraph : Provided further that where in any business income is set apart by the taxpayer by .way of a fund to cover depreciation under any of the headings mentioned in this paragraph. the amount so set apart for the year in which the income was derived shall, subject to the approval of the Commissioner, be the sum to be deducted for depreciation."" The adoption of the amendment will mean the restoration of the old provision regarding denreciation. The provision in the Bill was designed to liberalize the allowable deductions in respect of depreciation, and was the subject of most careful thought. It is only fair to mention that it was the Gommissio er who pressed for the liberalizing of the deductions allowed for denreciation. The provision was framed to deal with the obsolescence of assets generally; but many representations have been made to me about it , and the opinion generally expressed has been that if the basis now in operation, which is clearly understood, were altered, it would greatly inconvenience many taxpayers. On the other hand, I have had no strong .representations in support of our new liberalizing provision. Therefore, at the request of a great number of taxpayers, .and to meet their convenience, I have moved to substitute the old basis of depreciation for the new.  I agree with the Treasurer that from the agreed manufacturer's point of view the provision now in the Jaw is, on the balance, an improvement on that proposed in the Bill. I agree, too, that manufacturers have become familiar with the practice of the Commissioner in regard to depreciation of plant and machinery. If the Commissioner desires to liberalize the deductions allowed for depreciation and wear and tear, he has now power to do so under the Act , which allows him a disreprecretion to do what is just and reasonable. So far as m y experience of the working of the provision in regard to depreciation goes-and I have had many representations made to .me on the subject, particularly in the early years of the Act-the Commissioner errs on the mean side. I know that the maximum depreciation he allows .on machinery that can have a life of only ten years is 5 per cent, per annum., though, according to my arithmetic, it would require a generation at that rate to pay for it . As machinery is used more and more, and as so many developments have taken place in regard 'to it , I suggest, to the Treasurer that, in the interest of proficient manufacturing, the deductions allowable for depreciation should be liberalized. . Our manufacturers should have no temptation to continue, inuse machinery practically obsolete. Every encouragement should be given to themto bring their plant up'to date. Many firms - write off 10 per cent., and in some cases 1 15 per cent., on their machinery annually, and replace that machinery long before 1 it is worn out, because it is becoming obsolete. Yet the. Commissioner allows a deduction of only 5 per cent, in respect of it for depreciation. It may be argued that the cost of repairs can be deducted; but in view of the fact that it is constantly preached to us that progress in manufacturing is to be made, not by keeping' down wages, b ut by increasing the efficiencyof processes, this matter of depreciation should) receive more liberal treatment from the Commissioner.",56
305,Mr BOWDEN,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Nepean) [6.7] should like to know whether it would be possible to amend the provision whichi the Treasurer seeks to substitute for that the Bill . There is a general desire to include beasts of burden used in connection with businesses among the assets on which depreciation may be""allowed.",57
306,Mr BE LT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Darwin) [ 6 : 8 ] - I was going' to mention the matter spoken of by the honourable member for Nepean (Mr . Bowden). I would suggest the insertion after the words "" rolling stock "" of the word's "" animals used, as beasts of burdenand working beasts."" Those assetsaxe excluded in the previous clauseand , 1 should be included here. The value of beasts of burden obviously depreciates from year to year, and can be"" as easilyallowed for as the depreciation in the value of 'machinery ",57
307,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Flinders-Treasurer ) [6.9] -- I do notthink that I need reply to-the criticism of the honourable member  if the Commissioner has taken too narrow a view of the allowance which should be made for depreciation of machineryI do 'not admit that he has-ther e can be an appeal to an Appeal Board, and the result of such an appeal may be to obtain a more liberal allowance.  cently been the opportunity of appeal.",57
308,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Yes . I do not wish to be taken as admitting, for one instant,, that the Commissioner has taken an unfair view.' As to th© point raised, by the honourable member for Nepean. (Mr . Bowden), it has been the practice of the Department to make an allowance for depreciation of tfae value of beasts of burden and working beasts. I suggest that he should allow me to look further into his proposal, with a view to giving propereffect to it .",57
309,Mr FOLEY,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Kalgoorlie) [6.14] I agree with the honourable member for  the Commissioner has taken a narrow view regarding the allowance to be made for depreciation of machinery. Manufacturers have not been allowed to deduct more than5 per cent, for depreciation of machinery. When speaking on the second reading of theB ill , I mentioned a case in point. The Minister thinks that the value of the machinery can be taken into consideration. But if he says, as he did by letter to me, that - I the law need not be amended' in order to give relief to a certain taxpayer, I can see no way out if the taxpayer is to rely in on the opinion of the Commissioner as to what is a reasonable amount to allow. Amendment agreed to.  anxious to know why the deduction in respect to gifts to charitable institutions is limited to sums exceeding. £ 5 . I should imagine that, in many caseSj ten gifts of £ 1 each would, be more acceptable than one g if t of £ 5 . Will the Treasurer explain why the limitation is made ?",57
310,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Flinders-Treasurer ) [6.17] - It would be almost impossible to. administer a provision which allowed, all gifts to be included in the deductionscapable of being claimed by taxpayers. I think the figure provided in the Act' is very low, but I have left it as I found it. - ' . :  The. amount of £ 5 was fixed in the last Bill in another place for the reasons just, given by the Treasurer (Mr Bruce),, namely, that if single gifts of oneguinea each could be discriminately deducted, the saving effected to the taxpayer would not be Commensurate with 'the extra work entailed on the Taxation Commissioner's office. An y onewho has badvery much experience in connection with public movements w i ll regard the .scope"" of the. paragraph' dealing with this deduction as being: very narrow and as being' possibly liable to restrict donations t » verymany estimable public and benevolent institutions that are outside' t h * narrow ambit laid down in th© paragraph. I should like to se© some extension or widening of the provision which, while not bringing about any considerable sacrifice of revenue, would invite generous donors to make the gifts to this or that charity without suffering the infliction of having to pay income tax upon them. In my personal experience the Commissioner's definition of this provision is extremely narrow.",57
311,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Flinders-Treasurer) [6.22] - I do not agree with the contention of the honourable member for Parra should be widened; in fact, this particular class of deduction is one that should not be extended in any way. The paragraph was first inserted in th© Act at ' ii. time of the war when w© were all burning with patriotic Tervour.",58
312,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Hear , hear!",58
313,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"And when, possibly, Parliament was a little inclined to allow its sympathies to run away with it . But having found th© provision already made. I have not, on this occasion, suggested its deletiou. However, I certainly do not think that it should be extended.",58
314,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,Some of the States allow deductions for gifts to charities purely.,58
315,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"When people have spent their income in a particular way, which I trust gives them every satisfaction, as it should, if it ds in the direction of generous gifts to charitable causes, they are a little too inclined to think that the State should subsidize them for so doing. The other day a gentleman said .that he would give £25,000 to a particular institution, but he only proposed to burst into this generosity if he was freed from the payment of income tax. I looked up his case and found that the Commonwealth would be paying nearly half the gift. I have not the figures with me now, but, broadly speaking, if he had an income of £30,000 and kept £5,000 for himself, which ought to be adequate for any ordinary peison to live on, and if he gave away the remainder of his income in the direction indicated he would, on the figures' I worked out, have given about £14,000 and the Commonwealth would have given about £11,000. I have grave doubts as to whether people are entitled to be exempted from the payment of income tax in respect to gifts which one presumes are made willingly and with pleasure, and for which I understand a great reward is expected at a later period. At any rate, it is a principle which should not be extended. Mr Charlton. (Hunter) [6.25] The Treasurer (Mr Bruce) is right in saying that this provision was inserted in the Aet in an emergency during the war. Previously, no exemption was allowed in respect of charitable gifts.",58
316,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Previously , the Commonwealth had no Income Tax Act.",58
317,Mr CHARLTON,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"That is quite right, but I do not think that we would have inserted a provision of this kind if it had not been for the war. When' we passed the provision many organizations were collecting funds for war purposes, and in order to encourage gifts to those funds the provision was put in the Bill.",58
318,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,There was a special clause accompanying it in respect of Repatriation Funds.,58
319,Mr CHARLTON,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"I do not wish to push my view on the matter, but I think the time has arrived when we should strike out this exemption. Many people do not include gifts to charitable bodies in their taxation returns, and I do not think that a man who makes a gift of a large sum of money to a charitable organization has any justification for expecting to be exempted from the payment of income tax upon it . As the Treasurer has just pointed out, gifts could be made for the purpose of so reducing a man's income as to bring him to a lower rate of tax. I hope that there will be no extension of the principle.",58

331,Mr BRTJGE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Flinders- Treasurer)' [8.16] - A proposal to increase the deduction allowed, in respect of children must of necessity, appeal to every one, in) the community; but, whilst we' are' all desirous of doing' what is reasonable in that direction, there is a l i m it to the deductions that can be allowed under the income tax laws if we axe to obtain the 1 revenue necessary for the requirements of the ordinary services of the Commonwealth. This question of the deduction to be allowed in respect of children, has received full consideration. It was dealt with by the Taxation Commission, which, made a certain recommendation. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) has referred to the deduction which is allowed in Great Britain , and also to that allowed under the New South Wales Act, but he has not referred to the deductions allowed in the other Australian States. He has selected, for the purposes of his argument the State in which a deduction of £ 5 0 is allowed'. I would remind himof the position in the other 1 States. The Taxation Commission embodied in its report the provisions of all the State Acts. It set's out that in New South Wales a. deduction, of- £ 5 0 inrespect of.' each dependent child' under' eighteen) yearsof age - is permitted. In Victoria, at the time - of the presentation of the Commission's; report, no deduction in respect of children was allowed', but a 1 Bill then drafted provided for a deduction of £ 2 6 in respect of each dependent child under sixteen .jears of age.. Under the Queensland Act, there is a deduction of £ 2 6 in respect of each dependent child, under sixteeni years of; agej if the taxpayer's income does not exceed £ 8 0 0 ; so. that Queensland is very much less generous thlanis the Commonwealth. "" Underthe South Australian Act a de',' duction of .£15 in respect of each depen- dent child under fifiteen years of age is allowed if thes taxpayer's income does, not exceed £ 5 5 0 . In Western Australia thereisa deduction, of £26for each dependent child under sixteenyears of age* a< while Tasmania allows a deduction of 6s. from: the tax for each dependent child) under - sixteen years of age, if the taxpayer's income is under £350. With the exception of that allowed by the State of New South Wales, the deduction allowed by the Commonwealth is far more generous than that permitted under any of the State Acts.",60
332,Mr FENTON,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,What about the deduction all owed in Great Britain?,61
333,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Britain's position is very different from our own. The '""Royal Commission recommended a deduction - of £30 for each child under, sixteen years of age. The recommendation was embodied in the .amending. Bill passed last December, and is included in .the measure now before us. I would remind' honourable members that, under this Bill, .something more has been done. The general exemption has been lifted from £156 to £200, so that a married .man's income is exempt up to £200 .and he is .allowed 'a deduction of £30 in respect of «ach child. This question of granting a larger deduction in respeot of children was considered very - arefully by the Government before they brought in the measure now before ue. It - was taken into account in connection with the proposal to increase the general exemption to £200. We gave full consideration to two proposals-(1 ) That the general exemption should remain where it was in respect of both , single and married men, and that ,an increase should be made in the deduction for children, or (2) that the general exemption should be raised. The decision of the Cabinet was in favour of raising .the .general exemption to £200. By raising it to £200 we have probably done very much more than would have been suggested with regard to the deduction for children had we left the general exemption, at £156. What we are proposing is, I think, far more generous than anything that would have been proposed in respect of the deduction for cliKlren' had we allowed the ""exemption to remain at £156. The Committee is now invited to add to what has been given. I suggestto the Committee that too' much ie being asked. I agree that the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition towards this measure has throughout been consistent, but he has not been worried by any particular sense of responsibility, in regard to the .finances of the country, t t is easy to make proposals of this kind, which .must of necessity command the sympathy of all honourable members, but I suggest dt is hardly fair to try to increase the deduction in .respect of children when the generalexemption has been raised to £200.",61
334,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,Can the Treasurer - tell us what - amount would be involved in lifting the deduction .to the extent of £10 .per child-?,61
335,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"No ; but I can give the Committee some figures that will help them - in arriving at a proper calculation. When the deduction was lifted from £26 to - £30 it involved a loss of revenue amounting to about £40,000. On the basis of those figures, to raise it from £30 to .£35 would cost about another £45,000, land to raise it from £35 to £40 per child would cost an additional £50,000. The point I wish to stress is that the deduction we are now giving was recommended by the Royal Commission, and that the question of a still further deduction was considered by the Cabinet. Instead of - raising the .deduction beyond £30, we .'have done something which will probably ,give greater relief than would have been afforded - a man with children had we left the general exemption where it was and raised the deduction for .children.. .The reason that the Cabinet decided to raise 'the general .exemption instead of increasing the deduction for children was that, by raising the general exemption, the administrative costs would be very materially reduced. Had we raised the deduction for children and left the general exemption where it was we should still, have been faced with the necessity of handling and considering a great mass of income tax returns - of which we are now free.",61
336,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Does not the Treasurer^ averaging proposition, as embodied in this Bill, cancel .the decrease in cost of administration which he secured by lifting the exemption?",61
337,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,Certainly . The reason that justifies the .absorbing in that way of .the expenditure so saved is that the averaging system is an attempt-a n attempt with which some .people may not agree-to place the burden of taxation more equitably upon the shoulders of the taxpayers.,61
338,Dr EARLE PAGE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,rl s this not an attempt to place it more equitably upon the shoulders of people with families ?,61
339,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Quite so. We have raised' the general exemption, and the burden ie' now more equitably borne than it was. Having observed a fundamental principle' of taxation-the principle that you should try to collect your, revenue with a minimum of cost-it seems to me that so long as we are giving reasonable equity the Committee would go too far if , superimposed on the additional relief we have given, it endeavoured to crease the deduction in respect of children. I would ask honourable members not to be carried away by their sympathetic feelings with respect to this particular point. It is an easy appeal, and an easy cry to raise. We, as legislators, however, have a great responsibility, and are not entitled to respond to sentimental cries that appeal to us, and arouse in us the desire to do things which in our saner, moments we would not consider to be justifiable. For these reasons I appeal to the Committee to accept the basis of deduction per child which was embodied in the amending Bill passed last December-a n increase on the former deduction-and which is again repeated in this measure. I have just been handed the figures for which the right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr. Watt) asked. To raise the deduction for children from £30 to £ 3 5 would mean a loss of revenue amounting to £ 4 5 , 0 0 0; to raise it from £ 3 0 to £ 4 0 would involve a loss of revenue amounting to £95,000, and to raise it from £ 3 0 to £ 5 2 would mean a loss of revenue amounting to £220,000.",61
340,Sir ROBERT BEST,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"And the GovernRoyal Commission. ment has already sacrificed £600,000 in revenue.",62
341,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"It should be borne mind, as mentioned by the honourable tions? member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best), that in this Bill there is relief to taxpayers, included amongst whom are who would benefit by an increased deducof tion for children, amounting to £600,000.  we decreased the general exemption in case of single men, from £200 to £ 1 5 0 ?",62
342,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"I cannot give the orable member the exact figures, but can tell him that the additional revenue which would thus be gained would to great extent be lost to the Commonwealth by reason of the additional expenditure emption. we should incur in collecting, since we should have to consider and handle the to incomes of £800 . returns of all single men whose incomes ranged between £ 1 5 0 and £200.",62
343,Mr WATKI NS,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Newcastle) [8.29] We have heard a lot from the Treasurer (Mr Bruce) as to the loss of revenue which would be involved in raising the deduction allowed in respect of Australian-born children; but I would remind the Committee that the honourable gentleman is a member of a Government that is spending on immigration considerably more than the loss that would be so in - - incurred. We are often told that our best immigrant is the Australian-born child; but when we show a desire to encourage in a small way the rearing of such immigrants, we are met with a "" poor mouth "" on the part of the Government, who declare that they cannot alford the money. It must be remembered that, at the same time, the Government can find money to help to bring children from other parts of the world. We are told that to raise the exemption to £52 will result in a loss 'of revenue amounting to £220,000. But who is going to get the benefit of the remission ? Not the men and women of this country who would rather nurse dogs than children. Those who will get the benefit are the average citizens, who believe that married life means what it was intended for. It seems to me that we might as well have left the whole matter of in come taxation to the Royal Commission. Every time an honourable member proposes what he deems to be an improvement in the Bill he is referred to the opinions expressed in the report of the",62

The Treasurer if has referred to the general exemption of the £200 under the income tax law, but I remind the honourable gentleman that honthat exemption is not like those under I the State income tax laws. The States have a clean-cut exemption, but ours is a a diminishing quantity. For every £ 3 a man earns over £ 2 0 0 he loses £ 1 of ex",62
346,Mr WATKINS,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"That is before the exemption is entirely wiped out; but every £ 3 earned over £ 4 per week means a loss of £ 1 in the exemption. In New South Wales, the State exemption, whatover it is, applies to all, and does not diminish, in the round-about way adopted in Commonwealth legislation.",62
347,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,The object ofshading off the exemption is to catch men who reach the higher incomes- a policy that has always been urged by the honourable member's party.,63
348,Mr WATKINS,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"The Hansard records will show that when the honourable gentleman who interjects was Treasurer, and the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) raised this point, the honourable gentleman would not admit that the diminishing exemption would work in the way it has done.",63
349,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,I am talking of shading off the exemption.,63
350,Mr WATKINS,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"I do not knew that this exemption represents a fair way of imposing taxation; in my view, if there is an exemption, it should be' a proper exemption. I hope the Treasurer sees that the time has come when the present exemption of £ 3 0 might well be increased in order to afford some assistance to people who are trying to rear families in Australia.",63
351,Mr JOWETT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Grampians) [S.35] I trust I shall not be accused of raising this question, or of taking part in a discussion on it , merely because we are on the «vo of an election.

352,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,I remember your eloquent speech!,63
353,Mr JOWETT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"I thank the honourable member very much. We were, however, defeated in our efforts on that occasion, when we asked that the exemption be raised from £ 2 6 to £ 5 2 . On the next occasion that presented itself, 8th October, 1918, I again introduced the subject, and submitted an exactly similar amendment, but was defeated. I am glad, however, that .as a result of the discussion created by such amendments, greater prominence has been given to the subject.",63
354,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,Y o u r thunder has been ' stolen!,63
355,Mr JOWETT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"I have no regrets on that score. I do not care from what quarter such a proposal is made, I intend to support it . Had I not happened to be called out for a moment I should, myself, have submitted a similar amendment. The exemption for - children has now been increased from £ 2 6 to £ 3 0 ; and I shall support my honourable friends opposite in making it as large as possible under this Bill . Twice have I moved that it be raised to £52, and I am quite prepared to support an exemption of £ 6 0 . This is the gravest question that has ever been brought before any Legislature in Australia. An adequate increase of our population is absolutely dependent on the attitude' which the. community generally, including this Legislature, adopts towards the two conditions of life-on e known as single blessedness, and the other as married happiness. I am a warm supporter of the immigration of people of British blood; and I am certain that there is no necessity to take steps to import people of other races. There are tens of thousands of men, women, and children in Great Britain who would make magnificent settlers in this country-so many are there who are perfectly ready to come that I feel sure we should not be able to provide sufficient ships to carry them. But in addition to immigration we must take every opportunity presented by a measure such as this, which, however indirectly, may tend to increase our native-born population. The question of making proper allowances to people who are prepared to undertake tha difficulties and responsibilities of parentage lhas never, I believe, been adequately considered by this Chamber. Owing to the increase in the cost of living since the beginning of the war, it has become more and more difficult for married people to bring up their children in the way they ought to be brought up, and there has been created a much wider gulf between the cost to a single person of living i h comfort and happiness and the cost to married people. The income now required to support a family in comf o r t is much larger than it was some years ago, as compared with the incomenecessary to support a single person. The result is that people who decide to get married, and who, in the natural course of events, are blessed with children, find themselves at a great disadvantage; and the Legislature should endeavour to remove every obstacle from their path. This Bill presents one means by which those obstacles can, to a certain extent, be removed. In my view it is not a question of whether it will cost £50,000, i £90,000, or £200,000. Within this very month we have proposed to make taxation remissions amounting to over £3,000,000. When those remissions were being considered, the very first to claim attention should have been the remissions to people who are undertaking to bring up families in this country. It .seems to me, however, that it is only at the last moment that anything of the kind has been thought of. Having remitted taxation amounting to - over £3,000,000 we may surely spend £50,000 or .£90,000 in making the most important remission of all. I feel most strongly on this subject. I . bave voted for Ian exemption of £52 before, and I .shall support the largest exemption that the Committee is prepared to accept. Mar. WEST (East Sydney) [8.44],No one will accuse me of not taking part in discussions <on this question when it has ibeen before honourable members on previous occasions. The Treasurer night is labouring very hard; indeed, he reminds me .of a man who is endeavouring .to push a heavy wheelbarrow up a hill, and finds that he cannot do so withon out assistance. The honourable gentleman talks about sentiment; but what sentiment influenced him when, in his Budget speech, .he proposed to relieve 20 per cent, of the people of this country of £1,900,000 of taxation? .He has no hesitation in taking £3,500,000 from Trust Funds to relieve gentlemen who are connected with public 'companies, who, during the whole of this debate on taxation, have been watching and endeavouring to obtain more relief for themselves and their friends. It is not the wealthy section of the community that has .the large families. Those best able to keep children have the fewest. If the Treasurer had to live .on the basic wage of £3 18s. a week fixed in New South Wales, and had a family of six children, he would view very differently the proposal to increase the deduction for children, and would not have made the soeech that we have heard from hdm. I know that if he and I together took the public platform on this auestion, I would have the audience with me. Reference was made to the New South Wales law. There the exemption is £250. with a deduction of £50 for each child. In that State a Government with humanitarian ideals has been in power. The population of New South Wales is increasing rapidly, past Governments having laid the foundation of a prosperity that has increased by leaps and bounds. 1 do not worry much about those who are well off; it is what Blatchford calls the ""bottom dog,"" those who have not too much of this world's goods, whose interests need guarding in a matter of this kind. The Treasurer's concern was not for the "" bottom dog "" when he reduced the income tax by 10 per cent., which means that a man who formerly had to pay £1,000 in income taxation can *.ow give £100 to his .wife as a present for jewellery or other expenses. The honourable ,gentleman has forgotten those 'Who have to .straggle for a living, and are not in constant .employment. It is they who need ,a deduction of £3.0 for each .child. It is the men and women who are .rearing .large families i£or whom we should .have most consideration. I know what it means to bring up :a large family because I .had as many .as ten to- children. Australia - is under a idflmocratic .form of - government, - and - the peopled interests should be studied. It should not be necessary to put up a fight behalf of an increased deduction for children. The - man with :a wife and family of sex*en tor - eight children contributes proportionately much more to the revenue ithan is contributed by the msmwith only a wife :and a ichild ior stwo. When income .taxation was first imposed, in. .1842, its 'object *was to tobtain revenue from those who iwer.e. in a position to contribute to the needs of the State, but the ordinary man with a family of four or live is not in a position to pay income tax, and it was never intended that hia in come should , be taxed. In the Budget, the Treasurer promised reductions of taxation on behalf of classes - which can well afford to pay. On the'Taxation Commission, of which we heard so much, there was not a representative of Xabour.",63
356,Dr EARLE PAGE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,Yes ; Mr Duffy.,64
357,Mr MATHEWS,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"And a very fine fellow,too.",64
358,Mr WEST,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"If he opposed .the increasing of the deduction for children he made a mistake. I understood from the Treasurer that the Commission ,is in favour of the present deduction. In Amcrica..a deduction of £50 is allowed for each child, and there is an exemption of £500. There .they understand ho,w ito make income .taxation .equitable. Tihe deduction originally provided for in the Gommonwealth. Income Tax Act was made low because, at thei time, the country was at war.",64
359,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"The - Labour party, in framing that measure, provided for a. deduction of only £13 for. each, child.",65
360,Mr WEST,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Many of us objected that that deduction wasi too small;, but we were reminded that, the country was a* war, and that, a heavier burden of taxation, had, therefore, to be imposed than would, be proper in peace times. cumstances must govern the imposition of taxation. Thus it was that we came to propose an. exemption of £156 and a deduction of £13 for each child. We have been called disloyalists; but we were loyal enough to impose heavy burdens, on our own. class during, the war time, and should, be commended for what we did. It should not be a reflection on us that the deduction for children we proposed was small.",65
361,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"My remark was meant, not as a reflection', but as a reminder.",65
362,Mr WEST,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Some of those sitting near the right honourable member regarded it as a reflection on us. During the consideration of the Bill in Committee, I have been surprised to note the keen watchfulness of the Treasurer aud thesupporters of the Ministry on behalf of public companies, wealthy squatters, and other wealthy persons; the interests of the' rich could not have been more safeguarded. I think that it is .my duty to safeguard the interests of the poor. My life has been a strenuous one, but I am still full of vigour, and ready to champion the class from which I have sprung. Environment makes character, and the poor cannot get any one to represent them better than a member of their own class. The Treasurer talks about the burden of taxation, but after all the bouquet ;th!rawinjg hei benefits 75 per cent, of the people by remitting their taxation to the extent of £600,000, and benefits the other 25 per cent, by re. nuttingtaxation affecting them to the extent of £2,000,000. Apparently it will devolve upon honourable ' members of the Labour party, when they get on the other side of the Chamber, to see that justice is done to taxpayers with families; but I think that the Treasurer should mark his period of office by agreeing toi'the proposal put forward' fro m - this' side. If he would do so his memory would be; kept green,, because he would be doing somethingthat would give satisfaction to the masses.",65
363,Dr EARLE PAGE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"(Cowper) [9.5]- While the Treasurer (Mr Bruce)' was speaking, it seemed to me there was. running through his speech the refrain, "" Children, have no votes."" He advised the Committee not to be led away by sentimental] reasons.. As a matter of fact, almost every exemption provided for by Cir- the: Treasurer in the Bill has a good solidreason in the shape of votes behind it . The incidence of taxation largely determines where people live and what they d'o>;- it also largely determines the character of the population. Therefore, the. Treasurer should have given consideration to the raising of the deduction for children before agreeing to raise the exemption in the case of single men. The best immigrants Australia can have are the kiddies born here, and with the many calls that modern society makes upon the purse of the breadwinner, ib is often a difficult matter for families to live in decent comfort. Men in my pro^ fession axe able to judge where the shoe pinches in the household better than most men are able to do, and, speaking with that knowledge, I claim that the first remission of taxation should be in regard to those persons who have families. Last year I said that I would support the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) 1 upon this matter; but when it was pointed out by the then Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) that, by agreeing to the amendment the honourable member had submitted the revenue would be reducedto the extent of £200,000 or £300,000, and it was .already over £2,000,000 short, I supported the Government. However, we found that, although we had saved £200,000 or £300,000 by rejecting the honourable member's proposal and taking the money from the parents of children, the Government, despite their promise to effect economies, spent £1,000,000 morethan Parliament voted for them. In these circumstances, and as exemp1 tions are being made in other directions which are not so vital, I - have no hesitation to-night in saying that I shall support, the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton). If there is to be any remission of taxation, he - has indicated the direction in 1 which we should make a start, aud I shall do my best to see that it does start there.",65
364,Mr ROBERT COOK,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Indi) [9.8] We want to do simple justice in this matter. Although I cannot see my way clear to support a deduction to the extent of £60 ior each child, I think that the Treasurer might compromise by fixing the amount at £40. Under the proposal of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) a man with three children and a salary of £7 5s. a week would escape the payment of income tas. If the deduction were fixed at £40 for each child, a man with a family of three children and a salary of £ 6 5s. per week would escape the payment of income tax. Therefore, I think a deduction of £40 would be reasonable. I regard £30 as altogether too small a deduction to make, in view of what it costs to rear a family. No honourable member would care to keep a child on less than £40 per annum.",66
365,Mr MCGRATH,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Ballarat) [9.10] It is refreshing to find that the Country party are coming into line with the Labour party at this eleventh hour.  them. Mr MoGRATH - No, not all of them. It is a fact that nine out of tenof them voted against us in this matter last session.",66
366,Mr BRENJIAN,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Do not say anything now, or they may divide again.",66
367,Mr MCGRATH,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,We can see that an election is not far off when we find the Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page) standing up to-night and supporting the amendment submitted by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton).,66
368,Dr EARLE PAGE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"I supported it last year. Mr MCGRATifL-But other members of the honourable member's party did not. When the Treasurer tells us in his Budget that the Government propose to remit £2,000,000 of the taxation paid by the wealthy classes of Australia, and that it is proposed to spend £200,000 or £300,000 per annum on immigration, thero should be no hesitation in giving some relief to those people who are already in this country, and who have families. As a matter of fact, I believe that the general exemption should be raised to £300. A young Australian soldier who was wounded on several occasions married in London and brought his bride to Australia. The couple arc living at Malvem, 3^ miles out of Melbourne. The husband earns £200 per annum. They pay £1 2s. 6d. per week for two rooms and the use of a kitchen, 10s. per week for their furniture which they have bought on time payment, and about 10s. per week for debts incurred in .other ways. They were kind to me when I was in London, and I have asked them on several occasions to come up to the House and have tea with me, but they tell me that they cannot afford to make more than one trip per fortnight to Melbourne. Yet these are the people we are asking to pay income tax. Can we imagine a couple in such circumstances having children?",66
369,Mr JOWETT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"We could imagine that all right. Mr MoGRATH - It is all very well for the honourable member, with his millions of acres, to talk in this way, but there is no doubt that this couple are financially embarrassed. The Government speak of spending £10,000,000 upon introducing people from abroad; yet many of our people are in very straitened circumstances. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) proposes to give some relief to those people by, in the first place, increasing the allowance for each child to £60. When the Treasurer is able to relieve the wealthy classes of £2,000,000 of taxation, I apnea! to him not to listen to the honourable member for Balaclava when he asks that everybody should be interested in taxation, and that there should be no exemptions. It is very easy for the honourable member and those similarly situated to speak of no exemptions.",66
370,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,I have never spoken of no exemptions.,66
371,Mr MCGRATH,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"A mother with two or three children and a husband earning about £4 per week, which is about the average wage today, has a serious problem in making both euds meet. We ask that people of this class should be given a little consideration. I think they should be absolutely exempt from taxation. If an increase of population is essential, make living easier for'the people who have families. I am heartily in accord with the proposed increase of the allowance to £60., and I hope that later the Committee will agree to increase the general exemption to £300.",66
372,Mr BELL,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Darwin) [9.18] - I certainly ""think that one of the first remissions of taxation should be in favour of those who have families to rear; but the allowance should be based upon the reasonable cost of maintaining a' child. The proposed allowance of £60 is too high, for it does not necessarily cost that amount to maintain one child, or £120 to maintain two children, in reasonable comfort for the year. I look upon an allowance of 15s. per week for the maintenance of a child as reasonable, and I shall be prepared to support the honourable member for Indi (Mr Robert Cook) in uiakiner the deduction £40 in respect of each child. The amount proposed by the Leader of the Opposition is a little more than is reasonable, having regard to the cost of maintenance.",67
373,Mr CONSIDINE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Barrier) [9.19] It is rather amusing to listen to honourable members opposite voicing their opinions about what is fair and reasonable for the other chap. The honourable member for Darwin told the Committee that ho is quite in favour of a fair and reasonable allowance in respect of each child; but what is fair and reasonable is to be determined by him. He is like the ""good employer '' who is in favour of reasonable wages, provided he is the judge of what is reasonable.",67
374,Mr BELL,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,I was not returned to this Parliament to accept the honourable member's judgment.,67
375,Mr CONSIDINE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"I thought the honourable member was returned to Parliament to hear the rights and wrongs cf the people, and do justice, and not to vote in accordance with preconceived ideas. He is influenced by prejudice, and not by the justice of the case. Taxation is, of course, important for honourable members opposite, who devote most of their time to wrangling about its incidence. Employers will take good care that the working men and women have very little trouble with taxation. In New South Wales at the present time the basic wage is £ 3 18s. 6 d so that the lower-paid workers are deprived of the benefit of the £200 exemption. In other States the basic wage is approximately the same, and when the campaign that is being conducted by those who are satisfied and those who are dissatisfied with the present occupants of the Treasury bench is completed, the wages received by the working men and women will not be such as to necessitate their burning midnight oil in making out their income tax returns. I know that the great mass of the working men and women will not be benefited by a measure such as this. A certain strata of the working classes will be benefited, but they are not the great majority; they are not those who are the first to experience reductions in wages, and who find it so hard to make ends meet. The honourable member for Indi (Mr Robert Cook) spoke of giving exemption to workers who are in receipt of £6 or £7 per week; but how many of the working men and. women are paid that amount?",67
376,Mr HILL,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,Thos e people will not be troubled with taxation.,67
377,Mr CONSIDINE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Of course, they will not, but the honourable member does not seem anxious to divest himself of his "" troubles"" and get busy with a pick and shovel at £ 3 18s. 6d. per week 1",67
378,Mr HILL,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,Ditto .,67
379,Mr CONSIDLNE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"If the honorablo member and his colleagues have their way, I shall soon have an opportunity of doing that. I h my pre-parliamentary days, neither I nor my mates were troubled with income tax returns, but we were troubled by the honourable member and his friends, who tried to reduce our wages, although they did not constitute a taxable income. I fail to see that taxation is a burning question amongst working men and women. Of course, it is a matter of great concern to honourable members who represent the various conflicting commercial, manufacturing, and agrarian interests, which today are proposing to form new parties to further their respective selfish ends. The capitalistic press in Melbourne is telling U9 that politics are merely a reflection of the struggle between the steel interests and certain manufacturing interests represented by honourable members opposite. We saw something of that struggle in connection with the war-time profits tax, when various groups were trying v to shift the burden of the tax on to the shoulders of each other. We can well understand why honourable members get so heated in their discussion of the rights and wrongs of taxation. As I have pointed out before, and shall do again, the - working men and women are not concerned about getting exemption from income taxation, because it is not theTaxation Department that robs them; they are robbed in the> fields-, the factories, the mines, and the workshops. Their' concern is to stop robbery a»t thepoint of production. However, I intend to support the amendment, moved by the Leader of the Opposition, because it will benefit, certain sections of the working classes-thos e who. are already enjoying certain advantages in comparison with, other working men and women. Later, I shall propose a further allowance to a married man who is wholly maintaining relatives other than his children. Single men wholly maintaining a parent or parents are allowed a deduction, but a married man who also is maintaining his parents receives no 'consideration, «ty cept in respect of his children. When a taxpayer is supporting a parent or parents wholly dependent upon him, he should be allowed the deduction that is permitted' in respect of children. I propose later on to move the insertion of the words "" and/or parent,"" so that the paragraph, if amended' as proposed, will them read,The sum of sixty pounds in respect of child who is under the age of sixteen years at the beginning of the financial year in which theincome was received and/or a parent wholly maintained by any taxpayer who is not an absentee, shall be allowed as a deduction from income. We have heard a lot from the Ministerial side as to "" common justice,"" and I think that honourable members will agree that as an act of common justice the amendment have foreshadowed should be agreed to. If it is right that a. deduction should' be allowed a taxpayer in respect of the children whom he is maintaining, then it must appeal with added force to honourable members that if such a taxpayer has the additional burden of maintaining an aged parent who is absolutely dependent upon him, he should be allowed a similar deduction in respect of that parent. If honourable members opposite are really desirous of reducing the burden of taxation imposed upon these people-if their professed desire to increase the deduction in respect of children is not a mere electioneering cry-the n they will support the further amendment of which I have given notice. . . Mr Considine.",67
380,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Flinders-Treasurer ) [9.33}. - This question has been discussed at considerable length, and many vieww have been expressed, but I am inclined' to think that all who have spoken, are notquite clear as to the exact meaning of this proposal. If the deduction is in1 creasedto £60 per child it means that a. married man with two children will not be liable to taxationunless his incomeis more than £320 per annum.",68
381,Mr MAKIN,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"And quite right, too.",68
382,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Some honourable members take that view, but it seems to me that such an exemption would be far too high, and much in excess of what is required to meet the ordinary necessities of a man before he is brought within the income tax area. The Leader of theCountry party (Dr Earle Page), for some reason that I cannot fathom, prefaced his remarks by suggestingon my part an absolute want of good faith in the proposal I had put forward. I may have many sins, but I do not know that want of good faith is an outstanding one. The honourable member said that, underlying my observations with respect to this amendment, there was the thought that children have no votes. Such a statement was a little unprovoked, and quite uncalled for; each but, since the honourable member has made that suggestion against me, I . think I am quite fair in making a counter suggestion against him.. I would remind him that while children may have no votes, their parents have. There is probably no more burning question throughout Australia than that as to the extent of the' deduction from income tax that should be allowed in respect of. children. An honourable member with an eye to the elections I oould not .take up, a morepopular cry than that of "" increase the deduction for children."" The Leader of the Country party's suggestion that my attitude in opposing the amendment to increase the deduction was governed by a desire to please the electors, and that I was quite ruthless in respect of matters that would not affect votes certainly shows a very fundamental misconception of the whole position. If I were desirous 1 of putting forwardsomething that would appeal ,to the electors as a whole I could not do better than propose to increase the deduction for children. If we aregoing to impute motives- I suggest it is wholly undesirable, although when, one is attacked in that way. one is driven to reply in a similar strain- I would paint out that last December, when such a horrible thing as a general election was not near at hand, the honourable member declared that he would not, and he did not, vote for a proposal then submitted by the Leader of the Opposition to increase to £60 the deduction for children. Now that a general election is close at hand, he has changed his attitude. Mr BROWSE. - Tha b is not the reason 'he igave for his change of attitude.",68
383,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"He gave a most plausible 'reason, which suggested, I think, that he had been looking up what he actually said when the amending Bill was before us .last December, .and was - endeavouring to safeguard himself. Mr Watt. - The honourable member knows, does he not, that imitation is still. the sincerest form of flattery ?",69
384,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"I shall deal with that point in a .moment. The Leader of the Country party said last December that he could not vote to raise the deduction from £30 to £60; per child, ibecause, having regard to the then state of our finances, we could not alford the loss revenue that such an amendment would involve. Had my modesty permitted, I might have suggested, in reply to him this evening, that . probably the reason he was now prepared to vote for such an amendment was that I had so improved the financial position that we could afford the loss of revenue .that it would entail. The honourable member put forward the amazing explanation of his present .attitude that, after all, we were so reckless and were wasting so much money that it did not matter much whether or not a. further sum waa wasted. That was the substance of his explanation, and I think honourable members will agree with me that it is wholly insufficient. The right honourable .member for Balaclava (Mr Watt) has said that imitation is still the sincerest form of flattery. Underlying that statement, no doubt, is the suggestion that if the Leader of the Country party is going to attribute motives to me I might very well respond in the same way.",69
385,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,Not at all - Mr BLAKELET,69
386,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"I do not want to do, anything of the kind. Coming back to the question immediately before the Chair, I maintain the position I took up originally, that ithe deduction proposed by the Government, taken in conjunction with the fact that we have raised the general exemption to £200, is reasonable and proper. I realise, however, that at times we are met with an expression of opinion that cannot be overlooked, and that the .general opinion of the Committee is that some' f urther concession should be given to taxpayers with children. The Government cannot for one moment entertain *he amendment moved by the Leader of the 'Opposition, providing that the 'deduction 'shall be raised to £60 'per child. Such an increase is quite out of the-question, and would be extremely unfair to the general body of taxpayers. In addition, the.Joss - of revenue which it would involve is more than we could contemplate, when taken in conjunction with our general - financial proposals for the year. In order, - however, to - meet the wishes of the Gommittee, as so freely expressed, and without in any way receding from the?position that its original proposition is reasonable and fair, .the Government is prepared to raise the deduction from £30 to £39, which is - equal to 15s. per week for each child. The .of Government is anxious to meet the wishes of the Committee, but it cannot agree to any greater deduction than £39 per child.",69
387,Mr BLAKELET,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Darling) ,[9.45] It is most extraordinary that the Treasurer (Mr Bruce) should, without any soliciting from the House, be so prodigal towards a certain section of the community. But, of course, the soliciting of 'that section is not done in the chamber; there is no necessity for the wealthv section to which T refer to do their lobbying here, seeing that it can be done through the organizations which control the Government. The Treasurer came down to this House with a proposal to afford taxation relief amounting to £2,100,000 to a certain 'section of the community. Not one penny of that relief so granted helps the particular class which the amendment now before us has in view. We are not now concerned about the wealthy with large families-the wealthy can bear the brunt.",69
388,Mr MCGRATH,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"It is extremely hard to find the wealthy with large families. - It is not popular or fashionable for the wealthy to have large families, and it is left to the poorer classes of the community to populate this and every other country. ""When the Government, through its Treasurer, throws its millions of relief about, at least a portion should find its way to the workers in order to lighten the burden of taxation they now bear. The worker with three or four children pays very highly indeed towards the upkeep of the country; if he did not pay one penny in income tax, he would pay considerably more than is paid by many who pay income tax, because of the tolls which are made on the clothing he and his family wear, the food they consume, and everything they use. When £100,000 has been thrown to one section, £500,000 to another, £750,000 to another, and so on, by way of relief from taxation, we find the Treasurer on this occasion degenerating into a miserly huckster, who says, "" Well, if you put it that way I will give you another 3d., but if you are very pressing I might make it 5d., or if the numbers are against me I might even bo so generous as to make it 6d.!'' He now throws to the Committee 15s - "" are there any more offers on 15s.?"" On the one hand we see £2,100,000 given to one section of the community, and £9 offered to another section. .That is a sort of discrimination to which only the representative of the Government could give effect. The Government have given a £5,000 exemption in the case of the unimproved land values tax, an exemption which is enjoyed by the large landholder, whether he be worth £1,000,000 or £10,000,000.",69

We are prepared to do the fair thing by the workers of this country. It may be interesting to know thab this is not the first time the Labour party has endeavoured to afford this relief to a very deserving section of the community. On the 8th December, 1921, the present Leaden of the Opposition (Mr. Charlton), when an Income Tax Bill was under consideration, moved that the deduction allowable for each child should be £60.

409,Mr CONSIDINE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"1 understand that dependants have been provided for already. When I mentioned thisr matter previously I thought that the Treasurer would reply to what I had said, but he 8 did not do so. I do not know whether he AYES. failed to hear what I said, or whether he did not think the matter worthy of his attention, but I ask him now to give it every consideration. The present position is a real grievance to a number of persons who are supporting their aged parents. The single man is relieved of income tax to the extent to which he supportsa dependant, but when he marries and has the additional responsibilities of keeping a family, the Taxation Department does not recognise the fact that he has the NOES. continued burden of supporting his aged parent. The Treasurer has seen fit to lighten the burdens of those with families by increasing the deduction allowed in respect of each child. If he extended this provision and allowed a deduction in respect of an aged and dependent parent the charge of electioneering tactics made by the Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page) to which the Minister appeared so sensitive would not apply. Those people who support their parents may not be very numerous/, but I do not think politicians are keen enough to keep Marr, C. W. G. a list of them.

The honourable member had indicated that he proposed to move his amendment at a subsequent stage. However, I cannot accept it . The deductions allowed are very generous indeed, and have been a further liberalized in regard to children. The honourable member states that every argument used in favour of increasing or (he deduction in respect of children could be applied with equal force in respect of dependent fathers or mothers, hut as a matter of fact we could apply the argument in respect of 'all those who support others to an . extent that would entirely exempt them from taxation.

I - intend to make one addition. I NOES. have provided, in regard to the deduction :for funeral .expenses, that the .amount - shall not exceed £20. That covers all ordinary funerals. I propose the following:Then followed a clause worded exactly like the amendment I 'have proposed, except that the amount was £ 2 0 , instead of £ 3 0 . It is quite a .serious matter for a man with a limited income when sickness overtakes - him or his family, in volving a. cost - of £ 2 0 or £ 3 0 for one or two consultations, and probably .hospital expenses as well. I met last 'week a man who is in a. small way of .business a considerable distance from a medical man. .He had to send his wife to a hospital, PAIRS - and the expenses would amount i o between £20 and £30.

412,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Flinders - Treasurer) per [10.33] - Case s of illness and death Comnaturally excite our sympathy, but - the of .exemptionsprovided in this Bill - are already very large, and there must be a limit to them. The position of the Commonwealth is very different from that of Viotoria. This Bill gives much more generous exemptions than does the Victorian Act, and allows of the possibility of a man making provision for the vicissitudes of life. 1 know it is very difficult far men with small incomes to do that, but this Bill provides more opportunity in that way than does the Victorian taxation law.",73
413,Mr MCWILLIAMS,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,Tb e taxpayer has to pay both State and Federal taxes.,74
414,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"That is so; but we hmo tried to arrange our taxation in a way that is just aud equitable. The exemptions which this Bill provides are just and equitable. Whilst the vicissitudes of life are hard to meet and are very distressing to those whom they overtake, it 13 impossible in. an income tax system, although possibly desirable, to provide that a man who experiences any misfortune shall receive special treatment. Although I have the very greatest sympathy with those for whom relief is sought in this amendment, I cannot see my way to agree to its incorporation in the Bill.  Whilst I should like to be able to support the amendment, there is not the same need for it as there is for a provision granting some relief to those who do not enjoy the convenience and advantage of adjacency to medical attendance. In the great centres of population there *re lodges and societies which men may join for a small quarterly fee, and medical attention may be obtained cheaply through those channels. I am more concerned about the people in the outback portions of the Commonwealth, and I understand that recently the income tax law in Western Australia was altered to provide that the medical expenses of people in remoter portions of the Stats should be deductible from their incomes. If people are to be induced to go into the country, and if women are to bear children there, special consideration must be given to them.",74
415,Mr FENTON,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"My amendment applies to all people.  back-blocks the nearest doctor may be 20 miles, and even 100 miles, distant. Medical fees in the city may be a mere bagatelle, but the doctor in the country, although subsidized by the State, has to charge big fees because his patients are not numerous.",74
416,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"My information is that T the Western Australian Act does not differentiate between residents in different parts of the country.  man wrote to me on 22nd AugustMy wife had to undergo a serious operation during 1921, and I applied to the Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation, at Perth, for a deduction for the amount of cost of operation and expenses attendant thereto, and in reply was told that medical expenses were not allowable deductions, and I think that as they are not "" expenses"" they ought to be "" deductions"" as in my case the amount was over £90. An expense of that kind is a big burden to a struggling settler. Not only has he to pay the medical bills, but he is inconvenienced by being deprived of the assistance of his help-mate. Then he is told that he must find the money somewhere, and the Taxation Department will not help him. I wrote to the Federal Commissioner on the subject; and this is the cold-blooded reply I receivedRe J. T. . . . Narrogin, WA. The Income Tax Assessment Act does not permit any deduction in respect of medical expenses incurred by a taxpayer in respect of himself or his family. The Royal Commission on Taxation has not made any recommendation for the allowance of such deductions.",74
417,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"In fairness, I must again point out that what the Commissioner states is what the law provides. It is not fair to describe the Commissioner's reply as "" cold-blooded.""  the Commissioner is doing his duty by administering the Act, he does not seem to have made any recommendation on this subject to the Royal Commission on Taxation. Yet this is one of the disabilities retarding the development of the country. Few women can be persuaded to go out-back, and those who do are in continuous dread of illness overtaking themselves or their children, when they are so distant from medical practitioners. In cases sueh as that I have mentioned, an allowance should be made, no matter what the cost. If the amendment now before the Committee is not carried, I shall propose a further amendment, to the effect that sums paid in respect of medical attendance, where the taxpayer resides not less than two miles from a medical practitioner, be included in the allowable deductions.

I wish on this clause to discuss the - advisability of getting a little more liberal treatment for the amateur sporting bodies throughout the Commonwealth who make no profit out of sport. Their income is spent in the development of the game or sport in which they are concerned, with out any profit to any one, and by virtue of voluntary assistance all round. The dictionary defines an "" athlete "" - as ' ' vigorous in body and mind.' ' "" At h 1 letic "" is defined as "" strong, vigorous, muscular,"" and Bacon, very many years ago, described athletics as the - art of activity . My personal knowledge in regard to this matter is confined to the New South Wales Cricket Association and its operations.

I believe that we are all somewhat sympathetic to the grand - old game of cricket.

I think that this amendment will introduce a principle that will be helpful to the country. No citizen can avoid employing a medicall practitioner when any member of his family is ill';* and in the country districts therei is special need for the de? duction of' expenses incurred in this way. The principle is. not new, for it has been 1 adopted in other countries. In, Western Australia medical men have been; subsidized, in order to induce them to reside amongst, the people in thebackblocks; but> even with the subsidy, they have to charge very heavy fees, because the distances are so, great. In , the caseto which I have already referred-,, a settler had to send his wife a long distancefor an. operation. The medical expenses amounted to. £ 9 0 , but the item, was regarded as a non-deductible one-. There was hardship enough in this' man having his wife ill and away from home, but when he was preventedfrom allowing that item, as a legitimate part of his. expenditure, it was enough to make the in dividual feel that he was not a citizen of his own country.",77

We shpuld certainly give encouragement to womenfolk to go into the back-blocks, and help their Marr, C. W. C. husbands to develop the country.

429,Mr CHARLTON,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Hunter ) [11.21] This clause deals with the general exemption. I never agreed to the exemption being fixed at £ 2 0 0 . I thought'at the time that it should be £250, and the purchasing power of money has decreased in the meantime to such an extent that 32s. would now be required to represent the purchasing power of £ 1 at the time when the exemption was fixed at £ 2 0 0 . There is justification for a much higher exemption than is now provided for. I am not going to ask the Committee to make it £ 3 0 0 , but it is fair that a married man should have an allowance for his wife. In Great Britain , the married man has an exemption of £ 1 5 0 for himself, £ 1 0 0 for his wife, £ 4 0 for the eldest child, if under sixteen years of age, and £ 3 6 for each of the remaining children. That means an exemption, in. the case of a man with a wife and three children, much higher than that provided in this Bill , even with the concession granted in the form of the children's allowance. I move That all the words after ""pounds"", line ti, - be left out, with a view to insert, in lieu thereof the words "" with a further deduction of One hundred pounds in the case of a married man."" That would leave single men with an exemption of £ 2 0 0 , and would give married men an extra allowance of £100 .",78
430,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Flinders-Treasurer ) [11.24] - I am afraid I cannot agree to that. I do not think I need go at very great length into the question of an exemption with respect to the wife. We have discussed at some length the general question of exemption, as well as the deductions to be made in respect of children and other dependants, so that thera is very littl e remaining to be said on the subject. W it h regard to the second part of the proposal, to abolish the provision which reduces the exemption by £ 1 for every £ 3 by which the taxpayer's in come exceeds the amount of the exemption, the Government cannot consider it ; if for no other reason, because of the loss of revenue it would involve. I have not the figures with me now, but my recollection is that to give every taxpayer an exemption of £200 would mean a loss of revenue of something like £1,500,000 per annum, which is a loss that we could not contemplate. - Question-That the amendment be agreed to-put .

It is apparently to catch a number of companies domiciled overseas which are thought to be evading their proper taxation in this country; in doing that it will h it certain honest persons.

433,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"The arrangement proposal I have in mind could be aptheir plied in two ways, one of which is adding after the words ""income tax some such words as these: ' ' As agent the parties resident outside Australia."" The effect of^that would be that instead of the Commissioner being able to tax at any figure he thinks propar, the ticular person doing business with the overseas company would be taxed as should agent, and he could pass on the taxation. If that is not done, it will be an impedithat ment to certain classes of"" businesses that are in. every sense desirable. way of overcoming the difficulty would be by adding a proviso to clause 28 someare what in this for m Provided this section shall not apply cases where commodities dealt in are charged by person's outside Australia at prices approxiagents mately the same at which persons in Australia carrying on similar businesses can purchase from residents from outside Australia the ijlass of commodities. There is a large jute trade direct with India growing up in Australia in which fanners, sugar-producers, and wool-pack users are interested, and it is done on a to the law where his principal is. very narrow margin. I think 1 per cent, we would be regarded as a heavy commission in the trade. Under this clause, if not amended, businesses may be regarded as ""fakes,"" and heavy taxation, equivathe lent to, perhaps, 5 per cent, on the turnceed over, might be imposed. This would mean stopping the trade, and would interrupt all the ordinary channels merely w i the desire to capture some other people who are evading taxation under present [138] . conditions. Although I am not moving Comi n the direction indicated, I am hopeful that now the Treasurer has had the matter brought under his notice he will be prepared to accept either of the two sugges- tions I have mentioned in order to effect intended a desired alteration.",79

435,Mr BBTJCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Flinders-Treasurer ) [11.37] - This is a difficult question to handle effectively. We all to know that there are alleged cases [Quorum where certain large interests, in order to avoid payment of taxation in Australia, or arrange the price at which they sell to representatives here in such a way by that whilst there is a substantial "" profit upon the transaction, none of the for profit is derived in Australia, and the companies are not called upon to contribute taxation. This provision was designed to defeat that object, and, as the parfight honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) has pointed out, this clause uot operate to the detriment of the legitimate trade. No one desires that should happen, but in trying to in sure that legitimate traders will not' be Another interfered with in any way. we have to be very careful not to exclude those who deliberately arranging their business in order to avoid their obligations. In regard to the first suggestion of the right in honourable member for Balaclava, that the here .should only be responsible for any sums they have in hand belonging to their principal and should have the same right of recourse against their principal, I may say that I do not think the matter can be dealt with in that way. There is no right we can give to an agent against his representative overseas; he must look If limit the obligation of the agent to .the amount that may be it is in his possession belonging - to his principal we are going to be faced with difficulty that the principal will proto arrange his financial business in exactly the same way as he has done in regard to his profits. That would also t h apply to the suggestion of the honourable member for Nepean (Mr Bowden). We must leave it to the representative here to make his own arrangements to insure that he is indemnified against any taxamissioner tion levied on his principal. The position is so serious, and the possibility of avoiding legitimate obligations so great, that - we. are justified in throwing the responsibility upon the representatives in tralia to make arrangements to safeguard to sit late? their interests. The other side of the « question has been dealt with in the amendment suggested, and it seems that the two relate to different phases. The second presents some difficulty cepted in the form submitted, because we would always have to establish that was not possible for other people chase goods of a similar character at approximately the' same price. That diffiwhich culty would be very serious and real, cause one of the principal companies the mind of honourable members. which it has been suggested, has so its arrangements as to avoid its obligameets tions in the matter of taxation is alleging and swears that the price it is charging to its representative here is the f.o.b. price at the port of shipment, and that the goods are readily purchasable by any one at that price. I have given some thought, this matter, and cannot see any remedy stage. except in the provision which allows discretion, and I would be prepared rarge it to the extent of allowing such matters to be referred to the Appeal Boaiid.",79

454,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"T h u t I am not prepared to say, but the responsibilities and area his activities mark him out for all sorts of criticism in the press, in Parliament, on the public platform, and elsewhere. I do not think that we should say to such a man that we consider that he has acted improperly or has been doing his duty held too rigidly. Officialdom frequently gets into that position. If a man has been a long while representing the Crown as against the public in the discharge administrative functions there is that in evitable tendency. In fact, an ingly strong and sympathetic man quired to take both the Crown view and the public view at the same moment. Mingled with such men as these there effect by the Treasurer. should be upon Appeal Boards men who arc out in the business world and know the instincts of the trading community and how the decisions of the Appeal Boards are likely to influence business adversely or favourably. If the Treasurer will tell us that men with commercial training will be appointed to Appeal Boards, I would give them almost any power, but if they are to be merely a congregation of officials who, unfortunately, have been denied the opportunity of commercial training and experience, the Boards will be correspondingly ineffective.",81
455,Mr BOWDEN,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,Nepean) [11.52] - I suggest that there should be some means by which the decisions of Appeal Boards are made known to the general public.,81
456,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,The Department should be in a position to publish such decisions regularly.,81
457,Mr BOWDEN,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"I think it should be A f t e r putting in months of work - on appeals the public outside have found of that a decision has already been given which , would have saved all that trouble.  - I agree with the contention of the right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr . Watt) that we should couple, with' officials on tliese Appeal Boards men with wide and varied business experience. Apparently, any remarks which I have made in regard to the Commissioner of Taxation were not properly understood by my right honourable friend. I haye said, and I say again, that the Commissioner has touch been vested by this Parliament with greatelr powers and greater discretion than have been intrusted to any other officer in the Commonwealth Service, and, of course, he may have had, owing to the of lack of elasticity of the law, to take an academic view-point, and perhaps confine himself within a. very narrow ambit with regard to large questions concerning taxpayers and the development of industry. But I think that that view also has been to some ""extent by the Treasurer (Mr . Bruce), because, shortly after he came into office, he found it necessary to appoint a Board of Appeal from the Comof missioner's decisions.",81
458,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"The appointment of the exceedBoard of Appeal was contemplated in. the is reBill passed in December last.  plated, but the provision was carried into It was recognised that the whole responsibilitj ot the administration of the Federal Income Tax Department should not be placed wholly and solely on the shoulders of the Commissioner, and that he should be helped by Boards of Appeal. I supplement the remarks of the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt) in this direction, and I hope that the appointments, if they are made, and when they are made, will comprise business brains commingled - wi,th Federal officials. If there are only officials on Boards they will develop steadily, as the years go by, more aud more "" red tape."" The questions involved are too big to be decided only by officials.",81
459,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Flinders-Treasurer ) [11.56] - On e Appeal Board has been constituted up to the present time. In the A ct passed last December power was taken for the establishment of a. Board or Boards of Appeal, and I think the suggestion was made that there should be a Board of Appeal for each State. When I came to consider this question it appeared to me by no means certain that ' these Boards would function as .we hoped, or* would f i v e .the results that we desired. The Government, accordingly, decided that the best course to> adopt would be to appoint one Board with th© very best personnel we could get, to give a trial to the system. The Board was constituted, I think, in A p r i l last. It consists Twine, who was the Assistant Commissioner under Mr Ewing, and Mr Cunning, who was a lawyer in Western Australia, but subsequently went upon the bench and was a magistrate dealing, at the time of his appointment to the Board, exclusively with income tax matters. made very careful inquiries with regard to Mr Canning, and I gob from the business community such very strong recommendations as to his capacity, and the way he was filling his office in Western Australia, that it appeared to me that he was the man for the position. When I found that the view of the commerical community was confirmed by my own officers in the Department, I had no hesitation in recommending his appointment. The third member of the Board is Mr Lightband, who was an accountant with a large practice in Brisbane. The - head-quarters of the Board are in Sydney, and while the head-quarters remain there it will be a travelling Board, and will go wherever its services are most urgently required.",82
460,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,Why should its headquarters be in Sydney when the central office of the Taxation Department is in Melbourne ?,82
461,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Because the greatest number of cases will probably have to be dealt with in Sydney. The matter was investigated very closely, and we came to the conclusion that the balance of convenience, and the minimum of expense, would be secured by having the headthese quarters in Sydney.  not fit in with the suggestionof the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) in that there are no business men on it .",82
462,Mr BRUCE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"I venture to say that this Board comes as near to the thing desired as possible. A business man, pure and simple, would be of very slight value on a Board of this character. The Board is constituted on the best basis possible. It includes a practising accountant, a lawyer, and a Government official. The average accountant knows more about business than the honourable member or his associates. Mr Lightband was an accountant in a big practice, and has a broader view and a greater knowledge than most business men. Clause agreed to. Clause* 42 agreed to.

We have just sanctioned appointments for a term of seven years for the first Appeal Board. We have I heard the names of the members for the first time to-night, and I think honourable members know little or nothing of their qualifications except what the Treasurer has told us.",82

I know something of Mr Twine; he appears to be an excellent officer. I think, however, that we should have more men of commercial training on the only Board which the Treasurer has appointed so far.",82

I would ask my honourable friend to suspend his judgment upon the Board u n t i l lie has made a few inquiries. Personally I was very satisfied that I had obtained such an efficient ancl promising Board. If the honourable gentleman will think of the difficulties surrounding the constitution of a Board of this character, he will realise how hard it is to get a Board with a strong and useful personnel. The expense of these Boards is very great. Each Board will cost from £10,000 to £12,000 a year. This Board has been established for some months, and it may have had a case referred to it in the last few weeks; but when I last met the members in New South Wales they had not had a single case referred to them.

467,Mr BELL,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Darwin) [12.4 a.m.] - I disagree with the suggestion that it use having more Boards u n t il the business looks up. Unless this Board of Appeal can be easily reached by those taxpayers whose tax is a comparatively small one, we will not be giving what I expected would be made available to them. We know very well that not only in regard to income tax, but in various other forms of taxation, especially in the States, quite large sums in the aggregate are gathered from people because it is not worth their while to take their case to appeal or before the Law Courts. If they appealed and won the case the appeal would probably cost them more than the benefit they would derive. that is no reason why these people should be compelled to pay a taxation which is not just. I know of numerous taxpayer* having been assessed at a rate above that which they considered to be fair, but an appeal was not worthwhile, because of the cost. I had hoped that by isystem of Appeal Boards dissatisfied taxpayers would be able to get redress at less expense than in the past. Obviously, if there is to be one Board only, taxpayers in various States will find that it is costly to reach that body, and probably that is the reason why [139] more appeals have not been lodged. I shall be dissatisfied if there is to be one Board only, because it will not be easily accessible to the many dissatisfied taxpayers in Tasmania. Clause agreed to. Clauses 44 to 46 agreed to.

468,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Balaclava) [12.7 a.m.] I suggest to the Treasurer thab this is too large an order to ask the Committee to pass. We have elicited, by inquiry at this late hour, the salaries paid to the present Board, and this clause governs the whole scheme by specially appropriating for the existing Board or any number of Boards considerable sums of money, the control of which will pass beyond the reach of Parliament. We are told thab the existing Board is to cost from £10,00 0 to £12,00 0 per annum, and we have just heard the honourable member for Darwin (Mr Bell) pleading is no eloquently for a Board for eaoh State, instead of one peripatetic Board. We may have half-a-dozen of these Boards, costing the country fro m £60,000 to £70,000 per annum, without Parliament knowing anything at all about the cost so long as the Governor General is prepared to sign the necessary papers on the advice of his Ministers. One never knows how the taxpayers will exercise new rights of this kind, or how the Board will invite appeals by its decisions and procedure.",83

470,Mr WATT,OODNADATTA TO ALICE,"Not necessarily; but for But the first time he is given certain rights of appeal to a Board. If there are to be a number of these Boards we are creating a very expensive machine. I never imagined for a moment that a single Board would cost from £10,000 to £12,000 per annum, and that there might be several such bodies.
