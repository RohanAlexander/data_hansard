1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"In reference to the resolution of the House of the 18th September, I have received, through the High Commissioner's Office in London, the following cablegram, dated the 28tfh September, 1918:Reference your telegram 20th September, Lady Reid conveys her deep, heartfelt appreciation resolution passed by Commonwealth Parliament. EXPORTATION OF LEATHER . Kalgoorlie,",21
2,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Is the statement in today's newspaper, that the exportation of a. quantity of leather equal to the quantity of hides exported is to be permitted, correct? If it is not correct, will the Acting Prime Minister again try to obtain some relief for-our tanning and leather industries? I am informed that over £1,200,000 worth of leather is at present being kept back in Australia.",21
3,Mr WATT,Unknown,"The Government is aware that leather to a considerable value is stored in Australia awaiting shipment, and, as I have informed the House on they several occasions, Ministers have endea- . Wallace? voured to arrange better conditions with the British Government for the exportaWallaceas tion of our leather. The statement which uniform, ' [243}-8 was published last night is correct, and although I am awaiting confirmation of the facts .through official channels, I was entitled, by reason of the advices I had received, to make it public. The new arrangement is due largely to the efforts of the Prime Minister in London. I hope to be in a position within the next forty-eight hours to give the tanning trade more definite information. Mr TunoR - The arrangement is half and half?",21
4,Mr WATT,Unknown,Yes . NA RAILWAYSTRIK E.,21
5,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Is the statement of the general secretary of the Federated Enginemeh and - Firemen's Union, whioh appears in the press today, as a message sent to the union representative on the railway, correct ? It is to the effect that the authorities are agreeable to allowing the grievances of the men to'be dealt with by the Arbitration Court upon the presentation of a new log, the award of the Court to be retrospective, and that a ticket for the union organizer is to be purchased on the understanding that a refund of the purchase money shall be applied for later I If the statement is correct, I ask the Minister for Works and Railways if it embodies the policy of the Government towards these rebellious men!",21
6,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The statement is absolutely incorrect.,21
7,Mr GREGORY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"As serious inconvenience is being caused to a large number of people by the stoppage ot the railway service between Port Augusta and will the Minister for Works and Railways' say when the service is likelv to be resumed? M i . GROOM - I am not in .a position . to make any definite announcement as to when the passenger service will be resumed, but the Railway Commissioner is endeavouring to bring about a resumption as soon as possible.

9,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"We are, of course, - very glad to see the honourable member West Sydney in uniform, but there was a proper way of asking that the Houso might express its appreciation of his .action in enlisting, and I think that .should have been followed. AUSTRALIAN COPPER.",22
10,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"What reply was made by the Prime Minister to the. cablegram of the Acting Prime Minister informing bim that it had been suggested in the House of Representatives that if the British authorities declined to arrange for the purchase of Australian copper yond the 31st December next, the Auscircumstances tralian producers might be allowed make contracts with the Allied countries 1",22
11,Mr WATT,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"As I intimated to the honourable member, I cabled to the Prime Minister, and yesterday got a reply to effect that he was still dealing with the subject, and hoped to succeed. It will time enough to consider whether we should seek to sell in the Allied free world when tion. it is known that Britain will not buy our copper on favourable terms. PRICE OF BUTTER. ..",22
12,Mr CORSER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I ask the Minister for Price Fixing if , in view of the excepa copy of it. tionally trying period of drought and consequent shrinkage of supplies generally, and the high mortality in dairy stock, and in view of the fact that, despite sent the price of butter having been reduced by the Commissioner from 168s. to 149s. 4d. per cwt, lucerne was sold yesterday in Brisbane for £14 per ton, he will Queensland producers to give evidence production, shrinkage of supplies, high mortality of dairy stock, and the cost of fodder, and will then review the present fixed prices?",22
13,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable memmade ber informed me of his intention, to ask this question. I am aware that in some parts of Queensland the dairying industry is not in a . very flourishing condition the present time, because of the causes which he has stated, but I gave an Edols? undertaking to the House at the beginning of last winter, that when ber the butter production of all the awards States was equal to the consumption, the price of butter to the consumer would 'be brought hack to 149s. 4d. peT for cwt. I am informed that Queensland is now producing a little more butter than she can actually consume, which necessitates, of course, the storing of the surplus it for export. The British Government has not stated definitely whether it intends to buy our butter this year, but at the beginning of the present week I arranged with the Treasurer for an advance to the butter factories against all butter going into cold store. That advance is now being drawn; and, in the circumstances, it does not 'seem possible to do what .the honourable gentleman suggests. However, I shall be very glad to look into the matter, and see if beany thing can be done in the extraordinary in which some of the dairyto ing districts find themselves.",22
14,Mr FINLAY SON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I desire to ask the Minister in charge of price-fixing the whether, in determining the new prices for butter, he took into account his prohe mise to retailers in Queensland that consideration would be given to their posiI f so, why is it that a different basis has been adopted in Victoria, South Australia and' Tasmania from that adopted in Queensland? ",22
15,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable mem- ber hasevidently received a telegram from a gentleman in Brisbane, who also sent me Mr FINI,AYSON - That is so ",22
16,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The gentleman who this telegram is labouring under a misapprehension. We have given exactly the same consideration to the people of Queensland as we have to those in the other States, and in the adjustment of allow prices have given the retailers in the re northern State an additional halfpenny. . ARBITRATIO N AWARDS.  by the Federal Arbitration Court have been found to be ultra vires, will the Government enforce the 'payment of the . grossly unjust fines imposed on certain at pastoralists, particularly MT . Wallace Hunter, Mrs Kelly, and the late Mr H .",22
17,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable memis hardly accurate in saying that the ' have been held to he ultra vires. The awards will stand, .ibut the provisions of the Act dealing with the enforcement of awards are affected by the"" recent High Court decision. If the honourable member will submit the details of the cases to which he has inferred, I will have them looked into, in order to see how they are affected iby the decision. COUNTRY POST OFFICES . _ Mr NICHOLLS - (B y leave)- I desire to make ;a statement in connection with the Postal Department. siderable amount of anxiety has been displayed in various country centres at a notification which has been received by officials in certain post-offices, to the effect that their offices will be handed over to the Home and Territories Department, and that they must find other suitable premises in which the postal business can be conducted. This is the circular which has ibeen sent aroundI have to inform you that it has been decided by Central Office, Melbourne, to hand over the property used as a post-office at - to the Home and Territories Department. This decision will mean that other arrangements will have to bo made for the conduct of postal duties. In the circumstances, it will be. open to you to provide suitable premises, and to continue to conduct postal duties therein, receiving, of course, the full allowance payable, with no deduction for rent, or, failing that, to arrange with some other person, who may be willing to provide the premises, and conduct the duties for the allowance justified. (2) No date is fixed for the transfer of the property, but as it is stated that such transfer will take place as soon as the postal business is transferred to other premises, I shall be glad if you will take immediate steps to secure other premises, or, failing that, if you will nominate some person already in possession of suitable premises, centrally situated, who would conduct the postal duties. There is a fair amount of revenue received each year in these post-offices, and from statements which I have received fro m the officials themselves it appears to me that it will be impossible' for them to provide other <premises. Therefore, I ask the Postmaster^General to relieve their feelings of anxiety by making a statement to the effect that the existing facilities will remain as they are. At one time. I held the belief that the Minister was not devoting the whole of his time to his Department. I had expelled that idea from my mind, but I have now reluctantly to state that I fear that a great amount of his time is wasted,-.because this morning I received a circular from the Postmaster General-at least, I do not know whether it can be called a circular; it is in the for m of a poem, which reads as follows:With compliments. THE ELIXIR OF LIFE. If you would good health secure, One pint of water, hot and pure, Absorb each morning when you rise, This tonic which disease defies, The stomach, kidneys, bladder, gall, This purifies and cleanses all. A con- Combustion drives foul gases out, Nature rejoices at their rout. Its cost is nil, its value great, Cast not aside, nor underrate. To fellow members, one and all, Neglect it not, 'tis nature's call. For years I've scarce known ache or pain, 'Twill help you to good health maintain. Your well-wisher, * WILLIAM WEBSTER, 3.10.18.",22
18,Mr GREGORY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Is this a personal explanation ? MT . SPEAKER - I asked the honourable member if he desired to make a personal explanation. He said that he desired leave of the House to make a statement, and as the House offered no objection to the honourable member, I allowed him to proceed. At the same time, I ask him to make a serious statement.",23
19,Mr NICHOLLS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I desire to know whether this ""William Webster is the gentleman who is associated with the Postal Department. If such be the case, I ask him to devote more of his energies to providing postal facilities in country towns. PRICE OF TIMBER .",23
20,Mr MACKAY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"H as the Minister in Charge of Price F i x in g considered the question of fixing prices for log and sawn timber? If so, will he make representations to the - State Governments in order to prevent a periodical increase in the royalties which are demanded from the timber getters?",23
21,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"As far as my memory serves me, nothing has been done regarding the fixing of the price of timber beyond declaring that timber is a necessary commodity, so that inquiries can be made as 'to the advisability of fixing prices. Lf it is found desirable to fix the price of timber, and steps are taken to that end, I shall be very glad to approach the Queensland Government through the usual channels, and ask them not to raise the royalties demanded from timber-getters. 'SPANISH INFLUENZA.",23
22,Mr CHARLTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"In view of the epidemic of what is known as Spanish influenza, which is raging in South Africa and elsewhere, nnd causing many deaths, will the Minister for Trade and Customs say what steps have been taken in order to prevent its introduction into Australia ?",24
23,Mr JENSEN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Dr Cumpston, the Director of Quarantine, is taking every precaution to see that this dreaded disease does not get into Australia. Passengers are duly examined on the arrival of every boat, and every care is taken by the Quarantine Department. WRECK: OF THE JOHN",24
24,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Has the Navy Department taken steps to ascertain the.whereabouts of Captain Chugg and his boat's crew, which left Maldon Island after the - wreck of the ship John Murray, in order to obtain succour for those who were left on the island ? Will the Minister endeavour to see if the crew of that boat are marooned on any of the islands of the Pacific?  WAR LOAN ADVERTISEMENTS.",24
25,Mr WATT,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"In accordance with promises made in the House, I desire to lay on the table a statement showing the cost of advertising the Sixth War Loan. NA DOCKING OF THECETHANA .",24
26,Mr FENTON,VESSELS BUILT OR BUILDI NG IN,"It has been publicly stated that the first of the fleet of wooden vessels for which the Commonwealth Government placed au order in the United States of America arrived here a few weeks ago, and that ever since then she has been in dock undergoing repairs that"" will involve an expenditure of some thousands of pounds. Will the Acting Minister for the Navy state whether or not this report is correct ? I should also be glad if he would inform the House as to the stage that has been reached in the construction of the remaining vessels of the fleet.  tesy of the honourable member in advising me that he intended to ask this question,. I am in a position to supply the information he seeks. The vessel to which he refers as having arrived in Sydney recently is the Cethana. She carried a cargo of 1,400 tons of newspaper, 550 tons of ship plates, ancl 600 tons of sawn timber. I was in Sydney at the time of her arrival, and saw the cargo of newspaper being delivered. It was perfectly dry. The vessel, I understand, was not leaking on her arrival, but it is the usual practice to have a wooden vessel re-caulked at the end of her first voyage. This is being done in the case of the Cethana. To-morrow she will proceed to bad a cargo of wheat, and, so far as I know, there is nothing seriously wrong with her. As to the other MURRAY. wooden vessels of the fleet for which an order was placed in the United States of America, the Gulburra was launched on the 17th March last, and is due in Sydney, with a full cargo, about the 12th instant. The Challamba was launched on the 4th July, was delivered on 1st October, and sailed on 2nd October from Seattle for San Francisco to load for Australia. The Coolcha was launched on 22nd July, and delivery is expected about the middle of this month. The Bellata was launched on 18th April, the official trial took place on 26th September, and delivery is expected at the end of this week. The Bundarra. was launched on 20th May last, and her boilers are now being installed. The Birriwa was launched on 27th June; the Berringa on 27th July; and the Bethanga on 1st September. It is expected that the Benowa and the Babinda will be launched about the middle of this month. At the AMERICA. moment no particulars are available regarding the three remaining vessels, the Balcatta, the Boobyalla, and the Boorika; but, although no definite information is to hand, it is understood that four of the "" B "" class, which were originally intended to be steamers, are being converted into motor ships, with Diesel engines. COAL FOR PORT AUGUSTA.",24
27,Mr GREGORY,VESSELS BUILT OR BUILDI NG IN,"Will the Acting Minister for the Navy state whether it is a fact that the steam-ship Yarra recently proceeded to Port Augusta with a cargo of coal, but was unable to discharge it upon arrival there, and had to return with the cargo to Adelaide?' If the report is true, will lie give the House some assurfore ance that the Government will control trade of Australia, and not allow any terference by an outside body?  anything about the matter, but shall mate inquiries, and inform the honourable member of the result tomorrow. DEPARTMENT OF THE NAYY. REPORT OF ROYAL COMMISSION.",24
28,Mr FOWLER,VESSELS BUILT OR BUILDI NG IN,"In view of the fact that printed copies of the report of the Royal Commission upon the Department returned on furlough ? of the Navy have apparently been in existence for some little time, will the ing Prime Minister state the reason for the delay in supplying them to honourable members ? Is it due, as rumoured, to the fact that the Government are adding the report some little camouflage of their own?",25
29,Mr WATT,VESSELS BUILT OR BUILDI NG IN,"If the honourable member had been in his place last week he would know that the report was laid on the table, together with the recommendations adopted by the Cabinet, so that the whole paper is the property of the House. I moved that it be printed, the House convision curred, aud the circulation of the report is a matter for the authorities of the House. NA ARBITRATIO N COURT.",25
30,Mr BLAKELEY,CONCILIATION AND,"I desire to ask the Acting Prime Minister whether his atteution has been drawn to a recent statement by Mr Justice Powers with reference to alternative methods of enforcing the awards of the Court. The first of these was to give the President of the Court an appointment for life, while the second was that this Parliament should give to the High Court the necessary powers, so that the enforcement of the awards of the ciliation and Arbitration Court could be effected through the President or Deputy President.",25
31,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND,"I have not seen the stateconsideration, ment of the learned Judge to which the - local industry? honourable member has referred, but am aware that these questions were raised beber fore the High Court when the determinaobtain tion to which he alluded last week was arrived at.

34,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,MONEY FOR ANZAC S ON,"In view of the fact that the report which the Public Works Committee presented last week to the House on the question of the proof homes for the operators at Lithgow was only a majority one, and that to give effect to it would involve not only a new principle, but an enormous expenditure, will the Acting Prime Minister give the House an opportunity to consider the report before the Government are committed to the proposed expenditure?",25
35,Mr WATT,MONEY FOR ANZAC S ON,"That is a question of which Ministers might have notice. I may say, however, that the Minister concerned has brought it under the notice of the Cabinet, which is now dealing with it. EGG POWDER: IMPORTATION. .",25

38,Mr HIGGS,MONEY FOR ANZAC S ON,"I desire to ask a question in regard to the practice of tlio Defence Department in stopping,the separation allowance and allotment moneys of dependants of soldiers who have got into trouble at the Pront through being absent without leave. What is the position now? I understand that the Prime Minister has undertaken that the Commonwealth Government will pay half the allotment money, or something of that kind. I should like to know whether the Government are going to abandon the policy they have followed in the past, and pay the dependants as if nothing had happened at the Pront?",26
39,Mr WATT,MONEY FOR ANZAC S ON,"There is a good deal of literature on the official files relating bhis matter. I am not able to give an answer offhand, and I shall be glad if the honourable member will give notice of the question, when I shall be prepared to give him a full reply.

43,Mr WATT,MONEY FOR ANZAC S ON,"I could not do that impromptu, but I dare say I could if I were given sufficient notice. I have had several conferences with the Postmaster General on this and other matters, mostly in dealing with the Estimates, and the conferences have not been altogether pleasant for me. I cannot give an answer to the question offhand, and I should like the question to be placed on the notice paper. FEDERAL MINISTER IN LONDON.",26

45,Mr WATT,MONEY FOR ANZAC S ON,"We have considered the question, and we are awaiting further advices from the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes)'. As to any Minister being marked for the position, there is no truth in the statement. CAP RIBBONS FOR BLUEJACKETS .",26

49,Mr FENTON,PREFERENCE TO RETURNED,"I should like to know, Mr Speaker, whether it would be possible to have the latest war news posted somewhere within the precincts of the House? If this suggestion were acted upon, it would confer a benefit on honourable members.",26
50,Mr SPEAKER,PREFERENCE TO RETURNED," If I remember rightly, the Acting Prime Minister was asked a question on this subject last week. I subsequently had a consultation with that honourable gentleman on the suba ject. At one time it was the pracBritice of the Prime Minister's Departthe ment to supply information of the kind, which was posted in the lobby; but, for some reason, which the Acting Prime Minister was not able to explain at the interview, that practice has not been followed since the resumption of the present session. However, I have arranged to have the war news posted up in the future as soon as it is available from the newspaper offices; indeed, I may say that at the present time war news is posted up within Parliament House.

55,Mr FINLAYSON,PREFERENCE TO RETURNED,"In view of the paragraph in the Ministerial statement that price-fixing having assumed such considerable proportions it is necessary to place the matter on a more satisfactory basis than a regulation under the War Precautions Act , and in view also of the reported statement by the Minister for Price-Fixing, confirmed by the Acting Prime Minister, that the Government had nob even considered the question of placing price-fixing on a permanent basis, will the Acting Prime Minister inform the House what is the policy of the Government in regard to this matter?",27
56,Mr WATT,PREFERENCE TO RETURNED,"If the honourable member will read the Ministerial statement to which he referred, he will see that the paragraph did not refer to the placing of price-fixation on a permanent basis, but dealt with the effective regulation of price-fixation during war time.

69,Mr WISE,PREFERENCE TO RETURNED,"iTh e question of securing some high-class Arab horses-whic h may have been captured from the Turks by our troops during the operations in Palestine-for the purpose of promoting the horse-breeding industry in this country has been under consideration for some time, and the consensus of expert opinion is to the effect that, so far as breeding for military purposes is concerned, no advantage would be. gained by the introduction - of Arab blood. Prom a commercial point of view, the difficulty in obtaining freights, even after the war, and the necessity for the most stringent quarantine regulations to avoid introducing diseases from which Australia is now free, must be borne in mind; however, in order that the matter be more fully considered, proposed to obtain the fullest possible information regarding the quality of the tribunal animals captured and estimate of the exstatus penditure which their export from Egypt specific to Australia would entail.

WATT ) read a first time. SECOND READIN G.",30
77,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister - and Treasurer) [3.53] -(B y lea/ve) I move That this Bill be now read a second time. The last war loan, which was the sixth, was from many points of view the only one that was a real success. That is to say, without endeavouring in any way to derogate from the efforts of those who endeavoured, and who did raise money required under previous war loans, the sixth was the only war loan that gave us sufficient money to meet our war obligations for the period to be covered. In that sense it was a successful loan. I think it was primarily successful bePAPERS. cause of three conditions. One was a wider system of publicity and organization, which was attempted in connection with it . The second condition was the special advance system which was arranged between the banks and the Treasury, and the third was the announcement that it was the last tax-free loan. The publicity and organization arrangements have been extended in connection with the present loan, and from that point of view the prospects of its success appear as favourable, or even more favourable, than those of the sixth war loan. The second condition, the special advance, is still operative, but will cover a less tended field than that to which it was first applied. The reason for this is there are many citizens who took advantage of the special advance system and hypothecated their earnings under that system for eighteen months. That field cannot be tilled twice to the same depth, and, therefore, to some extent the operation of the advance system in its application to the present loan will necessarily be limited. The third condition achieved its purpose in the judgment of the Treasurer and chief oflicers; that is to say, it caused a number of people who appreciated the immunity stock to hasten in to acquire it before the door closed. condition, having achieved its purpose, is no longer existent, and there is no similar kind of inducement to offer in connection with the present loan. Therefore, I say, the present loan is at a disadvantage, compared with its immediate predecessor, if not with all previous war loans. This disadvantage is so serious, in the opinion of those most competent to judge, that the raising, of the full £40,000,000 in connection with the Seventh ""War Loan now before the country is to some extent doubtful, and we cannot at this stage risk a failure in connection witli it . Any shortage, any natural failure of the loan to yield the £40,000,000 required, could, apart from the measure I have the honour to recommend, only be made good by leaning further upon the British Government, and they, in my judgment, have already been asked to do too much. The British Government have lent us in definite loans £47,500,000 since the war started. They have, in addition, paid £54,345,000 for the maintenance of our troops at the Front. We have repaid of that last amount only £16,000,000 to the 30th June last. So that we owe the Mother Country for war expenditure a net .£85,845,000, and the Commonwealth Government have decided that this total must not be allowed to increase. We, therefore, bring forward a proposal which, so far as this country is concerned, is novel, and to some minds may appear to be too drastic. It is a measure to provide for a form of compulsory subscription in connection with the present loan and all other loans that follow it . The main reason for suggesting compulsion is this: It is known to the Governex- ment that many persons who are able to lend have not paid any money into prethat vious loans, and are not likely to do so unless forced. Many others have not subscribed as much as they ought to have done, and the Government conclude that it is not a fair thing that the willing section of the people should be allowed to find all the money required in connection with this war, even if they were able to do so. I may say in passing that the chief financial institutions of the country know these facts even better than the Government do, and approve of the principle of this measure. Some honourable members and some That critics outside may say that it is time enough to introduce a Bill for compulsion of this kind when the failure of a war loan has shown compulsion to be necessary. But, in my judgment, failure would be not only depressing, but detrimental in many ways. Failure would damage, or vitally injure, our national credit, and that must at all costs be avoided during the continuance of the struggle in which we are engaged. It is important, also, to remember that when the war is over, a long time must elapse before our troops, then we hope triumphant victors, will return to us, and, to speak quite frankly, more loans will be necessary after the conclusion of the war, whenever that is reached.",30
78,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"Not more than we are raising at the present time, but merely more loans?",31
79,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"More loans will be necessary after the conclusion of the war. until our war obligation vanishes. It will then be superseded by a repatriation obligation, which will probably continue for some considerable time. I say quite plainly that it is fairer to the people to ask them to lend at this stage, and easier for them to say "" Yes "" while the war is in progress, than it would be when our hearts are filled with joy and our memories, perhaps, rather fitful. This,- in my judgment, is the proper time to get the people to face the obligation that confronts the Government of this Commonwealth. Becognising, therefore, the necessity for compulsion, the Government have given very .careful attention to the provisions of a New Zealand measure which was passed last year, and have decided to submit a Bill on somewhat similar lines. The chief provision of the Bill is to the effect that every (person may be compelled to subscribe to the present or to any futur e loans a sum equal in any given year to six times his yearly average in come tax paid during the previous three years. There are two classes of exemptions of those upon whom we may levy. One comprises soldiers who have been or are on active service in this war outside of Australia. They will not be included in respect of their incomes from personal exertion. They will be given the same exemption as has been given in the In come Tax A ct in that respect. Of course, if they have income from property they may have to subscribe. The other persons exempted are those whose taxable income is £25 0 or under. All above that amount will be potential contributors under this provision.",31
80,Mr FENTON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"The amount is £70 0 under the New Zealand Act, I think.",32
81,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,It was.,32
82,Sir ROBERT BEST,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,The Acting Prime Minister means that persons who have mot contributed to the war loan may be compelled to subscribe to the extent of six times the amount of their Federal income tax?,32
83,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"Yes , we can within the purview of this Bill the Federal income tax, not the State. In New Zealand the position is somewhat ferent, and in explaining these provisions I propose to give, by way of comparison, information relating to the New Zealand Act. In New Zealand the law provides that persons may be compelled to contridoes bute to Dominion war loans in any one year six times the amount of their income laud taxes. I do not consider that the tax should be included in Australia, cause it is not a tax in the ordinary sense, but a penalty that is inflicted upon large landholders. There are other differences between the means of taxpayers in New Zealand and those in Australia which need not labour here, and which I can explain at a later stage. There is a proviso attached to this dition to the effect that if two loans are floated in a given financial year, and person has either subscribed voluntarily, been compelled to subscribe, six times the amount of his inicome tax to the first war loan during that year, he shall not be compelled to subscribe to the second loan. The Bill is so framed that the Commissioner of Taxation may, df the amount desired fits it , levy in respect of each of two loans in any year, three times'the amount of a non-substeriber's income tax every six months, but the maximum sum which he can compel such a taxpayer to subscribe is fixed at six times the amount of the income tax for a given financial year. This provision, is pralctically the same as that which is contained in the New Zealand Act. The proposed law will operate only if voluntary subscriptions to any loan f all short of the amount that may be required, and then only to the extent of that shortage. In other words, only to the extent to which subscriptions f all short will enforcement be applied. L et me state a case by way of. illustration. The prospectus to any war loan will set out the amount that is required by the Government. In respect of the present or Seventh War Loan, that amount is £40,000,000. If the voluntary subscriptions to it , after the passing of this Bill , amount to £30,000,000, enforcement wil l apply only to the shortage of £10,000,000.",32
84,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,And will represent three times instead of six times the amount paid in income tax by any nonsubscriber.,32
85,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,That depends entirely only bring upon circumstances.,32
86,Mr FENTON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"Suppos e that a wife is a contributor to a war loan, and that her difhusband is the only money earner?",32
87,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"There are lots of puzzles about the Bill which I prefer not to discuss at the present time. The measure deals with taxpayers as individuals-it not deal with them in their joint capacity. I repeat that the provision it and contains under which compulsion may be land applied when voluntarism falls short of be the amount required, and to the extent to which it does fall short, is sdmilar in effect to the provision that is embodied in the New Zealand law. When voluntary subscriptions to a loan f all short of the I amount required, the. Commissioner of Taxation may be directed by the Treasurer to require subscriptions to make congood that shortage. Where the Commissioner has reason to believe that any pera son of the non-exempt class has not subor scribed according to his means, that officer mav call upon such, person to subscribe a certain amount within a specified time. This person may lodge an objection with the Commissioner stating fully the grounds of his objection. In considering that objection the Commissioner will be compelled to take into account any war loan securities previously bought by the objector in the market, or direct from the Commonwealth, and any war saving certificates he may have purchased from the Commonwealth. The Commissioner must, in deciding the objection, take into account these antecedent facts. There is beyond this an Appeal Board which is to consist of the secretary of the Treasury as chairman, the Commissioner of Taxation, and a third person who is to be appointed by the Governor General. This Board will hear appeals in manner prescribed, or directed, by the Bill, and will be empowered to exempt the appellant or amend the demand made upon him, or dismiss the appeal. But the Board's decision will be final. These appeals will be heard and determined in private, and secrecy is enjoined under a heavy fine. In regard to these two matters I desire* to point out. two vital differences between this Bill and the New Zealand Act. In New Zealand there can be no'objection lodged with the Commissioner, but a man, if not satisfied with the preliminary requirements of the Commissioner, may appeal to a Board of Appeal, and, if still not satisfied by the Board's decision, may take his case to the Supreme Court. This is a lengthy, cumbrous, and costly procedure. this Bill we propose to give to the taxpayer the right to appeal to the Commissioner, and to put upon that officer, after all the facts have been presented to him from the taxpayer's point of view, the responsibility of determining whether his requirements shall be enforced, amended, or withdrawn. The second appeal of the taxpayer will be to this Board of Appeal, of which the Commissioner of Taxation will be a member, and we propose to give its decision absolute finality without recourse to law.  in the different States?",32
88,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"My honourable friend will see that in the latter clauses of the Bill certain powers of delegation are provided, in respect of the preliminary hearing by the Commissioner. But the Appeal Board will be the central organization, although it will have power to peregrinate Australia if its duties so demand.",33
89,Sir ROBERT BEST,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,The Commissioner sitting on the Appeal Board will get his own decisions confirmed.,33
90,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,Like members of great judicial tribunals.,33
91,Sir ROBERT BEST,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,They only get them confirmed sometimes.,33
92,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"That result was obtained in the most recent decisions. It is, of course, arguable as to whether the officer against whose decision an appeal is made ought to be a member of the Appeal Court. That question I shall be prepared to discuss in Committee.",33
93,Mr FOWLER,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,Has the Commissioner any rule by which he selects his victims ?,33
94,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"I think that that interjection is a characteristically unfortunate one, and I do not think it is calculated to help the consideration of our war loan finance. The Government is seeking no victims, but it is seeking to place contributions to our war loans equitably on the shoulders of the community. The Commissioner of Taxation has shown himself to be worthy of trust, .and I am sure that he will continue to discharge his duties impartially.",33
95,Mr FOWLER,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"I used the word ""victims"" in quite an innocent sense, and I do not think that the Acting Prime Minister is fair to me. In Mr Watt - I do not wish to be unfair, but my honourable friend, like myself, jokes with difficulty.",33
96,Mr FOWLER,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"I was not joking, either.",33
97,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"Then I apologize to the honourable member for taking what was a serious expression as .a facetious remark. Regarding his interjection as a serious one, I say that it will be the duty of the Commissioner of Taxation, when he gets a direction from the Treasurer requiring him to provide a certain sum of money, to find that money, with the means at his disposal, in an equitable way. When that is not being done, appellants will be able to show that it is not, - either to him or to ' the Appeal Board, which will sit in judgment on his decision.",33
98,Mr FOWLER,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"That is all I want to know. Mr ""WATT - Now , there is a penalty - attaching to those upon whom compulsion falls. If any person is compelled to subscribe he must forfeit, by way of penalty, a sum equal to twice the average amount of his income tax, but there is a provision that the penalty mav be proportionately reduced if compulsory subscriptions to an amount of less than six times the average income tax is demanded. That is to say, a man may have subscribed to this or to the last war loan, and may consider he has done, sufficient. The Commissioner may think otherwise, and if eventually it is shown that the taxpayer has subscribed only a partial amount of the total required of him, the Commissioner may proportionately reduce the penalty imposed him. It is not proposed to inflict the same penalty on such a taxpayer as upon the man in respect of whom the full compulsory subscription is demanded. This penalty payment passes into revenue, and is recoverable in manner laid down in the Act for the recovery of income tax or income tax fines, for which the law has invented recoverable machinery.",33
99,Mr CHANTER,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,Will there be an opportunity of appeal ?,34
100,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,The penalty will pass automatically into revenue.,34
101,Sir ROBERT BEST,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"But a taxpayer will get notice, and if he complies will he be penalized ?",34
102,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"If compulsion is enforced against a taxpayer, the penalty will pass automatically into revenue. I want to show why this is necessary.",34
103,Mr BRENNAN,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,Don' t argue with the investors. Give somo attention to members on this side of the House.,34
104,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"The honourable member suggested when this Bill was introduced that I should give some attention to honourable gentlemen on this side, and now he appears to be objecting. This payment of the penalty will not relieve any person of his obligations to subscribe to the war loan. That is to say, he cannot buy his way out of it . The penalty is intended as an addition or enforced subscription, but when a man pays the penalty he gets no scrip for _ it , the penalty passing automatically into the maw of the Treasury as revenue.",34
105,Mr HIGGS,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"Presumin g that a citizen of the Commonwealth subscribed to previous war loans an amount equal to six times his annual income during the period of the war, would be be exempt from any penalty?",34
106,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"I have already explained that if a citizen gets a requirement notice from the Taxation Commissioner, and he feels that he has been unjustly treated because of his subscriptions to previous war loans, he could submit his objection to the Commissioner, and under the provisions of this Bill the Commissioner would be compelled to take into account the amount so subscribed to war loans.",34
107,Mr HIGGS,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"Can you ascertain those who merit the attention of the Commissioner without bothering those who have subscribed ? on Mr Watt - As we have not a register of those who hold stock or bonds, it may happen that as the result of the first requirement notice the Commissioner will be obliged to forego the imposition of penalties in 'some cases. The only way to obviate this would be to take a census of the holdings, but that would take a very great deal of time, and it would be costly and unsatisfactory.",34
108,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,Me n may have subscribed to previous loans and since transferred their scrip.,34
109,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"Yes ; and it is a question how we should treat men who have bought over the counter, and have since disposed of the scrip, as compared with those who have not bought over the counter, but have purchased fro m other subscribers. That problem caused me considerable anxiety, but I think the honourable gentleman will find that a perfectly f a ir and feasible arrangement is provided for in the Bill .",34
110,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"Can the Acting Prime Minister say if conscientious objectors-thos e who, on religious grounds, or for otlier ethical reasons, refuse to take any part in the maintenance of the warwill receive consideration?",34
111,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"There is no provision in the Bill to meet such cases, and I do not propose to insert any. I think that a man who lives in a community and enjoys the protection which it affords to all, should share in its burdens. There is a limit to which ethical considerations may give any man immunity in critical times like the present. I have not attempted to provide for a contingency of the kind mentioned by the honourable member.",34
112,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,1 merely wished to ascertain whether the Government had made provision for those persons.,35
113,Mr BRENNAN,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,You do not compel us to take this interest?,35
114,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"The honourable member, if he likes, can donate his interest payments to the Treasury, as one honourable member on his side of the House has already done.",35
115,Mr BRENNAN,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"Yes , I know that. It is unnecessary to explain that it was a member on this side of the House.",35
116,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"That remark is characteristically ungenerous of the honourable member, for I need not have made the admission, which I did quite frankly and freely, because I think the honourable gentleman to whom I refer was impelled by high patriotic motives, and I like to acknowledge that. Now, if I may, I will proceed on this extremely rocky road in explanation of the Bill . Some honourable-members may imagine that the enforcement of the penalty will fal l very heavily on taxpayers. My answer to that is, that to the extent that compulsion may deter voluntary contributions to the war loanand it may, and it will , in certain tions-w e have to make sure that compulsion will gather in enough money to carry on. That is to say, if we were to pass this Bill , as we have passed other similar measures, relying upon public spirited patriotism, we would probably go a good distance, so far, at all events, as the means of the patriotic section of the community would allow us; but when we bring down a proposition i o more equitably spread the obligation of these big commitments, undoubtedly there are some who, having laden themselves heavily in regard to previous loans, will now say that other people should shoulder portion of the burden in connection with this loan. To some extent, therefore, we may, by this measure, discourage a section of the community from voluntary contributions to the loan now before the country, and in order to deal fairly by all sections of the people we must make sure that we are going to get the money. For that reason, therefore, we feel justified in inflicting a penalty of a substantial nature, and to be pretty rigid in its enforcement. I want now to compare the proposed penalty with the system in operation under the New Zealand law. position differs substantially from the New Zealand practice. In the Dominion the authorities do not inflict any penalty for intend to revenue purposes, but write a man low_ priced stock; that is to say, if he is a conscript contributor he may get 3 per cent, stock. I have looked carefully into the proposal, and have come to the conclusion - and I am sure the House will agree with me-that it would be dangerous to write stock which would have no appreciable or ascertainable market value. If , when inviting subscriptions to a loan with an effective rate of 5£ per cent., which is the amount of the Seventh War Loan, we wrote a man 3 or 3£ per cent, stock, we would be-giving him something which he could not sell, or if he did sell, it would be at between two-thirds or three-quarters of the face value, and, moreover, it would sympathetically injure the other stocks on the market. If we compel a man to find money for war loans at a time when he has no mobile assets, and has to get special advances from the banks, we prefer to write him stock of the same value.",35
117,Mr BKENNAN,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,But be is going to wait until he is pushed into it .,35
118,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"That reminds me of the police iconstable who was asked by the direc- magistrate if he had had to use force in arresting a prisoner, and who replied, "" No, sir, I made him come voluntarily. """,35
119,Mr BKENNAN,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,That is just what you will be doing,35
120,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,I am hopeful that that will be the effect of it . Another question to which I direct special attention is that the - Bill applies to companies as well as to persons.,35
121,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,All companies?,35
122,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"I ask the honourable member kindly to read the Bill , and not to put questions.",35
123,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,I thought it might be like the war-time profits tax..,35
124,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,The honourable member does not think at all ; he just opens his mouth and says what he likes.,35
125,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,I do not open my mouth and let you do the thinking for me,35
126,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,It would be better done if the honourable member did.,35
127,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,I do not thin k so.,35
128,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"If any tragic mischance should ever put the honourable member on This pro- this side of the table, and should give him the responsibility of baving to explain a Bill, I think he will wish that honourable members would be more patient than he is. I desire to utter one warning, and to emphasize that a person without money in hand or in the bank will have to subscribe if he has means; that is, if he has income, or property that yields income. There will be no hardship, because the Government in the past loan, and in connection with this, have arranged for the banks to advance to a person who wishes to subscribe, or who may now have to do so, up to 90 per cent, of the amount required, and at low-priced money. That is to say, a man can walk into a bank today and get 4 per cent, money spread over eighteen months, and by that means may purchase a loan security equal to the best stock in the country, and which will yield him 5£ per cent, effective rate. Therefore, because a man has not the money, he is not exempt from this provision. If necessary, he will have to operate under the special advance system, and pay as required by the Taxation Commissioner. This situation is somewhat different from that which exists in New Zealand. So far as I have been able to learn garding the practice throughout the whole of the Dominions, our system is the most elastic and the best-governed of special advances among all those in vogue, and our people can have no cause to complain about their inability to subscribe, when we have arranged low-priced money to be advanced to them up to the extent nine-tenths of their requirements. In New Zealand they have not made arrangeand ments in the same way; but the banks are advancing-to contributors, voluntary or compulsory-o r were, up to the time the latest information to hand, at the same price as that at which the stock issued, that is, 5 per cent, stock, 5 per cent, advance. And, to the extent that the banks may have issued their special advances, the Government of New Zealand made this concession, namely, that those institutions could increase their notethat issue without adding to their gold reserve. abated. That was a wise safeguard, and was a provision much appreciated by the banks, although I am not aware that it has had to be taken advantage of. As to subscribers to previous loans, and with respect to those who have made purchases in the market-for which there is a special provision-persons must not Mr Watt. expect exemption merely upon those grounds. The fact that a man may have subscribed to the first, second, and third loans, and then may have pulled out, will not be sufficient. The citizen who does not now subscribe must be able to show the Commissioner that he has already subscribed according to his means when all the facts have been taken into consideration.",35
129,Mr HIGGS,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"That is, holding the stock or bonds?",36
130,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"As to that, there is a lot of argument which may be brought forward. A person must show the Taxation Commissioner that in this respect he has done his duty. In New Zealand no notice is taken of what a person may have done before, or of what he is holding. We are more liberal. Previous loans or market purchases are not taken into account in that Dominion. It is the present loan-whicheve r it may.be-upo n which the Commissioner bases his demands. We are operating this proposition for the first time, and desire to be distinctly careful, therefore, to see that those who have already loaded themselves shall have fair consideration as against rethe man who. has not done his share.",36
131,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"Tfie y can appeal to the Commissioner, I take it . There is nothing in the Bill to that effect.",36
132,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"They can do so. The Government hopes that no one will be misled into thinking he is required to subscribe only up to six times the amount of of his income tax. The principle of voluntary subscription is still to be continued, it is as important as ever that all good citizens should continue to recognise their duty, no matter what they preoi viously may have done-that is, if their means will allow. Por without their willwas ing help the most liberal subscriptions that this proposed law might evoke would not be sufficient to secure all the money required. If there were no further voluntarism, this measure of compulsion would not be sufficient. We desire, therefore, voluntarism should continue unAs I know full well from a study of the lists in connection with the past few loans, splendid patriotism has been displayed by many of the great institutions throughout Australia and by many of our citizens; large and small, wealthy and humble; and we appeal to the people to continue in the full knowledge that ih is their duty and that they are endeavouring to help their country through the final stages of this dreadful drama. This security is gilt-edged. The in terest returned is very liberal considering all the circumstances, and these facts should continue to stimulate contributions. The scheme presented in the Bill is fair and equitable. No injustice will be done to any citizen. It is easily practicable of operation, and the appeals will not take an undue length of time. If experience proves that the measures now to be taken require to be strengthened, there will fal l upon the Government the responsibility. of undertaking strengthening. The Government is determined that this community, which has diffused wealth, shall find the money necessary to meet the nation's obligations in this war. spirit I recommend the Bill-nove l as it is-to the couutry as an absolutely essential war measure. If we are not to fail in our obligations or lean more heavily upon our maternal"" parent-the most generous that any country ever had - w e should now do our duty. And if some of the citizens will not see, and will not do, that duty, the responsibility for initiating a proposal to compel them falls upon the Government, while the responsibilit y for concurrence in the action of the Government falls on the Parliament. And I am hopeful that Parliament will help the Government. Debate (on motion by Mr HIGGS ) adjourned.",36
133,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"(B y leave). I ask the Acting Prime Minister (Mr ""Watt) if he can publish to the country simultaneously with the publication of his speech a statement of what, in the opinion of the Government, is the exact obligation resting on individuals in connection with the War Loan. What amount, in its opinion, should each individual contribute? honourable friend spoke of the duty of in dividuals in the matter of contributing to the loan, and honourable members on both sides agree with what he said on the subject, but the members of the public will wish to know, when told the penalty for not contributing, what exactly is their obligation.",37
134,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"(B y leave). The press will doubtless prin t the essential visions of the Bill ; and if the citizens these, they will understand their duty. NEW STANDING OBDEB.

135,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"Y a r r a ) [4.32] - This Parliament has been in existence now for more than seventeen years, and the Standing Orders which govern its procedure have never yet been debated; they are only provisional Standing Orders. Now the Government propose a new standing order, to take from honourable members the opportunity of expressing their opinions. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr . Watt) says that this standing order is absolutely needed to enable the Government to transact its business. The proposal is the greatest instance of political hypocrisy in the history of this Parliament.  ""gag""?",38
136,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"On the 15th June last the Government secured the adjournment of both Houses until the 16th September, which gave Ministers a recess of nearly fourteen weeks. Now they say, "" An y honourable member who dares to criticise the Government's proposals will be gagged."" I shall answer the question of the honourable member for Calare. When the Deakin Government was in power, its Attorney-General, now Mr Justice Isaalcs, proposed sin amendment of the Trades Marks.Act to enable trade unions to register trade marks. This came to be known as the Union Label Act . The Leader of the Opposition was the late Sir George Reid, and in his absence the present Minister for the Navy (Mr . Joseph Cook) acted for him, and the party behind him "" stone-walled "" the measure from the Tuesday until about 12.50 on the following Sunday morning. During that period we had but one adjournment, after a sitting of about twenty-three hours, from 1.30 p.m. to 2.30 p.m. oh the same day, an interval shorter than the ordinary luncheon suspension of a sitting. Mr Justice Isaacs then proposed the standing order which limits debate. This standing order has been put into operation but a very few times.' The Assistant Minister for Defence (Mr Wise) prepared a table showing how often it was used by the Cook Government. Originally an honourable member could rise at any time in Committee and move "" That the Chairman do now leave the chair,"" and on that motion there could be an untrammelled discussion lasting for many hours. The closure, which I voted for, was proposed by the Deakin Government to prevent such a thing being done.",38
137,Mr JOWETT,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"The "" gag.""",38
138,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"I prefer to term it the closure; the honourable member may use what word he pleases"". Speaking from memory, I have only voted once for the application of the ""gag,"" and then the Postmaster-General (Mr Webster), the medical poet of the water waggon, walked out of the House rather than vote for it . Yet he is a member of the Ministry that has submitted the proposal now under discussion.",39
139,Mr ATKINSON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"If the honourable member looks at paragraph VII . of the proposed standing order, he will see that the "" gag "" is not to apply to proceedings in respect of which time has been allotted.",39
140,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"I am aware of that. What honourable members opposite say, in effect, is, "" We do not propose to scalp you; we are only cutting off your head.""",39
141,Mr ATKINSON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,The proposed standing order applies to the whole House.,39
142,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"It s real application is to the Opposition. Honourable members opposite will not use the closure when they have the proposed standing order to their hand. The words, "" The question shall be put forthwith,"" appear repeatedly throughout the proposed standing order. In paragraph I . it is provided that the question, "" That the Bill be considered an urgent Bill "" shall be put forthwith, no debate or amendment being allowed. The question, "" That the Estimates of Expenditure be considered of an urgent nature "" is to be put forthwith. In paragraph I . provision is made for the allotting of time for the discussion of a measure, but no period is specified. The length of time allotted to the consideration of a B i ll may be no greater than the ten. seiconds in which the boxer who has been knocked down may recover himself. A Minister may get up and declare that the Estimates of Expenditure are an urgent matter. I can understand that there are honourable members on both sides who may be anxious to discuss the administration of the Northern T e r r i tory, and there may be honourable members on the Ministerial side who are not satisfied that the Government are in earnest in the matter of economy. However, by getting the Minister to move that the Estimates of Expenditure shall be treated as an urgent matter, they will be able to provide themselves with an excuse to the people outside for not discussing the matter or offering criticism against the Government.",39
143,Mr MASSYGREENE,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"If the Government do say that the consideration of the Estimates is an urgent matter, and the House so declares it , what happens?",39
144,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,The Government will then decide what time shall be allowed for the debate on the Estimates. It may be ten seconds or the remainder of a sitting.,39
145,Mr ATKINSON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,They may allow a week for the discussion.,39
146,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,Possibl y they may do so; but it is quite likely that no honourable member of the Opposition will be seen by the Chair. There is nothing in the Standing Orders declaring that Mr . Speaker or the Chairman of Committees shall see honourable members on either side of the House.,39
147,Mr MASSYGREENE,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,It is the invariable practice for them to do so.,39
148,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"I do not say that the present Speaker or the present Chairman of Committees wonld not follow that practice; but, even if the motion before the House should be amended to provide that the Chair must see honourable members on either side alternately, honourable members sitting on the Government side could cross the chamber and sit on this side. I think I am Tight in saying that, with the exception of Ministers and the Leader of the Opposition, no honourable member is supposed to be known to the Chair as belonging to any party in the House. In the way I have suggested, discussion of any matter under consideration could be absolutely stifled. We have had this proposal from the Government on the first day of sitting after an adjournment of fourteen weeks. I am aware that Ministers desired the adjournment so that they could transact ordinary administrative business; the same reason has been advanced for the restriction of the sittings of the House to three days a week.",39
149,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,Minister s are working overtime on WanPrecautions Begu1 a. tions.,39
150,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"i l believe"" that the machine is well oiled at the present time, and that these regulations' are being turned out in the usual quantity.",39
151,Mr MASSYGREENE,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"When the honourable member' was Minister he turned out a good many. - Mr TUDOR - The honourable member has not heard me say that the War Precautions Act was unnecessary. I have said that it has been put to uses to which it was never intended to apply. Honourable members of the Opposition do not have the opportunity of obtaining the same publicity for their remarks that honourable members on the Ministerial side have, seeing that they absolutely control the press.",39
152,Mr GROOM,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,Does the honourable member suggest that we control the Labour press ?,40
153,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"If the Minister wants an idea as to the control which honourable members on the Ministerial side have over the Labour press, he has only to look at the names of the gentlemen who constituted the press delegation to Europe. Eleven of them represent the - Ministerial party and conscription, which has been turned down twice by the people of Australia. There is ouly one gentleman representing the Labour press, and, apparently, he was only selected because he happened to be in Great Britain .",40
154,Mr MASSYGREENE,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,What has this to do with the motion?,40
155,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"I am pointing out that outside we have no opportunity of placing our views before the people, and M in isters are now taking good care to see that inside, through the columns of the press, we will have no opportunity of doing so.",40
156,Mr ATKINSON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,The press has treated the honourable member as fair l y as any other honourable member has been treated.,40
157,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"Since I have become Leader of the Opposition I have obtained a greater"" amount of publicity than I got previously; but recently, when I made a statement that the Government had increased the land tax by 20 per cent, only, and the income tax by 30 per cent., while the increase placed upon children attending picture shows was 33 per cent., the papers omitted all reference to the tax upon the children. Honourable members opposite could not live five minutes without the support of the press. We on this side of the chamber have secured our seats in spite. of the opposition of the press. I have always been returned in the teeth of opposition from the daily newspapers. The honourable member for Parkes (Mr Bruce Smith), the honourable  honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr Groom), and I are the only honourable members at this moment in the House who were members of the first Commonwealth Parliament. The Standing Orders under which we are working have never been discussed by the House.",40
158,Mr GROOM,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"As a matter of fact, they are only provisional.",40
159,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"That is time. The only standing order which has been discussed was that which had for its purpose the introduction of the closure The only Standing Orders we have discussed are those relating to the closure, the prayer at the opening of the sittings of the House, and the time l i m it to speeches which was proposed by the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams).",40
160,Mr GROOM,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,The honourable member has not found that time l i m it too short ?,40
161,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"No ; but under this standing order, if the Government so desire, we shall be prevented from discussing any measure. There is to be no discussion of a Bill .",40
162,Mr MASSYGREENE,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,This new standing order does not so provide.,40
163,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"It does. It provides thatOn the reading of a message from the Governor General recommending an appropriation in connection with any Bill , - on the calling on of a motion for leave to introduce a Bill, or on the consideration of any resolution preliminary to the introduction of a Bill , or at any stage of a Bill , a member of the Government may declare that the Bill is an urgent Bill , and, on such declaration, th8 question, "" That the Bill be considered an urgent Bill "" shall be put forthwith, no debate or amendment being allowed. That quotation supports my statement.",40
164,Mr MASSYGREENE,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"It does not. The honourable member said, that under this standing order there could be no discussion of a Bill.",40
165,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,The Government might allow a five minutes' discussion upon a Bill.,40
166,Mr GROOM,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,There might be a discussion extending over six months.,40
167,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"Under this standing order it will be open to the Government to prevent any member of the Opposition from discussing a Bill . The Government will determine the time to be allotted to the discussion on anv stage of a Bill . I well remember the discussion which took place on a certain resolution submitted to this House, on which we eventually went to the country, and which was opposed, at every stage by the present Deputy Speaker. I can well understand what would be the attitude of even the supporters of the Government if they were told that only a few minutes were to be allowed for the discussion of an Electoral Bill , in which provision was made for postal voting, or for the publication in the press of unsigned articles dealing with electoral matters. Then again, this standing order makes no provision for any discussion on the Budget.",40
168,Mr GROOM,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,The honourable member is putting the position i u a misleading way.,41
169,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"The honourable gentleman will,- of course, say that I am putting the position in a misleading way from the point of view of the Government, but the fact remains that I am stating exactly what the proposed standing order provides.",41
170,Mr GROOM,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"This standing order will not limi t the discussion of any measure. Under it , it will be for the House itself to determine the time to be devoted to the consideration of any Bill declared to be urgent.",41
171,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"1 invite the honourable gentleman to explain in what respect I have misstated the position. aware that it will be for the House to determine the time to be allotted to the discussion of any measure, but if a M in ister proposed that a Bill should be regarded as urgent, we well know how the supporters of the Ministry would vote. We know how they voted on the bachelor tax, which the Government had not the backbone to put into operation. two of their supporters had the courage to vote with us in opposition to it .",41
172,Mr JOWETT,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"I once induced nine supporters of the Government to cross over with me, and we should have defeated the Government's proposal on that occasion but for the fact that seven members of the Opposition failed to put in an appearance.",41
173,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"I cannot recall the incident to which the honourable member refers, but I do know that the supporters of the Government will vote blindly for anything proposed by Ministers.",41
174,Mr LISTER,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,Jus t as supporters of a previous Government were in the habit of doing.,41
175,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"Not at all. I was a member of a Government, many of the supporters of which frequently voted against it . If at this moment the bells were to ring for a division, would honourable members on entering the chamber inquire what was the question before the Chair ? We know that they would simply ask how the Government were voting.",41
176,Mr GROOM,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,Is the honourable member referring to his own party ?,41
177,Mr GREENE,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,He is speaking from the depths of his own experience.,41
178,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"No , I am speaking of the Government party. Supporters of the Government, when the division bells ring, - file into the chamber and vote with the Ministry without even inquiring what is the question before the Chair. On Friday last, when the Opposition proposed that on every 1,000,000 lbs. of tobacco the manufacturers should pay £500, honourable members opposite voted against us and in the interests of the big manufacturers. Did those who came into the chamber when the bells were rung ask what the question really was ? No. They simply asked how the Ministry were voting, and lined up behind the^ Government.",41
179,Mr SAMPSON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"The honourable member is not justified in making statements of that kind, since he cannot know what was I am in the minds of honourable members.",41
180,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"I invite the honourable member, if he was present last Friday, to explain why he voted with the Government for-the big manufacturer as against the small man. Under this standing order there will be nothing to prevent Mr Speaker or the Chairman of Committees from calling on Only honourable members from only one side of - the House, so that the Opposition may not be afforded an opportunity to express any opinion whatever on a Bill that is declared to be urgent. Such treatment of the Opposition would only be in keeping with the attitude adopted towards us by the press, which now completely ignores us. Then, again, the records show that the discussion of the Budget and the Estimates usually occupies about three weeks; but this standing order makes no provision for the discussion of the Budget, and under it the debate on the Estimates itself may be closed down after one day's consideration. I think I am safe in saying that the Tariff of 1901-2 occupied the attention of the House for at least eight months, and that the Tariff of 1907-8, introduced by the late Sir William was before this Chamber for at least months. Under the third paragraph of this standing order, when a Customs or Excise Tariff resolution is being sidered, a member of the may at any time declare that the proposed - resolution is of an urgent nature, whereupon the question, that the considered of an urgent nature, will have to be put forthwith. No debate or amendment will be permissible, and if the tion is agreed to, a Minister will have posed. power to move a further motion ing the time which shall be allotted to any portion of the Tariff or to the Tariff as a whole. That absolutely shuts discussion. The Tariff contains 440 items, some of which contain from to foriy subdivisions. Under the ing of timber alone, no one could possibly say how long it would be necessary discuss the duties, and there are other ample, or any other proposal. items to which no time limit reasonably be applied. In VI. of the proposed new order, we are told that purpose of bringing to a conclusion any proceedings which are to be brought to a conclusion on the expiration of the time allotted under any motion passed under any of the preceding graphs,"" the Speaker or the Chairman shall, at the time appointed for the conbarrel,"" clusion of the proceedings, put forthwith the question on any amendment or motion already proposed from the Chair, and, the case of the consideration of any Bill in Committee, shall then put any clauses ""and any Government amendments new clauses and schedules, copies of which have 'been circulated by the vernment among members two hours at least before the expiration of the allotted time."" It will be noted by honourable members that only Government ments are to be considered-that amendments by any private member are to be dealt with, although that member may have devoted much time and conservice. sideration to the proposal before the House, and have had his amendments honourable printed and circulated. Paragraph provides that the closure adopted by the House on 23rd November shall not apply to any proceeding respect of which time has been allotted in pursuance of this proposed order. That, of course, we can under- - vice. Mr Tudor. stand, for the motion before us gives the Lyne, Government much greater power than is six given by the closure. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr W at t ) told us that this new power will have to 'be used with care, conor the Government itself would feel its Government effects.",41

185,Mr LISTEE,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,No more did I .,42
186,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,The honourable memher and myself must disagree on that point.,43
187,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS, This discussion is out of order.,43
188,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"There is no doubt about that; and tliere will be a great deal mdre out of order if this motion is carried, for we on this side will be prevented from voicing our opinions or moving any amendment, even though we have given notice. It would be very difficult to find a Bill that has not been amended by the Government at the suggestion of the Opposition; and Ave had an example of this only last Priday, when I was able to point out a danger and induce the Government to amend a provision in the Excise Bill . H a d the proposed new standing order - been in force then, no amendment would have been possible.",43
189,Mr GROOM,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"You are quite wrong; during the time allowed for debate, an honourable member may move any amendment he chooses.",43
190,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"In view of the paragraph I have read, only Government amendments may be considered",43
191,Mr GROOM,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"Prope r time will always be allowed; but, of course, if there is any abuse, the standing order operate.",43
192,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,Unde r paragraph VII . a member who may have given notice of a dozen amendments may find them all swept away.,43
193,Mr WEST,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"That , is the intention. Mr TUDOR,-Of course it is; and honourable members on the Government side will suffer along with members of the Opposition. I remember when the income tax amendment measure was before us at an earlier part of this session, the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) gave notice of quite a number of amendments; but under the proposed standing order such notice would be absolutely useless, for the Government will decide that at a certain hour on a certain day discussion shall cease, and the question be put. Such amendments will not be given a chance of discussion, or even be put from the Chair. We know the fate that usually awaits a Government who apply the gag. In 1909, when the Pisher Government were in power, a majority of members decided that they should not have an opportunity of placing their policy before .the people, and instead of the Leader of the Opposition moving the adjournment of the debate, or a motion of want of confidence, he moved the adjournment of the House. The members of the Government were prevented from discussing any question; on a sudden death motion the Government were put out of office. The Deakin-Cook Government followed, and they repeatedly used the gag for the prevention of discussion. What happened at the general election? When Ministers went on public platforms the public gagged them, and on pollingday the Government were swept out of '.office.  ""gagged"" the honourable member's party again.",43
194,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"We were beaten in this House by the casting vote of the Speaker, but when we next appealed to the electors on the double dissolution in 1914 they reversed their verdict. It is quite possible that soon ther.e will be another swing of the pendulum/'and the honourable member for Calare may not then be so smug and satisfied. Honourable members opposite think that they have no reason to criticise the actions of the Government, or if they will should have, that opportunity will be afforded for them to do so, but that they will be able to prevent any honourable member on this side having his say, and that they will be able to curtail the discussion of awkward questions or prevent the putting from the Chair of any proposition that will place them in an embarrassing position. In this policy of suppression they will be backed up by the press, but if any difficulty should arise with the press they can call in the Censor to prevent the publication of anything that may prove damaging or dangerous to the Government. This is but another weapon forged by the Government for the limitation of free speech in this Parliament. Not only do they censor members' speeches and tamper with their correspondence, but they propose to carry a motion that will seriously curtail the privileges of honourable members. I shall vote against the motion.",43
195,Mr CHARLTON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"Hunter ) [ 5 . 1 5 ] - I do not think that the Government will gain anything by the passing of this motion. I realise that perhaps there are times when a good deal of unnecessary talk is indulged in , and that very often there is reiteration hy speakers, but whilst that may be so, I do not think it justifies the Government in bringing down a proposal of this kind. What does the motion mean? No matter how important the business may be, on any member of the Government declaring that it is urgent a motion to that effect is to be put forthwith. When the matter has been declared by the vote of the House to be urgent a further motion is to be moved fixing a time l i m it for the discussion of the question. That motion may be debated for not more than one hour, and no speech may exceed ten minutes in duration.. That means that there may be three speeches from each side on the very important question of deciding what time shall be available for the discussion of the particular motion or Bill . Very often when legislation is presented to the Chamber it appears that the last word has been said in regard to the form which the proposal should take; it is only after hearing the opinions of honourable members that the House realizes the necessity for alteration. The same thing will occur in regard to motions for the fixation of a time limit . Perhaps three honourable members giving reasons why the debate should not be limited will not be able to convey the thoughts of all honourable members. One honourable member, who does not succeed in getting a call during the hour of discussion, might have very sound arguments to put forward as to why the debate on that matter should not be unduly curtailed, but because the House does not get the benefit of his opinion, it comes to the conclusion that the measure is of such little importance that it can be dealt with in a very limited time. That may lead us into a very difficult position. I do not say that it is not necessary to curtail debate as far as possible for the sake of the more expeditious despatch of business, but we should hot do it in such a way as to run the risk of legislation leaving the House with blemishes. are many stages of a Bill, but under this proposed alteration of the Standing Orders the whole measure may be dealt with in a fixed time. My experienlce of Parliament has been that usually very business is done in the first two or three months of a session, but that towards its close many of the most important sures are on the business-paper to be dealt with. By that Mr Charlton. honourable members have made up their minds to complete the session's work by a certain date. The result is that, perhaps within a fortnight of the proposed date of adjournment, ^tliere are still to be dealt with half-a-dozen measures, the discussion of which should occupy the House for weeks. But under these amended Standing Orders the Government will take action to get the businesssheet cleared, and only a limited time will be allowed to each measure; none of them will be properly discussed, and we shall not produce healthy legislation. In stead of representing the combined wisdom of this Chamber, it will go for th representative, perhaps, of the wisdom only of the officer who drafted it . Wben the introduction of a Bill is contemplated, a Minister states his views to an officer, with instructions that those views shall be translated into Bill form. I admit that the officers are capable men, but no matter how great his ability, or how much he may consult with the Minister, a draftsman cannot get by conversation with a Minister the whole facts that are necessary to be understood if the legislation is to be effective.' A Minister may have certain views, and put those views before the officer, and the officer may d r a f t a Bill to the satisfaction of the Minister. It is sometimes only after debate in the House that the Minister himself can see the defects in his own measure. No man can expect to draft a measure in such a way as to give complete satisfaction. We are here to discuss every measure presented, in order to secure that it shall be passed in such a manner that its administration will be satisfactory to the country. If this motion is passed, we may be given no opportunity to do the work for which we are here. W h at is our position at the present moment? We have been here for a month, and what have we done ? We have done very little, and the business we have assembled to do still lies ahead of us. If this motion is carried it is quite possible we shall be given no sufficient opportunity to discuss There the real business of the country. There is no reason why we should not endeavour, by some procedure differing from this, to prevent unnecessary discuslittle sion: We have so many Supply Bills in troduced to cover short periods that their consideration takes up much, of the time mea- of Parliament, and leaves insufficient time and for the discussion of what may be more time important matters. I do not know what the Government propose to do in connection with the next Supply Bill , which must be almost immediately introduced in order that the salaries of public servants may be paid on the 14th of this month. It may be decided that, as the measure must go to the Senate, its consideration is urgent, and if this motion be carried a Supply Bill may be introduced tomorrow afternoon. The Government would then make it an urgent matter, and propose that only one hour should be allowed for its consideration, although in passing it we may be voting awav £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 of public money. Honourable members may have in mind certain grievances which they believe should be discussed, and to remedy which might in volve some amendment of the Supply Bill , especially at a time like the present, when there should be a desire for economy. They will have no opportunity to ventilate their grievances if the consideration of the Bill is confined to one hour - The Government, by their motion dealing with the matter, may not l i m it the time of a speaker in dealing with the Bill , and if the full half-hour allowed a speaker in Committee were taken by two speakers, they would be the only honourable members who could speak on the Bill if only one hour was fixed for its consideration. I ask honourable members to remember that that is quite possible if this motion be carried. I ask honourable members, also, to sider that the carrying of the motion may get the Government no further in the House direction in which they desire to go. tain Members of the Opposition, resentineif procedure of this kind, may force divisions Upon every item and at every stage, and tion. if they do, how long do honourable members think it will take to get a Supply Bill through under those conditions? honourable members believe that the proour cedure adopted by the Government will prevent them from discussing matters which they regard as vital, and connected with the expenditure of public money, the result will be that the business of House will be held u,p and bad feeling will be created through their relying upon the Standing Orders, and calling for division after division.",43
196,Mr NICHOLLS,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,The Government will regulate the divisions.,45
197,Mr CHARLTON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"The v cannot regulate the rights of honourable members under the Standing Orders. We do they not, I am sure, desire that that sort of thing should happen in this Chamber. Honourable members may take up the same attitude i u regard to any Bill , and the result may be that, instead of securing despatch in legislation, the adoption of this motion may merely create bad feeling amongst honourable members. Every form of obstruction! may be adopted in order that honourable members may show their resentment of this kind of procedure. Let me take, for instance, the Electoral Bill , with which we shall shortly be called upon to deal. That is not a party measure, and, in my opinion, should not be so regarded. But there is a number of matters connected with electoral reform which are deserving of a good deal of discussion. Honourable members on both sides may desire to express their views on, for instance, the postal vote. Several honourable members may desire to move amendments. They can only hope to secure support for their amendments by argument. They must make out a case to convince their fellow members of the necessity for the amendments they suggest. But how are they to do this if the Electoral Bill is treated, under this motion, as an urgent matter? A. fixed time will be given within which to dispose of the Bill . If the time fixed were two hours, or even one sitting, honourable members could not possibly discuss conthat measure as it deserves to be dealt with. There is scarcely a member of this who will not desire to criticise cerprovisions of the Electoral Bill ; but this motion be agreed to, there may be no sufficient time allowed for its consideraWhilst I agree that it is necessary to If prevent waste of time in connection with legislation, and admit that, under existing conditions, there is some waste of time, there should be some other means to provide against it . We might adopt some procedure which would render the this introduction of so many Supply Bills unnecessary. The question is oue which should be submitted to the Standing Orders Committee'. That Committee should be called upon to remodel the Standing Orders in such a way as to curtail all unnecessary debate; but it is quite wrong for the Government to propose, as do by this motion, to take away the rights of honourable members who have been sent bere by their constituents to voice their views in regard to important matters that materially affect the welfare of the country. It is easy to see where this motion will lead us if it is agreed to. I quite realise the view taken by honourable members opposite. They are anxious to get the business of the Government through, and that we shall sit here as short a time as possible.",45
198,Mr WEST,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,They would not sit here at all if they could help it .,46
199,Mr CHARLTON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"There might be something in that. In order to achieve their object, they submit this motion, under which the discussion upon any matter before the House may be confined to whatever time they please. I venture to say that honourable members opposite supporting this proposal will very shortly discover the mistake 1;hey are making. I do not mean to suggest a change of sides, but there may be some measure introduced by the Government which they may desire to amend in Committee. It is the proper function of a member of Parliament to endeavour to secure what he believes to be an improvement of a Bill when it is under consideration in Committee. That is the purpose for which we are here, and if we are prevented from carrying out that function, it is of no use for us to be here at all. When honourable members opposite find some provision in a Bill which they regard as unsatisfactory, they will require time to debate it. But, under this motion, the time fixed for the consideration of a measure may give them no opportunity to debate it . What will honourable members say to their constituents when they are asked, "" Why did you allow so-and-so to be done? Its effects are disastrous to us."" Would it be a sufficient justification for an honourable member to say, "" I could not say a word - I saw the blemish in the Bill, and the need for its amendment, but my party decided that there should be only a certain time allowed for its discussion. Only two or three speakers were given an Opportunity to speak, and none of them noticed the. provision to which you object. I noticed it, but I could not speak upon it. I was obliged to support the application of the closure to members of my own party."" That, I contend, will place honourable members in a very invidious position. There are many occasions upon which an honourable member finds himself diametrically opposed to the Government of which he is a supporter. In such circumstances he naturally desires to voice his opinions with a view to removing objectionable features from the proposal that is immediately before him. But under this motion he will be prevented from doing that. I am satisfied that its effect will not be to expedite the transaction of public business. In connection with the consideration of the Estimates, we all recognise that we have fallen into a practice which is far from satisfactory. Their consideration is usually postponed until the fag-end of the session, when the bulk of the money to which they relate has been expended. The statement which appears in the Age newspaper today to the effect that, in dealing - with our Estimates, we have drifted into a very slip-shod method, is quite true. But under this motion it would be possible for - the Government to bring forward the Estimates next week, for the House by a vote of twenty-four honourable members to decide that their consideration is an urgent matter and for it to fix a time-limit for their discussion. Suppose that the period allowed for their consideration be limited to, say, one sitting, will anybody contend that they can be adequately discussed? If this proposal be adopted, probably during the present Parliament, we shall see the Estimates disposed of in the course of a single sitting. Yet this is presumed to be a deliberative assembly.",46
200,Mr MAXWELL,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,Does the honourable member think that the practice for which the motion provides will be applied to the Estimates ?,46
201,Mr CHARLTON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"I do. I may tell the honourable member, who is comparatively a new member, that my experience in both the New South Wales Parliament and this Parliament, is that the consideration of the Estimates usually forms practically the last business of the session. Then we sit up all night to rush them through. In order to avoid all-night sittings, it will only be necessary to declare that the consideration of the Estimates is urgent, and to fix a period within which they must be disposed of.",46
202,Mr BRUCE SMITH,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,Has the honourable member considered how little difference tliere is between the procedure which is now proposed and the present procedure in the House of Commons?,46
203,Mr CHARLTON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,I have not.,47
204,Mr BRUCE SMITH,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,And there is noto determine. thing to cavil at in the procedure of House of Commons.,47
205,Mr CHARLTON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"I heard what the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) said in regard to that matter, and I am under the impression that he obtained the outin line of this proposal from the practice ber of the House of Commons. But in this country I venture to say that the procedure contemplated will work out in the way I have indicated. Let me further instance what may which happen under this motion in connection with Customs and Excise matters. Honorposaldrastic able members know that when a Tariff is before them they, usually receive very sound advice in regard to various duties that are proposed from outside persons who are interested in such matters.",47
206,Mr FENTON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,And who are experts in their own lines.,47
207,Mr CHARLTON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"Yes . Por example, many persons gave me very sound inthere formation in regard to the duties that were proposed to be levied upon timber. They were not personally interested in those duties, and the information which they imparted was of great assistance the timber trade. But if honourable members are denied an opportunity of discusapplied sing such a question, of what value will be the information which they gather? plied? How can we establish industries in Australia if we do not pay attention to our Tariff? - When the Minister for Trade closure has been. and Customs lays a Tariff upon the table, it necessarily contains many proposals which are not of a satisfactory character.",47
208,Mr FENTON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,Especiall y is that so the case of the present Government.,47
209,Mr CHARLTON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"It is the case no matter what Government may be in closure, power. I do not believe the passing of this motion will be in the interests of legislation. I am of opinion that we get hasty legislation. I do not say that we have not had that sort of legislation in the past. I do not suggest that our present procedure is satisfactory. I have sometimes heard time occupied in this voted to any debate? chamber by speeches which were entirely beside the mark. I admit that that sort of thing should be prevented.",47
210,Mr MAXWELL,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,How are we going to prevent it?,47
211,Mr CHARLTON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"That is a matter for the Standing Orders Committee I do not desire to the take away the privilege of any honourable member; - 'but I believe that we have too many .Supply Bills submitted for our consideration. Every one of those (measures occupies several days discussion, and I think that their nummight the curtailed without in any way interfering with the business which should legitimately occupy our attention. Lt. Colonel ABBOTT - Does not the J honourable member think that the closure was passed in 1905, with the assistance of the Labour party, is really more in operation than will be the proto which he is now objecting?",47
212,Mr OHARLTON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"The closure may still be put into operation if that course is deemed desiraible. But, as a matter of fact, it has been used only in exceptional cases. Suppose that I were guilty of deliberately wasting the time of the House, and, as a result, an honourable member moved the application of the closure, would 'be justification for his action. But under this motion every honourable member will be prevented from speaking.",47
213,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,The application of the closure prevents every honorto able member from speaking.,47
214,Mr CHARLTON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,The closure is only to a particular individual.,47
215,Mr WISE,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,How often has it been ap,47
216,Mr CHARLTON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,Not very often.,47
217,Mr WISE,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,But the straight-out,47
218,Mr OHARLTON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"Whatever ' may be said about the closure, I admit that its application has sometimes served a good in purpose, while at other times it has not been used wisely. But the proposal we are now considering is worse than the because wheu once a time limit has been fixed for the discussion of any good measure, honourable members will be deshall barred from further debating it. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - Does not the closure cut an honourable member off short, whereas, under this proposal, he vvill know exactly what time is to be de",47
219,Mr OHARLTON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"Whil e it is true that the closure will cut short the utterances of any honourable member, it is equally true that, under this niotion, if two hours he allotted for the discussion of any subject, and half-an-hour be allowed to each speaker, only four honourable members 'will be able to take part in the debate. Yet there may be ten honourable members desirous of participating in it, all of whom may have something to say which may be worth being heard. The Speaker calls one honourable member here and an honourable member there, and the time allotted for the consideration of a measure is exhausted before other honourable members have had an opportunity of speaking. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - But if each honourable member could speak for ten minutes he might be able to present his views in tabloid form.",47
220,Mr CHARLTON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"There is no provision that each member should be allowed ten minutes for the' discussion of any particular matter. It is proposed that the House should fix the time for the consideration of a particular question. In - this way the Government could fix any time they liked. We cannot escape from that position. Surely we can devise some other means of curtailing discussion without interfering with the rights of honourable members. Parliament will be up by the middle of December, and as we shall not come to the discussion of really important legislation inside of a couple of weeks there will be only four or five weeks available for its consideration. The adoption of this motion will practically mean ill-considered legislation which, when put into effect, will be found to be defective, and open to just criticism from the people who sent us here. Quite recently, and without this proposed time limit in operation, we passed certain legislation which was not put into operation, because it was defective. Several honourable members on this side of the House pointed out the position at the time, but our advice was not accepted. If this motion is adopted, and if the Government desire to pass certain legislation, that will be necessary will be to declare it urgent and fix a time for its discussion. After all, this decision will rest with the Government.  Government.",48
221,Mr CHARLTON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"We might as well be quite frank. We all know that if the Government decide that legislation is urgent, they will take action, and having done so, their supporters will be behind them. There is no doubt about that. This is party government.",48
222,Mr MAXWELL,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"But how are you going to suppress members who talk a lot, but have little to say?",48
223,Mr CHARLTON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"I admit there may be a good deal to be said from that point of view, but I do not think this will be the most successful way of dealing with the trouble. The whole question might have been submitted to the Standing Orders Committee for some alteration of procedure without curtailing honourable members' rights. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - But do you not think it preferable to have speeches in tabloid form rather than lengthy, diluted stuff?",48
224,Mr CHARLTON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"I admit that if an honourable member can condense his thoughts it is probable his speech will be more effective than that of a member who talks at greater length, and probably reiterates a great deal. I admit all that, but I do not think the proposed course will be the best remedy. In the future, if this motion is carried, a man may desire to put his position very clearly before the House, but unless he catches the Speaker's eye, before the expiration of the allotted time, he will not have an opportunity, because the Speaker, or the Chairman of Committees, if the House is in Committee, must put the question. The Minister himself (Mr Wise) has on several occasions been instrumental in securing beneficial amendments to Bills under consideration, and many other honourable members have done the same. In . future many of these opportunities will not be available to honourable members, and I maintain that to limit the time allotted for the discussion of measures will not give 'the best results in legislation, because certain honourable members who at present give a great deal all of attention to the Bills as they come before the House with the object of improving them will be discouraged if they cannot get a reasonable opportunity of stating their views. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - Then they can give an intelligent vote.",48
225,Mr CHARLTON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"Yes , they may satisfy themselves, but they will not have had a chance of expressing their views in order to enlighten, other honourable members. Speaking for myself, I am always open to conviction. If an honourable member can satisfactorily explain to me why a certain course of action'should be taken in regard to a Bill , I am always prepared to support him . That is what we are here i o r . But how will this be possible in the future under the operation of a time l i m it for the consideration of a Bill or a particular clause in a measure?",48
226,Sir ROBERT BEST,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,What does the honourable member suggest?,49
227,Mr CHARLTON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,I confess that offhand I cannot suggest anything other thanthat the matter should have been referred to the Standing Orders Committee for careful consideration to see if they can suggest an improved procedure for Parliament without unduly curtailing the rights of honourable members. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - How the 640 members in the House of Commons get an opportunity of speaking ?,49
228,Mr CHARLTON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"I admit that not very many do get a chance. not follow that we should adopt the same procedure. The experience of members of the House of Commons only illustrates the force of my argument. Many members of the Imperial Parliament, because of the lack of opportunity to speak, take very little interest in the proceedings of the House of Commons. them never bother about Parliament at all. They hold their seat, and that is the end of it . They do not devote their talents to the work of the Parliament. And that wil l be the experience here if we carry this motion. I know that many members on both sides of this House give careful attention to matters that come up for discussion, and that usually they are desirous of putting their views before this Chamber for the edification of other honourable members, and in order to remedy what they consider to be defects in our legislation.  they talk, nevertheless.",49
229,Mr CHARLTON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,There may be something in that.,49
230,Mr MAXWELL,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"If the operation of the motion were limited to the duration of the war, would the honourable member then support it ?",49
231,Mr CHARLTON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"I do not think that would affect the matter at all. It would be far better to devise some other means to improve the procedure of Parliament, and to obviate waste of time; but I do not think this motion will have that effect. It will , however, lay us open to the charge that we are passing ill-considered legislation. Though honourable members may have sound views to express, many of them in future will be denied the chance of doing so in Committee, and it is in the Committee that the real work of Parliament is done, and where the details of measures are considered in order to make them acceptable to the administration of the future. This cannot be done if , by means of this motion, we close members' mouths. As far as I am concerned, I am opposed to the motion,- and I think the House would be well advised not to pass it . The Ministry would do well to take into serious"" consideration the adoption of some other means for an improvement in the promany of cedure of the House. However anxious we may be to curtail discussion and to get legislation through, we should be more anxious to see that our legislation when But it does passed is complete and satisfactory in every respect. The effect of this motion will be to cause dissatisfaction as far as the work of Parliament is concerned.",49
232,Mr LAIRD SMITH,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"Denison) [5.50]. - I have listened with great pleasure to the speech of the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton), and could not help contrasting it in its temperateness Hundreds of with that of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor). We find the one honourable member giving us. much food for thought, which will cause us to go into the matter now before us most earnestly; while the other honourable gentleman merely utters a tirade of abuse towards honourable members on this side of the chamber who have dared to think and speak their opinions when they have differed from those of the Leader of the Opposition. The honourable member for Hunter called attention to the position^ arising in connection with the Budget, and, with respect to some of those who listened to him, Mr Charlton was able to make a very strong point. He pointed out that the Budget is brought down at the close of a session, and is simply rushed through. Why is that done? It is because no Government can get a measure through without bringing about a continuous sitting.",49
233,Mr WEST,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,We know all about that.,49
234,Mr LAIRD SMITH,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"That is so. The honourable member on one occasion sat side by side with me for fifty-two hours because the Pisher Government came to an understanding that the closure would not be applied; but it was applied to us. Let a member attempt, after having been in Caucus, to come into this chamber and express his opinions.",49
235,Mr MCGRATH,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"We l l , what about it?",50
236,Mr LAIRD SMITH,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"I ask the honourable member what he would get. The Whip would come along and say, in effect, "" You get up, and see what you will get."" Talk about freedom! What freedom had we after the Government had agreed to bring down a certain measure, and to pass it? We had to sit behind the Government, and vote behind the Government, or we would have had a - wire or some other notification sent to our league.",50
237,Mr MCGRATH,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,And you were a strong supporter of the procedure.,50
238,Mr LAIRD SMITH,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"Of course I was, because I believed it was the only way to get measures through which we believed in and desired to pass. simply sat here, and the Opposition did the talking. Honourable members talk of freedom to speak. What freedom has any honourable member here now, if he is supporting the Government, and is desirous that the Government should carry the legislation which it brings down?",50
239,Mr MCGRATH,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,What did the honorhonorable able member do?,50
240,Mr LAIRD SMITH,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"What did you do? You went and perched yourself with the honourable member for Bourke i another room, because you would not mit to the discipline.",50
241,Mr MCGRATH,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"And you to apply the "" gag.""",50
242,Mr LAIRD SMITH,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"And then the position for that. Prime Minister made the fatal mistake of not putting the acid on the honourable member, and of making him come to purpose heel. Internally, he was out of the party, * while externally he was known to be th© party.",50
243,Mr MCGRATH,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"Quite right. could not put the "" gag "" on me!",50
244,Mr LAIRD SMITH,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"And now the honourable member says I am wrong. Why do I go into this past history? I look into the history of the past because. future lies mirrored there. That is why I speak as I am doing today. Here, we are about to make it possible to get business through the House when a strong Opposition is determined will that no business shall go through. That is all that is proposed. Under the rules governing this House-and no one knows this fact better than the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr . MCGRATH)- a strong Opposition can make it impossible for any Government to do business. The Opposition will move an amendment. If it is ruled in order by Mr Speaker, there is ultimately a division upon it , and then there is a division on the motion; whereafter, another amendment is moved, and so we gu on.",50
245,Mr MCGRATH,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"We r e you not a member of the Opposition in 1913, when the Liberals were in power and applied the closure night after night? They carried their business in that way. What more do you want?",50
246,Mr LAIRD SMITH,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"Exactly , and that can be done today. But I shall vote for this motion because it will give honourable members much more freedom. What 'happens at the present time? Members of the Opposition may talk, and We their party has no objection at all to their talking upon any measure. But if the Government desire to get a Bill through, the party agree that it shall go through, whereupon honourable members on the Government side have either to curtail their speeches or not speak at all. What was the experience the other day ? The member for Illawarra"" (Mr . Hector Lamond) was desirous of speaking upon what was certainly to him a most important question. He made an n attempt about five times, and then got subshut out merely because the Government was desirous that the measure in queswere the man tion should go through. ",50
247,Mr LAIRD SMITH,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"Of course not. The Opposition is here for the specific of stopping the legislation of the Government, and, so long as they have in the right to do so, Opposition members are quite justified i u exercising their They righ t to the fullest extent. The trouble. with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) will be that when we come to read his speeches in the future it will be noted that what he said would the come about has not come about, and it will have been clearly demonstrated again that no one should be a prophet unless he knows beforehand. The honourable member has made statements today that be useful when we go on the hustings. We shall be-able to say, "" He r e is the speech of the Leader of the Opposition, and to show you people how intemperate and misleading he is in his remarks, just for the purpose of gulling the public, see what he has said.

249,Mr LAIRD SMITH,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"The honourable member knows that that kind of thing would not be submitted to, and that honourable members will have their say if deem it necessary. But why should every honourable member have to get up and talk when he believes in a measure and is ing to support the Government in its passage? An honourable member asks me why I continue to talk about this particular phase. It is because of the tirade of the Leader of the Opposition. I assure him that I shall have my say whenever I may desire, and that, when the Budget comes along-by 'which time. I may have even greater, freedom of speech- I shall still have my say, and I shall give honourable members just as much of my views as I may deem fit. I have been prepared generally to take the advice of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr . Austin Chapman), namely, to say no unkind word in this House. But if honourable members are going to speak as the Leader of the Opposition has done, andfor such a purpose-that is, - not to endeavour to win votes within this Chamber, nor to persuade honourable members upon any course, but merely that he may be able to say in his electorate, "" Look at what I said in the House about those ' scabs ' who lived with me and vou ""-the n I , too, shall have my say. I know what the Leader of the Opposition desires to bring about, but his efforts will not have that effect. Every day I meet trade unionists who are thinking for themselves now, who are not kicking us as they were doing months ago, but are saying, "" I am beginning to think that you are on the right side, and that I was wrong."" I was talking with one of the best trade unionists in Melbourne, who was elected to office only the other day, and when we hear men talking as the Leader of the Opposition has been doing, I can only [244] say that I , at any rate, do not object to his strong language, because I realise that men of ability outside will not be gulled in that manner. They will give us the opportunity to state our views from the platform. I shall support the motion, because I desire to see something done. 2So doubt, some of the members who live in Melbourne find comfortable quarters here. This House is not so hot a place as some others that they know, but, on the contrary, a haven of refuge. Those members would like to see us sit from Christmas to Christmas. But we who do not live in Melbourne desire to get away to our constituencies and our homes when they the occasion offers. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) complains that the motion will take away his freedom willof speech. Outside this Chamber he possesses nofreedom of speech at all. He has not what a great writer calls the freedom "" to utter, to argue according to conscience."" He must weigh every word that he utters. Indeed, he must first listen attentively to hear what the other man says he shall utter. In my opinion, the proposed new standing order will not deprive him of freedom of speech in this Chamber.  regard the motion as an unmixed evil. I have heard members make speeches by the hour, night after night, and have wished that there were some way. of stopping them. The fear that has been expressed, that Governments may use the proposed standing order unfairly , is not shared by me. I do not think that any set of Ministers would use it in a way likely to bring upon themselves"" ridicule and contempt and dismissal from power. A rule similar to that now proposed has been in operation in the Queensland Parliament for many years. In the good old days, when I was young in politics, I looked upon an all-night sitting as something glorious, but I do not relish one now. I have learned a great deal since then. I feel that something must be done, to facilitate the transaction of business. Of course, everything that the Leader of the Opposition said might happen were the motion passed could happen.",51

I have implicit faith in Mr Speaker seeing that no two speeches are made consecutively from one side of the House,- and I have no fear but that every question will be properly debated.

As soon as the Estimates are called on the Government Whip goes from member to member, and says, "" Will you stop all night, so that we may put the Estimates through?"" and we have an all-night sitting to rush them .through. is sheer hypocrisy in the circumstances to urge that it is necessary to pass such a standing order as this in order that the work of the Parliament may be carried out. I feel strongly concerning the failure of Parliament to sit moTe than three days & week. It is quite an innovation, and, as the result of it, the representatives of Queensland, Western Australia, and Tasmania have to remain in Melbourne from Friday afternoon until Wednesday afternoon for the resumption of the sittings. If this standing order be carried, I hope it will be subject to the proviso that it shall come into operation only when Parliament is sitting four days a week. No greater mistake could be made by any Parliament than to legislate for any peculiar set of circumstances or because of implicit trust in any Government. Honourable members ou this side of the House may say that they have every confidence in the Government of the day; but they should not forget that if we pass this standing order, it will remain for other Governments to apply. I doubt if , once carried, any Government will be induced to repeal it, so that those who are supporting it with a light heart today may have it applied as a political whip to their backs in the days to come.

The Estimates relating to the Navy, the Defence Department, the Northern Territory, Papua, and to Public Works, as well as those relating to the Federal Capital, the Small Arms Factory, and Cockatoo Island Dock, all call for very careful consideration. Will that consideration be possible under this standing order? Certainly not. Each of these large items requires separate treatment. They cannot be dealt with as a whole in an off-hand way; they are so varied and numerous that they demand the very closest scrutiny. Ever since I have been a member of this House I have held it to be as much the duty of the supporters of the Government as it is of the Opposition to thoroughly discuss the Estimates. That is a duty which rests on the shoulders of every honourable member; but I repeat that under this standing order it will not be possible to deal with public expenditure as it ought to be. If it be carried, then the Government should at once' introduce the Estimates, and allow the House to deal with them before it is applied.",54

I should be still better pleased if we were dealing with the matter of taxation, because that is infinitely more essential than the proposal to apply this drastic closure. The object of the motion appears to me to be to relieve the Government from bringing forward the Bills they have outlined for this session. As I have stated previously, Parliament should not be robbed of its privileges. Even conceding that some honourable members may have exceeded ordinary decency in the conduct of debate, we must credit them with the idea that they were casting pearls of wisdom before the country, and we have no righ t to deprive any representative of the opportunity of expressing his views. It has often happened that when members have wandered from the immediate business before the House they have been laying the foundation of important legislation subsequently, and I am not prepared to deprive members of the rights they now possess. I do not know any Parliament in Australia with a standing order so drastic.  Government is introducing a similar standing order.",55
280,Mr WEST,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"There are fools in other Parliaments as well as in this; at present, however no Parliament possesses a standing order of this character.. One reason for the proposal is that there have been protracted debates on the Estimates. Even if that be so, a standing order of this kind will not provide o. remedy. It may be that when the Estimates are laid on the table members are not quite prepared to discuss them, and the one and real reason is that, once the Estimates are through, a Government with a majority in both Houses has only to pass the Appropriation Bill by Christmas, and then be under no obligation to call Parliament u n t i l the following July. That is precisely what a great number of members object to-the giving up of the control of the finances. Even in the case of the granting of a three months' Supply Bill it is a matter of indifference to a Government wha+her Parliament meets in the meanwhile or not. A more seriois objection to the mo- I tion is that at the present time Australia does not look upon its National Parliament with that respect which is its due. There is discontent in the community, and also a number of gentlemen who believe in what is termed "" direct action."" There are many who are dissatisfied with our system of parliamentary government, and we had an instance of this the other day in connection with the Arbitration Court. Such standing orders as are now proposed simply supply material for argument to those discontented persons, and strengthen them in their view that direct action is the only road to reform. Parliament ought to be the protector, "" the guide, philosopher, and f r i e n d , "" of those who are keen for reform in .the interests of the people. In the time of "" J a c k "" Robertson and Sir Henry Parkes the New South Wales Parliament used to sit four days a week, as, indeed, this Parliament did until recent years, and if we are anxious to get on with the business of the country we ought to devote our time to the various measures, especially taxation measures, which have been promised, and not talk about curtailing the rights and privileges of honourable members. Latterly we have not had statesmen, or men of the necessary intellect and intelligence, at the head of the Treasury, and now we have an Acting Prime Minister who submits a motion of this kind instead of the Bills that have been promised. This motion will not win the war-will not give the soldier £1 a day, find him equipment, or feed his children. is no doubt that the measures on the business-paper would, if passed, be of some use as a foundation for a better of taxation than. we have at Hasty legislation is very dangerous, but legislation which there is no for discussing is more dangerous still, and holds out the possibilities of disaster. Government actuated by . proper would have no fear of criticism. know that the measures we pass, very often require amendment, but what would be the state of affairs under the operation of a standing order like that Where is the justification for such a standing order ?

To find out what the Labour party in Australia is doing. Honourable members may laugh, but I had the pleasure of introducing the commissioner from the technical and industrial colleges of Paris a few years ago, and I know what I am talking about. The French Mission is here to find out how we conduct our Mr West. legislative business, and .at such a moment it is"" proposed to stifle debate. As pointed ont by the Leader of the Opposition. (l ! r . Tudor), no amendments other than Government amendments will have a chance ofbeing put to the House under this standing order, and I am not unreasonable when I ask what the Opposition has done to justify such a proposal. TheOpposition in this House applies itself to the one purpose of assisting the There party in power to govern the country, and, if possible, to win the war. Nothing that has been said or done on this side system of the House would justify any honourable present. member in saying that we have not played our part in assisting the Governopportunity ment with any measure that had for its object the winning of the war. If the A Government are anxious to proceed with motives the business, let them bring before ParliaWe all ment the Bills which were promised in the Ministerial statement. I am anxious to assist them as far as I can, although I do not agree with them in regard to - their"" proposed ? taxation proposals or their loan policy. I know we cannot do without loan money; but before we pledge the country in order to raise money by loan.we ought to tap by taxation the reserves of wealth. If there are reserves which can be tapped by loans, those same reserves can be tapped by taxation. The Government have taken from the banks every available sovereign; How but for every sovereign placed .in the gold of reserve two notes have been issued. All if we the big companies in Australia have added to their wealth during the last few years, and I ask the Government why they do Parliament not make those companies contribute more parties-one largely to the revenue. The Mother of Parliaments has set an example for the smaller Parliaments of the Empire, by not attempting to carry on the war merely with loan moneys. About 33 per cent, of the Imperial war expenditure has been  We and other members of the House of Commons have criticised the Imperial Why Government for not adopting the same policy as was followed in connection with the Napoleonic and Crimean wars, when Parliament raised sufficient revenue to pay half the cost of the war, in order that the soldiers and their dependants might not be bled by indirect taxation whilst those who stayed at home became wealthy and p ut their money into the war loan at 5 per cent. If it is necessary to expedite the business of Parliament, I would sooner sit four days a week continuously for four or five months. If we had continuity in our sittings we should be able to come to decisions quicker than is possible under the present system of brief and interrupted sessions, which prevent continuity in our deliberations. We should do better if we followed the example of the Fisher Government when they induced Parliament to sit four days in the week; but I do not desire that the sitting shall start at 10 o'clock in the morning and continue t ill midnight or later. I do not believe that this motion will assist the Government at all . This is not the way to treat a Parliament of men. If we are men we should be treated as such, and if there is any justification for the motion we should be told what it is. When the French Commission was in Australia in 1911 I introduced its members into the gallery of this chamber, and I said to one of them : "" What do you think of this Parliament?"" He replied, "" I never heard a body of men rise in Parliament and speak for the first time with so much confidence and earnestness.""",55
281,Mr LECKIE,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,Did he mean that*as a compliment ?,57
282,Mr WEST,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"I never knew a Frenchman who was. not courteous and complimentary. It is always the tyrant who introduces tyrannical measures. Men who have open minds, and respect the opinions of others, never wish to do anything of a tyrannical nature. This motion cannot be regarded as anything but evidence of a tyrannical desire to suppress the views of honourable members on this s de. The present Standing Orders invest the Speaker with full power to protect the House against any honourable member who attempts anything which is not in accordance with the desire of the House. The Speaker can call an honourable member to order, or, if necessary, a motion can be made that an honourable member be no longer heard. And Parliament carried on very well with these Standing Orders until the - present Government came into power. The Government have lost Ministerial control. The Minister for Home and Territories (Mr Glynn) and the Postmaster-General (Mr Webster) are the only two Ministers who are not surrounded by Commissions. In the case of all the other Ministers, Commissions are doing all the work, and the Ministers are not""""even "" t w e l f t h - d ay cake ornaments."" The honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) has pointed out that, of the 313 working days in last year, Parliament sat only about fifty days. If those fifty days are divided into our salaries it will be seen that we have a dashed good job.",57
283,Mr CHARLTON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,Does the honourable member do nothing when he is not in the House ?,57
284,Mr WEST,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"I have a great deal of work in doing what I can to put the present Government out of office. There is plenty of real work to which Parliament could direct its energy. One can see in the street, on one hand, a workman's wife leading one child by the hand and carrying another in her arms; and, on the other hand, a woman riding in a car in Collins-street, wearing a hat that has cost more than the worker's weekly wage, and boots ornamented with enough buttons to equip thirty pairs of children's boots. While the one woman rides in luxury, the worker's wife on her way to visit her mother must walk with her children, because she cannot afford tram fares. These are the social anomalies which Parliament should be remedying. Let Parliament rise to the occasion and do the work which is to its hand. Let us show that we are a Parliament of men sent here to legislate in the interests of Australia. One honourable member interjected, "" What about our home comfortsi?"" And we work fifty days in the year! An intelligent Democracy will not stand that sort of thing. When the soldiers return they will demand' to know what we are doing to ; make conditions better than they were when they went away. They will not be content to go into the bush with their families and work for £2 10s. per week and never see' anything but gum - leaves aud dust. They will demand a better life than that, and Parliament should be trying to find employment for them. It is no pleasure to me to be driving these facts into ' the minds of honourable members opposite, except that I know that I am voicing the opinions of those who sent me here. I have no desire to hear my own voice, I speak only because I believe that there are wrongs which should be remedied. If we neglect our legislative work, discontent will surely increase, and possibly get beyond our control. We should legislate to prevent discontent. It can be done. The Government would be much better employed in proceeding with some of the Bills on the notice-paper, than in wasting time with this motion and that which was passed last week, to enable the Crown Law officers to censor my speeches. One might think I was a criminal, and that the Crown Law officers had to be called upon to decide what charge should be entered against me. Under the motion to which I refer Mr Speaker was deprived of all power. Our Hansard reporters are capable men, and would not include in their reports any utterance which might injur e the Empire. Their chief goes through the Hansard report, and so also does Mr Speaker, and. f u r ther, if honourable members are dissatisfied because something which they desired to appear is not included in the report, they can rise in their places here, and ask, through. Mr Speaker, for some explanation of the omission. When a motion such as that now under discussion is submitted, one would think that a small tooth-comb had been used amongst the community to gather all the wretches who could be found in order to place them in this Parliament. That ' is a logical deduction from the introduction' of such a motion, and I say that it is no way in which to treat the members of any Parliament. If we pass such a motion we shall rightly be subjected to the ridicule of every other Parliament in the Empire. - I often refrain. from speaking in this House because it is of no use to offer pearls of wisdom to dummies, and we know that honourable members opposite come here with their minds made up as creatures of the Government, to carry whatever they propose. The function of a Parliament is to debate questions, and, if any measure submitted is not likely to meet with the approbation of the people, it should not be passed. Under this proposal members may not understand a Bill submitted, because they may be given no opportunity to learn what is in it , if the creatures of the Government agree that the passing of the measure is an urgent matter. When the Estimates for the Navy come on I should like to avail myself of the opportunity to go thoroughly into them, but if honourable members opposite decide to pass them as an urgent matter they will be put to the vote, and done with. The honourable member for Yarra (Mr. Tudor), when speaking upon the motion, made a reference to the treatment of honMr West. orable members on this side by the press. Newspapers today do not give the attention which they used to give in times gone by to the utterances of members of Parliament. They are virtually in the hands of the Government, and may not publish anything but what the Government deem desirable, because the censors are the creatures of the Government. There never before was a time when the utterances of members of Parliament were treated by the newspapers as they are today. We know .that the war is the excuse, but it does not justify what is done. I receive every week two or three English newspapers, which are sent to me by my people in England, and I can assure honourable members that information concerning the war, and criticism of members of the Parliament of Parliaments, no matter what position they occupy, are freely published in those newspapers. That is sound, because the public, whose servants members of Parliament are. should know something of what is going on. Why should we have these attempts made to smother criticism in this country, when in Great Britain the representative of a British constituency may rise in his place in the House of Commons, and criticise the Estimates, or the action of Sir Douglas Haig at the Front. One honourable member urged that Sir Douglas H a i g should be recalled because of certain things he had done. He has been c r it i cised also in the press. Sir John French, when in command of the British Forces, was criticised, and so, also, was A d m i r a l Beatty. If any honourable member takes up an English newspaper, he will find that writers for it plainly say that these men do things which they ought not to do, and give reasons for their belief. That sort of freedom is not permitted in Australia. Are honourable members opposite afraid of what honourable members on this side - may say? I shall say nothing which may not appear in the press or in Hansard, and I know that every .honourable member on this side is animated by the same spirit. At one time it was proposed to constitute a mutual admiration society of this Parliament. I put my foot down upon that. If any attempt of the kin d were made, I should become linruly and obnoxious, and riotous, because when a Parliament becomes a mutual admiration society, as this Parliament is likely to become if this motion is passed, its f all will very shortly take place. Honourable members may recall that when the Romans became so satisfied, with themselves as to become a mutual admiration society, they went very fast to the walL I have been elected to oppose the present Government, and I shall oppose them when they submit any measure which is not progressive. This cannot be regarded as a progressive motion, and it will not add a shilling to any war fund. A.t the eleventh hour I advise honourable members opposite to induce the Government to withdraw the motion. If they do so they will be commended by the press, and by every right-thinking man in Australia. I have no desire to occupy further time in discussing this matter, but I protest against every attempt to curtail the p r i vileges of Parliament. If such a motion as this had been presented to some of the older politicians of the New South Wales Parliament, they would not have tolerated such an encroachment upon their rights. They regarded Parliament as a place in which public questions should be full y and lessly discussed, and their one ambition was the progress of the country. honourable members opposite to consider carefully what they are asked to do, and to remember that the Labour party in the elections in 1910 secured thousands of votes in every State, because they were able to say that they had been gagged and prevented from discussing measures brought before Parliament. This motion will reflect upon honourable members opposite in the same way. I do not speak in this fashion from any love of the present Government, but for love of the Parliament of which I am a member. confident that in voting against this motion I shall be giving effect to the views of the people of East Sydney, and of the whole of the city of Sydney, which is really the metropolis of Australia. There is no other city in the Commonwealth in which there are four daily papers, four newspapers published on the Sunday, and two comic and one semi-comic publication issued each week. parliamentary representatives of these people to be asked to vote for a proposal which will have the effect of stifling discussion here is altogether beyond reason. This motion is prompted by ulterior motives, and by fear on the part of the Government"" that the measures which they submit will be discussed full y and fearlessly, and ih the manner in which they ought to be discussed.",57
285,Mr ARCHIBALD,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"Hindmarsh) [8.31]. - I intend to support the motion. I have long held the opinion-and , in deed, I have repeatedly urged-that some such procedure as that contemplated in this proposal should be adopted. Briefly put, the motion aims at the emancipation of Ministerialists and the destruction of the tyranny of the Opposition. We hear a great deal about liberty from honourable members opposite^ but we witness only exhibitions of brutal tyranny. What is the position today ? As soon as the Government submit a measure for our consideration, members of the Opposition occupy all the time they are allowed to occupy under our Standing Orders in discussing it. Of course, Ministerial supporters are at liberty to follow their example, but if they did so the Government would be unable to pass any legislative measures at all. Consequently Ministerialists refrain from debating proposals because of fear- the tyranny of the Opposition. All-night sittings are sometimes resorted to in order. I ask to push business through this Chamber; but who derives any satisfaction from such sittings ? Only a few enthusiastic lunatics upon the opposite side of the Chamber. The ordinary citizen, upon reading about an all-night sitting, merely shrugs his shoulders, wonders what sort of an in stitution Parliament has become, and is driven to the conclusion that these protracted sittings involve a disgraceful waste of time. Such sittings break down the health of those honourable members who are most attentive to their duties, and I feel who do not possess sufficiently robust constitutions to withstand the strain. That is the position which obtains today, and I am sure that Australia does not desire its continuance. Some honourable members have indulged in all sorts of predictions as to what will be the effect of this motion. We have been assured that the Government will im pose a time limi t upon the discussion of Por the the Estimates and upon the consideration of measures of the utmost importance. Certainly they will, if they can command the support of a sufficient number of Ministerialists. But the latter have a keen love of liberty, and are not likelv to tolerate tyranny on the part of the Government, even if the latter desired to exercise it . As a matter of fact, however, there is no shch desire on the part of Ministers. ""With the exception of the pretics sent Opposition, there never was a party in this Parliament which was disposed indulge in tyranny, because the great jority of honourable members possess the sporting instincts of Australians. adoption of this motion will mean that the time allotted to any debate will equally divided between Ministerialists and Oppositionists. Consequently, tone of our discussions will be raised, the reports which appear in Hansard will be worthy of more serious perusal they are at present. There is another reason why the proobstruction. cedure contemplated should be adopted. The position of Parliament, today is tirely different from that of Parliament half a century ago. It has been urged that there is no precedent for this motion. But a precedent can be found in the British House of Commons. Why? Beintended cause the Commons recognised the necessay sity for some such procedure if it to carry on the King's business.",59
286,Mr BOYD,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,Remembe r that there are 670 members in the House of Commons.,60
287,Mr ARCHIBALD,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"I am quite aware of that. I know that discussion in the House of Commons is limited to a certain number of members. There, an honourable member cannot speak without the consent of the Whip, and if he attempted to make a speech of the character of many of speeches that are delivered here he would be pulled down on his seat by his coat tails. The Speaker of the House of Comnot mons is practically vested with unlimited powers, and again and again during the past for t y years he has, upon his own initiative, taken drastic action wheu he has felt sure that such action would command the support of mempartiality, bers. In the Britis h Parliament f r 1859 to 1865 we know that two parties carried on the business of the country. Every courtesy and sideration were shown to the Ministry that time. ' But here in Australia we not understand the rudiments of parliaand mentary government, and the sooner we learn them the better. The idea that it the function of an Opposition to consistenough, ently pursue obstructive tactics is unknown in England. Not a year passes in which the members of the different parties in British Parliament do not meet to confer upon certain matters. Who was it that originated parliamentary obstructive tac? It was the I r is h brigade, which used the forms of the House of Commons for to the purpose of securing Home Rule for maIreland by making it impossible for that Chamber to perform its work. Similarly, The when the measure dealing with the South African Confederation was under review, be a "" stone-wall "" was set up which lasted a week. Now, I have had twenty-seven the years of parliamentary experience, and I and have never yet known a "" stone-wall "" to succeed. When threatened with organized than obstruction, no Government would be worth its salt if it did not bring all its guns to bear in order to beat down that The proceedings of this Parliament are littl e short of a comedy. Cerentainly they do not reflect any credit upon us. Suppose the regulations dealing with the King's A r my could be used for the purpose of preventing that A r m y from discharging the functions which it is to disoharge, what would people ? Similarly, if the engineering society was adopted . rules which would prevent engineers from efficiently performing their duties, what should we think of it? Or, if the law society framed rules to prevent efficient service by members of the Bar, what would be said ? Y e t these cases are entirely analogous to our own. Hitherto we have allowed our Standing Orders to be used for the purpose of preventing Parliament transacting the public business. the We have already delayed too long, and the sooner the motion is passed the better it will be for this Parliament. I have the slightest fear as to the eflect of this amendment of our Standing Orders, because honourable members will have ample opportunity for the submission of their views. Mr Speaker will see to that. We are all agreed as to his i m and he will see that the time o m allowed will be fair l y allotted. To-night we have had some figures conconcerning the number of days that Parliaof ment has been sitting. I say that under do the present system we have sat too long, that if we had sat less it would have been better for the country. B y this I is do not mean that there has not been work but, unfortunately, we have an Opposition different from the Opposition of any other Parliament in the British the Empire; aye, different from any Opposition where the English language is spoken to-night. In no otheT part of the British Empire is tliere au Opposition in the sense that we know it here, comprising men burning with the hatred of party politics. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) has told us that he will use all the moans of party warfare to block this motion. In private affairs he is very much respected, but in party politics he is a barbarian. We have all this, too, at a time when the Empire is engaged in the greatest war in its history.",60
288,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,Is this the soft answer that turneth away wrath? '.,61
289,Mr ARCHIBALD,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"The honourable member need not worry. The red-raggers at Broken Hill keep him in.. I say that during this, the greatest war in our history, we have sat on too many days, because of the character of the Opposition. If any honourable member takes up Hansard and goes through the speeches, he will find what has been the attitude of honourable members opposite with regard to every Government proposal. When the Labour party were in power and there was a Liberal Opposition, I saw Supply Bills for three months go through in an hour. Have we had that experience during the present Parliament? Hansard will show that the speeches of every member on the other side have been made, not for the purpose of throwing any light on a debate or of insuring sounder judgment, but for the benefit of political leagues side the House. Then we have had all the cant about "" peace by negotiation."" Do honourable members think this was the right course to take in the Commonwealth Parliament at a time when our people are shouldering cheerfully the full weight of this war?> I say that when Parliament is cursed by an Opposition that countenances this, then the sooner Parliament is in recess the better. That is the view I take, and that is the view held by pretty well all the people of this country. Party politics have, never before sunk so low as to endeavour to paralyze the efforts of the Government and defy the wishes of the people. This, I maintain, is justification for the motion now before the House. The Government would not be worth their salt if they had not brought down some such proposal, and if they did not endeavour to get it through as quickly as possible. I do not want to set an example tonight by making a long speech. The carrying of this motion will give me ample opportunity of speaking in the future, though I may not have the chance to make long speeches.. I do .not want that. Let us examine this hypocritical cant about time being so necessary for the consideration of the Budget. If Parliament sat from the 1st January till Christmas Eve there would still be plenty of members who would .want to talk Budget all the time. And, after all, what do we gain by talking about the Budget? I have listened to honourable members of this Parliament talking for a couple of days about a vote of £100,000 with the object of reducing it by £1,. and then in the next half-hour they .have voted £10,000,000 or £20,000,000. The only way in which the Estimates' oan be interfered with is for the supporters of the Government to call upon the Government to make any reduction considered necessary.  have of doing that? Mr ARCHIBALD. - My honourable friend seems to know a very great deal about our Caucus. I have had the good fortune to be a member of bo,th Caucuses, and I know. ",61
290,Mr ARCHIBALD,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"I know that the difference between our - present Caucus outand the former Caucus of which I was a member, is as the differencebetween heaven _ and hell. All Ministers know they will have to consider any proposal by their supporters with regard to the Estimates. I have seen this done. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr. Poster) will recollect that the Government supporters in the South Australian Parliament, about twenty years ago, sent back the Estimates with an instruction for the Government to do certain things, and the Government obeyed. I remember when, as a youth, the celebrated John Bright saying just what the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) said to-night about the Budget. All this talk about reducing the Estimates, he said, was humbug, because he had sat beside Joseph Hume in the House of Commons for twenty-five years, and, though Joseph Hume had never done anything else but check Budgets, he had never got anything out of it, for the simple reason that all this Budget talk is intended for the people outside. Honourable members know that very well. We have to look at the position fair l y and consider what would be the effect of seriously interfering with Estimates. Let us take our military expenditure as an example. A f t e r the war it is certain there will be great differences of opinion amongst members as to how far we can go in reducing the Estimates. In many cases it would be very dimcult to cut down without abolishing certain aspects of departmental work. We might shut up the East-West railway, for in stance, and make a big saving in salaries, expenditure on rolling-stock, maintenance of the permanent-way, and allow the grass to grow there. We might also do the same with Canberra. But I do not want to discuss these matters to-night. I deprecate all this abstract talk about what we can do' by a Budget debate, for, as I have already said, I have seen the House occupy an immense amount of time in seeking to reduce a particular line by £ 1 , sitting, perhaps, for a couple of days and a. couple .of nights, and then passing Estimates for £10,000,000 without a word. It is comical, to say the least of it . ",61
291,Mr ARCHIBALD,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"I have no desire to be severe, but the honourable member was severe upon me a little while ago when he spoke about our Caucus. I recollect when I was in charge of the Bill for compulsory voting that members agreed to it in Caucus, but when they came down to the House they slaughtered it.  Webster slaughtering you, too? ' Mr ARCHIBALD - My friend need not tell that part of the story. However, that is past history. I do not know that I have much more to say, except that, in reply to a suggestion that we might sit on more days each week, I remember that in the Parliament of 1910-13, when there were several new members, there was a belief that, as eight hours a day was a good thing for the average man, it would be a good thing for Parliament. The old hands, like myself, shrugged their shoulders and shook their heads, but said, "" Let them have a go."" Accordingly we sat from 10 o'clock in the morning t ill 11 o'clock at night, but we did not get a bit "" forrader,"" because our friends .in Opposition-the Liberals in those days-said , in effect, to the Government, "" Parliament is going to get up when we like, and not before."" Ministers, therefore, had no time to attend to their offices, and honourable members who have had any experience of public life know what that means. That in novation failed. Parliament did no more work then than is being done now under the present system, but, of course, members had more time to talk. At one time, Wednesday was set apart for private members' business, and I have always regarded that as "" Tom Foqls's Day ""- a day when all the abstract twaddle that a man can think about was talked.",62
292,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,What about grievance day?,62
293,Sir ROBERT BEST,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,It is a safety valve.,62
294,Mr ARCHIBALD,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,Yes ; but most of the grievances that we hear so much of are made-up grievances. The main grievance of those who voice them is that they are not in office. I do not know why a day should be given every three weeks for the airing of that grievance.,62
295,Mr BOYD,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,They could have it out at any time they liked to do so.,62
296,Mr ARCHIBALD,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"Of course they could. If my honourable friend had a grievance to ventilate, he would know how to deal with it , and so would I . I never ventilate imaginary grievances, merely to play to the gallery. The State Parliaments sit only three days a week, and when this Parliament was sitting four days a week I was one of those who recognised that it could get through as much work if it saved a sitting day and its attendant expense. I ^Siould have liked, when a member of the Labour Gohonorable vernment, to see a motion like this car-. ried. I was in favour of. a standing order similar to that now proposed. Such a rule was needed. Complaint is made time and again of the delay in presenting the Budget, but whatever Government may be in office-Liberal , Labour, National, cr Radical-it could not, under the presentparliamentary arrangements, bring forward its Budget early in a session, because the discussion of the Estimates and Budget proposals would block the consideration of whatever measures it might have in its programme. A hundred reasons could be adduced in support of the motion, but, to my mind, there are not half-a-dozen to be found against it .",62
297,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"Brisbane) [9.4] The speeches of Ministerialists, instead of enlightening the House as to the reasons for this motion, have contained no reasons at all in support of it . The Government, before asking for greater power for the conduct of the business of the country, should have shown that, under the existing Standing Orders, the consideration of business is hindered. No member has stated that a reason for the proposed new standing order is that business cannot now be dealt with. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Archibald) has given us a reason why the motion should not be passed. He told us that the Labour A d ministration, which was in power between 1910 and 1913, did no more work with Parliament sitting four - days a week than this Government has done with Parliament sitting only three days a week. That Administration, however, passed through Parliament a series of legislative measures never equalled before or since in either quantity or quality. As i able to do that by getting Parliament to sit four days a week; and without asking for the increase of power now asked for, there is no good reason for the present motion.",63
298,Mr ARCHIBALD,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,That Government had a different Opposition.,63
299,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"Unfortunately , the honourable member was unable to keep out of his speech the bitter party prejudice which is so strong in him. H is remarks, and the interjection he has just made, indicate what is in his mind, and what is in the minds of Ministerialists generally. Their object is to get at the Opposition. I repudiate the suggestion that the conduct of the present Opposition has made it necessary to propose this new standing order. I do not think that it can be shown from the records of the House that the present - Opposition of twenty-two members has prevented the Government from transacting its business. The Opposition is not strong enough to prevent the Government from passing any measures that it may wish to pass, or from doing what it chooses with the business of the House. The closure gives the Government as strong a weapon against obstruction as can be wielded in any Parliament of the world. B y its use, this Government could at any time force any legislation through Parliament. was not, however, from any speaker preceding the honourable member for H in d marsh (Mr Archibald) the slightest suggestion that the motion is due to the ill-conduct of the Opposition. As a matter of fact, the Government has a large majority at its beck and call. It has not, however, made any serious attempt to transact business. It has not shown any particular desire to get through any great quantity of business. Parliament has sat for so few days, and its meetings have been at such long intervals, that Ministers evidently have not been particularly desirous of getting through their business. This Parliament was elected on the 5th. May, 1917. It met on the 14th June following; when it sat for one day only. It reassembled on the 11th July, and sat until the 27th 'September, on thirty-four days. In 1918 it sat between the 9th and 18th January on seven days, and 'between the 4th A p r i l and 15th June, on thirty-four days. We t was reassembled on 18th September, and have since sat on ten days. During a year and five months we have sat - on only eighty-six days. H a d the Government desired to get through legislation, it had the opportunity to do so. The Opposition has not obstructed, nor has it delayed, business. The reason for the proposed standing order is not anything that has happened in the past. This is a machine-gun trained on the Opposition to prevent possible obstruction of business in the future. I am not discussing this proposal from a party stand-point, because the Standing Orders affect all parliamentary parties alike. Ever since I entered the House in 1910, I have heard it said that the Standing Orders needed amendment. It has been suggested that the Standing Orders Committee, or a Special Committee, should be instructed to consider and revise them. The need for the revision of the Standing Orders being admitted on both sides, the Government should have referred them for revision to the Standing Orders Committee or to a Special Committee, composed of members of both parties. This has not been done. We are not informed whether Ministers have even consulted their supporters in reference to the proposed standing order, or whether the motion now before us comes wholly from the "" j u n t a , "" There the caucus upstairs having had no ""say "" about it . Certainly the Opposition has not been invited to offer any suggestion. However, I do not want to argue the matter. ""Whatever - Government may be in power, the use or abuse of the Standing Orders is the same. I have seen an Opposition doing its best to obstruct and delay the business of a Labour Government, aud I have seen a Labour Opposition using the same tactics towards a Liberal Government. I have heard complaints about the delay in the presentation of the Budget both when LabourGovernments and when Liberal Governments have been in power, - No matter what Administration may be in office, it uses the Standing Orders to suit its convenience. We have been told that this Government does not intend to employ, with any severity, the new powers for which it asks. We have been told by one of the Ministers that it is not intended to employ them in the manner suggested by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor), and that the Opposition will be given a fair deal. But. honourable members generally, and particularly those on the opposite side, must bear in mind that the proposed new standing order will be a weapon in the hands, not only of the present Ministers-wh o may use it fairly-bu t also of their successors; and those who support the motion may be the first to feel its effect. When the war precautions legislation was introduced, Sir William Irvine, the Minister for the Navy (Mr Joseph Cook), the Minister for Home and Territories (Mr. Glynn), and the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom) all protested against it, pointing out the seriousness of the step that the House was being asked to take in conferring so much power on the Government. The then Attorney General (Mr Hughes), and the then Prime Minister (Mr Andrew Fisher), assured the Housa. and the Opposition in particular, that the powers sought for would be used with discretion and moderation.",63
300,Mr MOWIXLIAMS,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"'When we tried to get the measure amended, honourable members opposite refused to support us, and they are now suffering heavily in consequence of that refusal.",64
301,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"I ask the House to remember that, although I was a supporter of the Government which introduced the legislation to which I am referring, I was from the very beginning opposed to it ",64
302,Mr MCGRATH,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,There were not too many who did oppose it.,64
303,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"No , the party as a whole supported it, but who imagines for one moment that the kindly character of the administration of the War Precautions Act promised by the then Government is at all comparable with the administration of that measure at the present time? The little timid, retiring cub has grown into a ferocious tiger. The War Precautions Act of today has no similarity whatever to the little, feeble, innocent measure introduced in 1914-15. When introduced it was to be used for special purposes, and was not to be used with severity. That is just what Ministers are saying today about this proposed amendment of the Standing Orders; but exactly as the War Precautions Act has developed, so will the Standing Orders develop, and one day the seed which Ministers are now sowing will bring in a harvest of trouble that it will take the work of a Parliament to undo. I believe that the Standing Orders do need amending""'. There are some anomalies in them which are not at - all flattering to our intelligence as a Parliament; but this is not the right way in which to alter them, and even now the Government would be well advised to accept the suggestion made earlier in. the debate, and withdraw the proposal and submit it to the Standing Orders Committee. The Speaker and those who have occupied the position of Speaker and Chairman of Committees know more about the working of the Standing Orders than ordinary honourable members; they are better acquainted with the intricacies of them, and they would make a very acceptable committee to revise the Standing Orders as a whole. If there is any particular reason for limiting debates on the lines suggested in the motion, such a Committee could give full consideration to. the proposal put forward. I cannot overlook the fact that this is, first of all, a deliberative assembly. Therefore, anything that would interfere with the freedom of our deliberations, and a full and fair criticism of the proposals brought forward here, is to be regarded with some suspicion, if not fear. The main objection to the Government's proposal is that it will tend to destroy the character of this House as a deliberative assembly. ""We are. getting into a system of government in this country-perhap s we are not much different from any other country-by which M in isters say what is to be done, and it is done. Ministers bring forward their measures as a matter of for m , as a sort of concession to Democracy, or as a kind of camouflage to make the people believe that there is such a thing in existence as a representative assembly; the measures are placed before the House and are seriously discussed, yet every honourable member on both sides knows that a Bill which has been brought forward by the Government has to go through, no matter whether the debate upon it lasts for a week or a month. It is merely a matter of legislation by 'an internal coterie of select members called a Cabinet. They choose what the legislation shall be. The really deliberative assembly in these days is the Cabinet, and we are credibly informed, and tliere seems to be very good reason for believing,- that there is an inner Cabinet which practically determines what the legislation of the country shall be. Already in various little ways we have whittled away rights and privileges attaching to an assembly such as this is. We are supposed to exercise a very full and rigid oversight over the measures of Ministers, but I challenge any one to show how, under the proposed new standing order, it will be possible for honourable members who are not in the M in istry to express any freedom of opinion or have any opportunity for doing so. Criticism of Ministers and attacks on their administration do not all come from the Opposition. Only last year one of the most serious attacks npon the Government came from the M in isterial corner, and take the trouble to go through the records of this Parliament since it opened in June of last year, we see that there has been more lengthy criticism of the Government from the Ministerial side than has come from this side.",64
304,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,Why should there not be? There is freedom on this side the House.,65
305,Mr MAXWELL,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"This motion is at licence, and not liberty.",65
306,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"The only justifileges cation for such an interjection a claim that the liberties of honourable me nbers have been abused. I challenge the honourable member to show in the records of this Parliament where the liberties of honourable members have been abused during debate. If he looks through the - records', the honourable member will find that the use, not the abuse, of the liberties of the House have been very freely availed of by honourable members on his own side for the purpose of making - attacks on the Government.",65
307,Mr MAXWELL,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"I am not talking of honourable members on either side, but - there are lots of speeches that could usef u l l y be compressed into half the space.",65
308,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"The honourable member has had a forensic training that enables him to put his words in very beautiful, concise, and effective language. We have not all had his advantages; but, on'the whole, honourable members express themselves fair l y clearly, if at times they do so rather full y , which may be not their fault but rather their misfortune. In quantity or quality the speeches delivered in this Parliament compare very favourably with those which have been delivered in any other Parliament. I am quite certain that this, the seventh Parliament of the Commonwealth, does not compare unfavorably in this regard with Parliaments that have preceded it . In any case, even if there are a few honourable members who are a bit prolix, and inflict themselves on the House at every conceivable opportunity, is it suflicient reason for the whole of the House abandoning its privileges and destroying its deliberative powers and opportunities? I think not. Can one go into any assembly or representative body and not find one or two men who make themselves a nuisance and try to allocate to themselves all the privileges when we and opportunities for speech?  his poetry.",65
309,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"Mr Webster is an authority on monopoly so far as debate is concerned. I suppose that he and the honourable member who holds the distinguished position of Speaker in this of House have an enviable, or perhaps unenviable, record in that respect, because aimed both of them when in Opposition were the fiercest in the exercise of their p r i v i in respect to obstructing Governwould be ment business. There are people who believe that in a time of war Parliament is a nuisance. Honourable members will easily recollect that, in 1914, soon after thewar broke out, and when a general election was pending, it was suggested that the election should be abandoned or postponed, and that Parliament should be summoned in order to have a War Government formed for the purpose of carrying on the war on behalf of Australia. That suggestion was rejected, but a significant remark was made by Sir Willia m Irvine, who was then the Attorney-General of the Liberal Government which was in office at the time, that in time of war Parliament was a nuisance or an obstacle. There are some honourable members today who seem to hold the opinion that it is impertinence on the part of the Opposition, or on the part of honourable members on their own side, to criticise administration when there is a war in progress, and that the Government should be permitted to do what they like, and as they like.",65
310,Mr BOYD,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,That would be quite right if there was a perfect Government in office - ' >- that we had two or three exhibitions in,66
311,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"Of course, it would. If my friend and a few of his compatriots were there, things would be safe; but when we have men in office whose administration during the war has come in for most severe criticism and castigation, such as has been heard in regard to the Defence Department and the Navy Department, one cannot believe that Parliament is an inefficient or unnecessary institution. It has been argued in the House of Commons that during the war Parliament should be almost continuously in session, not for the purpose of obstructing or harassing the Government, but for the purpose of insuring that, as far as possible, the whole of the weight, influence, and ment ability of the Legislature shall be concentrated, exercised, and made availthat able for the important purpose of carrying on the war. Here there seems to be an idea that the less opportunity given to honourable members to ' delibersent ate on questions and discuss them, the better it is, and that the less often liament meets, and the longer the recesses are, the better it is, because Ministers are their programme. then at liberty to give closer attention to their office work. Parliament is superseded, and in fact considered unnecessary and a nuisance. If the proposal to shorten debates will accomplish any purpose, it can only be one of two things-eithe r the Government are desirous to get certain business through or they intend to get their little programme through as quickly as possible and adjourn Parliament, in order to have the longest possible recess.",66
312,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,How long did the previous Government have. Parliament sitting?,66
313,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,I have not gone into the figures.,66

315,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"Then the present Government are not doing very badly; but the fact remains that they are transacting no business. When they went to the country with their programme of legislation, and their promises of the wonderful things they were going to accomplish, the country had a righ t to expect that some business would be done when Parliament met. Is it not a fact this Parliament of the Government having no business to bring forward, in consequence of which the House has had to adjourn?",66
316,Mr BOYD,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,The same thing occurs at the beginning of every session in every Parliament.,66
317,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"They are not anxious to get business through - the House. Every Minister knows that if he is anxious to get business through, he has unlimited powers in that respect. The Government could go through their whole programme to-night if they so desired.",66
318,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"What will the new standing order enable the Governto deal with , if it is not business ?",66
319,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"My complaint is it is unnecessary unless the Government are determined to get through a patricularly heavy lot of business during the present sub-session. There is at preno indication of anything of the kind. The Standing Orders as they exist Parto-day will enable the Government to pass all the miserable legislation at present ou What axe their items of legislation- a Distillation Bill , Spirits Bill , Iron and Steel Bounty Bill , Beer Excise Bill, Amendments Incorporation Bill , Australian Soldiers' Eepatriation Appropriation Bill , and Supply, and Ways and Means.  of the business to be dealt with during the present sittings.  sures have yet to be dealt with. - Mr FINLAYSON - There _are no Bills on the notice-paper .other than those I have read.",66
320,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,The Government are keeping other business up their sleeves.,67
321,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"A r e they keeping it up their sleeves until they get the new standing order carried? If so, I was right in speaking of the proposal as a machine gun, and it is evidently loaded. The Government have no right to introduce new methods until they have proved the old ones to be worthless. They have not attempted to use the powers they possess under the existing Standing Orders, and until they do they have no right to demand new powers. Until the Standing Orders at present in operation are proved to be insufficient to enable the Government to get on with their business, they have no right to ask for increased powers. It is contended by the Government that, because the House of Commons has in operation what is known as the guillotine, we should follow its example in that respect. There is, however, no analogy between the House of Commons, with its 670 members, and this House,"" with its seventy-five members. Could there be any analogy, again' between the quality and the importance of the measures which the House of Commons has to consider and those with which we have to deal ?  talking men here.",67
322,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"We have not, and the House of Commons makes no such distinctions in its Standing Orders as the Government propose in this case. The House of Commons cannot even provide seating accommodation for all its members. A feature of the House of Commons debates, and particularly of the speeches of its leading members, is the remarkable ability displayed in dealing with a great mass of information in a very short space of time.  effects of this proposal on the debates in this House.",67
323,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"Then the honourable member will suffer very sorely. He will have to burn the midnight oil steadily in the preparation of his speeches. As I said during the debate on the motion providing for the censorship of Hansard, in this matter, as in all others, as the Government sow so they must reap. They are proposing a standing order that may or may not suit their immediate purpose. That remains to be seen, but it cannot be worse in its effect on the Opposition than it will be upon the supporters of the Government. We cannot suffer under it more than they will , and to that extent, therefore, I am not particularly hurt by this proposition. I know, however that undoubtedly, as time goes on, a Government having such a power as this at its disposal, and determined to push on with its business, will h it the very men who today are advocating and are going to vote for this motion. Honourable members qpposite will not always be in power  will be to the advantage of the Opposition, because if we go out they will come in.'",67
324,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"The honourable member must recognise that what I consider when sitting in Opposition to be wrong must be equally wrong when I am on the other side. If I think a proposal is right I support it , but if I believe it to be wrong I oppose it , no matter where I may be sitting. I view this proposition as being altogether wrong. I would remind the Acting Minister for the  vernment of which I was a supporter in 1.912 brought forward a motion for the limitation of debate I opposed it , and have opposed its application ever since. I am jealous of the privileges which I have as a member of this Parliament. They make no difference to me personally, but I am here to express on behalf of those who sent me here the views I most fondly and truly believe in . And so I oppose this proposed standing order, because it will interfere, not only with my privileges, but with the privileges of honourable members opposite. When the time comes for them to feel the crushing effect of such a standing order, they will realise too late that they themselves forged a weapon that has entered their own political souls.  ber familiar with-the words of BurnsThe fear o' hell's a hangman's whip To haud the wretch in order. This is intended more as a preventive measure than for anv other purpose.",67
325,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"I am always amused when I hear honourable members opposite saying that they are out for prevention rather than for .cure. seem to invent diseases in order to secure an opportunity to promulgate preventive measures. The honourable member's words bring to my mind something that the Defence Department is doing for the soldiers on the other side, but which I cannot discuss at this stage. If the Department gave its attention to the curing of the disease instead of to the application of preventives, it would be to the advantage 6f the soldiers as well as to the country. The time is coming when something must be said in this House concerning that matter. As the Acting Minister for the Navy has stated, this proposition is designed, not to cure, but to prevent something. The Government are always putting up their umbrellas to shield themselves from a shower of which there is no indication. Surely the Government, having regard to their present position, should be full y occupied i u dealing with the troubles which actually surround them on every side. Surely they have enough to do in dealing with"" such difficulties instead of looking for imaginary ones. Do they think the Opposition are going to run wild ?  vocabularies of men like the honourable member.",68
326,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"I am often painf u l l y conscious qf the fact that my vocabulary is so incomplete as to make me quite unable to express myself as I should like to do. I can, at all events, promise the honourable member that every proposal to curtail the right of honourable members to criticise the Government of the day will be opposed by me, no matter whether I sit on this side of the House or on the other. I am out to preserve for honourable members in their representative character the fullest and freest opportunity for the exercise of their liberties.  tend to support the new standing order proposed by the Government, aeainst which I have not heard from the Opposition one argument. The honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Finlayson) said that such a standing order would interfere with the liberties of honourable members, and seriously curtail their privileges. I would remind him that it will not be applied except with the approval of the House it self, so that, if it does curtail any liberties They enjoyed by honourable members,, that curtailment will be the direct result of action taken by themselves. This newer is not to be exercised by some outside authority. It is to be brought into operation by honourable members themselves, and only when the occasion demands it will the House apply the guillotine: The honourable member for Brisbane has urged that in stead of using the guillotine we should sit more frequently. It has been said that during the last 483 days this House has met on only eighty-six days. I have figures to show what took place in Parliament when a previous Administration , of which the honourable member for Y a r r a (Mr Tudor) was a prominent member, was in office. From the 12th November, 1915, to the 29tE November, 1916, covering a period of 382 days, the Labour Government then in power called upon Parliament to meet on only twenty days. In view of that fact, what sort of camouflage are the Opposition resorting to in talking as they have done concerning the present Government? At that time, they had not on their shoulders the responsibility that the Government and their supporters have today. Honourable members were not then called upon to engage in recruiting work and to travel - throughout the length and breadth of Australia in the effort to induce young fellows to realise their responsibilities. Honourable members generally had more time at their disposal, and yet the Labour party then in power required this House to meet on only twenty days out of 382.",68
327,Mr BRENNAN,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"Why does not the honourable member go to the war?  to be addressed to' me by a man who is under forty-five. I asked the Prime M in ister (Mr Hughes) to raise the age l i m it to fifty-five years, so that the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr Riley) and I might enlist. The honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Finlayson) has declared that there is no analogy between the House of Commons and this House, and has also asserted that leaders of thought in the Imperial Parliament display remarkable ability m condensing their speeches. That condensation must have been cultivated as the result of the introduction of the guillotine. Members on both sides of the House have spoken, not for the purpose of helping on a measure before the House, but for obstructive purposes; and, therefore, I think the proposal made by the Government is on the right lines. I am not here to waste my time. The first impression I received when I entered the House was that members were not serious; they did not occupy the time as business men would, and, in fact, did not seem to value time at all. I have sat here in this chamber all day and all night, listening to weary reiteration of argument; and that sort of thing is not to be tolerated. The arguments put forward by the Opposition against the proposal are the very arguments they used on the 25""th November, 1905, when the closure was introduced. There is practioally no difference between this proposal and the closure, except that the former is more effective and scientific. The closure "" gags "" individual speakers, but the motion simply limits the period of time in which a measure may be discussed; there is nothing invidious about it, seeing that it does not attack individual members. I can remember the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) being stopped by a motion that he be no longer heard. That motion was moved by the honourable  the honourable member for Melbourne was very much offended.",68
328,Mr FENTON,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"How did you vote on that motion?  but it is not a question of my feelings, of the feelings of the honourable member for Melbourne. I remember sitting night during the session of 1913-14, when' the Speaker had the majority in his pocket. Some honourable members of the Opposition had gone down town, and we on the Government side, finding we had a majority, had the question put. I order to get the question settled, we had to move the closure some thirty times, it. involving some sixty divisions, and occupying some three hours to do what the proposal now before us will make possible in as many minutes. Tn that session 1913-14 the Standing Orders were strained, the Opposition introducing amendment upon amendment in such a way that it was impossible to get legislation accomplished. As a matter of fact, obstruction was raised even on the motion for leave to introduce a Bill ; and we all remember how cleverly the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) held up the House on that occasion. The motion before us is an endeavour to put an end to all that sort of nonsense, and I am quite sure that in the future the electors will thank ""us for the innovation. What we require is more concentration in our speeches.",69
329,Mr BRENNAN,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"What would have happened if the honourable member had had to concentrate this speech into"" ten minutes? He would have bust!  able member that Lord Salisbury, when on one occasion he was asked by a constituent how long he would require to prepare a speech, replied that if he were asked to speak for four hours he would require no preparation whatever, that if he were asked to speak for an hour he would require three hours to prepare, but that if he were asked to speak for three minutes he would require a week's notice. This illustrates what I mean when I say that we require more concentration of our thoughts, and ought to be able to say in ten minutes what now apparently takes us three or four hours. We have had very long speeches made in this House. One honourable member, who is not here now, has a record of eight or nine hours, and during the discussion on the "" gag"" proposals it was stated that another member, that session, had made speeches which covered seventy-three but yards of space in Hansard.",69
330,Mr BRENNAN,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"You have the two reall cord men on your side.  will wonder how Parliament tolerated such nonsense. I congratulate the Government on the introduction of this motion, n and I verily believe that honourable members opposite are heartily in accord with",69
331,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"Wentworth) [9.53] - In any question affecting the liberties of this Chamber, an - honourable member should of try to take a view beyond the immediate necessities of the moment, and I propose to address myself to this proposition entirely from that point of view. I do not find that this proposal is one intended to meet any exceptional circumstances arising out of the war; on the other hand, it is the intention to create an entirely new standing order revolutionizing the methods and procedure of the House for all time. I , therefore, ask myself, not as a memher sitting on this side of the House, but as one who has had the honour to ait in Parliament for a considerable time, what is my duty, not to this Government which happens to be in power, but to this House and the Commonwealth of Australia. I feel that honourable members on the Treasury bench have taken on their shoulders a very heavy responsibility in >' submitting this motion. It is, I see, roughly copied from a standing order of the House of Commons, where a great number of people can enter, and, if they see fit, obstruct the whole national business in such a way as to make it to conduct the affairs of the country. I find that the answer to what might be done is not proved by what haa been done. At one time. I was in a Government which did undoubtedly suffer from the most organized opposition that I think had been experienced by any Government in almost any country in the world, but eveu then, under the exceptional circumstances in which we were placed, we were not absolutely held up so much by the Opposition as by the situation in which the constituencies had placed us of being practically without a majority in this Chamber. Let us consider this proposal altogether apart from party, and look at it as reasonable men, who know Parliament and parliamentary procedure, must look nt it if they wish to do their duty the House.",69
332,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,The motion has been brought forward as a party measure. The House has not been consulted.,70
333,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"The House ^ is being consulted now; and, as an unimportant unit of the House, I am stating my own views in regard to it. The feeling I have is that a Government might possibly seek to stifle debate upon some question vitally affecting the existence of the Ministerial party at an immediately ensuing election. I am on the Ministerial side of the House at the present moment; but at any time parties may change sides, and I think that honourable members on this side may claim that they have most to lose if honest and legitimate debate be stifled. The value of debate in this House has often .been demonstrated. I have sat on the Opposition side and seen measure after measure introduced by an overwhelming party on the Government side, and modified, not by the force of votes or the brute strength of a division, but by 3heer force of argument, put again and again - I have seen measures improved over and over again by sheer reason from the party opposed to the Government which submitted them; and I do feel that it is not in the public interest if any party that happens to be placed temporarily in charge of the government of the country is. able, by a resolution of the kind suggested, to escape the responsibility now resting upon members under the Standing Orders of closuring directly impossible obstruction in this chamber. The difference between the existing standing order and that proposed is this: When obstruction takes place now, the man who moves under the existing standing order has to take the responsibility of his action. Under the proposed standing order, debate may be stifled before obstruction of any kind has been produced, perhaps stifling, not obstruction, but argument and light.  applied, it is applied to all.",70
334,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"There are several forms of the "" gag."" One form is to closure the individual member; another form is to closure a motion. When. motions for closure are moved, the country can deto cide on the debate that has taken place, whether that debate be useful or not. Under the proposal now before the House the Government may submit a motion and say, before the case is put, that the matter is urgent, and must be taken to the vote in one minute. In such circumstances, what chance would the country have of 'knowing what was behind the motion ?  that the Government would allow one minute for a debate?",70
335,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"I recollect occasions in this House when, I believe, an angry Minister would have behaved exactly a3 I have suggested, and I believe that other honourable members recollect similar incidents.",71
336,Mr COHSEK,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,Because the Minister lost his temper?,71
337,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,Because he lost his temper is one reason why Government supporters before an election would do almost anything rather than submit the Government to a humiliation.  ber is begging the question.,71
338,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,I am stating the case as honestly as I can. ,71
339,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"I accept the Minister's challenge, and 1 will take s'mply as an illustration of what this motion may mean the Bill that was submitted by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) today. In that measure a man's obligations for a particular purpose are assessed, not by his ability to meet them, but by the amount of the income tax he pays, Ministers having apparently overlooked the fact that the curves governing that tax rise at a particularly steep rate when an income gets beyond certain figures. The Bill introduced today requires a man to pay yearly as a war loan when he gets beyond an income of £5,000, a great deal more than he is receiving.",71
340,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS, Order ! The honourable member may not debate that Bill .,71
341,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"I referred to it simply as an illustration. It would be most deplorable if the Government, ' in order to cover up the foolish framing of a measure of that kind, and hoping to undo the harm by administration, were to say, ' ' This is an urgent measure required for the purpose of a loan, and we will put it through without debate."" A similar argument can be applied to almost any proposal that comes before the House. The honourable, member for Calare  ment must get their business through. Obviously, the Government should get their business through, but the country does not anticipate or expect that the Government shall get their business through :> Order. 6749 without debate. I am speaking now as a man who knows no party in auch a matter as this. . Mr CORSER - The Government have not suggested that they should get their business through without debate.",71
342,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,The whole standing order suggests that.  body knows that better than does the honourable member.,71
343,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"I deeply resent the attitude of the Acting Minister for the Navy, and I ask you, Mr Deputy President, to call upon the honourable gentleman to immediately withdraw the suggestion that I am acting dishonestly in stating my views to the House.  than the honourable member that what he has mentioned is not likely to occur.",71
344,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"I know that what I am saying is literally and absolutely correct, and the honourable member has no right to insult me because I take that view.",71
345,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"If the Acting Minister for the Navy (Mr . . Poynton) has made any offensive reference to the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Kelly), I ask him to withdraw it . I also ask honourable members to cease interjecting. There were so many interjections that it was impossible for me to hear what was said.  put in my mouth that I did not use. I did not say what the honourable member for Wentworth has alleged.",71

347,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"It could be put through in half a minute,- or in - any length of time that the Minister might chose to propose.  only by the vote of the House. .The honourable member is begging the question.",71
348,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"I am not aware that the insinuation that an honourable member is begging the - question is any more in order from the Ministerial bench than from any other part of the House. I am looking at the question fairly and squarely, and if honourable members do not like my view I hope they will pay me the same courtesy as I pay them when I differ from their statements. If honourable members will only realise that their possession of this side or that side is only they will look at the liberties of the House in a broader sense than I think some members are prepared to look at them today. When this proposal was first brought to my notice I did suggest that it might be possible to make it a war measure. In times of war there is an occasional urgency of business which does not exist at other times'. that my suggestion has not been adopted; and as the Government are proposingan alteration of the liberties of the House for a ll time, I find myself in the unfortunate position of not being able to support this Ministerial proposal.",71

350,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,No ; I suggested it before the motion was introducedi n the Bjouse.,72
351,Mr GREGORY,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,Why not amendment to that effect now?,72
352,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"It would relieve the position very much, and I shall adopt the honourable member's suggestion before I resume my seat. I remind honourable members that there is one feature of the business of this House which is, I think, peculiar to it , and it is that our legislation as a whole is put through with greater rapidity, judging by results, than is that of most other legislative Chambers. "" Honourable members are aware that we have passed measures, and have immediately been asked to consider new' measures to amend them. We have had a measure submitted here to amend another practically before the in k with which the Governor General signed his assent to the first measure was dry.",72

354,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"M a n y examples of the kind might be quoted. If we compare the way in which legislation is brought on here with the way in which legislation is dealt with in the House of Commons, where this procedure obtains, we shall find that in the practice of the House of Commons there are safeguards to secure the perfection of measures submitted to Parliament which do not exist here. There a Bill is submitted to a Committee of specially chosen persons from both sides before, it is considered by the House. The Committee carefully observes every temporary, phase of the proposed legislation before it is considered by the Parliament at all.",72
355,Mr GREGORY,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,We should submit every important Bill to a similar Committee.,72
356,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"I honestly think that to do so would be in the interests of the business of. this House.

If the Acting Prime Minister will accept the amendment - I have suggested I shall strain a point and support this proposal, but I really cannot support the motion as one to alter the Standing Orders of this House, in the way proposed, for all time. I am prepared to move the insertion of the words "" for the duration of the war "" after the word "" adopted.""",72

367,Mr BEENNAN,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"Batman) [10.15] - I do not propose to signify even partial proval of this proposal hy supporting the amendment. But, even at the risk of doing the honourable member for Wentwhen worth (Mr K e l l y ) irreparable damage his. constituency, I should like to conregulations gratulate him upon the wisdom he has evidenced in his speech. It came happily after the observations of the  I propose to put myself once, labouring as I do under the painf ul apprehension that the motion will ultiwith mately be carried, and that I shall have, upon certain fixed occasions in the future, to concentrate my utterances within the heretofore unheard of narrow limits of ten minutes. The honourable member for Calare consoles himself by the reflection that when this motion has been carried by a majority it will be something that has been imposed by the House itself, and, therefore, should be entirely satisfying every member of it . That will afford very little consolation to members of the minority party and those who have and, spoken and voted against the proposal. It will afford very little to the electors outside, whose spokesmen are not to be given an opportunity to give expression to their views in this House, as they ought to be. The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Kelly) observes-althoug h it must be a very painful reflection to him, pered, perhaps, by the fact that he is now in office-that he may some day with his party, in Opposition. The truth about this proposal, about that which ceded it for the censorship of honourable members' speeches, and about the policy of legislation by regulation, is that Government are perfectly secure in their knowledge that no Labour Government will ever put a policy of this kind into operation after they reach the Treasury benches. A Labour Government will never do this, either as a deliberate pression of their opinions, or as an act of reprisal against the party who insist passing legislation of this kind. The party opposite cut our speeches down by the process of censorship. We do not propose to do that. They would cut our rights papers, or motions for adjournment. down by the proposed new standing order, which, in addition to the gag which they have exercised so freely, will pTacticallv stultify this House altogether. Not tent with this, they call the Parliament aptogether for only a few days in the year. They are more busy with their legislation when this Parliament is not sitting than it is, and they have cumbered our ' in Library shelves with statutory rules and which they have never given this House an opportunity to consider. very Now, apparently,. we may not even conhonsider the measures which are brought before the House itself. We may not in training at even discuss them. I do not propose to repeat, in connection this proposal, observations equally applicable to the motion to censor the speeches of honourable members. A Labour Government will never do this, and therefore it becomes and remains a purely party practice and policy adopted by the other side. It is designed, not to prevent honourable-members opposite from expressing their views, but to prevent criticism of themselves and their policy. I recognise to that the motion is bound to be carried. But I shall not support it , either for the "" period of the war, or for any other period; consequently, I cannot vote for the amendment of the honourable member for consolation, also, Wentworth.",73
368,Mr LECKIE,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"Indi ) [10.19] - I find myself in a difficulty in regard to this proposal. I have asked myself whether any real necessity exists for it . I am bound to admit that there are occasions upon which a good deal of time is wasted in temthis Chamber-occasion s when we could not wish that there were some method of cutbe, ting short the utterances of garrulous members. But we have to recollect that preany time which may be wasted in this House is the time of honourable members and not of the country. No matter how the many, or how few, days we sit, the cost to the country is the same. It is really, therefore, the convenience of honourable members which is involved. My own experience, both of this Parliament and of exother Parliaments, is that the waste of time which occurs does not take place upon when Bills are under consideration. It occurs in discussing either the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply, or motions for the printing of certain I repeat that suflicient time is not devoted to the consideration of Bills, which have frequently to be rushed through the conHouse by means of all-night sittings. Only last year, we had an illustration of this when, as the result of an all-night sitting, we passed the War-time Profits Taxation - Act, which has probably damaged the industrial work of Australia more than has any other measure. If the Government will consent to withdraw Bills from the operation of the proposed guillotine, I am prepared to support them. The motion, if adopted, will not prevent garrulous members from talking at inordinate length; but it will prevent modest members, who do not often address the Chamber, from speaking at all. I know it is your practice, sir, to call upon honourable members alternately from either side of the House. That practice operates unfairly, because this side of the House has 53 members to 22. Assuming that this motion be carried, what will happen? Some honourable members will address the House at great length, and then, if two honourable members upon the same side of the chamber rise simultaneously, you, sir, will call upon the senior representative.' The result will be that new. members, like myself, will be entirely debarred from addressing themselves to some measures. I cannot see the necessity for this proposal, although I would welcome a measure to curtail the length of honourable members' speeches. When we recollect that, during the present Parliament, we have only sat some sixty or seventy days, it will be manifest that we cannot be accused of having inordinately, held up the business of the country. At the same time, I cannot support the amendment of the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Kelly). I believe that the proposal of the Government is a bad one, whether it be applied to war time or to any other time. During the past two years, I have not seen any urgent Government measure prevented from passing this Chamber. As a matter of fact, many Bills have been rushed through it hurriedly, with the result that they have subsequently had to be amended. I apprehend that the effect of the motion, if carried, will be to make the position of many, honourable members a very difficult one. There is no analogy, such as has been sought to be established, between the House of Commons and this Parliament. The House of Commons contains some Mr Leckie. 670 members, whereas this Chamber contains only seventy-five members. If the Government will consent to amend their proposal by restricting its application to motions, I will support it, but not otherwise.",73
369,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"Barrier) [10.23] I protest against the proposal, and I do not look with favour upon the amend.ment that has been submitted. While I congratulate the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Kelly) upon the manner in which he dealt with this motion, I believe that he overlooked the fact that the arguments which he adduced against it will apply with added weight to war-time legislation. He laid stress upon the value of criticism by honourable members of the Opposition in relation to many measures, which had thereby been improved. But if his arguments are sound, they will apply with even greater force to legislation enacted in war time, when honourable members, in common with the rest of the community, are not normal. Certain honourable members say that this motion should not be looked at from a party point of view; but seeing that the House has not been asked, through its Standing Orders Committee, to facilitate the progress of measures through this Chamber, we cannot very well look at it from any other view-point. Apparently, the Gdvernment have put their heads together, and have brought down this motion as part and parcel of the scheme foreshadowed by the censoring of Mansard. It is simply a scientific. suppression of Opposition criticism pure and simple.",74
370,Mr LYNCH,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,That is a jaundiced view.,74
371,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"No ; I think it is "" Lynch "" law as far as effective criticism is concerned. One honourable member, I - believe, said that no Labour Administration would use this measure if the tables were turned; but I think it is about time that the Labour party adopted the attitude inside this House, as well as outside it, not of turning the other cheek, but of giving as good as they get. If honourable members opposite, in the enjoyment of their temporary majority-(whic h at the next election might be turned into a minority-ar e going to utilize the power they possess to alter the machinery' of the House, and, so prevent legitimate criticisfn, and to advantage their own political party, then all I can say is that what is good for the goose.is good for the gander.",74
372,Mr JOWETT,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,Surely you would turn good for evil?,75
373,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"If ever we are"" in the happy position-and I have no doubt we will be one of these days-w e will, hope, adopt the same attitude that honNationalist party. orable members opposite take today. We will demand reparation and restitution. But, of course, honourable members have made up their minds, and-wit h the exception of a few who will come over aud vote with the minority; as .they usually do when they know that the Government have the numbers-wil l vote for this motion.",75
374,Mr MCWILMAMS,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,That is worthy of you.,75
375,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,The honourable member is generally in a minority.,75
376,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"The honourable memher for Wakefield (Mr Foster) may find himself in the minority ono of these days also. He and the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Archibald""i, in supporting the motion, gave the case away and exposed the fact that .it had been introduced as a political move.",75
377,Mr RICHABD FOOTER,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,iYo u are dreaming.,75
378,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"No , I am not. The' honourable member for Wakefield quoted the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) as one of the awful examples, rendering the censorship of Hansard necessary. He might have proceeded further, and named other honourable members.",75
379,Mr KICHAKD FOSTEB,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"I names of two others, and foT opposite reasons.",75
380,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,The honourable member for Wakefield has admitted the fact now. In the course of his remarks the honourable member for Hindmarsh poured the vials of his wrath upon the heads of members belonging to the party of which he was once an ornament.,75
381,Mr ABCHIBALD,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"It did revolutionaries, in those days.",75
382,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"It is not given to everybody to recognise' the position and to get out in time, as the honourable member did. 1 do not feel insulted at being called a revolutionary, for I am one of rethose who believe that revolutionary methods should, not be confined to one portion of the community at all. This motion itself is revolutionary, and, boiled down, is part and parcel of a scheme I hatched, no doubt, by the Caucus of the",75
383,Mr JOWETT,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,Do not say that.,75
384,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR LOAN SUBSCRIPTIONS,"I did not tliink the honourable memher for Grampian* would feel hurt about it , but I maintain that the motion has been devised with the intention of preventing the constituents of honourable members on this side of'the House from knowing what taking place here. One honourable member on this side said today that the press of this country was practically controlled by the party opposite. They have gone a step"" further in seeking to control Hansard, and now, as' the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Kelly) pointed out, they propose, by means of this guillotine motion, to allow a particular Minister to determine what length of .time shall .be given to the discussion of a measure. Therefore, much wil l depend ou whether he is in a good temper or otherwise, and how he feels generally. It has been suggested that I am not treating honourable members opposite fairly when I say one or two will vote with the minority because they know that the Government have the numbers; hut I believe that if honourable members treated this motion as a non-party measure it would not have half-adozen supporters on the Ministerial side of the House, because it cannot be justified by any logical reasoning. It is gave the merely intended to secure a party advantage at the expense of members on this side of the House. Therefore, while I oppose the motion, I Bay that, should it be carried, I hope that when the Lahour party is returned to power it will apply it to its opponents with the same courtesy as that shown by the present Government. Debate (on motion by Mr BX.AKBI.EY) not contain adjourned. House adjourned at 10.37 p.m.",75
